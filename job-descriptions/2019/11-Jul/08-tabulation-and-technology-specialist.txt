THANK YOU, NASSAU COUNTY ELECTION WORKERS!
Thank you to our incredible Nassau County Election Workers who diligently helped our office conduct a successful 2024 Election Cycle. We trained 428 Election Workers to serve Nassau County voters for this past Election Cycle.
In addition to Election Day and Early Voting duties, our Election Workers assisted with canvassing board activities, supervised voting, logistics, polling location setup/break down, technical support, voter registration drives, and monitoring secure ballot intake stations.
We are grateful for your dedication, commitment, and hard work to ensure we have safe, accurate, and secure elections in Nassau County.
Please take a moment to explore our website and contact our office to let us know how we can better serve you.
Please call us at 904-491-7500 or email us at [email protected].
We want to hear from you.
Janet H. Adkins, Nassau County Supervisor of Elections
