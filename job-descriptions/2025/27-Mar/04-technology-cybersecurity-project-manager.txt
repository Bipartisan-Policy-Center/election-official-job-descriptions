=== JOB DESCRIPTION ===




The Boulder County Clerk and Recorders department is seeking to hire a Technology and Cybersecurity Project Manager.  The Boulder County Clerk and Recorder’s Office provides Motor Vehicle, Recording, and Election services for Boulder County residents. The Technology and Cybersecurity Project Manager will support all divisions of the Clerk and Recorder’s office while owning technology objectives for the Elections Division. This position is a member of the Elections Leadership Team.
The Clerk and Recorder’s office is committed to continual improvement for cybersecurity and technology practices throughout all divisions and the ideal candidate will be committed to advancing the office’s development in these areas. The Elections Division provides comprehensive elections services for Boulder County, including voter records, voter services, ballot processing, technical and logistical support, and end-to end election administration.

The Elections Division is passionate about the work we do for democracy, and we are committed to facilitating the highest-quality elections in the country. We set a high bar for fulfilling our commitment to voters in Boulder County, and we are a national award-winning organization with a reputation for excellence, innovation, accuracy and continual improvement. Commitment to ensuring we include historically excluded communities in our culture and in the administration of elections is vital to fulfilling our mission of facilitating democracy. This person must be committed to building a culture where individuals from any background can be successful, which includes ongoing work around disrupting patterns, systems, and behaviors of inequity and exclusion.


This role integrates high-level strategic oversight with team management to ensure compliant voting system operations and an ingrained cybersecurity culture. This position will be accountable for the successful management of the voting system, creating and implementing security objectives, developing a team of up to 2 FTEs, and providing strategic technical oversight, guidance, and support to team members.

This position will work closely with their team to ensure voting system oversight – including procurement, maintenance, testing and validation, and ballot tabulation during the election. The ideal candidate has a track-record of creating an accountable and inclusive team culture while supporting themselves and the team through periods of high-scrutiny and pressure.
Additionally, the successful candidate will support the successful management, operations and support vote center setups. In this role, you will empower FTE staff in coordination with Vote Center Supervisors and IT to ensure that essential election hardware—including laptops, ballot printers, and network devices—is configured, tested, and maintained to meet regulatory standards. You will also oversee temporary election staff during setup and post-election recovery to ensure seamless, compliant operations.

This position will also work closely with the BCCR Technology Division Director, the office’s cybersecurity consultant, and Boulder County’s cybersecurity manager to ensure our security plan is updated and rooted in best practices from the ever-changing environment. The ideal candidate will be able to dive into the technical, legal, and administrative details while also having the skill of enrolling and training non-technical staff to comply with the plan.

This role will lead our comprehensive, multi-division cybersecurity program—continuously refining processes, adopting forward-thinking measures, and ensuring that policies reflect a people-first, equity-centered approach. This position will also plan and execute the multi-year cybersecurity strategy and supporting projects to maintain resilience and readiness across all digital operations.
Other important skills include strong problem-solving experience in a fast paced, changing, and deadline- driven environment, ability to present complex information and data in a user-friendly way; attention to detail in processes and systems as well as strong organization, planning, and collaborative skills in order to effectively integrate and balance outputs from multiple sources and formats that are created and managed by office staff. Knowledge of cybersecurity best practices is necessary, but we are willing to train and develop the right person with limited exposure who otherwise can be successful in all other areas of the job.

The ideal candidate will also have experience in setting up test plans and quality controls checks by using data to validate results. In addition to process and technical skills, candidate must also be able to lead temporary and permanent staff in alignment with the office’s values.

This is a full-time, benefited position. Regular hours are Monday - Thursday 7:00am - 5:30pm. Hours will vary during peak election operations.  This position will work a hybrid schedule, working at home and at 1750 33rd Street, Boulder, CO 80301.  Under Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) this position is exempt.
