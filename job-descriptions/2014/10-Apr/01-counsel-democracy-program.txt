Careers
Part think tank, part advocacy group, and part cutting-edge communications hub, the Brennan Center for Justice aims to hold public institutions accountable to core American values — democracy, justice, freedom, and equality. We work toward a more diverse and inclusive United States.
Core Values
Our internal culture hinges on four values. To uphold these values, we integrate them into our work and life at the Brennan Center.
Drive Visionary Goals through a Pragmatic Approach
We strive to reform our systems of democracy and justice by delivering clear-minded and independent analysis. We earn trust in our professional expertise through rigorous research and a focus on facts. Realizing durable change takes time, so we always keep in mind the long-term impact of our initiatives. We set achievable goals with tangible outcomes, and reach them through practical, solutions-driven methods.
Promote Openness & Accessibility
We produce our best outcomes by leveraging diverse experiences and perspectives. We foster an internal culture that is equitable and rooted in dignity and respect. Historically marginalized communities suffer most from the problems we seek to solve, and colleagues that reflect those communities enrich our work. We welcome all staff and external contributors at the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, age, ability, religion, and socioeconomic status. By exercising multidisciplinary thinking, we aim to generate ideas that are accessible and relevant to our teams and the broader multiethnic American public.
Nurture Growth & Excellence
We foster a spirit of curiosity and inquiry, adapting to new information, taking ambitious risks, and learning new skills that will develop us professionally and personally. We exercise creativity and innovation in alignment with our mission, constantly advancing both the organization and ourselves.
Cultivate Meaningful Teamwork & Collaboration
Collaboration and teamwork are essential to growing and sustaining our development. We strive to build trusting bonds through mutual accountability and communication that is inclusive and transparent. We reinforce these bonds with unwavering kindness, humility, flexibility, and empathy across all teams. We make decisions through a balance of thoughtful feedback, respectful candor, and careful consideration of all points of view.
Protect Our Democracy. Fight for Justice. Join Our Team.
The Brennan Center has a variety of opportunities available for those interested in joining the fight. Every position plays an important role in helping us achieve the organization’s mission.
We hire full- and part-time programmatic (Democracy, Justice, Liberty & National Security, Strategic Advocacy, and Fellows) and administrative (Communications, Democracy, Development, Events, Finance, IT, Operations, and Human Resources) staff.
We also hire legal and undergraduate interns for the fall and spring semesters and during the summer to work with our programs on policy advocacy, research, and litigation initiatives and to provide administrative and programmatic support to staff in our Communications, Democracy, Development, Events, Finance, Human Resources, Justice, Liberty & National Security, and Operations Departments.
In addition, we offer some opportunities, such as the Public Policy Advocacy Clinic, exclusively to NYU School of Law students. These students often earn credit for their work, can develop law review pieces and other papers on subjects growing out of the center’s activities, and are encouraged to apply for postgraduate fellowships at the Brennan Center.
We look forward to learning about the skills, perspective, and passion you could bring to our work.
