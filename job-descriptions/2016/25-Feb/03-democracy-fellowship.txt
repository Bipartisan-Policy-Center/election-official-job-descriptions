Fellowships
The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) annually awards two to four Democracy Studies Fellowships to bring outstanding graduate students to Washington, D.C., to engage in democracy development research. Based at IFES’s Center for Applied Research and Learning, fellows have access to IFES experts and conduct independent research with IFES mentors for six to ten weeks. At the end of the program, fellows must complete a paper for presentation to the public or IFES colleagues.
The William and Kathy Hybl Fellowship, funded by William Hybl, a former Chair and current member of IFES’s Board of Directors, and his wife Kathy, awards one grant to bring an outstanding U.S. or international graduate student from a university in the Rocky Mountain region to Washington to conduct research in democracy-building.
The Charles and Kathleen Manatt Fellowship, funded by the late U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic and former Chair of IFES's Board of Directors, Charles Manatt, and his wife Kathleen, awards a student from the American Midwest the opportunity to work with IFES experts and conduct research on democracy and governance.
