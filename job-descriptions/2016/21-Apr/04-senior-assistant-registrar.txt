We seek to build relationships with families and communities to ensure that every student succeeds. We will know every student!
We are the first public school division in Virginia, and among the first in the country, to develop and implement an Anti-Racism policy with the expressed purpose of building school communities that share the responsibility to recognize and end racism, eliminate inequitable practices that result in achievement gaps, and support the unique gifts, talents, and interests of every child. In ACPS, “all” really means all.
Who We’re Looking For
Teachers and Specialists are essential to achieving our goals of Thriving Students, Affirming and Empowering Communities, and Equitable, Transformative Resources.
Our ideal candidates are:
- Innovative, self-reflective, collaborative, knowledgeable in their content area and instructional practices, and are continually growing and improving
- Passionate about closing equity and achievement gaps
- Prepared to engage with our Culturally Responsive Teaching model in support of our Equity Mission Statement
Why Work in Our Schools
Here are just a few reasons why both new and experienced educators choose to join our team:
- Strong instructional support and mentoring from our building administrators, instructional coaches, learning technology integrators, diversity resource teachers, and equity specialists
- A wide range of professional development opportunities, including our New Teacher Academy and many other learning experiences held throughout the year for new and experienced teachers
- Competitive pay and benefits, including health & dental coverage, retirement, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, wellness program, discounts on gym memberships, and more

Location
Situated around beautiful Charlottesville, Virginia – which is consistently ranked among America’s top university towns and best places to live – Albemarle County is nestled in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah National Park. Just 100 miles south of Washington, DC and 70 miles west of Richmond, it’s only a short trip to the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic beaches, and New York is an easy Amtrak ride away. Whether it’s the great outdoors, a vibrant and diverse arts, food, and culture scene, or small town living with a big city feel, our part of Central Virginia has something for everyone.
