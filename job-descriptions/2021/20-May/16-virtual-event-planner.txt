The Elections & Voting Information Center (EVIC) is a non-partisan academic research center with our research leads co-located at Portland State University and Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Led by Founder and Director Paul Gronke, PhD, and Research Director Paul Manson, PhD, EVIC searches for common sense, non-partisan solutions to identified problems in election administration backed by solid empirical evidence. EVIC’s marquee project is the annual Local Election Official (LEO) Survey that the research team has been undertaking since 2018.
EVIC’s Current Projects
The EVIC Local Election Official Survey Project
FEBRUARY 6, 2025 UPDATE: We have released the 2024 EVIC LEO Survey report.
The Local Election Official (LEO) Survey project was initiated in 2018 by EVIC and has continued with 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023 studies. The 2024 survey is the sixth survey in this series.
The LEO Survey project amplifies local election officials’ voices in national, regional, and state conversations about election administration, and integrity. The EVIC team also conducts independent research into election administration, integrity, and democracy using these data and other information about election administration and those who staff the frontlines of democracy.
