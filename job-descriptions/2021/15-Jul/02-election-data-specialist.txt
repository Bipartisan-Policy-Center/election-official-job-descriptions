=== JOB DESCRIPTION ===


Boulder County Elections has an opening for an Elections Data Specialist position. Our team is committed to setting the state and nationwide gold standard for what an accurate, transparent, organized, and efficient election looks like, and this position is critical to our success in fulfilling that aim. Note: experience with elections is not required – we are looking for someone who has experience and a passion for data and will train the successful candidate on elections.  
 
The Elections Division is committed to continual improvement, and we are looking for a team member who can help strengthen our team and our work by overseeing mission-critical process areas that demonstrate accountability to the public while also assuring data integrity. The primary objectives of this position are to:


Develop, manage, and maintain database reporting and analytics tools that support the division in accurately, sustainably, and resiliently executing our voter registration and election administration duties
Develop and maintain data processing and management structures, procedures, and practices that ensure position duties and deliverables are accurate, efficient, secure, sustainable, and resilient
Work with others to create, provide, and maintain exports and reports that meet functional area needs
Work with others to define and develop self-service reporting solutions in alignment with organizational goals and values
As a member of the election team, this position will be expected to emulate behaviors that demonstrate a commitment to all Clerk and Recorder values, including and not limited to equity, inclusion, accountability, and integrity. Throughout the year, this position works closely with all division staff as well as other election partners; and the ability to form effective, collaborative, communicative working relationships with fellow teammates while under tight deadlines and requirements is a must. This is a crucial role on our 13-member team who must work closely with team members to demonstrate the integrity of our elections to the public while providing robust and inclusive service to the voters of Boulder County.
 
We strive to provide a work environment that supports employee well-being and growth, including remote work opportunities, a dog-friendly work environment, and a Monday-Thursday 40-hour schedule to provide team members with a 3-day weekend (exceptions apply during election time). Boulder County also offers robust training opportunities throughout the year for employees to grow their skillsets. We are looking for a team member who can demonstrate accountability and integrity with the variety of flexible work options provided.
 
To successfully fulfil key responsibilities, solid experience and independent ability is essential in the following areas:  

designing, building, and managing complex relational database reporting and analytics tools in a production environment (excluding database platform management such as patching and access control)

planning, assessing, prioritizing, and managing multiple concurrent and competing tasks
using and navigating Microsoft 365 tools (Outlook, OneNote, Word, PowerPoint)
Windows navigation and basic computer troubleshooting
The successful candidate is also self-sufficient, resourceful, and collaborative; effective at extracting and prioritizing user requirements and driven to provide effective solutions. They are well organized and methodical, and a champion of process standards and documentation.  Having an eye for detail pairs well with their creative, and agile problem-solving nature; while their ability to step back, up, and out helps them account for broader impacts in planning, assessing, and managing their time and priorities. The ideal candidate we seek to join our team enjoys digging through data and queries to root out discrepancies; pursues opportunities to help others improve processes and make informed decisions through reports and data; and is committed to the maintenance and development of systems and procedures that are empowering, sustainable, and resilient.
