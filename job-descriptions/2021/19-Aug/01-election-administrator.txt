SubscribeServant Leadership Conference + TLG 2026
Beginning in 2026, SGR’s Servant Leadership Conference will join with AFI’s Transforming Local Government Conference as one expanded, integrated event.
This intentional shift reflects our shared vision: leadership that both inspires innovation and builds strong, healthy cultures. By bringing the two conferences together, we’re creating an experience that equips leaders with the tools, relationships, and inspiration needed to shape the future of local government.
We’re excited to launch this new chapter at TLG 2026 in Dallas, April 20–22.
