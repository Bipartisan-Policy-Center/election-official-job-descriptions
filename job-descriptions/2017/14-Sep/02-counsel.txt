As Fair Elections Center grows and evolves under our new President and CEO Rebekah Caruthers, we continue to honor the work of our founder (and current president emeritus and senior advisor) Robert Brandon. This summer, we celebrated Bob’s impactful career with a reception in Washington, D.C., and in October we published a timeline of his remarkable achievements.
Over 50 years as a public interest lawyer, Bob achieved success on a variety of policy issues, including pharmaceutical regulation, tax reform, affordable energy, expanded healthcare access, environmental justice, college affordability, internet access, and—of course—voting rights.
