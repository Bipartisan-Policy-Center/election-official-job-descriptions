2025 Employee of the Year: Sarah Miller
Sarah Miller provides invaluable contributions to the Utah County Recorder’s Office through her consistent support of mappers and supervisors, as well as the Recorder's Office leadership. She is patient with team members while helping them to troubleshoot issues, responsive and thoughtful, and always remains calm while reassuring others that their mistakes can be learning opportunities, rather than placing blame or causing embarrassment. She takes initiative and is optimistic, positive, committed to delivering quality work and dedicated to her role in the Recorder's Office as a Quality Control Analyst.
Sarah is a great example to those she works with of the importance of paying attention to the details and understanding the big picture. She aptly takes on non-standard tasks and sees them as opportunities to be challenged and grow professionally. Other professionals outside our office have recognized her hard work ,which shows the depth of her contributions to the Recorder's Office. Her thoroughness sets a standard that we encourage other employees to replicate. She exemplifies a culture of encouragement and true leadership.
Sarah plays an integral part in the Recorder's Office meeting statutory deadlines. She effectively communicates with co-workers and supports others by sharing her extensive knowledge when collaborating and/or training. She models and promotes the values espoused by the County Recorder, Andrea Allen, who leads our office, and helps foster an uplifting, engaging and positive workplace morale.
Sarah consistently delivers outstanding results. She is organized, detail-oriented, and understands the processes within the Recorder's Office from start to finish. This allows her to maintain a "big picture" perspective that is critical when working in quality control. Her ability to motivate and her can-do attitude, as well as her commitment to providing outstanding customer service to our community makes her a revered employee.
Sarah is dedicated and reliable, and she doesn't complain! She just digs in to get the work done. She often has quite the backlog of work, considering she's the only Quality Control Analyst for Cadastral Mapping! She is prompt in her communication with industry professionals and co-workers and is ever mindful of the statutory timeframes our office is required to maintain. She challenges herself and consistently raises her own bar. She exceeds expectations in terms of the quality of her work and her dedication to her role as a Quality Control Analyst.
Sarah embodies the characteristics Utah County strives to have employees possess: she is smart, compassionate, loyal, ethical, committed, and innovative. I have no doubt she makes a difference in our community as an employee of the Recorder's Office. Sarah is adaptable, creative, honest, reliable, dedicated, independent, self-aware, a critical thinker, and an employee who brings the highest level of integrity to the Recorder's Office. She is aware of her core values and demonstrates them regularly. She has a passion for her work as a Quality Control Analyst that often inspires others. She is supportive, respectful, and committed to her own success, and to the success of her cadastral mapping team. She is resourceful, has well-honed interpersonal skills, and is a great listener.
