Updated April 11, 2022
About CVF:
The California Voter Foundation (CVF) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization working through research, oversight, outreach and demonstration projects to improve the election process so that it better serves the needs and interests of voters.
Since 1994, CVF has pioneered significant democratic reforms in California and beyond, such as requiring paper ballots and post-election audits to publicly verify election results. CVF innovated the Internet as a tool for voter education, and promotes online registration and voter lookup tools to assist and empower voters. One of CVF’s first major achievements was to shed “digital sunlight” on campaign finance data by requiring electronic filing and online disclosure; in recent years CVF has worked to identify and address the problem of ballot rejection in the vote-by-mail process.
A long-standing reputation, unwavering commitment to nonpartisanship, devotion to protecting and improving the voting process, and relationships with key institutions, government agencies, the news media and nonprofits enable CVF to be an effective and efficient catalyst for significant reform.
