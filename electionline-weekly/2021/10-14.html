														<p><b>Strengthening Democracy Through Cross-Sector Collaborations<br />
</b><i>A guide for building coalitions based on the Future of California Elections model</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7535" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM-300x288.png" alt="" width="193" height="185" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM-300x288.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM.png 678w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" />Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and large amounts of misinformation, voter turnout was high in the 2020 election. Over the last year, we have continued to see attacks on the integrity of our election process and an escalation of anti-democratic efforts to stifle the vote in many states. These efforts disproportionately affect BIPOC communities, young and senior voters, voters with disabilities, and justice-involved citizens. As we look forward to the 2022 and 2024 elections, a new cross-sector coalition is needed to protect our democratic values and ensure equitable election policies and practices that are responsive to communities long disenfranchised and disengaged from the voting process.</p>
<p>Between 2011 and 2020,<a href="https://futureofcaelections.org/"> Future of California Elections</a> (FoCE), a cross-sector coalition of bi-partisan election officials and nonprofit organizations, convened with the shared goal of modernizing elections and expanding participation for all eligible voters <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7533" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FOCE-300x117.png" alt="" width="300" height="117" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FOCE-300x117.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FOCE.png 318w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />in California. This is a noteworthy achievement—for many years, these groups often sat on the opposite sides. FoCE uniquely brought together an uncanny group of organizations and provided them a space to convene and work together. We see the benefit and success of this collaboration today, including the passage of the 2016 Voter Choice Act and expanding access to translated sample ballots, information, and other assistance for minority language communities.</p>
<p>A new Democracy Fund-commissioned <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/a-guide-for-building-cross-sector-collaborations-to-strengthen-democracy/">white paper</a> authored by Astrid Ochoa, former Executive Director of FoCE, highlights the success — and learnings — of the FoCE model and best practices for those interested in building cross-sector collaborative networks in other states. Beyond just finding more inclusive solutions to today’s election administration issues, a cross-sector <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7534" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DemocracyFund-300x123.png" alt="" width="300" height="123" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DemocracyFund-300x123.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DemocracyFund.png 618w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />network like this can help create a community of support between election officials and nonprofit organizations to better defend our democratic process against those who wish to usurp it. Additionally, this model can help election officials and voter advocates rebuild public trust and enhance participation in the democratic process by having a diverse group of election advocates and administrators at the table together to develop and advocate for inclusive elections policies and practices.</p>
<p>FoCE, the nonprofit, closed in 2020 and now operates as the Future of California Elections Network. This nonpartisan network continues to build on the<a href="https://futureofcaelections.org/search-results/"> work of its predecessor</a> to advance effective and inclusive election policies and practices. Much can be learned from the FoCE model that can be carried forward to other states looking to start their cross-sector networks, regardless of how different your state (or community) may be from California. Whether you are a State Election Director, the President of a State Association, or Executive Director of a civic action nonprofit, this report can help you develop a strong network of election administrators and voting advocates that can work together to create responsive and inclusive election policy.</p>
<p>Democracy Fund has partnered with Astrid to offer free consultation to election officials, election offices, or state associations interested in building better cross-sector collaborations with civic engagement groups in their community.

							<h2>2020 Elections Oral History Project</h2>
														<p><strong>The Guardians of Democracy</strong><br />
<em>New project from Stanford highlights issues from 2020 and a path forward</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7536" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.45.06-AM-300x96.png" alt="" width="300" height="96" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.45.06-AM-300x96.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.45.06-AM-1024x327.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.45.06-AM-768x245.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.45.06-AM-1536x490.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.45.06-AM-2048x653.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Stanford Internet Observatory Cyber Policy Center this week released an <a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/2020-elections-oral-history-project">oral history of the 2020 election</a>. The center interviewed federal state and local officials from around the country to capture their voice and experiences in 2020.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Center has released an election security policy paper that takes the experiences we heard and what Stanford non-resident Policy Fellow <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/matt-masterson">Matt Masterson</a> went through at CISA and lays out a roadmap for a path forward in this new environment.</p>
<p>The oral history and corresponding policy paper attempt to capture their experiences and offer a path forward for healing the election community and protecting our democracy. By telling the on-the-ground story of election officials in their own voices, we seek to tell the story of those guardians of democracy who administered and secured this election, and, as a result, were the targets of unprecedented, baseless, and heinous attacks.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7539" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-10.47.43-AM-240x300.png" alt="" width="162" height="203" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-10.47.43-AM-240x300.png 240w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-10.47.43-AM-819x1024.png 819w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-10.47.43-AM-768x961.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-10.47.43-AM.png 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" />The report outlines three exigent threats to the election process following the events of the 2020 general election. It also provides 11 targeted recommendations to best address these threats in preparation for the 2022 midterm elections and beyond. The report reflects months of interviews with election officials from around the country and across the political spectrum. While many threats to the election process exist, three stand out as especially concerning for the 2022 election and beyond.</p>
<ol>
<li>Election officials’ capacity to do their jobs is degraded by physical threats and broad districts fomented by bad-faith actors;</li>
<li>The playbook for undermining confidence in election results is well-defined and available for foreigh and domestic influence agents; and</li>
<li>Inconsistent funding and lack of governance structures around elections IT continue to perpetuate vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>In light of the aforementioned threats, and others yet to come, the report proposes a set of concrete and actionable recommendations to shore up election security and ensure election confidence. Each recommendation will require coordination by relevant stakeholders at the local, state and federal level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund elections consistently at the state, local and federal level;</li>
<li>Prepare state and local election officials to respond to mis-and disinformation in future elections;</li>
<li>Educate the public about the trusted role of election officials;</li>
<li>Encourage states to implement paper-based pre-certification audits;</li>
<li>Reform the U.S. Election Assistance Commission;</li>
<li>Mandate reporting of election cyber incidents to CISA and the FBI;</li>
<li>Establish minimum cybersecurity baselines for state and local election offices and election vendors;</li>
<li>Centralize election IT infrastructure at the state level; and</li>
<li>Support good-faith security research and vulnerability assessments.</li>

Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin recently took a four day tour of 11 storm-damaged parishes and found 34 of Terrebonne Parish’s 77 precincts would have to be moved, nine of St. Charles’ 41 precincts, 28 of Jefferson’s 273 precincts, several in St. Helena Parish and every one of Lafourche’s “down the bayou” 10th Ward voting locations had been destroyed or damaged. Each precinct averages 815 registered voters. That’s more than 100,000 voters impacted, about a third of those registered, and the count is still rising. More precincts in Orleans, Tangipahoa and St. John the Baptist parishes will be moved once the local governing authorities, later this week, pass the necessary ordinances to do so. Only Livingston Parish’s traditional polling places survived enough to be usable. “Logistics have been the most difficult part,” Ardoin said. The Secretary of State’s Office has three mobile voting stations that operate off generators. Lafourche is getting one and another is going to heavily damaged St. John the Baptist Parish on the Mississippi River, Ardoin said, adding that the third will be placed soon. “Our main concern is communications,” said Ashley Shelton, president of the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, a New Orleans-based community involvement group that emphasizes voting statewide. The nonprofit is pitching in by reaching out to voters with the latest news, particularly at the hot meal stations set up in the storm zone. Ardoin’s task force is talking to the U.S. Postal Service continuously, making sure local mail carriers are aware of absentee ballots. If voters aren’t receiving mail at home, they’re being instructed to go to the post office. His office is erecting large metal signs throughout the effected parishes with 1-800 numbers to get information, printing posters, handing out fliers, and will start advertising on local radio this week. “We’re trying to cover all our bases,” Ardoin said.</p>

While Otero-Warren and others ensured Hispanic women gained the right to vote in New Mexico in 1920, along with Anglos, it would be years before Native American women and those of other ethnicities also could cast a ballot.</p>

Meade announced the restoration of his voting rights via Twitter. “Wow. Wow,” he said. “Another chapter in the journey. Another, I guess, example of perseverance.” According to the Tampay Bay Times, His rights were restored under a new state clemency process approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet in March. The changes automatically restored the right to hold office and serve on a jury for Floridians with felony convictions who have completed their sentence and paid off their court debts. Meade and the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition he leads had advocated for the changes, which included removing a minimum five-year waiting period for those with felony convictions to apply to have their rights restored.

Anthony Sabatini (R-Lake County) has filed a bill ahead of the 2022 legislative session calling for the governor to “<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-republican-files-bill-to-conduct-forensic-audit-of-2020-election-results/">appoint an independent third party to conduct a forensic audit</a> of the general election that took place on November 3, 2020.” The investigation would happen in each county with a population of 250,000 or more, which would be 24 out of Florida’s 67 counties, according to the state’s 2020 population estimates. The Lake County Republican Party signed a resolution calling for an audit of the 2020 results even though former President Donald Trump won the state by more than 3%, a veritable landslide in a state known for close elections.</p>

James Moylan, would<a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/gec-bill-wont-cancel-primary-elections-for-1-political-party/article_89b537c0-2a79-11ec-8b4a-733b24015de5.html"> amend a number of local election laws</a>, including provisions affecting the names candidates use in official documents, electioneering limits at polling sites, and a timeframe to hold a special election in the event of a vacancy for Washington delegate. The first proposal is how best to cancel certain primary elections. In order to make Bill 173&#8217;s parameters &#8220;abundantly clear,&#8221; Elizabeth Santos, acting director of the Guam election commission, requested senators amend the bill to read: &#8220;In any given election year, the Guam Election Commission shall cancel the primary election if equal to or fewer than the maximum number of candidates can advance to the general election for any partisan elected office.&#8221; The provision as offered would only cancel elections for individual offices, and only in their entirety – not for just one political party, Elizabeth Santos repeatedly assured lawmakers. The legislation also allows the GEC to no longer keep track of exactly who was supported through write-in votes. To help comply with federal overseas voting laws, the GEC is also supportive of Bill 174, which would push up the dates of the primary election, in addition to the deadlines for candidates to file packets and residents to register as voters. The Legislation proposes to push up the initial vote of an election year to the first, rather than the last, Saturday in August. If adopted, campaigns will need to file official paperwork to appear on a ballot a month earlier than current law allows. The measure also requires voters to register for an election 21 days before it is held, instead of the current 10-day window.</p>

That bill would enact a strict ID requirement for in-person voters and a brand new one for absentee voters, as well as prohibit election officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications and accepting private donations. Republicans also rejected a Democratic amendment to appropriate funding for the bill to provide free IDs that passed on a party-line vote, with every Republican backing the measure. It now heads to the House. In addition to eliminating the ID fee, HB 5007 would require the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office to provide same-day service for those applying for a state ID card for the purpose of voting in an election, as well as those applying for an ID three days before Election Day, on Election Day or six days after an election.</p>

The bill would also: Require risk-limiting audits; Provide for early voting; Give county election boards flexibility when establishing ballot return locations; Make the ‘permanent’ vote-by-mail list actually permanent; Create a system of curing for absentee and mail-in ballots; Create a public voter fraud hotline; Establish a voter bill of rights; and Seek to have the state reimburse counties for the costs of voting machines, ballot processing machines, and electronic record systems. “This is common sense, county-led, opportunities for us to strengthen our democracy,” said Centre County Commissioner Michael Pipe. “I think that county commissioners across Pennsylvania should look at this as a model for how we go into the future.”</p>

In August, Santa Clara County received six public records requests that sought Dominion’s financial statements. As part of an agreement between the county and Dominion, the county notified the company about the records request and that they intended to fulfill it. After Dominion raised concerns about the release of the documents, the county directed them to make their case in court rather than the county making the determination. In their suit seeking to block the records from release, attorneys for Dominion argue that the company’s interest in preventing their release “outweighs” the public’s interest in receiving them. They also state that “across the nation,” individuals who are “fueled” by “false claims” that the company rigged the 2020 election have filed public records requests seeking information that intends to harm Dominion. In addition, attorneys for Dominion contend that it is in Santa Clara County’s own interest to not release the financial documents. If the documents were to be released, they argue, future vendors may be “reluctant” to work with the county.</p>

Robison has ruled that Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/10/13/tina-peters-mesa-county-elections-griswold/"> cannot be involved in the administration of her county’s November election</a>. Robison sided with the Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who in late August filed a lawsuit seeking to block Peters and Deputy Clerk and Recorder Belinda Knisley from handling the next election. That lawsuit “met the burden of showing that Peters and Knisley have committed a breach and neglect of duty and other wrongful acts. As such, Peters and Knisley are unable or unwilling to appropriately perform the duties of the Mesa County Designated Election Official,” the judge wrote in a 22-page ruling. This means that former Republican Secretary of State Wayne Williams will oversee Mesa County elections this year. He was appointed by the Mesa County commissioners, under a temporary agreement that pays him $180 an hour. The commissioners supported Griswold’s suit. Wrote Robison, “Peters failed to follow the rules and orders of the Secretary by facilitating and allowing a non-employee … without a disclosed background check to have access to a secured area via a Mesa County access card. Knisley aided Peters in her wrongful acts by requesting that the cameras be disabled. In doing so, Knisley ensured that the wrongful behavior of Peters could not be viewed.”</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the One America News Network and Donald J. Trump for President Inc. asked  Denver Judge Marie Avery Moses to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/denver-judge-considers-trumps-anti-slapp-defense-against-dominion-directors-defamation-suit/"> dismiss defamation claims</a> filed by a voting machine employee they falsely accused of rigging the 2020 election. Following the 2020 election, podcaster Joseph Oltmann claimed he heard a man on a call identified as “Eric from Dominion” say he was going to make sure Trump lost. Through internet research, Oltmann said he concluded this referred to Eric Coomer, a director of product strategy and security at Dominion Voting Systems. The spark caught and spread like wildfire, as it was picked up by the OAN, and repeated by the Trump campaign and attorneys Rudi Giuliani and Sydney Powell. In his 2020 lawsuit, Coomer identified 16 individuals and companies that collectively made him the villain in the narrative of unbased claims of election fraud. Threats and harassment drove Coomer into hiding. Moses did not indicate when or how she will decide the motions in question, but issued decorum and civilities orders before the hearings started.</p>

The Florida Conference of the NAACP, Disability Rights Florida, the League of Women Voters of Florida, UnidosUS and a number of other organizations allege that the changes approved by the Legislature this spring could curtail voting by Black, Latino and disabled residents. The lawsuits focus on several parts of the law that deal with voting by mail, as well as a requirement that third-party voter registration groups provide a disclaimer to people signing up to vote. The lawsuits contend that the restrictions will have a negative impact on people who work during the day and voters with disabilities, who might be forced to bring ballots into early voting sites if supervisors don’t provide drop boxes outside. Walker said Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Attorney General Ashley Moody and supervisors of elections should remain as defendants in the cases, though he dismissed the officials from some parts of the challenges. Lee argued that the case should be dismissed because the vote-by-mail restrictions do not place undue burdens on the right to vote and that the plaintiffs’ claims fail because they focus on burdens placed on “vulnerable” voters instead of on the electorate as a whole. “She is wrong on both points,” Walker wrote in a 62-page order. “In sum, defendant Lee’s arguments that restrictions on mail-in ballots do not implicate the right to vote is unsound and unsupported by precedent.”</p>

Amero’s ruling ended the last remaining major lawsuit over Georgia’s 2020 election and prevented an outside review of Fulton County’s 147,000 original absentee ballots. Though Amero’s decision was based on the legal principle of standing — the plaintiffs hadn’t suffered a specific injury that would give them a right to sue — he reviewed the evidence before making his ruling. There was no indication of “pristine” ballots with perfectly filled-in ovals and no creases, as alleged in the lawsuit. All ballots in those batches appeared to be authentic. “While no election is perfect, there was no widespread fraud or illegal voting large enough to overturn the election,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. “The results were, as we reported, that President Trump came up short in the state of Georgia.”</p>

The case, brought by Davis Hammet and the ACLU of Kansas, director of the civic engagement group Loud Light, argued Schwab’s move to ask the contractor managing the state’s voter registration database to dump a feature creating the report was a bid to circumvent the state’s open records laws. Watson ruled there was nothing compelling Schwab’s office from maintaining the ability to create the report, only that they must make the report available for inspection if the document exists. Under the Kansas Open Records Act, an entity can&#8217;t be required to create a record which doesn&#8217;t otherwise exist While Watson wrote Hammet “understandably” raises concerns about why Schwab’s office eliminated the ability to produce the report, she said that had no bearing on the lawsuit’s success. “There is no statute within or apart from KORA that requires the Secretary of State to create a statewide provisional ballot detail report either by hand or electronically,” Watson’s ruling said. “There is no statute that dictates how the Secretary of State must program the databases it uses to store information.</p>

The plaintiffs argue the law is suppressing the vote of young people who typically favor Democratic candidates.  The law prohibits political committees including student organizations from conducting voter registration drives and other political activities inside certain high-traffic public university spaces including residence halls, dining facilities and athletic facilities.  The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missoula argues that the law contained in Senate Bill 319 “imposes arbitrary, vague, and onerous restrictions on the rights of college students” to participate fully in the political process. According to the lawsuit, Montanans for Tester along with the Montana Democratic Party registered over 3,000 new voters on college campuses by focusing on high traffic areas such as dorms and dining halls prior to the 2018 election. The lawsuit names Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, a Republican, and Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff Mangan as defendants in the lawsuit, and asks the court to ban them from enforcing the law.</p>

The DNC and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party filed the motion to intervene, arguing that the mail voting law is valid and constitutional. They are intervening in part because the lawsuit has been expedited by the court, and is expected to move rapidly through the legal process this fall, an attorney representing the DNC said.</p>

Herring has steadfastly declined to weigh in despite receiving a formal request for an opinion five months ago from Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas. “Maybe the attorney general wants to opine — he may want to,” said Novak during a hearing, suggesting that some clear legal direction from Herring might resolve the need for the lawsuit. “I want him to do his job, but I’m not ordering it.” After Novak proposed a three-day deadline for additional filings, the attorney general’s office protested, calling the timing unreasonable. Novak snapped back: “I wouldn’t be in this position if you had done your job the first time.”</p>

They want all the cases tossed out. “This lawsuit is entirely unfounded and appears to be little more than a coordinated political attack on the integrity of Washington elections,” lawyers for the Democrats wrote in a motion filed in the Snohomish County case. “Plaintiffs stand before the Court with nothing but speculation, fueled by conspiracy theories, asking for breathtaking and entirely unwarranted ‘relief.’” The original lawsuits allege that auditors used uncertified voting equipment and manipulated thousands of ballots in an unspecified statewide race. Each lawsuit seeks a “full forensic audit” conducted in the same manner as one carried out in<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona"> Arizona</a> which found no evidence of fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones notified the election integrity coalition that it cannot appear pro se and must get counsel by Nov. 1. Borrelli, in an email, said the group wants those cases — and any others that land in federal court — remanded to Superior Court.</p>
<p>Franklin County Judge Sam Swanberg is allowing Franklin County  another chance to argue that Latinos are being fairly represented in county commissioner elections. Swanberg allowed the county to<a href="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article254936262.html"> cancel an agreement that required the county to come up with new district maps</a> and change to district-only elections. His decision resets the case to where it was a little more than a month ago, and sets the county and the League of United Latin American Citizens up for a trial. Swanberg suggested that should happen before the end of the year. The judge pointed out that he wasn’t making any decision about whether the county was violating the Washington Voting Rights Act. He also found merit to the argument that the county sat on its hands and was not working to defend itself. In the end, Swanberg agreed that the decision in the lawsuit affects everyone in the county, and was concerned that it appeared that the elected officials didn’t agree with the decision. “I think it’s in the best interest that the public at large (for the case) to be heard on the merits,” he said. “I think it provides a greater assurance to the community.” Swanberg said they should expedite the case, since it should have been decided on Sept. 13 as part of the court hearing where the two sides entered into the agreement.</p>

In a prepared statement, Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, lauded the court&#8217;s action.  &#8220;Wisconsin has a right to know how this taxpayer-funded investigation is being orchestrated,&#8221; Evers said.  Vos could appeal the decision. According to Wisconsin Public Radio, his office didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/creating-a-tech-equity-agenda-to-advance-american-democracy/">Creating a tech equity agenda to advance American democracy</a>, a conversation with Alondra Nelson, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: The modern world is shaped by technological innovation, from the exploratory potential of spacecraft to the promise of artificial intelligence systems. These and other emerging technologies are improving how we live our lives and modernize government operations and can create efficiencies that lend themselves to better public institutions and more participatory democracy. But these same technologies can create intended and unintended consequences for democratic processes and risks to citizens, who deserve a new digital ecosystem that advances well-being and prosperity. What’s more, what are the consumer and worker protections necessary for the equitable and fair deployment of emerging technologies and to mitigate racial bias and social inequities? How can we advance the nation’s aspiration for a more diverse science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce? What would responsible and rights-preserving science and technology systems look like in our criminal justice system? How can we protect free speech while also addressing the spread of misinformation and disinformation online? On October 21, the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings will host Alondra Nelson, deputy director for science and society at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, for a wide-ranging conversation with Senior Fellow Nicol Turner Lee on these and other topics. <strong>When:</strong> October 21. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
