														<p><strong>Associated Press review finds negligible amounts of 2020 voter fraud</strong><br />
<em>Review focused on 6 states, finds less than 500 instances</em></p>
<p>By Christina Cassidy<br />
The Associated Press</p>
<p>ATLANTA (AP) — An Associated Press review of every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by former President Donald Trump has found fewer than 475 — a number that would have made no difference in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and their 79 Electoral College votes by a combined 311,257 votes out of 25.5 million ballots cast for president. The disputed ballots represent just 0.15% of his victory margin in those states.</p>
<p>The cases could not throw the outcome into question even if all the potentially fraudulent votes were for Biden, which they were not, and even if those ballots were actually counted, which in most cases they were not.</p>
<p>The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots.</p>
<p>The findings build on a mountain of other evidence that the election wasn’t rigged, including verification of the results by Republican governors.</p>
<p>The AP review, a process that took months and encompassed more than 300 local election offices, is one the most comprehensive examinations of suspected voter fraud in last year’s presidential election. It relies on information collected at the local level, where officials must reconcile their ballots and account for discrepancies, and includes a handful of separate cases cited by secretaries of state and state attorneys general.</p>
<p>Contacted for comment, Trump repeated a litany of unfounded claims of fraud he had made previously, but offered no new evidence that specifically contradicted the AP’s reporting. He said a soon-to-come report from a source he would not disclose would support his case, and insisted increased mail voting alone had opened the door to cheating that involved “hundreds of thousands of votes.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t think you should make a fool out of yourself by saying 400 votes,” he said.</p>
<p>These are some of the culprits in the “massive election fraud” Trump falsely says deprived him of a second term:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Wisconsin man who mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole.</li>
<li>A woman in Arizona suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother.</li>
<li>A Pennsylvania man who went twice to the polls, voting once on his own behalf and once for his son.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cases were isolated. There was no widespread, coordinated deceit.</p>
<p>The cases also underscore that suspected fraud is both generally detected and exceptionally rare.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7350" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CARecall-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CARecall-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CARecall.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Voter fraud is virtually non-existent,” said George Christenson, election clerk for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, where five people statewide have been charged with fraud out of nearly 3.3 million ballots cast for president. “I would have to venture a guess that’s about the same odds as getting hit by lightning.”</p>
<p>Even in the state with the highest number of potential fraud cases — Arizona, with 198 — they comprised less than 2% of the margin by which Biden won.</p>
<p>Trump has continued to insist that the election was fraudulent by citing a wide range of complaints, many of them involving the expansion of mail voting because of the pandemic. As the Republican weighs another run for president in 2024, he has waded into some GOP primary contests, bestowing endorsements on those who mimic his “Stop the steal” rhetoric and seeking to exact revenge on some who have opposed his efforts to overturn the results.</p>
<p>Trump’s<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-claims-biden-won-explained-bd53b14ce871412b462cb3fe2c563f18"> false claims of a stolen election fueled</a> the deadly Jan. 6 attempted insurrection at the Capitol, have led to death threats against election officials and have become deeply ingrained within the GOP, with<a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-poll-trump-republicans-future-ba85f8d2a572c553b621f86e991ee197"> two-thirds of Republicans believing Biden’s election is illegitimate</a>. Republican lawmakers in several states have used the false claims as justification to conduct costly and time-consuming partisan election reviews, done at Trump’s urging, and add new restrictions for voting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6211" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Voting-Line-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Voting-Line-300x182.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Voting-Line.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The number of cases identified so far by local elections officials and forwarded to prosecutors, local law enforcement or secretaries of state for further review undercuts Trump’s claim. Election officials also say that in most cases, the additional ballots were never counted because workers did their jobs and pulled them for inspection before they were added to the tally.</p>
<p>“There is a very specific reason why we don’t see many instances of fraud, and that is because the system is designed to catch it, to flag it and then hold those people accountable,” said Amber McReynolds, a former director of elections in Denver and the founding CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, which promotes mail voting.</p>
<p>The AP’s review of cases in the six battleground states found no evidence to support Trump’s various claims, which have included unsupported allegations that more votes were tallied than there are registered voters and that thousands of mail-in ballots were cast by people who are not on voter rolls. Dozens of state and federal courts have rejected the claims.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Andrew Bates said the AP’s reporting offered further proof that the election was fairly conducted and decided, contrary to Trump’s claims.</p>
<p>“Each time this dangerous but weak and fear-ridden conspiracy theory has been put forward, it has only cemented the truth more by being completely debunked — including at the hands of elections authorities from both parties across the nation, nonpartisan experts, and over 80 federal judges,” he said.</p>
<p>Experts say to pull off stealing a presidential election would require large numbers of people willing to risk prosecution, prison time and fines working in concert with election officials from both parties who are willing to look the other way. And everyone somehow would keep quiet about the whole affair.</p>
<p>“It would be the most extensive conspiracy in the history of planet Earth,” said David Becker, a senior trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush who now directs the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6163" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EarlyVoting-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EarlyVoting-300x197.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EarlyVoting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Separate from the fraud allegations are claims by Trump and his allies that voting systems or ballot tallies were somehow manipulated to steal the election. Judges across the country, of both parties, dismissed those claims. That includes a federal judge in Michigan<a href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuits-michigan-ed328f20f55944164a68bc6003206c90"> who ordered sanctions against attorneys allied with Trump</a> for intending to create “confusion, commotion and chaos” in filing a lawsuit about the vote-counting process without checking for evidence to support the claims.</p>
<p>Even Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, said a month after the election that<a href="https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d"> there was no indication of widespread fraud</a> that could change the result.</p>
<p>For its review, AP reporters in five states contacted roughly 340 election offices for details about every instance of potential voter fraud that was identified as part of their post-election review and certification process.</p>
<p>After an election is over, officials research voter records, request and review additional information if needed from the state or other counties, and eventually decide whether to refer potential fraud cases for further investigation — a process that can take months.</p>
<p>For Wisconsin, the AP relied on a report about fraud investigations compiled by the state and filed public records requests to get the details of each case, in addition to prosecutions that were not initially reported to the state elections commission. Wisconsin is the only one of the six states with a centralized accounting of all potential voter fraud cases.</p>

Virtually all the cases were in Pima County, home to Tucson, and involved allegations of double voting. The county has a practice of referring every effort to cast a second ballot to prosecutors, something other offices don’t do. In the Pima cases, only one ballot for each voter was counted. So far, nine people have been charged in the state with voting fraud crimes following the 2020 election. Six of those were filed by the state attorney general’s office, which has an election integrity unit that is reviewing an undisclosed number of additional cases.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />—<strong>GEORGIA</strong>: Election officials in 124 of the state’s 159 counties reported no suspicious activity after conducting their post-election checks. Officials in 24 counties identified 64 potential voter fraud cases, representing 0.54% of Biden’s margin of victory in Georgia. Of those, 31 were determined to be the result of an administrative error or some other mistake. Eleven counties, most of them rural, either declined to say or did not respond. The state attorney general’s office is reviewing about 20 cases referred so far by the state election board related to all elections in 2020, including the primary, but it was not known if any of those overlapped with cases already identified by local election officials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5257" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" />—<strong>MICHIGAN</strong>: Officials have identified 56 potential instances of voter fraud in five counties, representing 0.04% of Biden’s margin of victory in the state. Most of the cases involved two people suspected of submitting about 50 fraudulent requests for absentee ballots in Macomb, Wayne and Oakland counties. All the suspicious applications were flagged by election officials and no ballots were cast improperly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5403" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />—<strong>NEVADA</strong>: Local officials identified between 93 and 98 potential fraud cases out of 1.4 million ballots cast, representing less than one-third of 1% of Biden’s margin of victory. More than half the total — 58 — were in Washoe County, which includes Reno, and the vast majority involved allegations of possible double voting. The statewide total does not include thousands of fraud allegations submitted to the state by local Republicans.<a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument?id=9428"> Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske has said</a> many of those were based “largely upon an incomplete assessment of voter registration records and lack of information concerning the processes by which these records are compiled and maintained.” It’s not known how many remain under investigation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="105" height="105" />—<strong>PENNSYLVANIA</strong>: Election officials in 11 of the state’s 67 counties identified 26 possible cases of voter fraud, representing 0.03% of Biden’s margin of victory. The elections office in Philadelphia refused to discuss potential cases with the AP, but the prosecutor’s office in Philadelphia said it has not received any fraud-related referrals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />—<strong>WISCONSIN</strong>: Election officials have referred 31 cases of potential fraud to prosecutors in 12 of the state’s 72 counties, representing about 0.15% of Biden’s margin of victory. After reviewing them, prosecutors declined to bring charges in 26 of those cases. Meagan Wolfe, administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said the number of cases in 2020 was “fairly run of the mill.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AP’s review found the potential cases of fraud ran the gamut: Some were attributed to administrative error or voter confusion while others were being examined as intentional attempts to commit fraud. In those cases, many involved people who sought to vote twice — by casting both an absentee and an in-person ballots — or those who cast a ballot for a dead relative such as the woman in Maricopa County, Arizona. Authorities there say she signed her mother’s name on a ballot envelope. The woman’s mother had died a month before the election.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6312" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The cases are bipartisan. Some of those charged with fraud are registered Republicans or told investigators they were supporters of Trump.</p>
<p>Donald Holz is among the five people in Wisconsin who face voter fraud charges. He said all he wanted to do was vote for Trump. But because he was still on parole after being convicted of felony drunken driving, the 63-year-old retiree was not eligible to do so. Wisconsin is not among the states that have loosened felon voting laws in recent years.</p>
<p>Holz said he had no intention to break the law and only did so after he asked poll workers if it was OK.</p>
<p>“The only thing that helps me out is that I know what I did and I did it with good intentions,” Holz said after an initial court appearance in Fond du Lac. “The guy upstairs knows what I did. I didn’t have any intention to commit election fraud.”</p>
<p>In southeast Pennsylvania, 72-year-old Ralph Thurman, a registered Republican, was sentenced to three years’ probation after pleading guilty to one count of repeat voting. Authorities said Thurman, after voting at his polling place, returned about an hour later wearing sunglasses and cast a ballot in his son’s name.</p>
<p>After being recognized and confronted, Thurman fled the building, officials said. Thurman’s attorney told the AP the incident was the result of miscommunication at the polling place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6476" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-300x300.png" alt="" width="185" height="185" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-1024x1021.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-768x766.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" />Las Vegas businessman Donald “Kirk” Hartle was among those in Nevada who raised the cry against election fraud. Early on, Hartle insisted someone had unlawfully cast a ballot in the name of his dead wife, and state Republicans seized on his story to support their claims of widespread fraud in the state. It turned out that someone had cast the ballot illegally — Hartle, himself.<a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-elections-las-vegas-voting-f9bddb59ee9d86d7544dad772771082b"> He agreed to plead guilty</a> to a reduced charge of voting more than once in the same election.</p>
<p>Hartle’s attorney said the businessman, who is an executive at a company that hosted a Trump rally before the election, had accepted responsibility for his actions.</p>
<p>Additional fraud cases could still surface in the weeks and months ahead. One avenue for those is the Electronic Registration Information Center, a data-sharing effort among 31 states aimed at improving state voter rolls. The effort also provides states with reports after each general election with information about voters who might have cast ballots in more than one state.</p>
<p>In the past, those lists have generated small numbers of fraud cases. In 2018, for example, Wisconsin used the report to identify 43 additional instances of potential fraud out of 2.6 million ballots cast.</p>
<p>Official post-election audits and other research have shown voter fraud to be exceptionally rare. A<a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wisconsin-presidential-elections-state-elections-madison-9a2f172dd8074668ded26bd5b0b41fbb"> nonpartisan audit of Wisconsin’s 2020 presidential election</a> found no evidence of widespread fraud and a Republican lawmaker concluded it showed that elections in the state were “safe and secure,” while also recommending dozens of changes to how elections are run. In Michigan,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-joe-biden-election-2020-elections-government-and-politics-4b6643aa699480dc63cbce8555aac946"> Republican state senators issued a report earlier this year</a> saying they had found “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud” in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Not only do election officials look for fraud, they have procedures to detect and prevent it.</p>
<p>For mail voting, which expanded greatly last year because of the pandemic, election officials log every mail ballot so voters cannot request more than one. Those ballots also are logged when they are returned, checked against registration and, in many cases, voter signatures on file to ensure the voter assigned to the ballot is the one who cast it.</p>
<p>If everything doesn’t match, the ballot isn’t counted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6180" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-300x282.png" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-300x282.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020.png 566w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Often, we don’t get to fraud,” said Jennifer Morrell, a former local election official in Utah and Colorado who advises election officials on security and other issues. “Say we have evidence that something might not be correct, we ask the voter to provide additional documentation. If the person doesn’t respond, the ballot isn’t accepted. The fraud never happened.”</p>
<p>If a person who requested a mail ballot shows up at a polling place, this will become apparent when they check in. Typically, poll workers either cancel the ballot that was previously issued, ensuring it’s never counted, or ask the voter to complete a provisional ballot that will only be counted if the mail ballot is not.</p>
<p>In Union County, Georgia, someone voted in person and then election officials found their ballot in a drop box. Since the person had already voted, the ballot in the drop box was not counted and the case was referred to the state for investigation, Deputy Registrar Diana Nichols said.</p>
<p>“We can tell pretty quick whenever we pull up that record &#8212; wait a minute, this person has already voted,” Nichols said. “I’m not saying it’s foolproof. We are all human, and we all make mistakes. But as far as the system is set up, if you follow the rules and the guidelines set up by the state, I think it’s a very good system.”</p>
<p>The final step is the canvassing process in which election officials must reconcile all their counts, ensuring the number of ballots cast equals the number of voters who voted. Any discrepancies are researched, and election officials provide detailed explanations before the election can be certified.</p>
<p>Often, an administrative error can raise questions that suggest the potential for fraud.</p>
<p>In Forsyth County, Georgia, election officials were asked by Arizona investigators for records confirming that a voter had also cast a ballot in Georgia last November. It turns out that voter didn’t cast a ballot but was listed as having done so because their registration number was mistakenly associated with another voter’s record in the county’s system, according to a letter sent by county election officials.</p>
<p>In other cases, it could be as simple as a voter signing on the wrong line next to another person’s name in a paper pollbook at their polling place. Once researched, it quickly becomes clear no fraud occurred.</p>

People voting in Republican races on Election Day will cast hand-marked ballots that will be hand counted, which the party believes to be more secure. Experts say the move will introduce a higher risk of fraud, confuse voters, and likely result in legal challenges. “This introduces a lot of potential mistakes and it also introduces opportunities for fraud,” Christina Adkins, the legal director of the Texas Secretary of State’s elections division told Votebeat. “The candidates on this ballot really need to think about whether this is how they want their election run.” Chris Davis, the election administrator in Williamson County and vice president of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators, learned of the plan from an email forwarded by the local party chair. “This will end badly,” Davis said, predicting extreme voter confusion. He said his county party has no desire to move in that direction and he is unaware of any county making a similar decision.</p>

Greenland will hold a special town election Dec. 18 on the citizen petition filed by Douglas Wilson and 51 registered voters calling on the town to revert back to the hand counting of all paper ballot votes. The petition in Greenland required only 50 signatures to call the special vote because the town&#8217;s population is less than 10,000 (it&#8217;s 4,067, according to 2020 Census). Similar attempts to ban the voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington. There is also a statewide bill to do away with voting machines filed by state Rep. Mark Alliegro, R-Campton. Proponents of the measure say it&#8217;s a way to restore &#8220;integrity&#8221; in future elections. Those who oppose this change to the way election results are counted have called it a ruse to undermine voter confidence in the election system by solving a problem that doesn&#8217;t exist. &#8220;Over 800,000 votes were cast in New Hampshire last November,&#8221; Gov. Chris Sununu (R) said in a prepared statement provided to Seacoastonline. &#8220;There were 16 recounts, and all verified the winners. New Hampshire’s election process continues to be a model for the rest of the country.&#8221;</p>

Hailey said that it was important to represent diversity of the population in the sticker design to inspire a more diverse voter turnout, as well as future designers. Hailey was one of five finalists selected from over 75 submissions, and her design will be featured at county polling places for 2022-2023 elections, according to the<a href="https://www.showmeboone.com/clerk/contest.asp"> Boone County Clerk’s website</a>.

Among the changes is a registration period for election observers. Candidates for office and political organizations are allowed one poll watcher and one observer at polling locations and up to four observers at a return location — in Anchorage’s case, the election center. Under the proposed changes, people wanting to register to be election observers would need to turn in a form between 62 and 32 days before a regular election, and between 37 and 22 days before a special election. Previously, there was no pre-registration. Other updates in the ordinance include changes to observer requirements and clarifying changes to the code’s language.  The Assembly will take in-person public testimony on the ordinance at two meetings this month.</p>

HB903 and SB1228 would require all Florida public high schools to host bipartisan voter registration presentations, giving eligible students the option to register or pre-register to vote. These presentations, designed by the Division of Elections, would give students the resources to register to vote online. Students could not be forced or persuaded to register to vote or register with a certain party, and teachers would not be involved in the presentation in any capacity. “Our youths are the leaders and changemakers of tomorrow. By providing accessible voter registration in Florida’s public schools we are facilitating a space where these students can contribute to the democratic process of this great nation.”, said Taddeo in a press release. “Many people in our state don’t know that if you turn 18 years old by election time, you can pre-register at the age of 17 years old and these presentations can help inform on just that.”</p>

Butch Miller (R) has introduced legislation that would<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-gop-senator-running-for-lt-governor-wants-to-ban-election-drop-boxes/YZ4SH27BNZFPVFDCNYOMSSKM7I/"> eliminate absentee ballot drop boxes</a>. In a press release, sent by the Senate Press Office, Miller, who is facing an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump, called the banning of drop boxes the “next step in our fight to restore Georgians’ faith in our election systems.” “Drop boxes were introduced as an emergency measure during the pandemic, but many counties did not follow the security guidelines in place, such as the requirement for camera surveillance on every drop box,” Miller said in the release. “Moving forward, we can return to a pre-pandemic normal of voting in person. Removing drop boxes will help rebuild the trust that has been lost..” Georgia’s new<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/fight-over-georgia-election-rewrite-now-heads-from-legislature-to-new-fronts/5OQ5XVXSXVD6VLERWIGBPSXOXU/"> voting law</a> allows the drop boxes with tight restrictions: They must be located inside early voting sites, available only during in-person voting hours, and shut down when early voting ends the Friday before an election. Miller’s proposal,<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/325"> Senate Bill 325</a>, would remove the use of election drop boxes completely. An<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/drop-box-use-soared-in-democratic-areas-before-georgia-voting-law/N4ZTGHLWD5BRBOUKBHTUCFVOEU/"> analysis</a> of election data from the secretary of state’s office by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Georgia Public Broadcasting found that ballot drop boxes saw heavy usage in mostly Democratic metro Atlanta counties during their rollout last year, far more than in rural Republican areas of Georgia.</p>

One bill required all voters living in the state to follow residency laws, such as the requirement to register a car in New Hampshire. The other bill added stricter requirements for voters who register within 30 days of an election but do not present a photo ID or other documentation. For those voters, the law required them to fill out a new set of forms and present the documentation to their local elected officials. HB 1213: Establishes the State Primary Election Day as a legal holiday, and provides that any state office, city, town, school district, and community college or university supported by the state shall not be open for any state holidays. Currently, General Election Day is a holiday, but public schools and public employees do not get the day off. HB 1442: Requires that election and voter information be available in multiple languages. This bill is sponsored by Rep. Manny Espitia, a Nashua Democrat. CACR 15: This constitutional amendment allows 17 year-olds to vote in primary elections, as long as they turn 18 by the time of the general election. CACR 16: This constitutional amendment requires the Attorney General to prosecute “any case of election fraud where there is clear and convincing evidence of such.” This amendment is sponsored by Rep. Max Abramson, a Seabrook Libertarian.</p>

The legislation was approved 33-14 with 2 abstentions. Immigrants with permanent residency or legal work authorizations will be able to vote in local elections moving forward. The legislation, sponsored by Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez,<a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2021/11/new-york-city-weighing-major-expansion-voting-rights-heres-what-you-need-know/185478/"> has been years</a> in the works. “It is no secret that today, inside this chamber, the New York City Council is making history,” Rodriguez told City &amp; State. Despite the bill having several dozen co-sponsors, a spirited debate on the legislation broke out at Thursday’s stated meeting. Council Member Mark Gjonaj, one of the more conservative Democratic members of the council, moved to send the bill back to the Committee on Governmental Operations, in order to consider possible amendments to it, including extending the mandatory residency requirement for noncitizen voters prior to the election date to more than 30 days. Several members spoke in favor of moving it back to committee, including Republican Minority Leader Joe Borelli and Democrats Kalman Yeger and Robert Holden.</p>

Roy Cooper (D) has vetoed legislation that would have prohibited local boards of elections from accepting<a href="https://www.wral.com/governor-vetoes-bill-barring-donations-to-run-nc-elections/20026559/"> private grant funding</a> to help administer elections.  GOP bill sponsors said outside donations to government agencies create the impression of undue influence in elections. They point out that some nationwide grant distributors received large donations from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the company formerly known as Facebook, and his wife. But Cooper said in a statement that nonprofit and nonpartisan grants provided masks, pens and other protective equipment “so voters stayed safe during the pandemic.” &#8220;The legislature should start properly funding elections boards to ensure accessible, safe, and secure elections every time, which would end the need for grants,” he added. The bill now returns to the General Assembly, which after Friday won&#8217;t reconvene to Raleigh until Dec. 30, when veto override attempts are possible. But it&#8217;s unlikely GOP bill authors would be successful. The bill was approved along party lines, and Republican majorities are not veto-proof.</p>

Eric Nelson, R-Westmoreland, would prohibit county and state elections officials from accepting private donations to administer elections. The move was inspired by millions of dollars in grants to local election offices provided by nonprofits controlled by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the last election cycle. “This bill addresses a major concern brought forth during the 2020 election, that the lure of private money has seeped into the election system,” Nelson said. “Email evidence has proven Pennsylvania’s highest election officials notified specific counties of grant opportunities weeks before other counties were made aware. Our state’s highest offices were vulnerable to perversion by deep pockets with private election contracts. It is just plain wrong, and this bill will stop it.” Rep. Scott Conklin, D-Centre, argued on the House floor Tuesday the money pumped into elections in 2020 wasn’t partisan and did not generate fraud. He urged the chamber to reject the legislation and to instead invest more tax dollars into elections to eliminate the need for private funds.</p>

That means Ohio largely would shift to only holding two elections a year: the primary, typically in March or May and the general election in November. The House voted 68-24 to approve the bill, with all of the “no” votes coming from Democrats, although some Democrats voted for the bill. The measure now heads to the Senate for consideration. One HB458 sponsor, State Rep. Thomas Hall, a Butler County Republican, previously has said that local governments “game the system” by seeking to approve tax increases during low-turnout special elections when most voters aren’t paying attention. Under the bill, local governments could place tax issues on the ballot during August special congressional elections, but only if the government’s borders are entirely within the congressional district. The bill also would allow local governments to seek tax issues in an August special election if they are designated by the state Auditor’s Office to be in a state of fiscal emergency.</p>

Ensign does not specifically address statistics presented by challengers that the change will have a disparate impact on minorities. Instead, he told U.S. District Court Judge Dominic Lanza that these claims are irrelevant, saying there is no proof that was the intent of the Republican-controlled legislature — even if that is what the numbers may show. Until now, anyone who has signed up for the permanent early voting list automatically gets a ballot in the mail ahead of all elections. Only when a person is removed from the list of registered voters does that end. The new law spells out that if someone does not return an early ballot in at least one of four prior elections — meaning a primary and a general election in two successive years — that person is dropped from what would no longer be called the permanent early voting list.</p>

Political science professors Sharon Austin, Michael McDonald and Daniel Smith filed the lawsuit after the university denied their requests to serve as plaintiffs’ witnesses in a challenge to a new state elections law (SB 90) that includes making it harder for Floridians to vote by mail. They said school administrators told them that going against the executive branch of the government was “adverse” to the university’s interests.  “The public controversy involving the three UF professors who were denied permission to act as paid expert witnesses in litigation against the state of Florida is now over. Indeed, that controversy was over even before this case began. UF approved the professors’ outside activity requests before they filed the lawsuit. They simply refuse to take yes for an answer,” the university’s lawyers wrote in a Dec. 1 motion to dismiss. According to court records, the university told the political science professors that “outside activities that may pose a conflict of interest to the executive branch of the state of Florida create a conflict” for the university. State universities rely on the Legislature for funding, and the governor has the ability to veto line items in the budget.</p>

Boulee<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-denies-attempts-to-dismiss-lawsuits-over-georgia-voting-law/5LE5NF7GJRCZDJY52NL7YD33DY/"> ruled against motions to dismiss eight pending lawsuits</a> against Georgia’s new voting law. Boulee’s orders allow the cases to move forward as they contest many provisions of the law, including stricter voter ID requirements, ballot drop boxes limitations, shorter absentee ballot request deadlines and a ban on handing out food and water to voters waiting in line. Boulee denied arguments from the state of Georgia that the cases should be thrown out because of legal issues including whether the plaintiffs had a right to sue, suffered an injury or stated a claim for relief. The merits of the cases will be determined after facts and evidence are presented in the case, Boulee wrote. The plaintiffs include several nonprofit organizations and the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged that the law targeted Black voters by restricting absentee voting. Georgia’s Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, sought to dismiss the case in July, calling it “political posturing” filled with “innuendo and hyperbole.”  The cases will now continue to move through the court system as the parties gather evidence and make arguments in court.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Senator David Perdue has filed a lawsuit that<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/12/10/david-perdue-files-election-lawsuit-recycled-already-disproven-claims-of-fraud"> recycles claims of fraud</a> already disproven by investigators and rejected by the courts. In court filings, Perdue and a Georgia voter claim that thousands of &#8220;unlawfully marked&#8221; absentee ballots were counted in Fulton County&#8217;s presidential election, despite three separate counts of the results and no evidence of so-called &#8220;counterfeit&#8221; ballots included in the vote totals. The lawsuit repeats claims of &#8220;pristine&#8221; ballots observed by a Republican monitor that investigators could not corroborate, includes debunked claims about ballots counted at State Farm Arena on election night and demands an inspection of absentee by mail ballots, after a Henry County judge dismissed a similar suit in October. The legal challenge also wants the court to fire any employees that committed or knew about alleged fraud — something a judge would be unlikely to do — and to command Fulton to &#8220;certify the correct vote total to the Secretary of State,&#8221; which is impossible to do since the election is already certified. Other claims made in the suit rehash arguments that have been made and fact-checked for months, including most recently in a lawsuit filed by election conspiracist Garland Favorito that was dismissed in October.</p>

The suit claims the proposed initiative violates three state constitutional requirements: the single-subject rule, addition of a cost without a funding source, and a deficient “description of effect,” the 200-word summary that accompanies the signature form for the petition.  It states that the initiative’s replacement of traditional closed party primaries along with the switch to a ranked-choice general election would violate the requirement that voter-filed initiatives stick to a single subject. “Though sweeping in scope, each of these changes is a discrete, independent modification of present election law that neither depends upon the other for its operation nor even references it in its voluminous text,” the complaint states. The lawsuit also claims the proposed initiative violates requirements against ballot questions that require an appropriation or spending of money without some kind of included tax or funding source.</p>

Sedita III ordered the counting of ballots from 43 Lewiston voters who<a href="https://subscribe.buffalonews.com/e/limit-reached-bn?returnURL=https://buffalonews.com/news/local/government-and-politics/o-my-filling-in-candidates-middle-initial-changes-outcome-in-lewiston-race/article_53ed7cfc-5c41-11ec-8db8-3333746b06e4.html"> filled in the &#8220;O&#8221; in Jacoby&#8217;s name</a>, instead of the oval for voting on their paper ballots. The computerized scanner that counts Niagara County votes missed those 43 votes because they are programmed to register marks in the oval. The scanner did count 21 ballots for Jacoby on which the voter filled in both the oval and the O. Acting Republican Election Commissioner Michael P. Carney sought to disallow those 21 votes because of the double marking, but Sedita refused. The result of the court ruling was to turn what seemed to be a 18-vote defeat for Jacoby into a 25-vote victory. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty familiar with the election process, but this was a fluke,&#8221; said Jacoby, an incumbent board member who was county Democratic Party chairman for almost a year before stepping down this summer.</p>

The court issued an opinion saying a provision of the law violates the separation of powers clause in the Texas Constitution, representing an intrusion by the executive branch into the judicial branch. The attorney general can only get involved in a case when asked to by a district or county attorney, the court said. In its opinion, the Court of Criminal Appeals overturned a lower-court ruling that said the election code provision “clearly and unambiguously gives the Attorney General power to prosecute criminal laws prescribed by election laws generally whether those laws are inside or outside the Code.” Rather, the Court of Criminal Appeals said, “the Attorney General can prosecute with the permission of the local prosecutor but cannot initiate prosecution unilaterally.”</p>

Tucked within SB 1 that was passed by the Texas Legislature in this year’s second special session is a section erasing criminal penalties for felons who attempt to vote without knowing that they were committing a crime. That portion of the law came about with Mason’s conviction in mind. “SB 1 is a repudiation of Ms. Mason’s conviction and five-year sentence of incarceration,” the brief states. Her case has been on appeal since she was convicted in 2018. It led Mason to spend 10 months in federal prison because her conviction amounted to a violation of her parole agreement with federal authorities. She is free while her case is on appeal. Her conviction was upheld in lower courts, but has been pending in Texas’ highest criminal appeals court since 2020.</p>

Mark Aguirre is charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and could face up to 20 years in prison. Aguirre was arrested last December after prosecutors say he ran his SUV into the back of the truck of an air conditioning technician.

In June, Paul Goldman sued the Board of Elections saying the 2021 House of Delegates elections were going to be on out of date districts. Some districts have nearly twice as many people as others. Goldman says that violates the equal protection clause: that one person gets one vote. The case, before Federal District Court, is currently on appeal before The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Herring&#8217;s office appealed the case after the judge overseeing the district court case removed a number of defendants from the case, including Governor Ralph Northam, but kept members of the State Board of Elections in their official capacities.  The Attorney General’s office brief was in an appeal lawyers wrote the case should be argued in state rather than Federal Court in order to sue state officials. They also wrote Goldman was disguising his state law claims in federal court, but conceded the case &#8220;may raise important questions of Virginia law.&#8221; “Mine is based on the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. They don&#8217;t seem to be able to comprehend that,” Goldman said. “There is also a very good state constitutional argument that you could make: I’m making the federal constitutional argument.”</p>

The lawsuit, filed in Snohomish County, wanted to have a “forensic audit” of the ballots. Mitchell ruled this week that the nonprofit needed to have an attorney file the case. Instead the nonprofit’s director, Tamborine Borrelli, and two Franklin County men, Ethan Carlson and Fred Carpenter, signed the complaint. While individuals can represent themselves in court, nonprofits don’t have the same ability, said Callie A. Castillo, the attorney representing Franklin County. Mitchell also pointed out the two Franklin County men didn’t sue within the time frame required by state law. Even outside of the procedural elements, Mitchell said ballots are protected from public records requests. “Those are confidential and they’re not to be disclosed,” he said. “The court also denies the complaint on that basis.”</p>

Specifically, the college IDs can be used for voting only if the IDs expire within two years of being issued and include a signature. IDs from five of the state&#8217;s institutions of higher learning don&#8217;t meet those criteria, according to the lawsuit. Peterson threw out the lawsuit, ruling that it was reasonable for the state to spell out what must be included on college IDs. &#8220;It would be rational for the legislature to conclude that making student IDs more uniform enhances their reliability, makes them more difficult to falsify, and makes it easier for poll workers to recognize a valid student ID,&#8221; Peterson wrote. Peterson, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, has ruled against the voter ID law in the past.</p>
<p>Waukesha County Circuit Judge Ralph Ramirez<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-wisconsin-lawsuits-state-elections-madison-f41cf8377526eab0136f750b2de40934"> delayed until at least next month</a> any action in a lawsuit that seeks to force the mayors of Madison and Green Bay to face jail or sit for depositions with the attorney hired by Republicans to investigate the 2020 election. Ramirez set the next hearing in the case after a Dane County judge hears arguments in a separate case filed by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul.  A ruling in that case would likely affect the lawsuit targeting the mayors, leading the judge on Friday to delay any action until after that Dec. 23 hearing. Attorneys for the mayors and Michael Gableman, the lead investigator, did not object to the delay.</p>

Julie Mathis, CEO, stated “We couldn’t be more excited about the expansion of our capabilities and what it means for our customers. Customers have told us they want to see Hart offer new products and services, beyond the core voting system. This way, they can benefit from our technology leadership and customer service excellence across more of their election operations and simplify their management of fewer vendors.” The Hart NextVote solution is centered around secure, modern, and flexible voter management/voter registration but also includes intuitive modules to make election processes more efficient, including election management, geographic information system (GIS), poll worker / polling place management, absentee ballot processing, petition management, and reporting management. Hart plans to solicit customer input to help prioritize the development of additional fully integrated modules to help election offices run more smoothly and efficiently. NextVote is designed to work across multiple voting system environments; it will integrate well with voting systems from Hart and from other vendors. NextVote is already being implemented by Hart in New York counties, and expansion to other states is already in motion.
