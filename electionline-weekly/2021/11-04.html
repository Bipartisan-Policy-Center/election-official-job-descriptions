							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Officials Made Democracy Happen in 2020</strong><br />
<em>A new report from the Center for Tech and Civic Life</em></p>
<p>By<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/team/keegan-hughes/"> Keegan Hughes</a>, senior impact &amp; learning manager<br />
<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Tech and Civic Life</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5301" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png 526w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />It’s been one year since the November 2020 elections, which also means it’s been one year since the Center for Tech and Civic Life’s<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/10-facts-about-ctcl-grants/"> COVID-19 Response Grant program</a>. You may recall the grant program — it’s the one that distributed approximately $350 million to<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/grant-update-march/"> nearly 2,500 jurisdictions</a> across 49 states, in order to provide emergency funding during a pandemic.</p>
<p>CTCL wasn’t a grantmaking organization before 2020, so we had to learn fast. Luckily, the grant process was straightforward: we awarded funding to every local election office that applied and was verified as legitimate, and they could spend the money on election-related costs that helped them administer the 2020 elections in a safe and secure way.</p>
<p>Awarding grants to 2,500 jurisdictions means we heard stories from 2,500 perspectives. Stories about what grantees were most proud of accomplishing with the funding, what 2020 would have looked like without it, and what grantees could accomplish if their election budgets permanently doubled. The stories were sometimes hopeful, sometimes heartbreaking, and always wildly passionate about serving voters and keeping everyone safe.</p>
<p>Here at CTCL, we believe that these stories belong to the people who shared them. Each individual provided a tiny glimpse into their world, but collectively their stories burst with common themes, goals, challenges, frustrations, hopes, and dreams. We brainstormed ways to “close the loop” between the individual stories and the collective story of the grant program. We decided to curate the stories, memorialize them in<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Election-Officials-Made-Democracy-Happen-in-2020.pdf"> a designed report</a>, and mail a physical copy to every grantee.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7611" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CTCLTwo11.04-232x300.png" alt="" width="209" height="270" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CTCLTwo11.04-232x300.png 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CTCLTwo11.04.png 609w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" />The report’s full title is<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Election-Officials-Made-Democracy-Happen-in-2020.pdf"> Election Officials Made Democracy Happen in 2020: The New Case for Predictable Government Funding</a>. But internally, we’ve been calling it our “love letter” to grantees. For many election administrators, the 2020 election was the most challenging election of their entire career, and we’re unbelievably grateful for all the work they did — and continue to do! — to make democracy happen.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights from the report<br />
</strong>Over 70% of grants were awarded to small jurisdictions with fewer than 25,000 voters. Grantees ranged from a town of 600 people, to a city of 6 million, and everywhere in between. Collectively, the grantees served 60% of eligible U.S. voters, and accomplished incredible things. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tiny jurisdiction in Texas used grant funds to buy ‘I Voted’ stickers for the first time</li>
<li>A city in Massachusetts hired interpreters at each polling place to assist non-English speaking voters</li>
<li>A Georgia county reached rural voters with a mobile voting bus</li>
<li>A county in Hawaii translated voting materials into Hawaiian for the first time</li>
<li>A Mississippi county safely trained poll workers with an FM transmitter while they stayed in their cars</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7610" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CTCLThree11.04-276x300.png" alt="" width="276" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CTCLThree11.04-276x300.png 276w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CTCLThree11.04.png 432w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" />The largest section, “What You Accomplished,” is the heart of the report, and showcases quotes directly from grantees. There are stories about disasters that could have happened without the extra funding: “We would not have been able to process all the ballots without these funds.” There are stories about creative pandemic solutions: “The town was able to provide shelter for voters while waiting in line to enter the polls.” And there are even stories about going above-and-beyond previous elections: “For the first time in 16 years, I feel that we were able to operate elections without worrying about budget and fully meet the needs of our citizens.”</p>
<p>The later sections delve into the challenges holding election officials back. The pandemic exacerbated an existing funding shortage that began long before 2020. Some grantees used the money to replace duct-taped equipment, install internet in the office, and replace voting booths they’d been trying to purchase for 15 years. We heard far too many experiences of election administrators working without pay, or struggling to pay their staff. Far too many grantees told us they cried when they received the money, because they honestly weren’t sure what they were going to do without it.</p>
<p>Private philanthropy is no substitute for predictable government funding at the local, state, and federal level. As one grantee wrote, “The funding from CTCL was a light in the darkness during this election cycle. That said, I think it’s ridiculous that in order to run an election in a somewhat capable manner, we needed to turn to private funding funneled through a national nonprofit.” That’s why the report concludes by envisioning what U.S. election administration might look like with<a href="https://www.modernizeourelections.org/"> predictable, robust public funding</a> into the future. What would it look like if elections were thriving, not just surviving?</p>
<p>We hope you take time to<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Election-Officials-Made-Democracy-Happen-in-2020.pdf"> read the report</a> and reflect on the work of election administrators to make democracy happen in 2020. Let’s celebrate the accomplishments and learn from the challenges. Let’s collectively envision a future with robust public funding, and then work to make it happen.</p>

														<p><strong>Few snags for Election Day 2021</strong><br />

<p>Voters in 30 states<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-voting-presidential-elections-misinformation-election-2020-4001fffebd1c5e2aa597d16581c749fd"> headed to the polls</a> on Tuesday and faced a variety of new laws, new equipment and greater scrutiny fomented by 2020. What they found, was a fairly typical Election Day. Of course there were some technical issues—especially in New Jersey where new equipment was being used for the first time—but there were<a href="https://www.starbeacon.com/region/few-snags-for-election-day-voting-amid-scrutiny-on-process/article_515bfea4-e5b5-52ca-aca3-6b6081165bb2.html"> no major issues</a> and so far (although it’s still early), losing candidates and their supporters seem to be accepting the fact that they lost.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and Turnout</strong><br />
As mentioned, the largest issues stemmed from problems with technology. In Virginia, the state’s largest county,<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/video/news/local/virginia/fairfax-county-recounts-ballots-after-issues-with-thumb-drives-from-early-voting-machine-in-virginia/65-f5caab06-2b9b-475b-94f7-e8d082b7ab17"> Fairfax</a>, was forced recount about 20,000 ballots after an issue with a thumb drive from an early voting machine. In<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/loudoun-county-temporary-polling-location-issue-ballot-machine-jammed-residents-return-to-finish-voting/65-6cf862cc-9f61-431b-927d-a844b35737b2"> Loudoun County</a>, about three dozen voters had to use emergency ballots when a ballot machine briefly jammed. In<a href="https://wset.com/news/local/trouble-with-registration-machines-at-madison-heights-polling-place-causes-voting-delay"> Amherst County</a>, voting got off to a slow start when a missing part for the sign-in equipment briefly delayed the opening of polls. The commonwealth saw its highest<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/elections/voter-turnout-leads-to-ballot-shortages-in-virginia/65-fa5337e4-c218-4bbb-b62b-e378c32e8224"> turnout</a> ever for a gubernatorial election and that had some voters waiting in long lines when polling places in several areas ran out of ballots. Polling places in<a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/albemarle-county-runs-out-of-ballots-at-some-precincts/article_8b075b7c-3c2a-11ec-81b3-1fd5e22f9e75.html"> Albemarle County</a> and<a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/long-lines-at-one-chesterfield-precinct-after-running-out-of-ballots/article_1aeae69d-71e8-52f5-a0b0-8963b3c79dac.html"> Chesterfield County</a> ran out or ran critically low on ballots.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, officials and voters ran into a host of issues with new voting equipment, being rolled out for the first time in a general election on Tuesday. Problems were reported in<a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/jersey-city-voters-plagued-with-poll-locations-opening-late-voting-machines-down-this-morning/"> Jersey City</a>,<a href="https://www.njherald.com/story/news/2021/11/02/sussex-county-nj-elections-incorrect-voting-information-andover-frankford-stanhope/6247501001/"> Sussex County</a>,<a href="https://www.insidernj.com/amid-machine-malfunctions-cumberland-county-testa-urges-vigilance/"> Cumberland County</a> and<a href="https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/11/02/nj-election-voting-machine-problems-middlesex-county/6247303001/"> Middlesex County</a>. E-pollbooks and the ability to connect them to the Internet caused numerous issues throughout the day. In<a href="https://nj1015.com/nj-polling-places-plagued-by-internet-problems-long-lines-on-election-day/"> Monmouth County</a>, Board of Elections Commissioner Eileen Kean said there were &#8220;definitely hiccups taking place today.&#8221; &#8220;Yes we are having internet slowdowns and problems and we are working our way through it,&#8221; Kean said. &#8220;The problem is around the state. It&#8217;s not just a Monmouth County problem. It&#8217;s tied to the electronic poll books Kean said that the early voting went smoothly because there were fewer locations than on Election Day. &#8220;We have hundreds of polling districts. Sure there&#8217;s going to be more problems today than there were when we had ten polling centers for early voting,&#8221; Kean said. The ACLU and the League of Women Voters went to court<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/us/elections/new-jersey-polls-open-aclu.html"> seeking to keep polling places open</a> for an additional 90 minutes due to the problems, but a judge in the state Superior Court, Mercer County division,<a href="https://www.insidernj.com/judge-denies-aclu-lwv-suit-keep-polls-open-past8-pm/"> denied the extension</a>. And problems continued into Election Night. Poll workers in several towns in<a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/11/election-results-from-18-machines-in-union-county-delayed-due-to-poll-worker-errors-official-says.html"> Union County</a> failed to follow proper procedures when removing thumb drives which then resulted in a delay in tabulation and reporting.</p>

<p>While Election Day in<a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-pa-conduct-of-paelection-20211103-2le74ljycja73lhj2qz6erzt7m-story.html"> Pennsylvania</a> was a<a href="https://www.ydr.com/story/news/2021/11/02/tuesdays-election-ran-smoothly-central-pennsylvania/6174674001/"> marked improvement</a> from the May primaries there were still some issues reported both with voting in-person as well as ballot tallying. In<a href="https://patch.com/pennsylvania/norristown/equipment-issue-montco-polling-places-causes-delays"> Montgomery County</a>, an equipment issue at two polling places led to polling hours being extended by an hour. Also in Montgomery County, an<a href="https://www.thereporteronline.com/2021/11/03/montgomery-county-has-delayed-count-of-23000-mail-in-ballots/"> error on about 23,000 mail-in ballots</a> complicated the scanning process and caused a delay in tallying and reporting.  <a href="https://www.bradfordera.com/news/minor-mechanical-issues-reported-during-mckean-county-elections/article_efbb69d3-dea0-5c5e-be1b-7cefc3c26662.html">McKean County</a> experienced technical issues at several polling places, but voting was not impacted. In<a href="http://levittownnow.com/2021/11/02/voting-machines-delivered-to-wrong-place-in-bristol-twp/"> Bristol Township</a>, it wasn’t an issue with malfunctioning equipment, but the wrong equipment. The misdelivered equipment was eventually delivered to the correct polling location.</p>
<p><strong>New Laws</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/polls-open-voters-choose-mayors-city-councils-local-taxes/WICTGADCTVE37MEHRTNBJLBQMQ/">Georgia</a> held its first election since the implementation of SB202 which revamped a number of the state’s voting laws. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, there were few problems on Tuesday that stemmed from the new law, although there were some <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />technical issues with voting equipment. However, election officials did experience some difficulties with a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/election-officials-struggled-with-new-georgia-turnout-disclosure/MPE2CFX3ARFI7BSKFAYY7DAA5M/"> new reporting requirement</a>. Under the new law, officials are supposed to publicly report on election night, the total number of ballots cast. According to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, elections offices in the metro Atlanta area didn’t always comply. An employee who would have helped answer poll workers’ questions after precincts closed instead was assigned to verify turnout information, Cobb Election Director Janine Eveler told the AJC. “The task of collecting and reporting numbers delayed the poll workers from starting their regular closing tasks,” Eveler said. “This likely delayed the returns from some polls.” In<a href="https://www.thegazette.com/local-government/early-voting-is-up-in-linn-and-johnson-despite-new-law/"> Iowa</a>, where some voters did run into issues with a new voting law that shortened absentee ballot deadlines, turnout for early voting, which was shortened, was up in at least two counties. In<a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/new-voting-laws-virginia-2021/291-2d87c884-d175-4881-b0d1-362e75b2f0b5"> Virginia</a>, voters took advantage of new early voting and absentee laws. In<a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/11/the-results-on-njs-first-early-in-person-voting-are-in-more-than-200k-hit-polls-ahead-of-election-day.html"> New Jersey</a>, where early voting was used for the first time, about 200K people took advantage of the new law.</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Measures</strong><br />

In<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/02/denver-election-results-2021-question-2h-2g/"> Denver</a>, voters overwhelmingly voted to amend the charter to move municipal elections to the first Tuesday in April in odd-numbered years instead of the first Tuesday in May as the charter mandates now.

<p><strong>Recounts, Ties and Ranked Choice</strong><br />
For those that follow elections closely, recounts and ties—especially in small, more localized elections—aren’t all that uncommon. This year was no exception. Several Connecticut towns including<a href="https://www.greenwichtime.com/elections/article/Greenwich-to-hold-recount-in-tight-race-for-16588278.php"> Greenwich</a> and<a href="https://www.fairfieldcitizenonline.com/local/article/Some-recounts-needed-in-Bethel-following-election-16589541.php"> Bethel</a>, will be conducting recounts. In<a href="https://www.pahomepage.com/election/your-local-election-headquarters/heads-or-tails-milton-mayoral-race-to-be-determined-thursday-could-come-down-to-coin-flip/"> Milton, Pennsylvania</a>, the difference in the mayoral race is one vote with three provisional ballots left to be counted. The county board of elections will conduct a recount and include the provisionals.  In<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-florida-election-recounts-alcee-hastings-congress-af7e113ffdc7ccbb13e5123f95c631b0"> Florida</a>, with just 12 votes separating the leading candidates in the Democratic primary for the special U.S. House election, a hand recount of ballots will occur. Interestingly, in<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2021-11-03/portland-ranked-choice-council-race-that-ended-in-tie-will-be-decided-by-chance"> Portland, Maine</a>, an election conducted using ranked choice voting still ended up in a tie. After none of the four candidates received more than 50% of the vote, ranked choice kicked in and after the two lower-vote candidates were eliminated, Roberto Rodriguez and Brandon Mazer each ended up with 8,529. Portland&#8217;s rules for ranked-choice elections states that ties must be settled &#8220;in public by lot.&#8221; But the rules do not specify whether that should be a coin flip, drawing straws or another method. In<a href="https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2021-11-03/utah-county-clerks-say-ranked-choice-voting-elections-tuesday-went-smoothly"> Utah</a>, 21 cities debuted ranked choice voting and the response from local election officials was that overall, things went well. “It went really well,” Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen told KUER. “Voters didn&#8217;t seem to be confused by it, I think, because of our explicit instructions on our ballot.”</p>
<p><strong>Polling Place Odds and Ends</strong><br />
Election Day never disappoints for a myriad of stories that come from polling places. Sometimes it’s nudity, sometimes it’s violence and sometimes it’s ponies. In<a href="https://newcanaanite.com/poll-worker-removed-from-nchs-following-reports-of-instructing-voters-updating-5029971"> New Canaan, Connecticut</a>, a poll worker was removed from a polling place after there were reports that she was telling people how to vote. In<a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/video-shows-two-voters-yelling-profanities-causing-disruption-in-polling-place"> Syracuse, New York</a>, voters and poll workers got into a shouting match over a mask requirement. In<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/nyregion/curtis-sliwa-cat-voting.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur"> New York City</a>, mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa showed up with this cat and tried to bring it into the polling place. Gizmo—the cat—was denied entry and Sliwa challenged poll officials on that and several other issues. In<a href="https://www.wral.com/wake-county-election-official-removed-from-voting-site-after-refusing-to-wear-a-mask/19957966/"> Wake County, North Carolina</a>, a precinct judge was removed from a polling place for refusing to wear a mask. Authorities in<a href="https://www.fox19.com/2021/11/02/police-investigate-possible-threat-polling-place-after-woman-says-person-waived-gun-her/"> Hamilton County, Ohio</a> investigated a threat made outside of a polling place. According to the police report, the victim says someone drove past her in a black pickup truck and yelled an obscenity directed at democrats, and then pointed a firearm at her. In<a href="https://nj1015.com/nj-polling-places-plagued-by-internet-problems-long-lines-on-election-day/"> Monmouth County</a>,  New Jersey, a power outage caused a halt to voting at the two fire stations used as polling locations in Keansburg, according to JCP&amp;L spokesman Christopher Hoenig. He said animals damaged a breaker inside a substation that crews are trying to bypass in order to restore power. The article doesn’t say what type of animals caused the damage, but given past problems, we’re gonna<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel"> put our money one animal</a>, and one animal only. And in<a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/local/york/york-county-polling-place-gets-a-visit-from-a-mini-therapy-horse/"> York County, Pennsylvania</a>, Dominique, the miniature therapy horse was at the Bridgeville Fire Co. polling site. “We need kindness, but we need to cast our ballots. It’s a terrific privilege,” Dominique’s handler Sandy Smith said.</p>

Warner said the text to report technology makes it easier than ever to report possible violations. Warner sees a double benefit of this program: on one hand the easy-to-use text to report technology will encourage people to report possible election fraud, while on the other, the accessibility and speed of the ability to report will deter offenders from engaging in errant behavior. Possible violations of election law can be confidentially reported from any common texting device in three easy steps: Text WV to 45995; Click on the incoming text link; and Submit the Confidential Complaint. With investigators situated around the state, the immediate transfer of information will allow them to get to work quickly. Once submitted, the complaint is received immediately by the WVSOS Investigations Division for action with a notice of receipt upon submission. Complaints made to the WV Secretary of State&#8217;s Office are kept confidential. By state law, employees of the WVSOS Office are not permitted to discuss any election investigation or complaint. &#8220;In West Virginia, we&#8217;re continuing our effort in making it easy to vote and hard to cheat,&#8221; said Secretary Warner. &#8220;The general public plays a vital role in helping my office and our county clerks keep elections fair and secure.&#8221;</p>

In a statement issued this week, the professors that they won’t comply with the school’s order barring them from giving testimony. Their statement comes after the university softened its initial stance and said that the professors can provide expert testimony as long as they do it pro bono and on their own time. “Prohibiting professors from giving standard expert testimony, and instead only allowing pro bono testimony, undermines their credibility as expert witnesses and chills their speech,” the professors’ attorneys David O&#8217;Neil and Paul Donnelly wrote in a statement. Within days of the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/us/florida-professors-voting-rights-lawsuit.html"> New York Times</a> breaking the news on Friday night, the school had changed its stance to allow the teachers to testify under certain conditions.  The conflict was brought to light in a court filing, where school leaders contended the testimony from professors would pose a conflict of interest and be “adverse to UF’s interest.” Professors at the university had previously testified in legal challenges involving the state, including on voting rights issues.</p>

The Illinois State Crime Commission selected County Clerk Staley Ferry for her skillful coordination of the 2020/2021 elections during the COVID-19 Pandemic, the accuracy and speed in which she posted elections results during each of those elections, and for transparency in providing important election information to the public. She also was recognized for expanding Early Voting locations across Will County and for cost-reduction measures that have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars. “I am humbled to be recognized by the Illinois State Crime Commission with this distinguished honor for work performed during my first term,” County Clerk Staley Ferry said. “My directive to my staff when I came into office at the end of 2018 was to think creatively and to work tirelessly to serve our voters. The COVID-19 Pandemic put my entire team to the test, but we met every challenge together. This is an honor I share with my incredibly talented and resourceful staff.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>

John Lewis (D-Ga.), marking the latest setback for Democrats in their push for new elections legislation.  Senators voted 50-49 on whether to bring up the bill, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move forward. Vice President Harris presided over part of the vote.  Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted no, a procedural step that lets him bring the bill back up in the future for another vote. Unlike this year&#8217;s previous failed election reform votes, which were on bills that stretched well beyond bolstering the Voting Rights Act, Democrats picked up a GOP supporter: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). All Senate Democrats except Manchin introduced the bill in October to update the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA) to strengthen sections that were gutted by the Supreme Court&#8217;s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which focused on Section 5 of the VRA and its required Justice Department preclearance before some states could change voting laws, and this year&#8217;s Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee decision, which advocates believe weakened Section 2, which is focused on racially targeted voting policies. The revised bill that Republicans blocked on Wednesday includes changes such as what factors courts can consider when determining if Section 2 of the VRA has been violated. The bill also drops a requirement for localities with growing minority populations to get preclearance for changes on offering food or drinks to people waiting in line to vote. The change has been included under the earlier version of the bill&#8217;s new requirement for &#8220;practice-based&#8221; preclearance.</p>

The measures would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow absentee ballots received up to 72 hours after polls close on Election Day to count, as long as they are postmarked on or before Election Day.</li>
<li>Allow absent voter counting boards to start processing and tabulating ballots up to seven days before Election Day. The bill says boards are &#8220;only permitted to open, process, and tabulate absent voter ballots and are not permitted to tally or count the results of those absent voter ballots.&#8221; Generally, tabulating a ballot and counting a ballot are considered the same thing. A House Democratic spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a call seeking clarification.</li>
<li>Mandate at least one absentee ballot drop box for every 20,000 registered voters in a city.</li>
<li>Require clerks to mail an absentee ballot application and pre-paid return envelope to every registered voter in a city or township. The state would be required to reimburse the local municipality for the cost of postage.</li>
<li>Nix a part of law that criminalizes the hiring of a vehicle to take anyone other than someone physically unable to walk to a polling place.</li>
<li>Allow active duty service members and their spouses who are deployed or living overseas to return ballots electronically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Democrats did not work with House Republican leadership on the measures. Generally, bills from Democratic lawmakers have a harder time advancing through the GOP-controlled Legislature. House Elections and Ethics Committee Chairwoman Ann Bollin, R-Brighton, did not outright reject the package but called the overall announcement a &#8220;political stunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/10/29/whitmer-vetoes-election-bills/8520215002/"> vetoed a series of GOP election bills </a>that would have imposed strict ID rules on voters, barred election officials from accepting donations and prohibited the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office as well as clerks from providing absentee ballot applications unless a voter specifically requested one. In a letter outlining her objections to the bills — SB 303, SB 304 and HB 5007 — Whitmer echoed concerns voiced by Democratic lawmakers that the measures would disenfranchise voters.  All three bills passed on party-line votes without any Democratic support. Republican lawmakers who backed the measures argued the changes would boost confidence in elections.  While the Michigan Democratic Party celebrated Whitmer’s vetoes as a win for voter access, the Michigan GOP blasted her decision as a blow to legislation the party said would enhance election integrity.</p>
<p>A bill brought before a House committee aims to<a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/11/michigan-house-bill-would-ban-posting-of-unofficial-election-results-until-after-election-day.html"> prohibit election clerks from posting unofficial election results</a> until all precincts in a community are complete. It would change the way voters typically watch unofficial election results come in on clerk’s websites throughout an election night.<a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billanalysis/House/pdf/2021-HLA-5474-10778A91.pdf"> HB 5474</a>, sponsored by Rep. Luke Meerman, R-Coopersville, would bar local clerks from publishing any unofficial results online until all of the precinct ballot returns and absent voter ballot returns for that precinct are complete. The bill would require clerks to have counted every ballot, both in-person and absentee, before posting results on the websites.</p>

We are not going to do that, but I do want the law to be more consistent. I do think it is unfair for someone convicted of a bad check to not be able to vote, but someone convicted of child phonography can vote,&#8221; said State Representative Nick Bain. One of the topics that came up during the 90-minute meeting was the idea of expanding on what crimes are eligible for expungement.</p>

She also plans to push for a forensic audit of Virginia’s 2020 election results after spending recent months traveling the country participating in election audit protests like the one she organized outside of the Virginia State Capitol in August. ”While I’m thankful freedom won this election cycle, I’m still fully committed to election integrity,” Chase<a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaChaseVA"> tweeted</a> Wednesday, the day after the Republican statewide ticket swept the Democrats. “Tomorrow, I begin drafting legislation to put the guardrails back on our elections including photo ID to vote. Mail in ballots increase the risk of issues.”</p>

The case is in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “The first time it happened could be a mistake,” the new suit says of claims of election fraud. “The second, third, fourth and fiftieth times it happened were intentional choices.” The suit says OANN had “every opportunity” to do the right thing: “It could have reported the truth. Instead, OANN chose to do the wrong thing every time. It reported a lie.” Before the 2020 election, Smartmatic’s business was valued in excess of $3 billion based on a modest multiplier, the suit says.  “Now … Smartmatic’s business is valued at less than $1 billion. The general and widespread publication and distribution of OANN’s defamatory statements about Smartmatic were a substantial cause of a portion of this business valuation decline.” Smartmatic had previously<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/537377-voting-tech-company-files-27-billion-suit-against-fox-giuliani-and"> filed a $2.7 billion lawsuit</a> against Fox News, Fox News hosts, as well as attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, accusing them of harming the company&#8217;s brand with their accusations of the voting machines&#8217; role in alleged widespread election fraud.</p>

Roger Geisler, a special agent with Brnovich’s major fraud unit, questioned Adrian Fontes, the Democratic former Maricopa County recorder, on Monday about issues stemming from the election. Another investigator also attended the one-hour interview of Fontes, arranged late last week by Geisler. According to The Arizona Republic, it is unclear how far along the probe is or how wide it reaches, but the interview makes clear that Brnovich, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, is taking up an issue that has often dominated GOP politics in the aftermath of Trump’s narrow defeat in Arizona last year. A  spokesperson declined to discuss the matter, saying, &#8220;We cannot comment on any specifics of an ongoing investigation.&#8221; Last week, attorney general officials told The Arizona Republic it had not received any written complaints of election fraud from the Trump campaign, Trump’s lawyer, or key figures from his reelection campaign. Officials did not respond when asked repeatedly whether the office had received any verbal requests.</p>

Swanson filed for an emergency injunction Tuesday morning to stop the Rome City elections, stating that he had not seen evidence that necessary testing on the election machines had been completed. The judge told Swanson that he had to prove irreparable damage has taken place before an injunction could move forward. Representing himself in court, Swanson argued that “if the logic and accuracy testing wasn’t completed as required by law, then the machines that tabulate the vote could be flawed.” Johnson stated that under Georgia law, citizens can contest election results five days after the votes are certified if they feel that the election was corrupted in some way. “If it’s determined through that procedure that the election was impermissibly flawed, it provides that a second election be held,” Johnson said. Since the testing logs were turned over to Swanson to review, he agreed to dismiss the injunction to review the logs. At that point he has the option to go file a complaint after five-day waiting period.</p>

The Dutchess County Supreme Court judge originally decided the site would be split in September, as it was for the 2020 general election, because the county&#8217;s election commissioners could and the decision on a change. Rosa&#8217;s decision has survived a pair of appeals from county Republican Election Commissioner Erik Haight; Democrat Election Commissioner Hannah Black has supported the decision. Bard officials and advocates have pushed to move the site to the campus for years. Bard students, staff and president filed a suit to block Haight from reverting the polling place to where it was in 2019. The elections commissioners agreed on splitting the site in fall 2020 after weeks of last-minute legal arguments in court stemmed around safety and accessibility of the church amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The appeals court this week ruled Haight&#8217;s challenge as &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221;</p>

Eckel dismissed the bulk of the lawsuit ruling that the board of election will continue to oversee Tuesday’s election after putting safeguards in place and correcting the ballot issues. The judge will allow two watchers — one from each political party — to monitor the mail-in ballots in Delaware County for any irregularities. The 670 ballots in question were mailed to addresses that did not match the voter information on the ballot inside. The county said it has taken steps to identify those ballots and send new ones to the voters who received them. Delaware County Solicitor Bill Martin criticized Republicans for attempting to wrestle control of the election out of the hands of the county board of elections over an issue he said had already been “appropriately remedied.”</p>
<p>The supervisor and chief custodian of the Delaware County Voting Machine Warehouse is suing former President Donald Trump, two local GOP poll watchers and others for allegedly making<a href="https://www.delcotimes.com/2021/11/04/delco-election-official-sues-trump-supporters-for-defamation/"> “deliberate, malicious, and defamatory statements and insinuations”</a> about him in the wake of the contentious 2020 Presidential Election. James Savage, of Chester, says his character has been “assassinated at a national level,” that he has suffered health issues and that he has been subjected to threats of physical violence after Trump and his supporters repeatedly made false statements that painted him as a criminal who fraudulently uploaded 50,000 votes for Democratic President Joe Biden during vote tabulations last fall. The suit, filed in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas by attorney J. Conor Corcoran, names Trump, Donald J. Trump for President Inc., former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, and GOP poll watchers Greg Stenstrom of Glen Mills and Leah Hoopes of Chadds Ford as defendants. The lawsuit points to numerous public statements made by the defendants in the wake of the election that were allegedly designed to sow discord and confusion about the results, including a Nov. 25 hearing before Pennsylvania Senate Republicans in Gettysburg and a press conference in Arlington, Va., on Dec. 1. The suit also references an affidavit from Stenstrom in one of several lawsuits filed by Trump seeking to overturn election results and in statements he made on Fox News’ “Hannity” program on Dec. 3, 2020.</p>

The suit, filed last week by the Virginia Institute for Public Policy, said that the office was approving mailed absentee-ballot applications of voters who hadn’t provided the last four digits of their Social Security number, as required by law. It included an affidavit by a woman who said she had seen that more than 300 such applications had been approved. In its written response, the elections office pointed to Virginia law that says such a suit can only be brought by an “aggrieved voter,” a candidate or a candidate’s campaign or party. The Virginia Institute for Public Policy, being a nonprofit corporation, isn’t any of those, and Devine agreed that they didn’t have standing to sue. While the institute said it’s dedicated to fair elections, Devine said that didn’t put them into the category of a party with a direct interest: “Everybody who votes shares that interest.”</p>

This session, Part III of the series, features a conversation among leading social scientists studying disinformation in American elections and our evolving understanding of how disinformation spreads and may be limited. Speakers include: Joan Donavan (Harvard), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmout) and Renee DiResta (Stanford). The event will be moderated by former NPR correspondent Pam Fessler. <strong>When:</strong> November 10; 3:15pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

Some are particularly concerned about the role that the Department of Justice and its Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) played in undermining congressional oversight during the Trump years, when it issued opinions that arguably distorted the separation of powers by brooking no recognition for Congress&#8217;s prerogatives as a co-equal branch. Others are focused on the need to protect and strengthen the roles of Inspectors General after former President Trump fired four IGs in the span of six weeks in what some called a &#8220;dangerous pattern of retaliation&#8221; against federal watchdogs. Recognizing that transparency and oversight is key to democratic survival, what are the best ways to achieve accountability for executive branch transgressions? What role should the Office of Legal Counsel play in reigning in executive branch illegality? And what reforms to the Inspector General system are needed so that these watchdogs can provide the independent nonpartisan oversight they are legislatively required to deliver? Moderated by Josh Gerstein, senior legal affairs reporter with Politico and featuring welcoming remarks from former Sen. Russ Feingold. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 18, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
