							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Exit Interview</strong><br />
<em>NPR’s Pam Fessler set to retire</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7147" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="266" />If you’ve been around the elections world for a hot minute, you know the name Pam Fessler. Fessler is a correspondent on NPR’s National Desk and in addition to reporting on poverty and philanthropy, most importantly for our readers, Fessler covers voting issues.</p>
<p>From hanging chads to The Big Lie<strong>. </strong>From the debate over voter ID to Russian hacking attempts to long lines at the polls, Fessler has covered every aspect of the elections world. You may have spotted her at a conference or two with headphones and microphone hard at work.</p>
<p>After a storied career, Friday July 9 will mark Fessler’s last day at NPR. While our Exit Interviews are usually reserved for elections officials, we thought, given her dedication to the elections world, readers would be interested in hearing what she has to say about covering elections through the years.</p>
<p>“Pam Fessler was covering election administration before covering election administration was ‘cool’—when everyone else was only covering the horserace, she knew that there was so much more to the story,” said Tammy Patrick, senior advisor at the Democracy Fund. “Her approach is one that I often share with those new to the election beat: talk to as many people as you can and make certain that election officials are part of the conversation. The American voter knows more about their democracy because of her coverage, she will be sorely missed.”</p>
<p>Before becoming a correspondent, Fessler was the acting senior editor on the Washington Desk and NPR&#8217;s chief election editor. She coordinated all network coverage of the presidential, congressional, and state elections in 1996 and 1998. In her more than 25 years at NPR, Fessler has also been deputy Washington Desk editor and Midwest National Desk editor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7149" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler3-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler3-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler3-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Fessler became NPR&#8217;s first Homeland Security correspondent. For seven years, she reported on efforts to tighten security at ports, airports, and borders, and the debate over the impact on privacy and civil rights. She also reported on the government&#8217;s response to Hurricane Katrina, The 9/11 Commission Report, Social Security, and the Census. Fessler was one of NPR&#8217;s White House reporters during the Clinton and Bush administrations.</p>
<p>Earlier in her career, she was a senior writer at Congressional Quarterly magazine. Fessler worked there for 13 years as both a reporter and editor, covering tax, budget, and other news. She also worked as a budget specialist at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, and was a reporter at The Record newspaper in Hackensack, New Jersey.</p>
<p>And on behalf of electionline and all of our readers, I’d like to thank Pam for her dedication to our field. We&#8217;ll miss you Pam!</p>
<p><em><strong>There are not too many reporters covering elections at a national level for as long as you have. How did you get started and what made you stick with it through the years?<br />
</strong></em>I think I might be the longest! I was covering the transition from Clinton to Bush for NPR and a big part of that story was what, if anything, the country would do to avoid a repeat of the 2000 election. When Congress began considering the Help America Vote Act, I was the natural choice to cover it. I had also been reporting on the Census and redistricting. And I’m something of a policy nerd (I got my start in Washington reporting for Congressional Quarterly magazine and have a master’s of public administration) so the topic of voting and elections was right up my alley. I found it fascinating, how a country could set up a system where millions of people in very different communities can come together to vote on or around a particular day, and then count those votes accurately.  It&#8217;s a huge logistical and managerial puzzle and an astonishing achievement when it works. Throw in the politics of voting, and it’s a fascinating story.  It was also clear that most Americans didn’t understand how the system worked.  I felt it was very important for me – and NPR &#8212; to report on the process.  And quite frankly, I liked the people involved and I pretty much had the beat to myself. I never wanted to give it up.</p>
<p><em><strong>You developed a reputation in the election community as someone who took the time to become knowledgeable about the nuts and bolts of elections… Even so, there must’ve been some things you didn’t know that surprised you along the way. What comes to mind? </strong></em><br />
What surprised me most when I started was how nonpartisan most election officials are, even though they&#8217;re running what is probably the most political and partisan activity in American life.  Of course, that&#8217;s been changing, especially in recent years.  But for the most part, the overwhelming majority of election officials simply want the system to work. One of the great pleasures of covering this beat has been the willingness of those involved to answer my questions. That&#8217;s not always the case covering government, but I think a lot of those who do elections work are happy to have someone who is interested in what they do and why.</p>
<p>The other big surprise for me was how easily misinformation and disinformation can destroy public confidence. I&#8217;ve always believed that if you sit down and tell people the facts in a clear way, most will say, &#8220;Oh yeah. Now I see.&#8221;  Silly me. The last few years have shown how very wrong I was &#8212; extraordinarily disturbing for someone whose 47-year journalism career has been devoted to presenting the facts so people can better understand the world around them.</p>
<p><em><strong>In your experience, what is the most successful way that election officials have gotten information out to the press/public?  What could election officials do better? </strong></em><br />
The past year has clearly shown how confused people remain about the voting process. The average American doesn’t know the difference between poll workers and poll watchers, and election officials and election boards, who&#8217;s partisan and who’s not. They don&#8217;t understand what happens to their ballots once they’ve voted and how they’re counted. Now, they&#8217;ve been intentionally misled by powerful forces in this country who’ve exploited that ignorance. Election offices have been trying to correct the misinformation, but unfortunately the challenge is so great, they have to be much more aggressive. I think things like CISA’s Rumor Control site and many of the state and local election websites were a good start, but limited – they seem to be communicating largely with those who already trust the system. CISA was further constrained by the fact that it was trying to correct misinformation promulgated by the head of the very government it was a part of.</p>
<p>I think election officials need to get ahead of the misinformation as soon as possible. They need to fact-check lies, but also to take a more proactive, positive approach to telling their story: Here’s what we do, here’s how it works and here’s who we are.  We are public servants who are working to protect one of the fundamental activities of democracy. And this is how we do it. They need to be as accessible and transparent as possible.  Invite reporters and the public in to see what you do. And do it now, before the heat of the mid-term elections. How about more stories telling the public about some of the heroic things election workers did this past year to ensure that Americans could vote during a pandemic? Personal stories always resonate more than simple facts.  Don&#8217;t be shy. The people who are telling the lies aren&#8217;t shy in the slightest.</p>
<p><em><strong>Along that same vein, what recommendations/advice do you have for reporters who are just starting to cover elections more in-depth?  </strong></em><br />
As I mentioned, one of the best things about the voting beat is how willing the people involved, from election officials to interest groups to voters, are to talk. I’d highly recommend spending as much time as possible in an election office and watching what they do so you really understand the process. I also think it’s very important to understand why so many voters lack confidence in our voting system, and where their information and beliefs are coming from. Why do they simply ignore what’s clearly fact? It’s the fundamental question of the day.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that anyone covering this issue be alert for the next, unexpected threat. People always seem to be fighting the last war.  States replaced punch card machines only to discover the new machines had problems of their own. The country geared up to fight foreign interference in elections, only to discover the biggest threat was domestic. Election offices prepared to handle hurricanes and power outages, but then a pandemic arrived.  No one knows what lurks around the corner, but every election there’s been some new, unanticipated challenge. There’s no reason that won’t be the case next year.  Be prepared.</p>
<p><em><strong>After years of toiling away in obscurity, election administration hit the mainstream, above the fold in 2020. What did you see that gave you hope? What concerns do you have? </strong></em><br />
I’ll start with the latter.  The most worrisome concern by far is the volume of violent threats and attacks against election officials and the impact that is having on retaining experienced workers and recruiting new ones. That’s one story I hope reporters on this beat will continue to cover relentlessly. What gives me great hope is that there are now so many talented journalists on this beat, at both the local and national level. In the past, I was often the only reporter at a NASS conference or some other voting-related event.  Now, there are dozens. I have no doubt they will do an incredible job keeping the public informed, especially now that so many more Americans are paying attention.</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s next for you? Writing any new books, perhaps one on election administration? </strong></em><br />
There&#8217;s definitely a lot of material for a great book about the 2020 elections, but probably not by me. Writing a book is a huge undertaking and there are other reporters out there who I think have the skill, knowledge and energy to do a great job. That said, I do hope to use what I know about voting and politics and government to help fix some of the damage that&#8217;s been done by the craziness of the past year &#8212; especially when it comes to public confidence.  We&#8217;ve seen how fragile democracy can be. I haven&#8217;t yet figured out what I’ll do on that front, but hopefully I can contribute. I also plan to continue promoting the book I DID write &#8212;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZTSST1F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"> Carville’s Cure</a> (about leprosy…you have to read it to find out why patients lost their right to vote!) &#8212; and to travel. I have a lot of pent-up desire to get out and about after this pandemic.</p>
<p>One last thing &#8212; thanks so much to Electionline for helping to keep me and many others informed over all these years!</p>

Expanded access to mail-in ballots pushed disability turnout to 17.7 million, up from 16 million in 2016.</p>
<p>“Turnout increases when people with disabilities have more voting options. It’s not ‘one size fits all,’” said Professor Lisa Schur, Co-Director of the Program for Disability Research at Rutgers University. “Many states made it easier to vote during the pandemic, which particularly helped voters with disabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data from the federal government’s Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement for November 2020 to calculate disability turnout. They found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 62% of people with disabilities voted in 2020, up from 56% in 2016.</li>
<li>That’s an increase of 6 points, outpacing the<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDo1HWMOUWDhFGFHix70gcjDW8motRQXdDtjDNllxuOQZ170kJUwun7HbdNzWcYCR-2FZax-2BnuSxosEte1Q36gRvC4l-2FMTWiGotVUAbMKxsnm52b1IN4PSvU2paKu7k0ZBR9UA-3D-3DNG6Z_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpTwWnSLA9oGBpJXohjJau4oRbImBY2RkJaiCDhvU6kMWCezZkzQhsXTMr8xQ0vg4lnDzfdGgzHs9S1m75nNCbdnq5YwAq-2FQ6YsgIKW7va9cctp6MbdZxqk03Sm88BNfS7PzVqb8TR535jsyL63hSVsBwS6f-2B7uE-2FRWCJz0InjFS7cM40Tc7fqe4VFO8Q0XcvnGTcgUK4L9q8ozz36n-2B-2FDKW7twEG0ZkcyuzqQFp4dRVJH-2F0DdilH1c2Gsvs0FjSLO-2BRdqwnX4FDcXMEOYmllJTw-3D-3D"> historic increase</a> of 5 points among people without disabilities.</li>
<li>Higher turnout was reported across all disability types and demographic groups.</li>
<li>The turnout gap between people with and without disabilities was relatively unchanged.</li>
<li>More than 53% of people with disabilities voted by mail, compared to 42% of people without disabilities.</li>
<li>Just 26% of people with disabilities and 31% of people without disabilities voted at a polling place on Election Day.</li>
<li>The 23 states that made it easier to vote by mail appeared to have a higher increase in disability turnout, though the difference is within the margin of error.</li>
</ul>
<p>An estimated 1.95 million people with disabilities had trouble voting in 2020, but accessibility was significantly improved compared to previous elections.<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDo-2FXMXBpm4TwHPzR99czw1W4aczmZquE6Au1Y1u87uo2s4TDRhgYbg2mgCSK7AYOkKxXOL6-2FFj7Jfw4nK0p7TGSWIM-2BuVhPUblA5LhtkbocSjlA1HLQIgD3nN1i3q9RQ-2Bhq5Y1w5778yBIKkDiw8IiT0-3DFQwt_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpTwWnSLA9oGBpJXohjJau4oRbImBY2RkJaiCDhvU6kMWCezZkzQhsXTMr8xQ0vg4lnDzfdGgzHs9S1m75nNCbdnq5YwAq-2FQ6YsgIKW7va9cdt9gHYNFxENeGobM-2F2AZ6XCYuShfZra2-2FqAhvl52oyKXA3-2Fukms2doX5J7bcBj-2BVQVJzf4SmIhYLB37Qmv-2BDnVPSsjJrwOsj8rUhgRcU92o-2Fmdkm0I6jbvDgeKeNG7-2FolalKKchHHSsmaUaJ1I1LOtVY-2F3ZwxPdwcKZSl9W8VucA-3D-3D"> An earlier study</a>, commissioned by the EAC under clearinghouse and research mandates outlined in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), found:</p>
<ul>
<li>11% of people with disabilities had trouble voting in 2020, down from 26% in 2012.</li>
<li>5% of people with disabilities experienced difficulties voting by mail, compared to 18% of those who voted at a polling place.</li>
<li>Voters with disabilities were still almost twice as likely as voters without disabilities to report difficulties.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Despite the barriers that people with disabilities face, they turn out to vote when motivated,” said Distinguished Professor Douglas Kruse, Co-Director of the Program for Disability Research at Rutgers University. “The decrease in voting difficulties over the past eight years is very positive and reflects well on efforts by the Election Assistance Commission and election officials, helping ensure that people with disabilities are fully included in our democracy.”</p>
<p>The EAC is encouraged by the reported decrease in barriers and increase in voter participation by people with disabilities. The data released today will help the EAC improve and inform resources and guidance materials while measuring the progress made by election officials as they serve voters with disabilities.</p>
<p>“Election officials across the country work hard to provide accessible options to voters as they register and vote. We are happy to see that progress is being made but there is still room for improvement for future elections,” said Donald Palmer, Chairman of the EAC. “This data is critical for officials as they consider new voting technologies, options for voters to cast a ballot, and as they address the growing accessibility needs of an aging demographic. The EAC is continually working to improve accessibility and to ensure an independent and private vote for all.”</p>

Now local elections officials are making the dash to September. &#8220;We immediately started contacting our vendors, making sure we have enough supplies materials even ballot paper to be able to accommodate this election and mail ballots to all registered voters,&#8221; said Courtney Bailey-Kanelos,<a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/busy-weeks-ahead-counties-prepare-california-gubernatorial-recall-election/36917561"> Sacramento County</a> Registrar of Voters.  Bailey-Kanelos is also working to find vote center locations since they&#8217;ll be open starting on Labor Day. The tight schedule is causing additional concerns. &#8220;We are actually concerned about the supplies including the ballot paper. We obviously don&#8217;t know yet how many candidates are actually going to file so we are waiting for that number to see what size paper to order,&#8221; Bailey-Kanelos said.<a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/dash-to-september-county-clerks-campaigns-getting-ready-for-the-recall-election/"> Fresno County</a> Clerk James Kus says, for most elections, his office will start preparing six months in advance. “It’s going to be tight, but we will get it done,” Kus said. “We have 74 days from today for Sept. 14, and we’ve begun all of our processes already.” In<a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2021/jul/02/san-diego-county-registrar-makes-plans-recall-elec/"> San Diego County</a>, the registrar’s office has already started reaching out to poll workers and poll locations who served in the November 2020 election.  They are also planning on having approximately 200 “super poll” locations open for four-days of voting. “We are, as all of us are, scrambling,” said Donna Johnston, the president of the<a href="https://fox40.com/inside-california-politics/california-elections-officials-scramble-to-ready-recall-election-within-shortened-timeframe/"> California Association of Clerks and Elections Officials</a>. “It’s a little earlier than we had hoped for.” Before the date was set, the association told state leaders that Sept. 14 would be the earliest possible day they could logistically hold the election, and now with the date confirmed, the clock is ticking. “We are all working very diligently to secure our locations, now that we have a date, to secure our poll workers, to work with our printers to make sure that our materials are printed on time and that ballots are delivered to voters in time,” Johnston said.</p>

At the same time, there was broad agreement that people should have to show identification when they go to the polls. Two-thirds of Americans also believe democracy is &#8220;under threat&#8221; but likely for very different reasons. &#8220;For Democrats, Jan. 6 undoubtedly looms large,&#8221; said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, referring to the violence and insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, &#8220;while, for Republicans, it&#8217;s more likely about [former President Donald] Trump and his claims of a rigged election.&#8221; By a 56% to 41% margin, survey respondents said making sure that everyone who wants to vote can do so is a bigger concern than making sure that no one who is ineligible votes. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans said they believe voters should be required to show government-issued photo identification whenever they vote. Not surprisingly opinions about voter access and voter ID varied by party.</p>

At HeadCount.org/SaveTheVote, users will find a listing of what’s happening in all 50 states. To access that information, “they first play a little guessing game,” the announcement says, by predicting where their state ranks in how easy it is to vote. Then — after selecting their state on an interactive map — they’ll learn about pending or recently passed voting legislation in their home state. Visitors can also learn about how voting rights impact specific nonpartisan issues such as Criminal Justice, Racism and Discrimination, Jobs and the Economy, and LGBTQ+ rights. Lil Dicky, Big Freedia, Dead and Company, Amy Lee of Evanescence, Ministry, Michael Franti, Kam Franklin of The Suffers, Shah, and  Dozens of musicians and cultural leaders will participate, with many directly calling their own elected officials and capturing those moments on social media videos, HeadCount announced the new initiative on the 50th anniversary of the 26th Amendment. “50 years ago, our country gave electoral power to the youth vote at a time when we knew their voices could no longer be silenced,” said Andy Bernstein, HeadCount’s executive director, “and today, we are bringing young Americans and their favorite musicians into the national conversation about voting rights.”</p>

The alliance prioritizes policies that enhance the voting experience, inspire confidence in election results, and foster collaboration and bipartisanship in our governing institutions, especially Congress. The four founding members of the alliance are Citi, CVS Health, Delta Air Lines, and Southern Company. The companies comprising the alliance believe the private sector can play a positive role in supporting election laws that make voting easier and maintain security, crucial steps to rebuilding confidence in elections. “In 2020, our nation’s election officials overcame tremendous obstacles and enabled more people to vote than ever before. It is critical that policymakers come together in a bipartisan manner to ensure the right to vote is protected and facilitated for all Americans,” said BPC President Jason Grumet. “Our economy depends upon an effective democracy. It is encouraging to see business leaders rise to meet this challenge in the interest of their employees, customers, and communities.” The alliance encourages policymakers to refocus the debate on election administration innovations that both parties can support, that state and local election officials can reasonably implement, and which will help all voters cast their ballots. Voters should have access to early, mail-in, and in-person voting options, and the entire process must be secured from end-to-end if leaders expect Americans to trust the results. Our country achieves both goals when policymakers work in concert with election administrators who must implement the policies on the ground.</p>

Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park) drafted &#8220;to advance voter equity&#8221;<a href="https://patch.com/california/across-ca/voter-access-bills-peninsula-state-senator-advance-assembly"> advanced in the state Assembly</a>, his office announced. Senate Bill 503, which would implement a uniform statewide signature verification standard for mail-in ballots, passed the Assembly Elections Committee in a 6-1 vote and will head to the Appropriations Committee.  SB 503 would require timely outreach to voters whose ballots are rejected. For a ballot to be rejected because of an invalid signature, elections officials would need to determine &#8220;beyond a reasonable doubt&#8221; when comparing signatures that they do not match. It would also prohibit elections officials from taking a voter&#8217;s party preference, race or ethnicity into consideration when comparing signatures.  Senate Bill 504, which would take steps to ensure that those who have been released from incarceration would not inadvertently be removed from voter rolls, was approved by the committee unanimously and will head to the Public Safety Committee. SB 504 would also ensure that members of the military, California residents living overseas and those living with disabilities would have the same access to remote same-day voter registration as other residents.</p>

James Moylan’s Bill 120 is signed into law. It would allow for a 30-day window, prior to Election Day, for residents to come in and cast their ballots. Early voting is an option for those who can&#8217;t vote on Election Day, but the bill waives the requirement. The measure could help drive up Guam’s voter turnout, Guam Election Commission Director Maria Pangelinan told lawmakers June 22.</p>

LaShawn Ford (D) announced his plans to introduce a bill that will call<a href="https://chicagocrusader.com/representative-ford-to-introduce-new-id-voter-card-bill-for-easier-voting-access/"> for voter registration cards to include a photo ID</a>. “I am filing a bill to make the voter’s registration card official with a photo ID,” Ford told the Crusader. The problem, Ford said, is that every state has different election laws. He is hoping his bill can be a national model to make it easier, not more restrictive, for voters to cast their votes. Ford said his bill is also important because “our voter registration card would be an official ID for people in prison. They can leave prison with an official Illinois ID,” he said. “If a person can’t afford a traditional ID card, an official registration card with a photo seems like a smart approach.” While marshaling support for his proposed bill, Ford said he would introduce it during the October veto session.</p>

John Bel Edwards announced that he vetoed 28 of the 505 bills the Louisiana Legislature sent him during the 2021 legislative session<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/07/02/louisiana-gov-john-bel-edwards-vetoes-bills-related-to-vaccines-emergency-powers-and-elections/"> including several elections-related bills</a>. Edwards House Bill 138, sponsored by Rep. Les Farnum (R-Sulphur), requires voter registrars to conduct a “supplemental annual canvas” of all voters and purge the voter registration rolls of any residents who move without updating their voter registration with their current address. It would have placed such voters on an inactive list until the registrar confirmed their new addresses. In vetoing the bill, Edwards said each parish’s registrar of voters is already required to conduct an annual canvas of all registered voters. The “supplemental annual canvas” is “repetitive and unnecessary,” he wrote and creates a “significant unfunded mandate” on the secretary of state. House Bill 704, sponsored by Rep. Valarie Hodges (R-Denham Springs), would allow a political party to place a poll watcher in every precinct on election day and place “super watchers” in every parish. The watchers and super watchers would be appointed by the state central committee of each political party with at least 25% of the registered voters in the state.  Edwards also vetoed Senate Bill 63, sponsored by Sen. Robert Mills (R-Minden).  Minden said he intended his bill to clarify current law by allowing a voter to hand deliver an absentee ballot to any employee at the registrar’s main office, branch or early voting location. “However, as finally passed, it is now unclear as to whether hand delivery can only take place during the period for conducting early voting or whether hand delivery can take place at an early voting location if it is during the time period for conducting early voting. Access to voting is too important for this uncertainty, and so I have vetoed this bill,” Edwards wrote. Sen. Heather Cloud (R-Ville Platte) said her Senate Bill 220 was in the name of so-called “election integrity.” It would have required the legislative auditor to conduct annual audits of elections. The bill is an unnecessary “expansion of government” that creates separation of power issues, Edwards wrote. He said “there has been no legitimate allegation that statutory election processes have not been followed.” Senate Bill 224, another bill that Sen. Cloud said would bolster “election integrity” would have required voters to include the last four digits of their social security number or driver’s license number on the outside of an absentee mail ballot envelope.  That same information would be required for a voter sending an application for an absentee ballot. Edwards said the bill “would require more stringent requirements to make application to vote absentee by mail than what is currently required to actually vote absentee by mail.” The governor said the bill was hastily drafted and “without proper debate.  He said, “Louisiana election law being changed overnight and without proper vetting is an incredible disservice to the people of the state.”</p>

MassGOP Chairman Jim Lyons, a former state representative, announced the campaign in a Sunday, July 4 email in which he put out the call for at least 2,000 volunteers to help gather enough signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot. Petitioners must collect an initial round of 80,239 voter signatures by early December, and a second round of 13,374 signatures next spring in order to keep their petitions on the 2022 ballot track.</p>
<p>The Lowell city council voted unanimously to send a<a href="https://www.lowellsun.com/2021/07/06/lowell-city-council-approves-home-rule-petition-to-expand-voting-options/"> home-rule petition</a> to the Legislature seeking to continue one-week in-person early voting, no-excuse mail-in voting and drop-box options that were used due to the coronavirus pandemic. The vote immediately followed an Election Laws/Redistricting Subcommittee meeting held earlier in the evening where councilors heard from several residents and candidates for office who oppose a proposed plan to temporarily reduce the city’s polling locations from 13 to eight for the 2021 preliminary and general municipal elections.</p>

The signature requirement was not in the original proposal by Sen. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, but Republican lawmakers in the state House added it. In an interview, Barrett said he believes a consensus has been reached in favor of dropping the policy and moving forward with a focus on photo ID alone. &#8220;It’s just simpler to have people bring their ID,&#8221; Barrett said. &#8220;If they don’t have their ID, we’re going to make them available for free.&#8221; Barrett&#8217;s legislation is part of the 39-bill Senate Republican package to overhaul Michigan&#8217;s voting laws after the 2020 presidential election. It&#8217;s already passed the Senate and the House but because of the changes made in the House, it will have to be voted on again.</p>

The GOP trio &#8212; including Republican National Committeewoman Lydia Brasch of West Point, a former state senator, and former Douglas County Republican Chairwoman Nancy McCabe of Omaha &#8212; filed an initiative petition with the secretary of state&#8217;s office launching the Citizens for Voter ID drive. The proposal would place the issue on the 2022 general election ballot in the form of a constitutional amendment. Supporters of the initiative said they expect to begin collecting petition signatures in August.</p>

Tom Wolf last week<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/spl/pa-election-overhaul-voter-id-wolf-veto-20210630.html"> vetoed the bill he wrote</a>. “It is over until we get a new governor,” Rep. Seth Grove (R., York), chair of the House State Government Committee and author of<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-republican-election-bill-voter-id-20210610.html"> the proposed Republican election overhaul</a>, said in an interview late last week. That would leave the state’s election system effectively unchanged for next year’s nationally watched open-seat races for governor and U.S. Senate. And it leaves local elections officials in both parties across Pennsylvania without the two things they have consistently pleaded for: earlier processing of mail ballots, which would avoid prolonged vote counts as the world saw last year, and an extension of tight mail-ballot deadlines that don’t align with Postal Service standards and leave thousands of voters unable to return them on time. “We’ll still be in the same boat. We’ll just use the same paddles to row further,” said Karen Barsoum, the Chester County elections director. “It’s unfortunate that there were clear areas that could have been improved upon, that we had basically the whole year to prepare for the next big election.”</p>

Andrew Murr, R-Junction, does not contain highly controversial provisions making it easier for judges to overturn elections or limiting early voting hours on Sundays. However, many elements of the original GOP elections package remain intact. They include bans on drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting, and criminal penalties for election officials who proactively send out vote-by-mail applications — methods that were pioneered by Harris County in 2020 for greater convenience during the coronavirus pandemic. The bill also still contains limitations on early voting hours, new ID requirements for those who vote by mail, and provisions affording “free movement” to partisan poll watchers at polling places.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona</strong>: A federal judge erred when he<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/tossing-unsigned-ballots-on-election-day-ok-arizona-tells-ninth-circuit/"> blocked Arizona county recorders from throwing out unsigned ballots</a> at the end of Election Day, attorneys for the state and the Republican Party told a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel this week. “Arizona, like three other states, allows curing until polls close,” said Drew Ensign of the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, referring to the process of verifying ballot signatures. “That is an eminently reasonable practice and more generous than a majority of states.” The appeal stems from a June 2020 lawsuit in which the Arizona Democratic Party, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic National Committee asked the court for a permanent injunction to stop the state from throwing out the ballots. The plaintiffs eventually won the case against Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and the 15 county recorders. But ballots with no signatures are tossed if they aren’t cured by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Claiming the restriction disenfranchises thousands of voters, the plaintiffs are asking for five days after Election Day to cure unsigned ballots. In a letter to the court last week, the state of Arizona, an intervenor appellant, reiterated its position that the state voting system, which includes wide access to mailed ballots and three weeks of early in-person voting, as well as Election Day polling places, inherently protect voting rights. In the context of this system, tossing unsigned ballots is not an undue burden on anyone, the state argued. U.S. Circuit Judge A. Wallace Tashima questioned whether the state should treat these ballots differently from other ballots with mistakes, such as mismatched signatures. Yes, Ensign said.</p>

Boulee<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-rejects-attempt-to-stop-parts-of-georgia-voting-law/B5F4HCEG4FDWBNCHOKDC3TYN44/"> denied an effort to invalidate parts of Georgia’s voting law</a>, the first court ruling upholding new rules passed after last year’s elections. Boulee wrote in his order that he wouldn’t “change the law in the ninth inning” amid ongoing runoffs for the state House. Boulee reserved judgment about future elections. The<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/lawsuit-seeks-to-stop-local-election-takeovers-in-georgia-voting-law/WXE3YQHEHZEKZCPHQBBB7DA2N4/"> lawsuit</a> by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election security organization, opposed new requirements that voters request absentee ballots at least 11 days before election day, a deadline that limited the time available to vote by mail in the runoffs. The case also asked for court intervention to prevent restrictions on election observation. “Election administrators have prepared to implement the challenged rules, have implemented them at least to some extent and now would have to grapple with a different set of rules in the middle of the election,” Boulee wrote in an 11-page order. “The risk of disrupting the administration of an ongoing election &#8230; outweigh the alleged harm to plaintiffs at this time.” The plaintiffs had sought an injunction to halt enforcement of the voting law,<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/bills/SB/202"> Senate Bill 202</a>, which Gov. Brian Kemp<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/bill-changing-georgia-voting-rules-passes-state-house/EY2MATS6SRA77HTOBVEMTJLIT4/"> signed</a> March 25. Though Boulee ruled against the plaintiffs’ request for immediate action, the underlying lawsuit against Georgia’s voting law remains pending in federal court. The judge’s order relied on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said courts generally shouldn’t change existing rules when elections are imminent. Known as the Purcell principle, based on the 2006 case Purcell v. Gonzalez, the court found that altering election rules could bewilder voters and discourage them from participating.</p>

The law created a new process for people to prove that they are residents of New Hampshire if they registered to vote within 30 days of an election or on Election Day without a photo ID. The state&#8217;s highest court agreed with a 2020 Superior Court ruling that the new requirements and forms involved in the process are confusing, could deter people from registering and voting and &#8220;imposes unreasonable burdens on the right to vote.&#8221; “We affirm the trial court’s ruling that SB3 violates<a href="https://www.nh.gov/glance/bill-of-rights.htm"> Part I, Article 11 of the New Hampshire Constitution</a>,” Associate Justice Patrick Donovan wrote in a unanimous, 4-0 opinion. The constitutional article cited guarantees each &#8220;inhabitant&#8221; of the state 18 years of age and older an &#8220;equal right to vote.&#8221; The court concluded that, given the burdens, Senate Bill 3 “must be stricken in its entirety”</p>

The move means the election commission will not seek at least $6,000 in legal cost that 4 Good Government may be responsible for if the group loses the case. The petition group-backed referendum – a controversial attempt to restrict Metro government’s power over future property tax increases, among other initiatives – was<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/03/anti-tax-referendum-nashville-judge-keeps-petition-off-ballot/6134879002/"> struck down by a judge</a> last year. While the petition failed, other claims included in the lawsuit remain unresolved, said Election Commission Chairman Jim DeLanis. The election commission offered to settle the case in April with each party covering its own expenses and attorney&#8217;s fees, court documents show.</p>

<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257">Election Audit Specialist</a>, VotingWorks— VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair. We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment. About the Job: Your goal is to make election administrators successful when running Arlo, VotingWorks’ risk-limiting audit software, to conduct risk-limiting election audits. You succeed when these election administrators succeed in delighting audit board members, voters, and the public. You’ll need to become very skilled with the Arlo software, the VotingWorks voting machines and general risk-limiting audit procedures. You’ll support election administrators and audit board members with tier 1 support (basic software and procedure questions) that includes light training and troubleshooting in preparation for and during audit conduct remotely. Occasionally, you’ll be asked to provide the same support in-person. Your enthusiasm for the product, the process, the mission, and the team should be infectious, surpassed only by your organizational skills and ability to multitask. You know that no matter how robust a technology, at the end of the day it’s people who make other people successful and you feel personally responsible for ensuring that everyone who uses Arlo feels successful. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257"> click here</a>.</p>
