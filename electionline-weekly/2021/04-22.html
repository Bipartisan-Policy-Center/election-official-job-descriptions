							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Stewards of Democracy</strong><br />
<em>Understanding career journeys of local election officials and anticipating potential shortages</em></p>
<p>By  Paul Gronke, Paul Manson, Jay Lee, and Heather Creek</p>
<p>A modern, trusted, and equitable U.S. election system depends not just on laws or administrative procedures, but on people who are pivotal to delivering democracy: local election officials. In this post we examine the career trajectories, job satisfaction rates, and retirement plans of those playing this important role. Our research found generally good news about the experience and satisfaction of this workforce. We also found a few points of concern — specifically the significant proportion of local election officials eligible for retirement before the next general election.</p>
<p>Findings are based on survey and interview responses from more than 850 individuals who serve as chief local election officials — those in charge of elections in their jurisdiction — across the country. Whenever interpreting information about local election administration and administrators, it is important to pay attention to differences by jurisdiction size. For our analysis, we often present data sorted in this way, and all means are weighted to represent the overall population of local election officials. See the Reed College<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo-survey-summary/"> Early Voting Information Center website</a> for further survey results broken down by jurisdiction size.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Variation in Scope and Staffing</strong><br />
The specific array of election officials’ responsibilities varies enormously across states and between jurisdictions of different sizes. In the largest jurisdictions, these professionals are full-time officials, compensated with six-figure salaries and running operations with hundreds or even thousands of permanent staff, and they administer elections to millions of eligible citizens.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, more than one-third of officials tell us that their jobs are less than full-time and that they are responsible for far more than just administering elections. Notably, over half of our respondents (and by implication, half of local election officials nationwide) told us that their “staff” consists of only one person — that is, themselves.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of jurisdictions serving fewer than 5,000 registered voters have only one staff member working in the elections office, and 25 percent of jurisdictions serving between 5,000 and 25,000 voters have only one elections staffer. In the largest jurisdictions, by contrast, almost 85 percent of elections offices have 10 or more staff members — and many have more than 50.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6868" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph1-1024x720.png" alt="" width="640" height="450" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph1-1024x720.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph1-300x211.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph1-768x540.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph1.png 1356w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Paths to Becoming a Local Election Official</strong><br />
The path to leadership as a local election official<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx"> differs across and within states</a>. It also differs by jurisdiction size as illustrated below. Whether officials are elected versus appointed is the most basic difference, but elected officials may also vary in whether they run for partisan versus non-partisan positions. Of note,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X12472365"> research has shown</a> that how officials are selected can be influential in shaping their incentives and policy goals.</p>
<p>While over half of local election officials are elected to their positions, less than 20 percent of these officials in the largest jurisdictions are elected. Among local election officials who are elected, 61 percent are elected in partisan elections, while the other 39 percent hold non-partisan positions. Our overall estimate of the percentage of local election officials who are elected versus appointed closely matches estimates obtained from surveys conducted by the<a href="https://electioncenter.org/electionresources/documents/CRS-RL32938%206-23-05.pdf"> Congressional Research Service</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6869" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph2-1024x721.png" alt="" width="640" height="451" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph2-1024x721.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph2-300x211.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph2-768x541.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph2.png 1378w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Among officials who are appointed, those appointments may be made by county commissioners, a chief executive, or by elections boards or commissions, which themselves can be elective or appointive. Finally, appointive positions may or may not have civil service protections.</p>
<p>The responses in our survey indicate that the community of local election officials is highly experienced. The median official has been working in elections for over 12 years, having started in 2008. Local election officials in larger jurisdictions have a slightly longer tenure than those in smaller jurisdictions. Less than 5 percent of survey respondents reported that they had been working in election administration less than a year, and just over 10 percent said they had been in their current position for a year or less.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6870" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph3-1024x491.png" alt="" width="640" height="307" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph3-1024x491.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph3-300x144.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph3-768x368.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph3.png 1398w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>While local election officials in larger jurisdictions reported slightly longer tenures, those from smaller jurisdictions reported that they were older. Seventy-six percent of local election officials in jurisdictions serving under 5,000 voters are over age 50, while 60 percent of those in jurisdictions serving over 250,000 voters are over that age. In combination with findings about tenure, this would seem to indicate that officials in larger jurisdictions are starting in the elections field earlier in life than those in smaller jurisdictions, thus gaining more job experience at a younger age. Based on available data, it seems likely that a significant number of local election officials working in larger jurisdictions served previously in smaller- or medium-sized jurisdictions in something of a career “pipeline.” We do know that large jurisdictions with appointed election officials often conduct national searches for replacements. What is less well known is the breadth and diversity of these search pools.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6871" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph4-1024x672.png" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph4-1024x672.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph4-300x197.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph4-768x504.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph4.png 1356w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I took a part-time job in our community — we’re in a small town — working with what is like our chamber of commerce. Did that for 10 years, being active with the community… that led to me eventually running for office here, trying to have a voice in the direction of our community.” – LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL, ELECTED POSITION</em></p>
<p>Local election officials in smaller jurisdictions are more than twice as likely as those in the largest jurisdictions to have no prior elections experience before starting their current job as the chief local election official.</p>
<p>The types of jobs and activities that current local election officials worked on before entering the elections field can also inform our understanding of the career pipeline. Our survey respondents were most likely (39 percent) to say that they were working in the private sector (non-elections related) before entering election administration. Another 21 percent said they had other roles in local government, and 13 percent were elected officials serving in roles other than election administration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6872" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph5-1024x932.png" alt="" width="640" height="583" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph5-1024x932.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph5-300x273.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph5-768x699.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph5.png 1358w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Before this, my experience varied from construction to working in law offices… I worked in the office under the previous clerk as a part-time employee, then bumped up to full-time employee while working another full-time job. The previous clerk passed away in office and another deputy finished the term and then I ran and won the election.” – LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL</em></p>
<p>As we think about career pathways, we must realize that for many local election officials, there isn’t a dedicated “career track” to follow into this profession. Larger jurisdictions might train up their assistant elections director or actively pursue outside candidates to replace a retiring official, while in a smaller jurisdiction an outgoing election official might be replaced by a first-time elected clerk with no previous elections experience.</p>
<p><strong>Job Satisfaction Among Local Election Officials</strong><br />
For all the diverse pathways and job responsibilities involved, there is remarkable agreement that being a local election official is a rewarding career. Among our respondents, 55 percent said that they were “satisfied” with their job, and another 37 percent said they were “very satisfied.” This holds true regardless of the jurisdiction size.</p>
<p>An important caveat for all of our findings on job satisfaction is that the survey was conducted prior to the November 2020 election, which saw death threats and other attacks directed at local election officials. We asked these questions during the summer of 2020, when dedicated officials may have felt determined to stay focused on the positive aspects of their work. Perspectives on satisfaction may have shifted by November.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>“There’s something at the end of the day, knowing the most fundamental aspect of our country was carried out from president to school board. …We had a transition of power, and people had faith in the results, in the votes counted being valid.” – LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6873" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph6-1024x915.png" alt="" width="640" height="572" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph6-1024x915.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph6-300x268.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph6-768x686.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph6.png 1482w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Across most questions probing specific areas of job satisfaction, there was very little disparity between local election officials serving in jurisdictions of different sizes. When grouped by size of jurisdiction, all groups on average agreed with about eight or nine of the 14 statements indicating satisfaction.</p>
<p>When asked how they feel about specific facets of their job, respondents unsurprisingly presented more varied opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Election offices on the local level should have more support. We are expected to give a herculean effort without the proper resources in space, employees, and equipment. We sacrifice our own health in order to make sure everything goes smoothly.” – LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL, SMALLER JURISDICTION</em></p>
<p>Overall, approximately 50 percent of local election officials surveyed said that they were satisfied with their pay. Still, it’s important to understand that this high rate of pay satisfaction is uneven; when we isolate the responses of those from the largest jurisdictions, the figure jumps to 74 percent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6874" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph7-1024x600.png" alt="" width="640" height="375" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph7-1024x600.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph7-300x176.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph7-768x450.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph7.png 1378w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>When we further probe into the elements of local election officials’ job satisfaction we find a few concerns. For example, resources and funding are a pain point, with over half of local election officials agreeing with the statement, “a lack of sufficient funding prevents me from doing my job well.” Local election officials share issues about their personal work experience as well. For example, less than 45 percent said that their workload was “reasonable.” Managing work-life balance is also a problem. While overall, most local election officials share that they are able to balance work and home priorities, the larger the jurisdiction is, the more this is a reported challenge.</p>
<p>It is important to note that 25 percent of respondents neither agreed nor disagreed with the question of balancing work and home priorities. To explore this further, we framed the question a different way. When asked if they agree with the statement, “I am able to leave problems at work,” local election officials surface more worries. Almost half of respondents said they agreed that they could leave problems at work, and 42 percent disagreed with the statement. In the responses to both of these questions, we see that for larger jurisdictions, balancing the stresses of work is harder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m exceeding my capacity for dealing with it. I’m tired, constantly. It’s stressful. I go home and crash, get up and do it again the next day. I think all election officials right now are kind of in that same boat. Presidential elections are always stressful but this one seems hyper stressful, at least to me personally.” – LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL</em></p>
<p>Combining the pandemic with heightened political pressure, misinformation, and staffing concerns, the 2020 election created a uniquely stressful environment for local election officials. Some expressed this during interviews conducted in fall 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Plans for Leaving the Field</strong><br />
Having an experienced body of local election officials is important to maintaining administrative competencies, knowledge of state laws and local procedures, as well as an intimate familiarity with the local electorate.</p>
<p>This local election official population is older, with many nearing retirement. Indeed, 74 percent of chief local election officials are over age 50, and a quarter are over age 65. Almost 35 percent report that they’re eligible to retire before the next presidential election in 2024, and this figure is more than 50 percent among local election officials in the largest jurisdictions. It should be noted that among those eligible to retire in the next four years, only 45 percent said that they planned on doing so. Even so, this expected wave of retirements diminishes today’s population of local election officials by 16 percent. When we asked those who were planning to retire to tell us their motivations for doing so, the top three reasons shared were a desire to move on to something else in their life (37 percent); that they had served long enough to retire (35 percent); and the political environment (23 percent). In addition, 20 percent noted they “no longer enjoy the position” or “want to do something else for work.”</p>
<p>Of the local election officials that are not eligible to retire soon, we asked whether they were planning to leave the field otherwise. Only 10 percent said yes, but a quarter responded that they were “unsure.” Similar to those planning for retirement, the most common reason they gave was a desire to move on to something else in their life (33 percent). But notably, job satisfaction concerns like the desire to move to a position with a better work-life balance (29 percent), desire to do something else for work (25 percent), and no longer enjoying the work (20 percent) were cited more often than, for example, the political environment, which factored more significantly into retirement decisions.</p>
<p>When we take into account those planning to retire and planning to leave for other reasons, the numbers give us pause. Overall, 22 percent of respondents said that they were planning on leaving the profession in the next four years, 49 percent said they weren’t planning on leaving, and 29 percent said they were unsure.</p>
<p>Most worrisome, local election officials in the largest jurisdictions were almost twice as likely to say that they’re planning to leave in the next four years. These officials have large and presumably experienced staff but very little is known about planned transitions in leadership. Local election official turnover in the largest jurisdictions has the potential to impact a huge number of American voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6875" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph8-1024x511.png" alt="" width="640" height="319" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph8-1024x511.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph8-300x150.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph8-768x383.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewserGraph8.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In survey follow-up interviews, local election officials were asked to discuss what transition-planning looks like in their jurisdiction. Few of them — whether elected or appointed — said they have formal transition plans or documented procedures in place for their eventual successors. Most said that they expect their second-in command (e.g., deputy clerk, assistant manager) to take over the role when they leave the position.</p>
<p><strong>Paying Attention to the Pipeline</strong><br />
Given that more than half of all local election officials have served over a decade in their positions and express overall high levels of satisfaction with the job, there is much positive news about this field of professionals at the front lines of democracy. Still, traditional pain points — budgets, facilities, and compensation — remain, supporting assertions by many that the field is undervalued and under-resourced.</p>
<p>Further, with half of local election officials from the largest jurisdictions reporting that they are qualified for retirement, the shape and composition of the pipeline of talent to support this work is an important topic for future investigation. This means paying close attention to retirement and other turnover, as well as the degree to which these positions are filled by people who are diverse, experienced, and capable of playing this vital role.</p>

According to StateScoop,  In a<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/newsRoom/pressReleases/2021/20210414LetterCISA.pdf"> letter</a> to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Brandon Wales, CISA acting director, the officials thanked the agency for its efforts fighting false claims during the 2020 election — such as the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol"> Rumor Control</a> website, on which CISA published rebuttals of foreign, and later domestic, disinformation and misinformation about voting procedures and election equipment. But the election officials also said that the heavy circulation of these rumors sowed distrust that continues today. “There have been some good and bad days in the election community since November. On one hand, election officials successfully ran multiple elections during a pandemic,” the letter reads. “The general election was the most secure in recent history. On the other hand, because of disinformation, some Americans now lack confidence in the electoral process.” The letter was led by Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, and signed by the chief election officials in Alaska, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.</p>

The investigation “revealed that these allegations and others are based largely upon an incomplete assessment of voter registration records and lack of information concerning the processes by which these records are compiled and maintained,” said Deputy Secretary for Elections Mark Wlaschin in a letter on behalf of Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske released Wednesday. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the state party initially filed a complaint with nearly 123,000 individual records of alleged fraud. Cegavske’s office initially whittled that number down to less than 4,000, many of them already under investigation by her office. While the state GOP “raises policy concerns about the integrity of mail-in voting, automatic voter registration, and same-day voter registration, these concerns do not amount to evidentiary support for the contention that the 2020 general election was plagued by widespread voter fraud,” Wlaschin wrote in a letter accompanying an 11-page detailed report of the office’s findings.</p>

But some parts of the law earned bipartisan support or condemnation. Voters overwhelmingly back weekend early voting options but they oppose a ban on giving food and drinks to voters waiting in line, and they object to allowing the state to take over underperforming county election offices. There was widespread support for mandatory Saturday and optional Sunday voting during the state’s three-week early voting period before general elections, with about three-quarters of voters approving of both. The law requires all counties to offer early voting on two Saturdays, a provision that will cover about 40% of the state’s voters who live in mostly rural areas that didn’t previously offer voting on a second Saturday. The poll of 887 voters was conducted by UGA’s School of Public and International Affairs from March 31 to April 19. It has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.</p>

The Elections, Motor Vehicle, and Recording Divisions will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays. “We originally decided to try the pilot program after lengthy conversations with other clerk and recorder offices in the metro area who had positive feedback from the public and staff after similar 4-day expanded weekday schedules,&#8221; Boulder County Clerk Molly Fitzpatrick said in a statement. We started it as a pilot here in Boulder County, as we wanted to then gauge our public and staff response to the new days and hours of operation,&#8221; Fitzpatrick said. &#8220;After two months in, we surveyed staff and the response was overwhelmingly in support of continuing the new schedule. Additionally, the public response has been substantially more positive than negative. The main feedback we&#8217;ve heard from residents is how they can now get to our office for quick trips before going to work themselves.&#8221; Fitzpatrick&#8217;s staff said that under this schedule, most employees will work four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days. The four-day schedule also provides a window of time immediately before and after public access hours for staff to return resident emails and phone calls.</p>

SB118 was first proposed by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison (D-Birmingham) and now awaits action in the House.</p>

The bill also sets new standards for maintaining the state’s voter registry and for absentee ballots, which would be tracked from voter to ballot box. Voters would also be told immediately if their vote is rejected and be given a chance after Election Day to fix problems. In its current form, Sen. Mike Shower’s (R-Wasilla) bill would require the Alaska Division of Elections to issue “digital multi-factor authentication security identifiers to all registered voters.” Voters would not be required to use the new system, which Shower said could function like an ATM card with a PIN or the cellphone-app boarding pass system used by Alaska Airlines. The precise look of the program would be determined later.</p>

Senate Bill 1485 is one of the most high-profile changes Republicans have proposed to Arizona’s voting laws during this legislative session. It comes after nearly half the GOP caucus in the Legislature backed throwing out the results of last year’s presidential election following Donald Trump’s defeat in the state. Following the 31-29 vote along party lines, the measure has one more vote in the Senate before it would land on Gov. Doug Ducey&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5404" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arkansas:</strong> House Bill 1517 which would have established an<a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/post/bill-establishing-online-voter-registration-system-fails-arkansas-senate"> online voter registration</a> system in Arkansas failed to pass the state Senate. Under the bill, citizens in Arkansas, who have conducted business with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, would have had the ability to register to vote through an online system. Citizens would have to submit their application at least 30 days before an election in order to qualify to vote in said election. They would also have to provide a current driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number. The bill also requires Arkansas Secretary of State to go through voting registration data before each election and identify and purge from the rolls any listed voter who is deceased by comparing data received from the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>The House approved Senate Bill 498 by Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, requires that complaints made to<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/21/house-sends-governor-5-election-related-bills/"> county election boards</a> about alleged election law violations be sent to the state Board of Election Commissioners. In response to a question from House Minority Leader Tippi McCullough, D-Little Rock, the House sponsor, Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, said the bill would not take away the oversight of local prosecutors, because the state board would refer complaints to the appropriate authority. It was sent to Gov. Asa Hutchinson on a 79-9 vote.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 557, also sponsored by Johnson, would<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/21/house-sends-governor-5-election-related-bills/"> give county boards the power to supervise all election officials</a>, and it states that county employees detailed as election officials must comply with the county board&#8217;s directives in election matters. The House sponsor, Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Ferndale, said the bill clarifies lines of responsibility for election officials. SB557 was sent to the governor&#8217;s desk on a 76-17 vote.</p>
<p>The House also sent Senate Bill 549 by Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, to Hutchinson unanimously. That bill requires the county boards of elections to prepare a<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/21/house-sends-governor-5-election-related-bills/"> report on absentee and provisional ballots</a>. It passed 92-0 in the chamber.</p>
<p>Additionally, Senate Bill 643 and Senate Bill 644, both by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, also gained final legislative approval in the House on Tuesday. SB643 requires that<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/21/house-sends-governor-5-election-related-bills/"> absentee ballots be turned in by the end of the day on the Friday before an election</a> and passed 65-25. SB644 sets up procedures for the Legislature to review issues with elections and prohibits anyone convicted of a misdemeanor related to violating election law from<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/21/house-sends-governor-5-election-related-bills/"> becoming an election official</a> in future elections. It passed in a 73-17 vote.</p>

Josh Newman (D-Orange County) is pulling a bill that would have allowed politicians targeted by<a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2021/apr/21/bill-to-reveal-names-of-recall-signers-wont-move/"> recall efforts</a> to see who signed petitions to oust them. Newman said he&#8217;s pulling the bill due to pressure from supporters of a likely recall election against Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat. Newman&#8217;s bill would not have applied to the anti-Newsom effort, but that movement&#8217;s supporters vehemently opposed it, saying it would violate citizen privacy and intimidate voters. Newman&#8217;s proposal would have allowed an elected official facing a recall to see the names of people who signed the petition so they can contact them to make sure they understood what they signed and see if they want to remove their names. People currently have 30 days to remove their names from a recall petition once state elections officials determine there are enough signatures.</p>

One bill would implement automatic voter registration at the DMV, a bill that’s already passed the Senate. The second bill would move the primary date from September to the same day as the presidential primary in July. The bill’s sponsor, State Rep. Stephanie Bolden (D-Wilmington) has introduced this bill three times before, and each time it’s failed to pass through the state senate, despite bipartisan support in the house. Bolden says every time the bill is passed, it receives more support from legislators, and she hopes this is the year it finally passes. Advocates testifying in support of the bill say moving the primary date is even more of a necessity if no-excuse absentee voting is becoming a mainstay, as it gives more time for the elections department to handle the mailing of ballots before the general election in November. Bolden adds turnout in the presidential primary is often higher than the statewide primary, and combining the two would boost turnout, especially among voters who may have difficulty getting to the polls in the first place. All bills passed through the committee, and now head to the House floor for debate.</p>

It now awaits a final vote from the full House and Senate. SB 159 requires license and ID applicants to choose to be registered to vote or to make changes to voter registration information. Certain information may be shared but only among county agencies, the state Department of Transportation, election personnel and the online voter registration system.</p>

Brad Little has signed a bill that will make it tougher for voters to bring<a href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article250752054.html"> initiatives onto statewide ballots</a>. Senate Bill 1110 was passed by the Senate in March and by the House earlier this month. The law will make it significantly harder for voters to get referendums or initiatives on ballots by requiring that 6% of registered voters in each of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts sign a petition before it will be accepted by the state. Currently, 6% of voters in only 18 districts are required to sign the petitions, which must also total 6% of voters statewide.</p>

Senate Bill 221 would set up several layers of oversight of Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s effort to buy new voting machines. Under the measure, Ardoin would be required to use input from lawmakers to create a set of standards for new machines. It would also create a new commission to evaluate voting systems. Ardoin raised some concerns that the bill limits his ability to make decisions on picking new voting machines, but he vowed to work with Senators on the legislation. Ardoin is a Republican but has clashed with lawmakers over the voting machine procurement. The committee also backed Senate Bill 220 by Sen. Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, to require the Louisiana legislative auditor to conduct a review of Louisiana’s election processes.</p>

Under the proposal, firearms would be prohibited from being within 250 feet of a polling station, though law-enforcement officers would be exempt from the ban. Maine is one of a handful of &#8220;open carry&#8221; states where firearm owners can possess a gun in plain view, without any special permit. While federal law prohibits firearms in schools, where many polling stations are located, there&#8217;s no prohibition in city or town halls, community centers and other places where people cast ballots. The bill&#8217;s primary sponsor, Sen. Cathy Breen, D-Falmouth, calls the proposal a &#8220;common-sense measure that provides protection for everyone working at the polls.&#8221;</p>

The proposal surfaced as one of 1,157 amendments to the House’s $47.6 billion budget for fiscal 2022.  The legislation would give a town clerk the discretion to accept or challenge the would-be voter’s credentials if the person fails to produce a valid photo ID in a process that voting rights advocates described as overly complicated.</p>

Greg Gianforte (R) signed two<a href="https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-politics/gianforte-signs-bills-eliminating-election-day-registration-tightening-voter-id"> elections-related bills into law</a> this week. House Bill 176, sponsored by Rep. Sharon Greef, R-Florence, eliminates Election Day voter-registration in Montana after 15 years. The new law ends voter registration at noon on the Monday before an election. MTN News reported last month that anywhere from 1 percent to 2.3 percent of Montana votes cast in recent presidential general elections have been cast by people who register on Election Day. Senate Bill 169, sponsored by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka, more tightly defines the type of ID required to vote in Montana or register to vote. Cuffe said voter ID “is a key component in protecting the integrity of Montana elections.” Any voter who does not have a government-issued photo ID or a state concealed carry permit must produce two forms of identification in order to cast a ballot at the polls.</p>

Currently, parolees must wait a period of four to six weeks to receive a pardon and then must register to vote on their own.  The legislation would restore voting rights at the time of release and would require Department of Corrections employees to provide parolees with a voter registration form.  Some Republican assembly members argued that a felon&#8217;s debt to society isn&#8217;t paid until they finish parole, but the bill was ultimately passed with a Democratic majority in both chambers of the legislature. The bill will be sent to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s desk, although there is no set timeline for when that will happen.</p>

If passed, starting September 1, 2021, electronic voting machines that do not produce a verifiable paper record cannot be purchased. Beginning September 1, 2023, electronic voting machines cannot be used in an election, unless it produces a paper record. The bill will now go before the Committee on Calendars for possible placement on the House floor.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on State Affairs has unanimously passed a bill which would require the secretary of state to publish<a href="https://www.kltv.com/2021/04/16/sen-hughes-bill-publish-voting-history-record-passes-committee/"> voting history records</a>. SB 1925, authored by Sen. Bryan Hughes (R-Mineola) was approved in a 6-0 vote. According to documents filed by Hughes, the record would indicate the voter and the process by which the voter voted: election day, early voting by appearance or voted early by mail. The record would not indicate the contents of a ballot. The record would appear on the secretary of state website. The committee opted to have the bill placed on the Senate’s local and uncontested calendar.</p>
<p>The House Committee on Elections approved HB 1314 by a 5-3 vote. The bill requires all components of<a href="https://www.kltv.com/2021/04/19/rep-hefners-bill-requiring-american-made-voting-machines-passes-committee/"> voting equipment to be American made</a>. Rep. Cole Hefner (R-Mount Pleasant) calls HB 1314 simple and straight-forward. The bill not only requires all parts to be American-made but also the companies manufacturing the equipment, and their parent companies must be located and headquartered in the United States. Also, data and equipment storage must remain in the United States. The bill will now go to the Committee on Calendars for possible placement on the House floor.</p>

Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, aims to codify an attorney general’s opinion from three years ago that said election judges have the same power as district judges to enforce order and keep the peace and therefore are exempt from prohibitions against carrying guns at polling locations. That reasoning stemmed from a 1913 Texas Court of Criminal Appeals case, and the attorney general opinion was non-binding. The bill passed on a vote of 94-51 and now moves to the Senate.</p>

The city&#8217;s decision was made just before the May 9 deadline cities have to notify the Lieutenant Governor&#8217;s Office if they will participate in a ranked-choice vote this year. The ranked-choice voting plan was supported by multiple residents who logged onto Tuesday night&#8217;s meeting.</p>

Gavin Newsom’s decision to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/appeals-court-to-decide-if-newsom-overstepped-his-authority-with-mail-in-ballots/"> mail ballots to all registered voters for the 2020 election</a>. Newsom declared a state of emergency in March 2020, just after the primary election. Newsom issued an executive order to send vote-by-mail ballots to all registered voters for the November general elections. The governor also required local election officials to use a specific barcode to track ballots in the mail and changed hours of operation at polling places in certain counties leading up to the Nov. 3 general election. He issued his three orders under the California Emergency Services Act (CESA), which gives the governor complete authority over state government agencies and the right to police power under state law and the Constitution. In November 2020, Sutter County Superior Court Judge Sarah<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/newsom-election-orders-an-overreach-california-judge-rules/"> ruled</a> the CESA “does not authorize or empower the governor of the state of California to amend statutory law or make new statutory law, which is exclusively a legislative function not delegated to the governor under the CESA.” The state appealed the ruling and now it’s before the appellate court. Assemblymen James Gallagher (R-Yuba City) argued before the panel that Newsom usurped the Legislature’s authority. Deputy Attorney General John Killeen argued Newsom could not achieve some sort of broad, long term change under his emergency powers since “there are plenty of safeguards in CESA, it’s not even close to being unconstitutional.”</p>

Greg Gianforte (R) signed two laws that would<a href="https://missoulacurrent.com/government/2021/04/election-day-registration-2/"> change how and when voters register</a>, attorneys for the Montana Democratic Party have sued to stop them, saying they unfairly disenfranchise young voters, the elderly, Native Americans and the disabled even though not a single case of voter fraud has been documented in the past 20 years. In the lawsuit filed by Mike Meloy of Helena and Matthew Gordon of Seattle, they ask the court to strike down House Bill 176, which eliminated Election Day – or same-day – voter registration. They also asked the court to rule that Senate Bill 169, which established stricter rules for acceptable identification, as unconstitutional. The lawsuit, filed in Yellowstone County, has been assigned to Judge Mary Jane Knisely. The Democrats have named Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen as the defendant in her role as overseeing statewide elections and voter registration. The party’s complaint alleges that the two bills violate provisions in the state constitution requiring equal protection under the law, arguing that young voters would be disproportionately impacted. Democrats also complained that the laws would hamper their get-out-the-vote efforts, which hinge in part on convincing people to register and vote on election day, and would force them to spend additional resources on voter education.</p>

The justices released an order Monday instructing a lower court to dismiss the case as moot. The order did not include an opinion or indicate which justices supported or opposed the move. A Republican congressional candidate and four individual voters filed a federal lawsuit against Pennsylvania elections officials in October after a state court ruled that mail-in ballots could be counted if they were received up to three days after Election Day, which legislators had established as the deadline. Democrats had sued in state court to have the deadline extended due to the expected increase in mail ballots because of the pandemic. The Supreme Court&#8217;s order comes nearly two months after it rejected a handful of cases brought by former President Trump and his allies that sought to challenge the election results in battleground states that helped carry President Biden to victory.</p>
<p>Washington County Judge Michael Lucas has blocked an attempt by three Donegal Township supervisors to<a href="https://observer-reporter.com/news/localnews/judge-denies-request-by-three-donegal-supervisors-to-halt-primary/article_c582ec2a-a144-11eb-9623-ff6f00acd85c.html"> halt the municipality’s primary election next month</a>. Lucas ruled late Friday afternoon to deny the preliminary injunction request by Supervisors Richard Martin, Richard Fidler and Tammi M. Iams after they claimed they could be removed from office before their terms expire when the board is downsized from five members to three after this year’s election. “The proper and lawful exercise of a fundamental right to vote may not be sacrificed to maintain the term of any officeholder,” Lucas wrote in his opinion. “An elected office is a public trust, not the private domain of the officeholder.” The three supervisors filed the lawsuit April 9 claiming they could be harmed by the May 18 primary because each has multiple years remaining on their terms, meaning they could be removed early if they lose their reelection bids later this year. The trio sued the Washington County Board of Elections asking for it to halt the election or invalidate the results. Also named in the lawsuit were fellow Supervisors Edward Shingle Jr. and Kathleen Croft.</p>

The agreement comes after several voters with disabilities, the American Council of the Blind of Virginia, and the National Federation of the Blind of Virginia filed a lawsuit in federal court last year against the state for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act and the Virginia Disabilities Act. In August, the state agreed to provide an absentee ballot option that is accessible and can be marked electronically so voters with disabilities could safely vote in the November 2020 general election. The plaintiffs and their lawyers said this week that the state has agreed to permanently provide the remote electronic absentee ballot option for voters with disabilities, beginning with the upcoming primary election in June. Under a consent decree, the state will also appoint an ombudsman to assist voters to use the accessible electronic ballot.</p>

Through BDDO, the City Clerk’s office has increased their ability to enfranchise voters and get constituents more involved in the democratic process. Vocem Online is a web-based application that includes an election office portal and a constituent portal. Jurisdictions have a central place to efficiently manage petitions.
