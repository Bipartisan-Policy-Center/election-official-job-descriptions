														<p><strong>Free Self-Paced Cybersecurity &amp; Combating Misinformation Training </strong><br />
<em>&#8220;I enjoyed the format and the videos. It wasn&#8217;t boring.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>By Whitney May, co-founder and director of government services<br />
Center for Tech and Civic Life</p>
<p>Against all odds, the 2020 U.S. general election was the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election"> most secure in American history</a>. This wasn’t by accident or pure luck, rather it was the result of years of work across public and private sectors &#8212; building relationships, sharing information, and empowering election offices to identify and respond to cyber threats and influence operations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6759" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL1.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL1.png 600w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Since the cyber attacks in 2016, the field has been galvanized around the commitment to deeply invest in the security of our elections. An example is the 2018 founding of the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/election-security"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> and the release of their catalogue of cyber hygiene services that include vulnerability scanning and phishing campaign assessments to election offices at no cost. Another example is the<a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration"> Elections Infrastructure &#8211; Information Sharing Analysis Center (EI-ISAC)</a> which provides its members with free resources like election-specific threat intelligence and security best practices. And there’s the<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/project/defending-digital-democracy#!about"> Defending Digital Democracy Project at Harvard Kennedy School (D3P)</a> that produced the leading election cybersecurity playbooks and facilitated tabletop exercises with election offices across the country.</p>
<p>Our own organization,<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/"> Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL)</a>, also played a role in helping election departments advance their security efforts. Even with 2020 behind us, CTCL is continuing to support election security with free training sponsored by the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Free Self-Paced Cybersecurity Training for Election Officials</strong><br />
At CTCL, we believe one of our roles is to build, curate, and package resources for election officials on the most pressing issues they face, and then deliver those resources in a way that’s easy for them to adopt. With this in mind, in 2018 we collaborated with the<a href="https://cdt.org/"> Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT)</a> to create a 3-part training series,<a href="https://learn.techandciviclife.org/library/by/category/cybersecurity/"> Cybersecurity for Election Officials</a>. Together, we were able to use the courses to promote many of the services that CISA, EI-ISAC, D3P, and others had already developed.</p>
<p>The series begins with an introduction to cybersecurity terms and definitions. The first course also covers simple yet powerful actions each election official can take to improve security like creating stronger passwords and implementing two-factor authentication. The second course examines cybersecurity from a systems-level perspective and asks election offices to apply elements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework core, the 5 Functions, to help ensure continuity of operations for their election infrastructure. Finally, the third course focuses on ways election officials can communicate with the public about how they prepare for and respond to cyber threats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6760" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2.jpg 600w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>At the start of 2020<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VA-Case-Study.pdf"> CTCL teamed up with the Virginia Department of Elections</a> to deliver the self-paced cybersecurity series to local election offices across the commonwealth. The training reached over 750 election officials and we received lots of good feedback on the courses. Daniel Persico, Chief Information Officer with the Virginia Department of Elections, told us “The content and delivery of the CTCL courses could benefit all local election officials, nationwide. Everyone has a responsibility to security and protecting our democracy.”</p>
<p>Following this success in Virginia, the<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/eac-cybersecurity-training/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) partnered with CTCL</a> in 2020 to provide the cybersecurity series to every election official in the country free of charge. And even though the 2020 election is behind us, the work of safeguarding our democracy continues. This training will help election officials improve cybersecurity in their office, stay up-to-date with election best practices, and show the public they take cybersecurity seriously.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6761" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2.png 600w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTCL2-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Election officials can now enroll in these courses as part of a self-paced module. Working at your own pace, you can complete each of the three courses in about 90 minutes. If you’re on the fence about whether the series is a good fit your election office, consider these reactions from officials who have completed the training:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;The videos were short, concise, and very informative. They kept my attention very well and I found them to be quite interesting.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This course did a good job of communicating a complex topic and making it relevant to everyday interactions.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This is valuable and I appreciate the differentiation between the various election systems and their vulnerabilities.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;The examples and practice situations in 301 were the most helpful to me; having the example situations and how to respond to them in the office, to the public, and to the press all at once is the most realistic scenario, so I appreciated having that practice.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I enjoyed the format and the videos. It wasn&#8217;t boring.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>To date, the top 5 states or territories with the highest total enrollment numbers are Virginia, Ohio, South Carolina, California, and Florida. And the top 5 states or territories with the highest percentage of their jurisdictions enrolled in the training are Alaska, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Virginia, and South Carolina. Make sure your state or territory doesn’t miss out on this opportunity &#8211; the training is available for free for all U.S. election departments through the end of May 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing a Free Self-Paced Course on Combating Election Misinformation</strong><br />
Along with cyber threats, influence operations will also be part of U.S. elections beyond 2020. That’s why in addition to the 3 cybersecurity courses, we’re also announcing the launch of the newest CTCL self-paced course,<a href="https://learn.techandciviclife.org/library/combating-election-misinformation-b06a3396/200846/about/"> Combating Election Misinformation</a>, available starting today. Similar to the cybersecurity series, the misinformation course was created in collaboration with CDT.</p>
<p>In Combating Election Misinformation, election officials will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with terms and concepts related to information operations</li>
<li>Identify different forms of misinformation, malinformation, and disinformation and how to respond</li>
<li>Develop resilience with a defensive communications strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>All U.S. election officials are invited to attend, especially those with limited exposure to the concept of influence operations in elections. When the course was originally delivered in July 2020 over Zoom, an election official who attended said that it was their first webinar about the misinformation of elections. After attending, they felt more prepared to both identify election misinformation and had a better understanding of what to do in response. To get a sense of the course covers, be sure to check out the free<a href="https://www.electiontools.org/tool/checklist-for-combating-election-misinformation/"> Checklist for Combating Election Misinformation</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re a state election office, you’re invited to explore<a href="https://learn.techandciviclife.org/p/home/"> CTCL’s full self-paced catalogue of courses</a> and see how the content aligns with your training program for the local election officials in your state. Similar to the experience in Virginia, we’d love the opportunity to partner with you so your locals receive continuing education credit for completing these free, self-paced courses.</p>
<p>2020 was a turbulent year, and we made it to the other side so we might make progress on the critical work of helping ensure our elections are more secure. Election officials continue to make U.S. democracy happen for all of us, and we’re proud to support their work alongside other private and public sector partners. Please contact us at courses@techandciviclife.org to learn more about CTCL’s professional development program for election officials.</p>

<em>Report examines policy trends that made a difference in 2020 turnout</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6754" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Goes-to-the-Polls-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Goes-to-the-Polls-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Goes-to-the-Polls-787x1024.png 787w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Goes-to-the-Polls-768x999.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Goes-to-the-Polls.png 810w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" />The new<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/america-goes-to-the-polls-2020/"> “America Goes to the Polls”</a> report &#8212; a joint effort between Nonprofit VOTE and the U.S. Elections Project &#8212; pulls back the curtain on the record-breaking voter turnout of the 2020 Presidential election to examine the bigger story: the crucial differences in voting policies across states and their impact on each state’s voter turnout.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt that all of America &#8212; citizens, election officials, voting rights advocates &#8212; should be celebrating the numbers we saw in the 2020 general election with all 50 states showing an increase in voter turnout,” says Brian Miller, Executive Director of Nonprofit VOTE. “But if we want to continue to see and expand a vibrant electorate, we have to understand what worked and recognize that there are still wide differences in how citizens can vote state-by-state.” Indeed, the new report ranks all 50 states by turnout, highlighting the  policies their voters can use to register and cast their ballots.</p>
<p>“One difference was the record use of mail ballots and early in-person voting that made voting more convenient and safer in the midst of a pandemic.” says Michael McDonald, Election Project Director and Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida. “More than two of every three voters voted early. To put that in context, 2020 was the first modern election when more people voted early than filled out a ballot at the polls on Election Day.”</p>
<p>In an effort to offer citizens an easier and safer way to cast their ballots in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 28 states changed their policies to make voting by mail more accessible. The results cannot only be seen in the national turnout success of 2020, but by the fact that half of the top 10 turnout states in the report were those that mailed ballots to registered voters. Almost all of the bottom 10 states required excuses for vote by mail ballots or cut off voter registration four weeks before the election.</p>
<p>The new America Goes to the Polls report also highlights Same Day Registration (SDR) &#8212; which allows voters to register as late as election day &#8212; as a crucial policy for encouraging turnout. “We saw that nine of the top 10 states offer SDR which results in a five percentage point increase in voter turnout over states without the policy,” says Caroline Mak, Research Coordinator at Nonprofit VOTE. “State adoption of SDR is a promising trend, with nearly half of all states offering it now. Last year’s election further underlines the fact that voter education, registration, and activation are key to the continuation and health of our robust, representative democracy.”</p>

Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy had asked the County Commissioners to authorize spending to get the county’s voting machines ready for the May election. The commissioners declined. Guy says that means votes will have to be counted manually, which she says is against state law. County commissioner Ed Boettcher says a lawsuit alleging problems with the county’s election last November means the board had no choice but to require a hand-count for the upcoming vote. “It could become quite cumbersome, but, given our circumstances, it felt like our options were pretty limited,” Boettcher said. “There weren’t – there wasn’t a good – there wasn’t good direction to head. We’re heading in what I feel is the best one possible.” A spokesperson for the Secretary of State declined comment on the legality of a paper ballot hand count, citing the potential for future legal proceedings. A spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems also declined comment. While the county already uses paper ballots — their Dominion machines are used to count ballots — the state outlawed the kind of precinct paper ballot hand counts the commission approved. “The state said we can’t, but let them come tell us that we can’t, given our circumstance,” said Boettcher, of the commission’s decision to hold a hand ballot count in the May primary.</span></p>

The announcement drew immediate condemnation from members of Congress who would have to pass legislation to carry out some parts of the proposal. Among other things, the plan would reduce post office hours, consolidate locations, limit the use of planes to deliver the mail and loosen the delivery standard for first-class mail from within three days in the continental United States to within five days, an effort to meet the agency’s 95 percent target for on-time delivery. In a news conference, Kristin Seaver, an executive vice president at the Postal Service, maintained that 70 percent of first-class mail would continue to be delivered in one to three days. Gostmaster General, Louis DeJoy argued that the steps were necessary given the Postal Service’s worsening financial situation. The agency, which is supposed to be self-sustaining, has lost $87 billion in the past 14 fiscal years and is projected to lose another $9.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 alone. “We have to start the conversation with we’re losing $10 billion a year,” Mr. DeJoy said in an interview on Tuesday, “and that’s going to continue to go up unless we do something.” Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-New Jersey), renewed a call for the sitting members of the agency’s Board of Governors to be fired and for DeJoy to be “escorted to the street where his bags are waiting for him.” The plan should be a “dead letter” for the agency, he added.</span></p>

This week Harris County Elections officials unveiled a new state-of-the-art touchscreen voting system they said will make voting easier and adds another layer of security including a paper trail. The new machines will cost the county more than $50 million. Harris County administrator Isabel Longoria said it was the first time in more than 10 years the county will be using new voting machines. “We’re looking at about 2,500 machines for the May election but we’ve got 12,000 total coming in for November,” Longoria said. The machines come from Hart InterCivic, the same company Harris County has used since 2000. “It’s going to be faster for folks to vote because you can touch the screen instead of dealing with those little turn wheels and buttons,” said Longoria They will first be used in May, when early voting begins at 23 different locations around Harris County for various local elections. “We don’t anticipate anything going at all wrong in the May elections,” Longoria says.</span></p>

Guilford County Board of Elections Director Charlie Collicutt said this week that his office is bringing back the “I Voted” stickers.  Collicutt said the removal of the well-liked stickers in 2020 was done to prevent the possibility of spreading the virus. “Those were very popular,” Collicutt said of the stickers.  “We were just trying to cut down on things that were touched.” The county’s elections department also got rid of community pens that were in the past used by one person after another, and, of course, the department used wide open spaces for polling places and kept the voting booths a great distance apart.</span></p>

He called the voting rollbacks in the states an “existential threat to our democracy” reminiscent of Jim Crow segregationist laws, chanting “Shame! Shame! Shame!” at the Republicans promoting them. On the other end of the spectrum, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) spread disinformation about voter registration during his testimony. “This bill is the single most dangerous bill this committee has ever considered,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. “This bill is designed to corrupt the election process permanently, and it is a brazen and shameless power grab by Democrats.” According to The New York Times, So far, not a single Republican supports the nearly 800-page bill, and Democrats are unlikely to win support even from all 50 of their senators without substantial changes. Democrats’ best hope for enacting the legislation increasingly appears to be to try to leverage its voting protections — which many liberals view as a life-or-death matter not just for American democracy, but for their own political chances in the future — to justify triggering the Senate’s so-called nuclear option: the elimination of the filibuster rule requiring 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to advance most bills. For now, though, even that remains out of reach as long as conservative Democrats in the 50-50 Senate are opposed. Michigan Secretary of State</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/03/michigan-secretary-of-state-testifies-at-us-senate-hearing-on-voter-reform-bill.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jocelyn Benson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (D) and West Virginia Secretary of State</span><a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/03/24/warner-rips-federal-election-reform-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mac Warner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (R) each testified on the legislation</span></p>

Legislators voted 74-25 for the bill that now moves to the Alabama Senate.  The bill by Republican Rep. Wes Allen of Troy would explicitly forbid election workers from setting up curbside areas for people to cast ballots as well as forbid setting up of voting machines outside a polling place. Supporters of the bill said it is needed to protect election integrity. Opponents argued the state is cutting off an avenue that might make it easier for elderly and disabled people to vote.</span></p>

Then county election officials would be required to be sure these match what they have on file. This would be in addition to the current signature-matching mandates in state law. Local elections officials testified against the bill citing the added time and costs. Gabriella Cazares-Kelly, the Pima County recorder, said that last year her office verified 459,791 early ballots. That required two shifts, each 12 to 14 hours a day, with employees paid about $14 an hour. Working with the language of SB 1713, Cazares-Kelly said it would take an additional 2,500 hours of staff time, meaning more than $35,000 additional cost. “And that’s only if everyone is using a driver’s license number on their affidavit and shows consistent information,” she said. “The additional verifications are unnecessary and don’t add any meaningful security measures to a process that’s already proven secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Committee on Government and Elections also approved SB1010 under party-line vote. Under the bill anyone with enough money to</span><a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/03/24/senate-committee-approves-bills-to-add-burdens-on-early-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy a recount of any — and all — elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and at any level they wanted, right up through the entire state. Under SB 1010 they could demand not just a regular recount, which is done by running the ballots again through tabulation equipment, but even a hand count as long as they could afford the cost — no one had any figures — and the request was made within five days after the formal certification of the results and could afford the cost.</span></p>

Hammer says his measure will allow county election commissions to better prepare for Election Day, as well as check for any voting irregularities.

They have backed off the move to throw out all requests for mail ballots made for the 2020 presidential election, which, under previous law, meant that mail-in ballots would automatically be provided through the 2022 mid-terms. Throwing out all the ballot requests — retroactively — would disproportionately hurt Democrats next year, when both Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio will be seeking re-election. The Florida House elections committee approved legislation Monday to</span><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-florida-house-republican-election-law-changes-20210322-texar6hc5bh3fga3pbyr2vp6ze-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change many vote-by-mail rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The proposal would shorten the length of time voters’ requests to receive mail ballots remain in effect. But first it was amended so that it wouldn’t apply retroactively and cancel previous requests. The legislation would require elections officials to use the last signature they have on file for a voter to match a mail ballot instead of comparing several signatures. People who return their mail ballots to drop boxes at supervisors of elections offices or at early voting sites would have to show identification proving they live at the address of the voter whose ballot they’re returning. If it’s not the same address, they’d have to sign a declaration at the drop box that they’re a relative of the voter whose ballot they’re returning. Only relatives could return someone else’s vote-by-mail ballot. More access would be granted to people representing candidates and political parties wishing to scrutinize signature matching and duplication of ballots that need to be corrected if they are damaged or not filled out according to the instructions.</span></p>

The bill would also limit ballot drop boxes, an</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/ballot-drop-boxes-approved-for-georgia-voters-during-coronavirus/4Bir3Ymx1zL0ZOGsXMazEO/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2020 election cycle that allowed voters to deliver their absentee ballots rather than have to rely on the U.S. Postal Service to return them by election day. Drop boxes would only be allowed inside advance polling places during the hours that they’re opening. In addition, the bill would expand early voting by requiring polling on two Saturdays during the three-week early voting period. Legislators also voted to allow county election offices to have the option of opening for early voting on two Sundays, a decision that came after protests over</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/plan-to-limit-georgia-sunday-voting-disrupts-black-church-efforts/ARKWRBU7FRAR5LKSA5IY4JGAGA/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reducing voting opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for Black voters who go to the polls after church. The legislation also would create a hotline to report voting allegations to the attorney general’s office, allow the State Election Board to take over county election boards it deems problematic, and require disclaimers on absentee ballot application forms mailed by nonprofit groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A House committee</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-panel-passes-bill-to-limit-drop-boxes-expand-weekend-voting/NANGLLMWU5DCFGENMRLXUQPY64/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed a different election overhaul bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Monday, and lawmakers will have to negotiate final versions of bills before this year’s legislative session ends March 31. The House version,</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/202"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 202</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also would set a deadline to request absentee ballots 11 days before election day, disqualify provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct, ban free food given to voters waiting in line, and</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-bill-would-end-long-runoffs-and-free-for-all-special-elections/WHLUNDQX7RATRGLSOPZMJQRW5Q/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require runoffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> four weeks after election day instead of nine weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators have voted down a Gwinnett County bill that would have</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/gwinnett-bills-would-raise-chairs-salary-remake-elections-board/VOVKN5NOEZB2RKQ3Z47CCBTDJI/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remade the county’s election board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, Democrats and Republicans alike appoint two members while a fifth, nonpartisan member is selected by the other members. The proposal to reconstitute the board would require the executive committees of both the Republican and Democratic parties to submit three names to the county commission within 30 days of there being an opening on the board. Commissioners would appoint two people from each list. If no lists are submitted, commissioners could appoint whoever they wanted. A fifth member of the board would be appointed by the commission without regard to party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decisions about Georgia elections, such as vote counting and polling place closures, could be made by appointees of Republican state officials empowered to</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-bill-would-shift-power-over-elections-to-gop-appointees/VPNVO2W4TBBTFKGA7Z2GZIEQEE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> take over local election operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a bill awaiting final votes. Under the proposal, the Republican-controlled State Election Board would be able to</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-state-legislature/georgia-bill-clears-senate-to-let-state-take-over-local-election-boards/JOMQA2LX3VH65MG4O44IXY2ADE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struggling county election boards and install new management, with broad authority over elections and results. Critics of the proposal say it would</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/bipartisan-local-elections-oversight-endangered-by-georgia-bills/O3HEIIABYFHC7MPCSV7QTT6SUI/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usurp authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from county election boards, often run by volunteers appointed by each political party or county commissions. The bill calls for one person appointed by the state to oversee a county’s election operations. Supporters of the measure say some county election offices, such as Fulton’s,</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/confusion-over-firing-fulton-election-head-continues-state-monitor-weighs-in/CLQU3DSLHVBAHPKVRSLV57ES4E/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after 2020 elections stained by long lines in the primary and suspicions about ballot security. They say the state government should step in when local governments fail. The county election board takeover proposals are included within broad election overhaul measures,</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/202"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 202</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/531"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 531</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are scheduled for votes in each chamber starting Thursday. The legislation would also require voter ID for absentee ballots, expand weekend voting in general elections and limit ballot drop boxes. Both bills would allow the State Election Board to seek the removal of county election boards for poor performance. The measure that cleared the House goes further. It would remove the secretary of state as the chairperson of the State Election Board and replace him with an appointee of the General Assembly. That would give a majority of the board to the General Assembly, which already appoints two of its members.</span></p>

Under current law, no person who has been convicted of a crime in Illinois, any other state, or in a federal court who is serving a term of confinement in any penal institution is allowed to vote. That includes inmates who are on furlough or in a work-release program, but it does not include people who’ve been released on parole or people being held in pretrial detention. Their right to vote is only restored once they have been released or paroled from prison. Simply repealing that law, however, would not, by itself, restore the right to vote for inmates because Article 3, Section 2 of the Illinois Constitution also prohibits prison inmates from voting. Per the constitution, “A person convicted of a felony, or otherwise under sentence in a correctional institution or jail, shall lose the right to vote, which right shall be restored not later than upon completion of his sentence.”</span></p>

A spokeswoman said the hearing was canceled because of “scheduling conflicts,” but that the bill will be heard at a future committee hearing. But, area Democratic officials say the bill is voter suppression, while area Republican officials say the bill limits the potential for fraud. The bill — authored by Sens. Erin Houchin, R-Salem; Eric Koch, R-Bedford; and Jon Ford, R-Terre Haute; requires voters to write in — instead of election workers preprinting the number — their driver’s license or last four numbers of their Social Security number on the application for an absentee ballot that is on record with their county election offices. The bill also prohibits the Indiana Election Commission from “instituting, increasing or expanding” vote-by-mail or absentee vote-by-mail and changing the time, place or manner of holding an election.</span></p>

The House voted 94-0 Wednesday night to pass</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HJR%2011&amp;ga=89"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Joint Resolution 11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, advancing a priority that Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has called for since 2019. The House overwhelmingly passed the proposed amendment before, in 2019. But the Senate, which like the House is controlled by Republicans, failed to act on the measure in 2019 and 2020. It&#8217;s unclear whether the Senate will act this year. Proposals to amend the Iowa Constitution must pass two consecutive general assemblies and win majority approval in a statewide vote. If passed this year, the Legislature would have to pass the same language in 2023 or 2024 before it could be put before Iowans for a vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House on Wednesday also passed a separate bill,</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20818&amp;ga=89"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House File 818</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that would</span><a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/24/iowa-house-passes-proposed-amendment-state-constitution-restoring-felon-voting-rights-resolution-11/6990253002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impose similar restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on who is eligible to have their voting rights automatically restored if the constitutional amendment were to take effect. That bill passed on a vote of 65-28. The House bill would also require all restitution be paid to any crime victims before the person&#8217;s voting rights could be restored — a provision that Democrats said amounted to a poll tax.</span></p>

Lawmakers in the state’s Senate Federal and State Affairs committee held a hearing on the bill Wednesday morning. The</span><a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/measures/documents/hb2183_01_0000.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit the governor, the executive branch and the judicial branch from altering election laws. It would also limit the authority of the Secretary of State from entering into consent decrees with any court without approval from the state’s legislative coordinating council. Supporters of the measure said it’s a necessary step to make elections safer for Kansas. However, some opponents of the bill said while it’s important to maintain election integrity, it’s not the legislature’s place to impose restrictions on other branches of government, seeing it as another attempt to place limits on the governor.</span></p>

Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery) has been touted by Democratic lawmakers and advocates as a way to improve voter confidence in mail-in voting while also expanding access to popular ballot drop-off boxes. In addition to expanding drop-off boxes and ballot tracking, the bill would also allow voters to “cure” absentee ballots that contain errors.</span></p>

People convicted of felony crimes regain their ability to vote once their sentence has been completed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone convicted of buying or selling votes permanently loses their registration eligibility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would also require the state and local boards of elections to provide voter registration forms to incarcerated individuals at least 30 days before the registration window closes, and educate inmates about their voting eligibility and absentee ballots.</span></p>

Among the proposed changes contained in the 39 bills: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require drop boxes for absentee ballots to be approved by the secretary of state and the county board of canvassers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the removal of absentee ballot drop boxes used in the November general election that aren’t approved. Implement new requirements for monitoring such boxes. (SB 273)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow those between the ages of 16 and 17½  to pre-register to vote if they meet certain conditions. (SB 274) </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow individuals from each political party to observe and record election audits carried out at precincts and allow clerks to provide live video coverage of counting boards tasked with processing and counting absentee ballots. (SB 275)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorize election inspectors, challengers and poll watchers to photograph and film the tabulation of votes. (SB 276)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow county clerks to flag deceased voters in the qualified voter file — which houses each voter&#8217;s information and is widely used for many election needs — and require them to notify local clerks of any people who have died in the county every two weeks and then every week the 45 days before an election. (SB 277)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require those collecting absentee ballots from drop boxes to carry ballots in approved containers and require clerks to document each time ballots are collected. (SB 278)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modify the number of election challengers allowed to observe absent voter counting boards based on the number of absentee ballots assigned to the board. (SB 279)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the board of state canvassers to complete the canvass of an initiative petition within 100 days after the petition is filed. (SB 280)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the secretary of state to collect information from multistate programs and partnerships the secretary of state is participating in to verify voters&#8217; addresses and registration status. Require the secretary of state to post on the department of state’s website the number of voters who moved out of state, the number of voters who changed addresses, duplicate voter registration records, voters who died and the results of investigations concerning improper votes among other information.(SB 281) </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit who can access the qualified voter file. (SB 282)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change the deadline for county board of canvassers to examine ballot containers. Allow clerks in large jurisdictions to begin processing but not counting absentee ballots the day before the election. (SB 283)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the secretary of state to provide a report to the Legislature detailing any contracts entered into for an election-related activity or service. Prohibit the state, counties, cities and townships from accepting contributions from individuals and entities to be used for election-related activities or election equipment. (SB 284)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require those requesting an absentee ballot to present identification to their local clerk or attach a copy of their ID to their application. Require clerks to issue a provisional absentee ballot to those who fail to show ID. (SB 285)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit voters from using a drop box after 5 p.m. the day before Election Day. (SB 286)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit clerks from providing prepaid postage for absentee ballot return envelopes and prohibit the secretary of state from providing funding for prepaid postage. (SB 287)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require statewide election audits conducted in a precinct to be carried out by members of the two major political parties and allow political parties to designate observers to monitor the audit and require the secretary of state to provide live video streaming of an audit. (SB 288)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require federal funds for election-related purposes to only be spent upon appropriation in a budget act and require any funds that aren&#8217;t appropriated within a budget act within 90 days to be returned to the federal government. (SB 289)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require election challengers to wear an identification badge. (SB 290)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amend the criminal code to expand election-related felonies. (SB 291)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the secretary of state to establish training for election challengers. Require challengers to be associated with a political party, as opposed to groups advocating for a ballot proposition, and mandate they take training at least once every three years. Parties would need to offer this training at least three days before an election. (SB 292)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeal a portion of criminal law related to election challengers appointed by entities that are not political parties. SB 292 bill would only allow political parties to provide challengers. (SB 293)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the local board of election commissioners to strive to appoint the same number of Democratic and Republican election inspectors for every election precinct. This can be a challenge in areas that have substantially more Republican or Democratic voters — chiefly Detroit. If the board cannot appoint an essentially equal number of inspectors based on the party, the local clerk would need to send a report to the state within 10 days of the election explaining what was done to search for inspectors. (SB 294)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require hourly checks by precinct officials to ensure that during the ballot counting process, the number of ballots issued at a precinct matches the number of ballots tabulated at a precinct. While this law is intended to prevent out-of-balance precincts, it seemingly doesn’t account for someone receiving an absentee ballot but not ultimately casting it. (SB 295)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abolish every existing board of canvassers in a county with at least 200,000 starting in 2022. In a county with 200,000 to 750,000 people, it would require six-member boards. In larger counties, it would require eight-member boards. While boards now generally consist of four people, keeping boards at an even number would still allow for the chance that certification votes end in a tie. (SB 296)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require at least one Republican and Democrat be present at all times during an election canvass. Require board approval for the clerk to hire any associate who would help with the canvass. (SB 297)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extend the amount of time for an election canvass to be certified from 14 days after an election to 21 days. (SB 298)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require election inspectors to deliver the statement of election returns and a vote tally sheet in a sealed envelope to the local clerk by noon the day after the election. (SB 299)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require holding on-site early voting from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the second Saturday before any election. Clerks would need to post where and when early voting sites would be open. It would be a felony to reveal results from an early voting period until after polls closed on Election Day. (SB 300)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create criminal violations for tampering with ballots cast early or with revealing the results from early voting. (SB 301)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require voter registration applications include a provision where applicants attest that they do not claim voting residence or have the right to vote in another state. It’s unclear whether this would entail whether a person is registered to vote in another state, even if that person moved away from that state to Michigan. (SB 302)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp up the state’s voter identification requirements. Right now, voters who do not have photo identification can sign an affidavit attesting to their identity. This bill would instead mandate that they be issued provisional ballots, subject to a separate process of counting and verification. (SB 303)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outline how voters who want their provisional ballots to count would verify their identity. The bill would require these voters to prove their identity within six days of the election — if they present a government-issued ID that does not include an address, voters would also need to present a document such as a utility bill or bank statement verifying their address. (SB 304)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ban elected officials from including their names on publicly funded materials that have anything to do with elections. Officials could post the names of offices and contact information, but not the name of the election official. In theory, this would prohibit the secretary of state or county clerks from using taxpayer dollars to campaign while spreading election information. In practice, the measure would likely make it a misdemeanor for an elected official to post a news release with a quote on social media. (SB 305)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the secretary of state to submit a report to the Legislature and publicly post within 45 days of an election the names of all local clerks who have not conducted required training. (SB 306)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require the full text of a ballot proposal be included on absentee ballots and ballots cast in person. (SB 307)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandate the secretary of state create a signature verification process and that local clerks be trained on that process. This comes in response to misinformation about signatures on absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots. (SB 308)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outline rules and regulations for poll watchers and poll challengers. It explains the duties of both positions, where they are allowed to stand on Election Day, what they are allowed to challenge and how to resolve disputes. Republicans argued challengers and watchers at TCF Center in Detroit were prevented from monitoring election workers last fall, but the city and Democrats argued these challengers did not understand their roles and ignored COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. (SB 309)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit the secretary of state from either mailing absentee ballot applications or posting these applications on a website. The secretary could only mail an application to someone who requested that application. It was not immediately clear whether any other entity — such as local clerks or political parties — would be banned from mailing out unsolicited applications. Republicans routinely argue mailing out applications to voters who did not request them may increase the chances of voter fraud. Voter fraud is exceptionally rare, and there is no evidence that mass mailings of applications drastically increases fraud. (SB 310)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow active duty service members who are deployed at the time of an election to cast a ballot electronically, as long as signature verification measures are created and used. (SB 311)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Elections and Ethics Committee is considering making changes to Michigan election laws that would include</span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/23/michigan-house-panel-considers-eliminating-may-elections-requiring-challenger-training/6967673002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> condensing the May and August elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The change to the election dates would eliminate low turnout May elections and move up the August primary to a June election date. The earlier primary would give clerks more time to prepare for the November general election.  The legislation condensing the state&#8217;s election dates is also expected to save cities and townships the money that would usually be spent on the extra May and August elections. In 2017, the state estimated an average election cost between $2,000 and $2,700 per precinct, saving cities like Detroit about $1 million in a three-election year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a separate bill, county clerks, who are among some of the first to receive notice of a county death, would be tasked with</span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/23/michigan-house-panel-considers-eliminating-may-elections-requiring-challenger-training/6967673002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> removing those individuals from the voting rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently, with some exceptions, county clerks transmit the list of deceased individuals to local clerks, who are responsible for removing dead individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill would require the Secretary of State and county clerks to develop and administer</span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/23/michigan-house-panel-considers-eliminating-may-elections-requiring-challenger-training/6967673002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> training for election challengers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a suggestion that was made last year after election officials said GOP poll challengers at the TCF Center failed to understand the absentee ballot counting process when they made claims of fraudulent vote counts. The county clerks would administer the training to party and organization leaders, which would then be required to convey that training to challengers and issue a certificate of completion. The bill also increases training for election inspectors.</span></p>

House Bill 176, if signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) would end voter registration at noon on the day before Election Day. Supporters say the bill is needed because same-day registration causes undue burden for election administrators. Opponents say the bill will make it harder for some, like Native Americans and those who are disabled, to vote. The bill advanced on a party line vote. The House State Administration Committee originally tabled the bill. But Republicans revived the proposal after it was amended to move the voter registration deadline closer to Election Day. Republican Secretary of State Christie Jacobsen said the legislation is a top priority for her office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Montana House committee unanimously endorsed a bill aimed at</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-elections-native-americans-montana-voting-0255625ab0a3d1ce07cdcecb73b5a4eb"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making it easier for Native Americans to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill would require counties to have at least one satellite or alternative election office on reservations in the 30 days before an election and for the counties and tribes to agree, in writing, on the location and hours of operation. The bill puts into law the terms of a 2014 settlement in a voting rights lawsuit that required three counties to open satellite voting offices on reservations twice a week before Election Day. It also puts into law guidance issued by the Secretary of State’s Office directing other counties with tribal voters to comply with the settlement.</span></p>

A week after the House State Administration Committee voted unanimously to keep Montana college IDs on the state’s the list of “primary” identification for registering and voting, House Speaker Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, introduced an amendment reversing the change to Senate Bill 169. The amendment passed 55-45. The bill is part of a package of legislation being pushed by Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen. As written, the bill would require an official document showing the voter’s name and current address, if they can’t provide a primary ID. Primary ID options include a Montana driver’s license or ID card, tribal photo ID, military ID, concealed carry permit, a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number.</span></p>

The bill allows county election boards to decide the placement of ballot drop boxes by a simple majority vote. In the case of a tie, the county clerk casts the deciding vote. Under the bill, each county must erect at least 10 ballot drop boxes, with at least one box in each municipality with average per capita or median family incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty line. The bill is a bid to prevent drop box clusters seen in some towns in last year’s elections. The rules used for those races required drop boxes be placed at specific sites, including county and municipal government buildings, community colleges and state universities. The Assembly State and Local Government Committee cleared that measure in a 4-2 vote along party lines. The Senate passed the measure in a 25-13 vote in February, but will have to do so again, as Assembly lawmakers amended it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly State and Local Government Committee voted 4-2 along party lines on a measure that would ban</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/assembly-panel-clears-bills-barring-police-from-polling-places-allowing-election-officials-to-decide-drop-box-placement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on- and off-duty police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from loitering within 100 ft. of a drop box. That prohibition does not prevent officers from voting, nor does it prevent officers from remaining in their homes if those fall within the 100-foot limit. It also blocks municipalities from assigning police to enforce election laws unless they’re specifically requested by an election board, superintendent of elections or county clerk. The bill would still allow local and county police authorities to assist in the transport of ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly Education Committee on Wednesday advanced legislation (</span><a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A3500/3394_I1.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A-3394</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to require all New Jersey students in an appropriate middle school grade to</span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/reynolds-jackson-carter-jasey-bill-require-civics-instruction-middle-schools-clears-assembly-panel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complete a civics course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beginning in the 2022-2023 school year. The course would address the values and principles of the American system of constitutional democracy, the function and limitations of government, and the role of a citizen in a democratic society. The New Jersey Center for Civic Education at Rutgers University would provide curricula, professional development and technical assistance for middle and high school civics education. The bill would be known as “Laura Wooten’s Law” in recognition of Mercer County’s longest-serving poll worker, who volunteered a record 79 continuous years before she passed away in 2019. Her voting rights advocacy inspired a coalition of college and high school students to launch the Poll Hero Project, an initiative to recruit young people to serve as poll workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new bill introduced by Assemblyman Gerard Scharfenberger (R-Middletown) would require New Jersey’s State Department</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/scharfenberger-bill-would-require-database-of-election-violations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create a database of election violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including civil rights breaches and fraud. The measure would require state officials create an incident reporting and complaint database to track abuses, including voting-related civil rights violations and fraud. It requires the incidents include information about the location and date of the incident, as well as a description and a list of actions taken by authorities in response to the complaint. It would also command election officials to forward complaints to the state Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney. Under the bill, the State Department must submit a report detailing incidents to the governor and the legislature.</span></p>

The bill would prevent the collection of any absentee ballots after 5 p.m. Election Day or the date of the primary regardless of when the voter mailed the ballot. If the Election Integrity Act becomes law, elections boards in the state’s 100 counties will have a series of new rules to follow when handling absentee ballots. “The goal of the bill is to bring clarity, simplicity and a clear set of rules to ensure everybody’s on the same footing,” Newton said in an interview, “and the overarching goal is to really restore trust, restore confidence in the election process.” The bill mandates that voters eligible to cast absentee ballots must complete a request form by 5 p.m. the Tuesday two weeks before the election. As soon as the county board receives that application staff must mail to the voter the official ballot, a return envelope for the ballot, and instructions regarding the requirement for a photocopy of the voter’s identification.</span></p>

Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks. &#8220;This bill did seem to me to go too far in completely restricting the ability of the governor to react so that we do have the ability to vote&#8221; in elections, said Larson, who voted against the bill. It fell 23-24 on Monday, one vote shy of staying alive. The legislation would have prohibited the governor from issuing an executive order suspending or amending provisions in laws, orders or state agency rules related to the required minimum of physical polling places. The House last month passed the bill 77-17. Gov. Doug Burgum last year signed an executive order waiving the requirement that counties provide at least one physical polling site for the June 2020 election, due to the coronavirus pandemic. His spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday on whether Burgum would have vetoed the bill.</span></p>

Disability-rights advocates had sued saying the state is violating a legal duty to</span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Not-necessary-to-offer-voter-registration-in-16051183.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> register voters in offices serving disabled students and the elderly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who have less access than others to motor-voter sign-ups. While the populations served by those offices are less likely than others to apply for drivers’ licenses, which would entitle them to immediate voter registration, they are not the types of public agencies required by law to have their own registration sites, the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco said Tuesday. Federal law requires states to establish voter-registration centers in offices that provide either “public assistance” or “state-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.” After advocacy groups said California was not fully complying with the law, then-Secretary of State Alex Padilla agreed in 2018 to set up registration sites in some county welfare departments, the state Office for Services to the Blind, and offices serving disabled students in community colleges. At a judge’s orders, Padilla added more welfare offices and student financial aid centers as registration sites in 2019. But he declined to install registration sites at “special education” offices serving students with disabilities, or at the 33 Area Agencies on Aging, nonprofits commissioned by the state to deliver meals and provide other services to elderly people who need them. The court said neither one was the type of office mandated by federal law to register voters. Advocates have said they will appeal.</span></p>

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jane Barwick said last year that she didn’t have jurisdiction to enforce subpoenas from the commission, which is looking into whether Abrams’ campaign illegally coordinated its efforts with nonprofits supporting her bid for governor. Georgia law prohibits independent groups from coordinating with candidates. Abrams ultimately lost the election to Republican Brian Kemp. A rematch between the two is expected in 2022, and her camp has noted that the ethics commission’s executive secretary, David Emadi, was a Kemp donor in 2018.</span></p>

Lawyers appeared remotely via video feed Monday to discuss discovery issues arising in an unsettled election lawsuit filed in Antrim County. Both sides claim the other is withholding information that’s delaying the case from moving forward. The lawsuit focuses largely on claims that Dominion Voting Systems tabulators and software can’t be trusted.</span></p>

There has been at least five lawsuits filed in the Canton election battle. A judge ruled the incumbent mayor&#8217;s name will be on the ballot, but that&#8217;s not the end of the dispute.  Canton residents believe the ongoing legal wrangling that’s stopped absentee ballots from being printed is all about power. Canton resident Tobias Anderson said with no absentee ballots printed, it significantly alters his voting plan. &#8220;I always do the absentee ballot and vote here, so, for that to not be an option for me it’s going to make it difficult for me to have a say so,&#8221; said Anderson. The initial dispute over ballots was resolved when a judge ruled the mayor and two sitting alderman who were disqualified for not living in the city would be allowed to run for their positions again. Now, there’s a new hold-up for the ballots.</span></p>

In the past several months, and most recently in late February, attorneys for the state on one side, and the Democratic Party, League of Women Voters and six individual current or former college students on the other side, have traded written briefs in preparation for likely oral arguments, which have not yet been scheduled. In January filings, the plaintiffs have noted that three judges have found Senate Bill 3 to be unconstitutional – including two preliminary rulings and the final Superior Court ruling being appealed in this case – finding that the law imposed severe or unreasonable restrictions on the right to vote. In briefings filed in late February, he state’s attorney’s wrote: “&#8230; a plaintiff seeking to invalidate a duly enacted law (like SB 3) on its face is required to show that the law ‘violates the Constitution in all, or virtually all, of its applications’ to succeed. “Showing that certain portions of SB 3 may adversely affect a small subset of same-day registrants during certain high volume elections at certain polling places is insufficient to meet that high bar.” The attorney general’s office acknowledges, “SB3 reduces the number of individuals who may register to vote without providing documentary proof of domicile.”</span></p>

A top Justice Department official notified the county Tuesday that the federal government plans to file a civil lawsuit over violations that disenfranchised voters in the election, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by syracuse.com | The Post-Standard. The two-page notice alleges the Oneida County Board of Elections violated the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, two key federal laws aimed at ensuring free and fair elections. The Justice Department review confirmed what was revealed in the legal battle after the election: Oneida County failed to process at least 2,400 voter registration applications that had been submitted in time for the election through the state Department of Motor Vehicles. An unknown number of those voters who properly registered for the 2020 election at the DMV were not given a chance to vote. The federal review also found Oneida County election officials improperly rejected hundreds of affidavit ballots submitted at polling sites, even though they were cast by eligible voters in the Nov. 3 election, according to the letter.</span></p>

The investigation resulted in a range of charges related to immigration, registration and election rules against about 70 people — more than 40 of whom were accused of casting ballots illegally. Dates of those charges, which involved activity during the 2016 election and prior, range from July 2018 to mid-February 2021. Many of the latest indictments</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-general-elections-elections-raleigh-voting-633ce0fd33f28ec627551b043ed423fd"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the first time last week, but the totals fall far short of early suggestions by the federal government of “pervasive” or “systemic” fraud, suspicions the U.S. Attorney’s Office put before a federal judge in an effort to keep details of its inquiry secret for years. Hundreds of pages of now unsealed court files — which WRAL News, The News &amp; Observer and other media outlets fought in court for</span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article246659433.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than than a year to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtain — shed light on the contentious relationship State Board of Elections officials had with federal investigators from the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The two sides repeatedly accused each other of either sabotage or incompetence, the court records show. The filings also illustrate a shift in priorities for the then newly installed Trump Department of Justice, which grew increasingly focused on bringing criminal charges for voting irregularities among noncitizens. State officials, who relied on federal citizenship data for voter list maintenance, discovered that what once was a routine process could now spawn wide-ranging criminal investigations.</span></p>

The state sought a protection order in response to deposition notices sent by Attorney Stephen Funk, who is representing the Summit GOP’s Executive Committee in the suit filed Friday challenging LaRose’s rejection of Bryan Williams’ reappointment to the Summit County Board of Elections. Williams has claimed that LaRose – a Summit County native – developed a political animosity toward him after he sponsored a fundraiser in 2018 for a potential Republican opponent in LaRose’s race for secretary of state. The party is asking the court to order that Williams serve a four-year term at the election board through Feb. 28, 2025. Williams has been a member of the board since March 2014, and from 2004 to 2010, he was director or deputy director. The court announced this week that it</span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/03/ohio-supreme-court-orders-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-be-deposed-by-summit-county-gop.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will require</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LaRose and Grandjean to be deposed, but imposted a time limit on it.  The court partially rejected the state’s request for a protection order to prevent the depositions and partially granted it by ordering that LaRose’s deposition last up to two hours and Grandjean’s up to one hour. Attorneys for the state may also have an additional 30 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively, for “examination if needed.”</span></p>

EAC serves as a National clearinghouse and resource for information with respect to the administration of Federal elections. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), specifically requires states to make polling places accessible “in a manner that provides the same opportunity to people with disabilities for access and participation” as is provided to non-disabled voters. This includes accessible parking and paths of travel. Each polling place is also required to have at least one direct recording electronic voting system or voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities. HAVA also requires equal access for people with disabilities to registration by mail and a computerized statewide database, eliminating the need to re-register when people move (or re-register as a person with a disability) amongst other provisions. The incumbent is responsible to create EAC Accessibility related Clearinghouse material to assist election officials, voters, and other stakeholders with best practices, white papers, tools, data, training materials, instructions, and any other information that would be helpful to election administrators to assist with the administration of elections. The incumbent will provide expert guidance on accessibility related to election administration that touches all facets of the agency to serve EAC stakeholders. <strong>Salary:</strong> $87,198 to $144,128. <strong>Deadline:</strong> June 3. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/594020200"> click here</a>.</p>
