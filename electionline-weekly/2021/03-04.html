							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Preparing for the 2022 Midterm</strong></p>
<p>By Jim Allen</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6682" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-300x166.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-768x425.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In 2020, we re-designed poll worker recruitment and training.  We provided socially-distanced in-person voting in fairgrounds and sporting arenas.  We processed record-shattering numbers of mail-in ballots. We managed super-sized turnouts.  We did it all that during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Problem was, so much of it had to be done on the fly.  Looking ahead to 2022, we have more time to look around the corner and make plans. Here are three areas to consider:</p>
<p><strong>1. Restore faith: Be ready to tell your story.</strong></p>
<p>Our elections ran securely. The paper ballot moved from the ideal to the norm in swing states with high-profile jurisdictions replacing Direct Recording Electronic devices that lacked paper trails.  Recounts and audits were transparent.  Results were checked and verified.</p>
<p>Even so, more people than ever “argued the calls.” Some produced misleading or easily misunderstood videos that went viral.</p>
<p>Here are some steps we can take at the local, state and federal levels – ahead of 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce videos that outline how we perform PRELAT, maintain a secure chain of custody, process the ballots, and verify the results through post-election canvasses;</li>
<li>Be aware of the optics of our vote-counting processes. Use large labels on all materials, containers, and activity stations. Create signs that state the rules clearly; and,</li>
<li>Make sure all staff understand the importance of defending the integrity of the count.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Voter emails and cell numbers help us function. Let’s build those lists.</strong></p>
<p>Successful Vote By Mail programs included timely emails and text messages to voters. We used these platforms to send applications, confirm ballot returns, and alert voters to problems.</p>
<p>Even so, there is a digital divide with “legacy” voters who registered a decade or more ago. That was before they had their current email addresses, or before they switched from land lines to smart phones.</p>
<p>First, consider adding to your canvass mailing – or in-person ballot applications – a way for voters to submit email addresses and cell numbers.  Make clear that the information is optional – but will help voters if the election agency needs to reach voters in the future. If applicable in your state, make clear that you will safeguard this information.</p>
<p>Second, we need to expand the menus on our states’ online registration platforms.  Currently, these systems let voters: (1) register to vote, and (2) update names and addresses. We should add the options to: (3) add or update an email address, and (4) add or update a cell number.  This will happen only if we all start asking.</p>
<p><strong>3. Brace for late Census data.</strong></p>
<p>The Census Bureau will release 2020 data far later than ever before. This will delay re-districting and may contribute to mistakes and problems with our election calendars. The National Conference of State Legislatures&#8217; Ben Williams<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/redistricting/5-ways-to-handle-census-delays-and-redistricting-deadlines-magazine2021.aspx"> recently wrote some tips</a> for lawmakers to consider.</p>
<p>What can we do at the local level?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-train staff on your mapping systems so that late arrivals of Congressional, state, and local district files do not fall on just one person or a few members of your team.</li>
<li>Meet online with election administrators on the regional and state levels about the challenges that late maps may present for petition circulation, candidate filings, and ballot prep. Build a unified message.</li>
<li>Communicate with legislators at the state, county, and municipal levels about scheduling issues.  Help legislators consider (now) how election codes and calendars may need to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, consider how the Census Bureau will tell more jurisdictions of the need to add one or more languages to ballots and other voting materials.  Census Bureau notices could come in late 2021 – even early or mid-2022.  Is your jurisdiction English-only, but more diverse than it was in 2010? If so, check in with your voting-equipment vendor.  Talk with colleagues in multi-lingual jurisdictions. They can tell you about Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act and how to strengthen community partnerships.  These partners are vital to being able to offer new web content, change printed materials, expand outreach, and recruit bilingual poll workers.</p>
<p>We all face various concerns. One will be budgeting for almost-certain changes in state laws – and programs that we may need to provide in 2022 without the CARES Act funding we received in 2020. Even so, unlike 2020, we have more time to contemplate the issues and do what we do best: plan ahead.</p>

							<h2>In Their Own Words</h2>
														<p><strong>Whose responsibility is it anyway?</strong><br />
<em>How can we create a more truth-based culture?</em></p>
<p>By Kammi Foote, clerk, recorder &amp; registrar of voters<br />
<a href="https://www.inyocounty.us/services/clerk-recorder">Inyo County, California</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6681" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KammiFoote-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KammiFoote-200x300.jpg 200w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KammiFoote-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KammiFoote-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KammiFoote-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KammiFoote.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />The country has been gripped with the aftermath of the Presidential election, marred with accusations of massive voter fraud altering the outcome of the election. As contributing factors emerge to paint a clearer of picture of what led up to the historic second impeachment of the 45th President, we should recognize that all of us as citizens have a responsibility to contribute to a truth-based culture in the United States.</p>
<p>As a public official responsible for conducting elections in Inyo County, California, I experienced firsthand how manipulated facts fueled a national crisis that culminated at the Capital on January 6th. For many citizens, this was the first time experiencing the damage that false accusations can cause.</p>
<p>Having been directly exposed to a conspiracy prior to this election, I view mis-and disinformation as much more menacing to our culture than this single tragic incident.  A few years ago, I found myself at the heart of a small conspiracy when I agreed to help a local family in crisis after their child went missing. Many people who volunteered to help were doxed, maliciously reported to law enforcement, private conversations where shared publicly without permission, false reports were made to their jobs, all which pales in comparison to the stalking and harassment the family continues to endure.  It was very emotional and confusing since I had never experienced anything like it before.</p>
<p>I am not a mental health professional, but I have spent a lot of time reflecting on my own experiences. In my opinion, we need to invest much more research into how the internet is contributing to a less stable society. In the meantime, as individuals, we should develop strategies to deal with harassing behaviors online, and to protect ourselves from unintentionally participating in it. I would encourage readers to do their own research and seek professional support if they find themselves involved in conspiratorial thinking.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987715003643?via%3Dihub"> medical hypotheses</a>, delusions are mistaken and unfounded personal beliefs, when there is superior evidence to the contrary. Once in a delusion, depending on how convinced the person is of the fictitious reality, they will cling to their false beliefs even when presented with conflicting evidence. We see this in politics where officials blame each other for problems, ignoring their own actions leading to current events.</p>
<p>In the situations that I experienced, only parts of relevant information were widely shared. Other evidence was misrepresented, with attempts to set the record straight either ignored or further twisted to feed false narratives.</p>
<p>People often see patterns and connections that are simply not there. We have all likely experienced a form of this at some point in our life &#8211; whether it be an insecurity, a paranoia or leaps in logic that do not add up but play into our biases. In the digital world, these tendencies can increase if they are reinforced by others that have similar beliefs. If gone unchallenged, these delusions can feed into a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2006/03000/Mass_hysteria_revisited.10.aspx#:~:text=A%20common%20trigger%20of%20mass,and%20weakness%20%5B4%E2%80%A2%5D."> mass hysteria</a>. This is a circumstance where many people in a group believe in a delusion, reinforcing each other in their false convictions.</p>
<p>When I found myself mistreated because of rumors and lies, it sometimes felt like nothing that I could do or say could dispel the fabrications. In large part, this was true. Once someone has made up their mind, it can be difficult to convince them otherwise. In the case of elections, I can show public evidence, but people may still choose not to believe it. In the sensitive case of a missing person, there are many things unknown, so the truth is much harder to discern.</p>
<p>In both cases, I chose to approach the skeptics with compassion and empathy. It is easy to take false accusations personally. After all, most of us are not used to being lied about by strangers. In any case, the perceptions of the accusers are real, even if the facts do not support their conclusions. Learning to recognize that many abusive behaviors online are complex and could be the result of underlying mental health disorders, might help you refrain from the impulse to participate in the collective trauma. I asked gentle, logical, and clarifying questions when I felt that someone was acting in good faith and tried to be non-confrontational with those who did not seem to be acting rationally. It is important to be able to recognize real threats and separate that from critical or hurtful comments.</p>
<p>Having people publicly accuse me of motives that I did not possess or thoughts I never considered is likely a result of the perplexing phenomenon known as psychological projection.</p>
<p>According to everydayhealth.com: “<a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/psychological-projection-dealing-with-undesirable-emotions/">Psychological projection</a> is a defense mechanism people subconsciously employ in order to cope with difficult feelings or emotions. Psychological projection involves projecting undesirable feelings or emotions onto someone else, rather than admitting to or dealing with the unwanted feelings. Have you ever disliked someone only to become convinced that the person had a vendetta against you? This is a common example of psychological projection.”</p>
<p>No one can know what another person is thinking unless they explicitly tell you. Even then, it may only be what the person believes at that moment in time, if they are even being truthful in the first place. Just because someone said something in the past, we should not assume that they are incapable of changing their minds, especially if more information materializes. An example is the current health crisis, where it would be illogical to rely on reports from 10 months ago, prior to the emergence of more recent scientific studies.</p>
<p>All of us should make conscious efforts not to assign motives to others or share deceptive information. If you have, it is okay to seek forgiveness if the situation warrants it. We all make mistakes. However, if we fail to recognize our own responsibility to be honest, instead placing the blame at the feet of others, we lose our opportunity to promote a more genuine humanity. It may seem like such a monumental problem that one person’s actions could never make a difference. But, like a pebble dropped into a pond, although the catalyst of the dropping the pebble may seem like one small act, collectively the ripple effect can create powerful waves with significant impacts. If we all commit to this simple philosophy &#8211; to hold ourselves responsible for telling the truth &#8211; my hope is that we can collectively manifest a more positive and truthful world.</p>

Established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the EAC is charged with serving as a clearinghouse for election administration information. To further this mission, the EAC launched the Clearies in 2016 to promote best practices in elections and celebrate the accomplishments of election officials.</p>
<p>The award categories include innovation in election administration; improving accessibility for voters with disabilities; best practices in recruiting, training, and retaining poll workers; and creative and original “I Voted” sticker design. The EAC also announced a new category this year for innovation in election cybersecurity and technology. Winners were selected by two independent panels of election officials from the EAC’s advisory boards with the EAC Commissioners serving as judges for the sticker category. The EAC is grateful for the contributions of this year’s judges.</p>
<p>“This year we are pleased to receive a record-breaking number of 137 Clearie submissions, more than tripling the 2019 submissions,” said EAC Chairman Donald Palmer. “The number of Clearie submissions highlights that even though this was a challenging election year, officials continue to modernize and develop programming that will serve as helpful best practices for the coming years. The job of an election official is never done, and we hope to see even more submissions and exceptional examples in 2021. The Clearie winners, those who submitted entries, and all election officials should be incredibly proud of the work they did to ensure a successful 2020 election. These best practices are valuable resources as officials continue to administer elections during the pandemic and for years to come.”</p>
<p>EAC Commissioner and 2020 Chairman, Ben Hovland said, “During an incredibly challenging year, election officials rose to the occasion by developing new, innovative solutions to serve voters. As a result of their creativity and perseverance, millions of voters had their voices heard in extremely well-run elections with record turnout.”</p>
<p>Now in its fifth year, the Clearie awards recognize the innovative efforts of election officials across America. Entries were judged based on each initiative’s depiction of positive results, innovation, sustainability, outreach efforts, cost-effectiveness, and replicability. More information about each awardee is available on<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDoy6UvR94HEJdppV-2FI4XMyTeWcSEIPk6EJRzRHqYa5MhiDvP0O7Zu7H11M2zmGJv9nrdBVvAx4cxYDebYSAyWSlE-3D0dAZ_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpx5d6nixGvjH702p-2Fp8BULZID9glsMtrTdVHZznMc0gP3-2FGelL08ZNFr5JTQe7PjqWh5c08ZVRAqTNTUBdquv83MD-2BPKPQ3RB1ambZ7yji586FYk0t-2FxV6-2BGRZakjPZbv6DJW1XxChBkAl6Yl5YM8CQlHVehudf3PtILrJPObzrD8yFanP0ECVbklPxE4jfVStnMTDfspYmFAqDK1guM-2Be8hw-2BLNKVO6K3iPPrPchasP-2FfVTbJ1dqueqksXujzg4SRwcPCZC2yCH16WerpEqbYw-3D-3D"> the EAC’s website</a>.</p>

Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says it was found around 9:30 a.m. outside the Lakeside Center at 400 NW Lakeshore Drive and described the device as a metal piece with two end caps, “similar to a pipe bomb.” Fitzgerald said the polling place was closed and as a precaution the other polling places in Ankeny were made aware of the situation and checked out. Police said no other pipe bombs or devices have been found or reported in Ankeny. The device was rendered safe by a technician from the State Fire Marshal’s office. Investigators said it&#8217;s<a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/ankeny-pd-still-trying-to-determine-when-pipe-bomb-was-left-at-polling-location/35717845"> unclear</a> whether there was a target with the pipe bomb. A key reason for the mystery at this point is that it&#8217;s unknown when someone left the device. Investigators are also trying to determine whether surveillance video from the park or home security systems may help them find the person who left the device. ProPublica has a story this week about the<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/after-a-wave-of-violent-threats-against-election-workers-georgia-sees-few-arrests"> violent threats Georgia elections officials and workers received</a> and that there have been relatively few arrests. ProPublica could identify only one case of a Georgia elections-related threat since November that led to an arrest: No arrests were made in any of a dozen or more high-profile cases of politically fueled threats against Georgia&#8217;s governor and secretary of state, all of its state legislators, Fulton County&#8217;s district attorney, and election officials and workers in several counties. Gwinnett County Solicitor-General Brian Whiteside told ProPublica there needs to be a special division of state government tasked with investigating election-related crimes. “I have a deep fear that somebody is going to get hurt out here,” he said. “Because they’re not making enough preventive arrests when these incidents happen.”</p>

According to KATC, Ardoin sent a letter to Paula Tregre, Louisiana’s chief procurement officer, announcing his decision, asking her to remove the bid solicitation from a state website and requesting that she dismiss protests filed by two companies that wanted to seek the work. “I am withdrawing the (request for proposals) to spend the next few months seeking to undo the damage to voter confidence done by those who willfully spread misinformation and disinformation,” Ardoin said in a statement. “We cannot let election administration become just another political football for politicians or voting machine vendors to kick around, without any understanding or concern for the consequences,” Ardoin wrote in the letter. Ardoin said he’ll redo the search in the future, though he gave no date for that plan. Also this week, NPR has a story about the struggle<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972960446/trumps-baseless-2020-conspiracies-complicate-ohio-effort-to-buy-voting-machines"> Stark County, Ohio</a> is having with purchasing new voting equipment due to false claims made by the former president and others about the accuracy of the 2020 election. In December the county BOE voted unanimously to purchase new Dominion voting equipment and since then officials said they have been getting pushback from constituents. &#8220;The board of commissioners has received hundreds of communications from concerned citizens,&#8221; County Commissioner Bill Smith said during a public meeting last month. &#8220;This response from the public has far exceeded the response any of us have received on any topic to come before our board.&#8221; At the meeting, chair of the Starke County BOE Jeff Matthews pushed back. &#8220;Refusing to recognize that this election was safe, secure and accurate can be viewed as nothing less than attacking the peaceful transfer of power,&#8221; Matthews said. &#8220;Some of the claims made about Dominion Voting Systems are beyond absurd and require one to suspend all critical thought.&#8221; In the weeks since that meeting, the county&#8217;s commissioners have yet to approve the $6.5 million contract.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6687" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/King-County-300x172.png" alt="" width="300" height="172" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/King-County-300x172.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/King-County-768x440.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/King-County.png 814w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This week, King County [Washington] Elections</strong> and the Seattle Foundation announced the availability of<a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/2021/March/1-voter-education-fund.aspx"> $950,000 in grants to help break down barriers to voting</a> among historically excluded communities. The grants will go to more than 30 organizations. Focus communities for this grantee cycle include, but are not limited to Black, Indigenous, people of color, people experiencing homelessness, people convicted of a felony, limited-English speaking communities, people with disabilities and youth of color. “As elections administrators it is our democratic duty to ensure every eligible voter has access to the ballot. Confronting the shameful history of voter suppression—that has disproportionately impacted BIPOC communities—is vital to the work we do,” said Julie Wise, King County elections director. “The Voter Education Fund helps us get out the vote by supporting grassroots organizations, who are already putting in the work and have established relationships within their communities, with the resources needed to give everyone a voice. That is democracy in action.” Selected organizations will work to educate, register, familiarize voters with the electoral process through nonpartisan information, and provide culturally appropriate technical assistance during the 2021-2022 election cycles. After an initial pilot program in 2016, the VEF was launched in 2017 with a $435,000 commitment. During the 2019-2020 cycle $950,000 was invested across 39 grantee organizations. Since 2018 VEF community partners have reached 887,608 voters, registered 17,550 people, and held 5,423 community events.</p>

According to Forbes, With the<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/03/02/lebron-james-voting-rights-group-partners-with-nba-to-fight-gop-backed-voter-restrictions/?sh=73c239140ee3"> NBA&#8217;s All-Star Game</a> set to be played Sunday in Atlanta, More Than a Vote says they plan to use the attention the league generates this weekend to highlight pending legislation nationwide that creates barriers to voting, which disproportionately impacts Black Americans and urban communities. “Given that we’ll have a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/nba-lebron-james-group-team-to-fight-voter-suppression-during-all-star-weekend/TRGHKD3XQVEHTP7XD5Y54U6QDI/"> national audience tuning in</a> to watch the All Star Game this weekend in Atlanta, we have a unique opportunity to work together with our partners to shine a spotlight on these voter suppression efforts that target the league’s most loyal fan base and provide fans with the tools they need to fight back,” said Addisu Demissie, the executive director of More Than A Vote. The group’s plans include a social media campaign and interviews with league stars promoting expanded voting rights. “We all need to continue to use our platform,” James<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/lebron-james-nba-georgia-voting.html"> wrote</a> to his 49 million Twitter followers this week.</p>

Small Jr.</a>, formerly the Berkeley County, West Virginia clerk died on February 24. He was 87. Small was first employed in the county clerk’s office in 1956 and only recently retired after decades of service. He was appointed chief deputy clerk on Jan. 2, 1957, and served in that position until the death of then-Clerk Eugene Dunham. He was appointed to the vacated position on Sept. 17, 1971. Small was first officially elected to office in 1974 and was reelected to his position every six years after. “I appreciate the many courtesies and kindness you and your staff have extended to me, you have helped to make my time of service meaningful and enjoyable,” Small wrote in his retirement letter. “The opportunity to serve my neighbors and fellow citizens has been my motivation for more years than I could ever have imagined. I wish each of you well as I move into my retirement and a new part of my life…. I hope to take it easy now, buoyed by my memories, my many friendships and my loving wife Julie.” Small was the longest-serving election official in Berkeley County history. “Over those 64 years of service to the people of this great county, I have witnessed the spectacular growth of Berkeley County and have presided over the growth of this office and its many changes through the years. It has been my great pleasure and good fortune to have served the public…”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6450" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: On Wednesday night, by a vote of 220 to 210, the U.S. House of Representatives approved<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-elections-voting-pelosi-/2021/03/03/e434df58-7c22-11eb-a976-c028a4215c78_story.html"> HR1—the For the People Act</a>. The legislation would<a href="https://apnews.com/article/bills-campaign-finance-voting-rights-legislation-elections-a74d9d8cce567d751021ed66cee2b85f"> create national voting standards</a>, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting. The bill’s voting provisions would guarantee no-excuse mail voting and at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections; require states to use their existing government records to automatically register citizens to vote; restore voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences; and mandate the use of paper ballots.<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-03-03/battle-over-voting-rights-intensifies"> Other provisions</a> would create new disclosure requirements for “dark money” donations to political groups; require states to appoint independent commissions to draw congressional districts; and create new federal standards for election equipment vendors. The bill also would require tech platforms to disclose political advertising information; establish a code of ethics for Supreme Court justices for the first time; restructure the Federal Election Commission to an odd number of members to break partisan deadlocks; and require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns. According to The Washington Post, while virtually all Democrats, including the president, have signaled support for the bill, the solid GOP opposition means the legislation is in deep peril in the Senate, whose rules allow a 41-vote minority to block most legislation from coming to a final vote. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) has made clear that Republicans plan to fight tooth and nail against it. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said this week that she expects to usher companion legislation through the Senate Rules Committee later this spring and ultimately to bring it to the floor. Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said, “If you’re ranking the most important legislation of the year, that is way up there.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas) has introduced the<a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/mar/03/westerman-drafts-voting-bill/"> Verification and Oversight for Transparent Elections, Registration, and Identification, or VOTER ID, Act</a>, Westerman&#8217;s legislation mandates audits of the results of &#8220;each regularly scheduled general election for Federal office held in the State.&#8221; Westerman introduced his legislation after failing, on Monday, to persuade the House Rules Committee to include his provisions in HR1. In addition to checking &#8220;the accuracy of the voting systems used to carry out the election,&#8221; the Hot Springs lawmaker&#8217;s bill would require states to assess whether their elections complied with &#8220;applicable laws, rules and procedures.&#8221; States would have to &#8220;attest&#8221; that they have &#8220;voter identification procedures and practices&#8221; in place as well as a system for keeping voter registration lists up to date. The results would be posted online.</p>
<p>Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) have introduced the<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/02/25/senators-who-voted-to-overturn-election-propose-severe-voting-restrictions-to-restore-confidence/?sh=6df96f3cd8e9"> Save Democracy Act</a>. The bill would institute several new registration requirements for ballot access, including citizenship verification and Social Security numbers, while outlawing automatic voter registration. It would also roll back expansions of mail-in voting former President Donald Trump railed against, setting restrictions on who can submit mail-in ballots, and where and when they can be submitted. The bill requires states to stop automatically sending mail-in ballots to every voter, a system adopted by 9 states, including 5 – Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington – that conduct elections primarily by mail. Finally, the bill would set new regulations for the way in which votes are counted, requiring uninterrupted vote counting, expanded poll-watching access for campaign representatives and audits of vote tabulating systems – all key tenets of Trump’s argument that the 2020 election was “rigged” against him.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> A House committee Wednesday approved legislation that would explicitly ban<a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2021/03/03/alabama-house-committee-approves-curbside-voting-ban/6897195002/"> curbside voting</a> in Alabama. HB 285, sponsored by Rep. Wes Allen, R-Troy, would forbid election workers from setting up curbside drop off areas or setting up voting machines outside a polling place. “This goes to managing, protecting the integrity of the election and the chain of custody from the balance sheet,” Allen said in committee. The measure, if passed, would codify an interpretation of state law by Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, who says curbside voting is prohibited in Alabama and has blocked counties from engaging in it. Civil rights groups, representing plaintiffs with disabilities or who were vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, sued last year to lift the prohibition. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the lawsuits.</p>
<p>House Bill 396, which would have allowed people to vote<a href="https://www.waff.com/2021/03/04/house-bill-allowing-no-excuse-absentee-voting-carried-over/"> absentee without an excuse</a> has been carried over, all but killing the legislation for this year. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill originally supported this bill but has since dropped that support. “We are not proponents of no excuse absentee voting, but wanted to use this vehicle to feature that as an option to pass some other things that were important to us in streamlining the absentee process,” Merrill said. According to WAFF, Merrill is working with other lawmakers on a new proposal to change the deadline for absentee ballot applications to be returned from five days before the election, to ten days.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that will purge people from the<a href="https://ktar.com/story/4120740/bill-purging-arizona-early-voting-list-clears-state-senate/"> permanent early voting list</a> if they skip two consecutive election cycles. The popular “permanent early voting list” allows voters to sign up once and automatically receive a ballot for every election. The bill by Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, would purge people from the list of they skip the primary and general election for two cycles in a row. They would get a letter asking them whether they want to remain on the permanent early voting list and would be removed if they don’t respond. State election officials have said about 200,000 voters currently meet the criteria. The proposal has had an up-and-down route through the Legislature. An identical bill died in the Senate last month when Republican Sen. Paul Boyer joined all 14 Democrats in opposition. Boyer later said he would support it after getting questions answered by lawyers, and it cleared the Senate in a 16-14 vote.</p>
<p>The House has advanced a number of<a href="https://ktar.com/story/4098120/arizona-house-gop-advances-election-bills-aimed-at-tightening-security/"> election-related bills</a> including making same-day voter registration a felony offense, requiring people to specifically ask to register to vote, mandating notices on mailed early ballots telling recipients to “return to sender” if the person no longer lives there and boosting limits on the required disclosure of campaign contributions. Another measure makes it a felony for an election official to send mail ballots to people who hadn’t requested them — a move prompted by a failed proposal last year by Maricopa County’s former recorder to mail all voters ballots during the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5404" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arkansas:</strong><a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/feb/27/online-registration-proposed-voters/"> Online voter registration</a> could come to Arkansas, in part, through the efforts of a Girl Scout, the sponsor of a bill to authorize the change said Friday. “This started when Anna Claire Tilley made a presentation, and it was a good one,” said Rep. Justin Boyd, R-Fort Smith, sponsor of House Bill 1517. The House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee recommended the bill Wednesday. Tilley spoke to a meeting of the state agencies committee in March of last year, part of her efforts to encourage online voting. Tilley is a student time at Southside High School in Fort Smith. Getting her state to approve online voting began as a Girl Scout project, according to news accounts. Her proposal was studied in the interim between legislative sessions, Boyd said, and the bill introduced after the Legislature’s regular session began in January. Gaining committee approval in the sponsor’s chamber of the Legislature is only the first step in passing a bill after filing it. The next step will be harder, Boyd said. The change in the bill would affect laws implementing Amendment 51 to the state’s constitution, which concerns voter registration. Voters passed Amendment 51 in 1964, setting up the voter registration system used since. Bills affecting voter-approved constitutional amendments require a two-thirds super-majority to pass, Boyd said. Amendment 51 passed in the civil rights era, repealing requirements such as such as poll taxes, used to suppress votes from Black Arkansans.</p>
<p>Gov. Asa Hutchinson said this week that he will sign HB1112 into law. The legislation requires a<a href="https://katv.com/news/local/arkansas-governor-signing-voter-id-bill-into-law"> photo ID</a> or a provisional ballot and also eliminates signature verification of provisional ballots. The new law will need to be monitored, he said, to ensure that voters are receiving proper assistance in obtaining an ID. If they are not, Hutchinson said Arkansas&#8217; General Assembly will need to change the law. Lawmakers opposed to the legislation argued that 2020 election about 2,700 provisional ballots with sworn signatures were tabulated, and there was not a single instance of voter fraud with those ballots. But Lowery said it took weeks in some cases to count provisional ballots and election workers don’t have the training to verify signatures.</p>

The House voted along party lines, 97-72. Democrats opposing the legislation said it creates obstacles for voting that will do more to reduce turnout than increase election security. The measure that passed the Georgia House,<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/531"> House Bill 531</a>, would limit ballot drop boxes to locations inside early voting locations, reduce “Souls to the Polls” voting events to one Sunday during early voting, and require voters to provide a driver’s license number, state ID number or copy of photo ID to request absentee ballots. In addition, the measure would set a deadline for requesting absentee ballots 11 days before election day, ban organizations from distributing grants to help fund elections and prohibit distributing food and drink to voters waiting in line. The bill now heads to the state Senate. In response to concerns about House Bill 531, House Speaker David Ralston announced a plan to offer<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/free-georgia-photo-id-card-proposed-for-absentee-voting-requirements/SKID6EFSRVD75GLRFPVKIUHI7E/"> free Georgia ID cards</a> that could be used for voting, opening bank accounts and traveling on airlines.</p>

Senators voted 26-9 to send to the House the measure that backers say is needed to give rural voters more say in the process, noting the state is growing rapidly especially in urban areas. Opponents argued the measure violates the Idaho Constitution because it makes getting initiatives on ballots nearly impossible, giving a single district veto power. Current rules require signatures from 6% of registered voters in each of 18 districts in 18 months, plus a number of signatures that equals 6% or all registered voters in the state. The proposed law would change that to requiring 6% of registered voters in all 35 Idaho legislative districts in 18 months. Backers of the bill said that under current rules, signature gatherers could get all the signatures they need in the 18 districts in just a handful of counties that contain urban areas.</p>

The bill that has several significant changes from the bill that was pulled from the House floor earlier this month after debate tilted toward almost certain defeat. The new bill changes from two to six the number of ballots a single family member can deliver. It also redefines family to include adopted children. The proposed law limits who can handle multiple ballots to election officials, U.S. postal service workers and parcel delivery services.</p>

House Bill 574 keeps several of the emergency measures enacted in last year&#8217;s elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which factored into a record number of Kentuckians turning out to vote. The original version of HB 574 included four days of early voting, but the committee substitute passed Thursday lowered this to three days, with its lead sponsor saying this was one of several compromises to give the bill a chance of passing both chambers. Secretary of State Michael Adams testified to the committee and called the bill a major step forward for improving voting access while maintaining the integrity of elections, noting many other states are taking the opposite approach. House Bill 574 would also: Allow counties to continue operating voting centers where anyone in the county could vote in-person early and on Election Day, as well as maintain drop boxes where voters can submit absentee ballots; Keep the process adopted last year in which voters can cure absentee ballots of deficiencies, such as one missing a signature; Include new vote integrity measures to prohibit ballot harvesting, in which people collect others&#8217; completed absentee ballots and turn them in; Require counties to purchase voting machines allowing for paper ballots or a verified paper trail when replacing old equipment; and Improve the ability of state elections officials to purge individuals from the voting rolls when informed they are voting in another state.</p>

Members of the House Elections and Elected Officials Committee discussed only allowing Missouri voters to use paper ballots. Rep. Peggy McGaugh (R-Carrollton) is the sponsor of<a href="https://fox2now.com/news/lawmakers-discuss-doing-away-with-presidential-primary-election-for-missouri-voters/"> House Bill 1065, a large election bill</a>, which includes doing away with Missourians voting in the presidential preference primary election. “It totally eliminates that particular primary that is held every four years,” McGaugh said. She said that election costs the state $9 million. Election clerks from around the state testified in favor of the bill. HB 1065 would also allow an absentee ballot to count if the voter dies after the ballot is cast. McGaugh testified saying some counties count the vote while others don’t. Under McGaugh’s bill, local election authorities wouldn’t have to wait until election day to count absentee ballots. It would allow for absentee ballots to be considered “cast” the day they are received, meaning it can be counted. Another piece of the legislation would allow those using an absentee ballot without an excuse would have three weeks to fill out their ballot, instead of six, but then voters would be able to return it to a drop box.</p>

House Bill 406, sponsored by Rep. Mark Noland, R-Bigfork, proposes several tweaks to the Ballot Interference Protection Act. The law was passed overwhelmingly by voters in a 2018 ballot referendum, but was ruled unconstitutional by a pair of state district judges last year. Noland’s bill would remove a six-ballot limit on the practice, while tightening other restrictions and creating a statewide registry of anyone allowed to turn in another person’s ballot, including members of the same family or household.</p>
<p>The House meanwhile sank a pair of Democrat-sponsored election bills, including House Bill 441, which would have<a href="https://ravallirepublic.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_0ee6f1b6-1e05-5d14-b76f-f065250106f8.html"> allowed students under the age of 18 to serve as election judges</a>. The sponsor, Rep. Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, framed the legislation as a means to relieve election offices that have struggled to attract enough volunteers to adequately staff polling places. It failed to pass 39-61.</p>

Sharon Stewart-Peregoy, D-Crow Agency,<a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/HB0613.pdf"> House Bill 613</a> would require at least two permanent satellite election offices for each federally recognized tribe and require precinct polling place notices to include locations on reservations. It would also authorize the use of nontraditional addresses for voters. &#8220;This (bill) is very important in the respect that it&#8217;s really looking at ensuring our rights as citizens are not undercut,&#8221; said Stewart-Peregoy. Keaton Sunchild, political director for Western Native Voice who worked closely with Stewart-Peregoy on the bill, said the HB 613 symbolizes progress. &#8220;This bill will do nothing but push us forward and make Montana one of the leaders in the United States in terms of Native voting rights. &#8230; For far too long, people in power have tried to silence the Native vote, and we think this is our best chance to make our voices heard,&#8221; he said.</p>

Now, the bill awaits passage in the Assembly, but the timeline in that chamber remains unclear. “It’s a bit alarming that a simple bill seeking to chop away at Jim Crow-era voter bans has not yet passed in the New York State Assembly,” Nick Encalada-Malinowski, civil rights campaign director at VOCAL-NY, said in a statement. The legislation, sponsored for the past decade by Assembly Member Danny O’Donnell, is still in committee. It has come close to getting approved in the chamber in past years, but it’s never actually come up for a vote. O’Donnell spokesperson Gabriel Lewenstein said they have “productive conversations” and that they’re “optimistic” it will soon get passed in the chamber.</p>

Jose Menendez filed Senate Bill 408 to bridge what he calls a voting equality gap and the need to<a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/03/03/new-bill-would-mandate-more-polling-locations-on-public-college-campuses-in-texas/"> make voting more accessible to a younger population</a> of Texans. The bill would mandate that a number of polling sites be located on public college campuses each election cycle. “I would like to designate two locations on a campus if a school has at least 10,000 students, and we’re requiring an additional poll for every additional 10,000,” Menendez said.</p>
<p>Texas Rep. Jared Patterson (R-Frisco) filed a bill Thursday that would<a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/politics/article/Bill-Texas-legislature-early-voting-hours-15982883.php"> restrict polling hours during early voting</a> to between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. The bill is a direct response to Harris County&#8217;s voting expansion for the 2020 election. Harris County opened seven voting locations for over 24 hours as part of the effort to expand voting access during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>

I think that there is integrity to the ballot,” said the floor sponsor of<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0152.html"> HB152</a>, Sen. Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork.<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0152.html"> HB152</a> would limit candidates to their given name or a nickname that they’ve “generally been known” by for at least five years and they have “documentary evidence” as proof. It had initially failed to pass in the House on Feb. 4, but it was reconsidered a day later and passed 46-24. “(This bill) puts the lieutenant governor’s office in a position where there’s a First Amendment problem,” argued Sen. Daniel McCay, R-Riverton. He also questioned whether the bill was more centered on a “personal pet peeve” than any real policy concern. The Senate voted down the bill 2-22.</p>

Tarra Simmons, that would make it so that a<a href="https://mynorthwest.com/2633791/bill-washington-felons-voting-rights-passes-state-house/?"> former felon would be eligible to vote</a> the moment they are no longer incarcerated, and would retain that right regardless of whether or not they can pay off post-incarceration expenses. Rep. Simmons — who made history in 2020 after becoming the first former inmate elected to the Washington Legislature — believes that this proposal is integral in helping people reintegrate into society after prison. “My being here today as a state legislator is directly tied to the ability several years ago to successfully reenter the community after incarceration and become a voter again,” she said. “When someone is trying to rebuild their life and feel like they are a real part of their community, it’s just common sense that we should give them the kinds of support that we can.” Co-sponsor Rep. Roger Goodman also<a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/opinion/contributors/2018/11/08/restoring-felons-voting-rights-might-also-decrease-crime/1925398002/"> pointed to data</a> that indicates restored voting rights for felons can actually reduce the rate of recidivism, and by extension, crime rates as well.</p>
<p>A bill that would<a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/feb/25/state-house-passes-bill-to-exempt-certain-election/"> exempt certain election security information from public records</a> disclosures passed the state House of Representatives last week. The bill passed 61-37, with many Republicans saying they oppose exempting more from the Public Records Act, which requires all state and local governmental entities to make public records available to the public. The bill exempts the following: continuity of operations plans for elections; security audits; security risk assessments; security test results that relate to physical security or cybersecurity of election operations or infrastructure. The legislation would still allow the public to access information on security breaches or audits about those breaches.</p>

Another bill GOP lawmakers introduced would allow municipalities to begin counting absentee ballots the day before an election if they meet certain requirements, a fix that elections officials have previously called for as they dealt with a surge in absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet another piece of legislation Republicans proposed Friday would give district attorneys broader jurisdiction over alleged election violations in order to resolve election law disputes more quickly. The proposed legislation, which is very early in the legislative process, follows an extremely fraught presidential election in which former President Donald Trump made repeated unfounded claims questioning the integrity of the election, which has led to public distrust about the election result. Republican lawmakers cited such distrust as a reason for some of the legislation proposed Friday.</p>

The vote in favor of<a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/HB0075"> House Bill 75</a> was 51-9 in favor. Opponents of the bill have generally characterized the bill as a solution in search of a problem since even most supporters of the measure don&#8217;t claim that voter fraud is a big problem in the state. Under the bill, accepted identification would include a driver&#8217;s license from any U.S. state or territory, a Medicare insurance card, a tribal I.D., a U.S. passport or military card, or a school ID from the University of Wyoming, any Wyoming community college or public school. A voter ID bill was defeated in 2019 in the Wyoming House by a 30-29 margin. But since this year&#8217;s measure is co-sponsored by roughly 2/3 of the legislature, it would seem pretty likely to win legislative approval this time around.</p>

Democratic National Committee</a>, an Arizona voting rights case. According to published reports, the Court<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972935032/supreme-court-seems-ready-to-uphold-restrictive-voting-laws"> seemed ready to uphold</a> the election restrictions in Arizona and to make it harder to challenge a variety of limitations on voting. The immediate question for the justices was whether two Arizona measures ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. One of the measures requires election officials to discard ballots cast at the wrong precinct. The other makes it a crime for campaign workers, community activists and most other people to collect ballots for delivery to polling places, a practice critics call “ballot harvesting.” Much of the argument centered on that larger issue in the case of what standard courts should apply to challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The court’s answer to that question could determine the fate of scores if not hundreds of laws addressing election rules in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason said that the<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/02/26/judge-says-maricopa-county-must-provide-2020-ballots-arizona-senate/6825892002/"> subpoenas issued by the Arizona Senate are valid</a> and Maricopa County must turn over ballots from the November general election to the Arizona Senate and provide the Senate access to its voting machines so it can conduct an audit. Thomason said he disagreed with the county&#8217;s arguments that they were unlawful and that the county legally could not hand over the ballots. In response, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers said in a statement Friday afternoon that the county &#8220;will immediately start working to provide the Arizona Senate with the ballots and other materials.&#8221; &#8220;We hope senators will show the same respect and care we have for the 2.1 million private ballots and use them in service of their legislative duties,&#8221; Sellers said. The Senate wants another audit of ballots and a careful check of voter information, while the county believes its multiple audits have been sufficient and says the ballots must remain sealed under state law. Thomason emphasized in his ruling that he did not want to wade into the politics of the issue. He said the Senate has broad authority to issue subpoenas, and the Senate&#8217;s reasoning to issue them — to see if there are changes that could be made to state law to further protect the integrity of elections — was valid.</p>

District Attorney Fani Willis hasn’t said exactly what her prosecutors seek, but she sent recent letters to Gov. Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and other state officials last month directing them to preserve documents. She indicated she’s investigating several state crimes, including solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and involvement in violence or threats related to the election’s administration. Georgia State University law professor Clark Cunningham believes Willis has the makings of a “pretty compelling narrative of a conspiracy” that sought to prevent state electors from casting their votes for Biden.</p>

In the ruling, Weill not only calls for a new election but also finds evidence of fraud and criminal activity, in how absentee ballots were handled, how votes were counted, and the actions by some at the polling place. In his ruling, the judge said that sixty-six of eighty-four absentee ballots cast in the June runoff were not valid and should never have been counted. Nicholas Holliday was declared the winner by a 37 vote margin. Robert Devaull challenged the results in court. Weill found many irregularities with absentee ballots. He issued a bench warrant for notary Dallas Jones, who notarized absentee ballots. During a hearing, Jones admitted violating notary duties. The judge also found that 83 regular ballots were counted without being initialed by election workers. Weill also said there was clear evidence of voter intimidation and harassment at the polling place on election day. State law says candidates and supporters must stay at least 150 feet away from the polling place. In his ruling, the judge said Holliday, along with Police Chief Henry Randle, and former Mayor Maurice Howard acted as if they were above the law, repeatedly violating criminal statutes.</p>

The bureau announced earlier this month that &#8220;COVID-19-related shifts in data collection&#8221; and processing would push the delivery of population data states need for redistricting from March 31 to Sept. 30.  That&#8217;s a problem for Ohio where voters recently installed a new process for drawing districts. State House and Senate maps are constitutionally required by Sept. 1 with the federal Congressional maps due Sept. 30. State lawmakers have already said they won&#8217;t be able to meet those deadlines. And voting rights groups worry some of the gerrymandering protections they gained through these reforms will get pushed to the side for the sake of time. The suit argues that Congress could vote to delay the data, but the bureau couldn&#8217;t because the deadline was written in law.  “Laws cannot be arbitrarily changed by administrative fiat,” Yost said in a statement. “Even if it’s inconvenient, the Census Bureau must do its job.” Federal law imposes a March 31 deadline, &#8220;not an aspirational target date,&#8221; attorneys for the state wrote in the complaint.</p>

Tim Rudd, R-Murfreesboro, has filed a resolution calling for the legislature to form a committee and<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/27/tennessee-rep-calls-removal-nashville-judge-over-absentee-voting-order/6833931002/"> remove Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle </a>from the bench. Rudd, who chairs the House subcommittee on elections and campaign finance, said he filed the bill in response to<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/20/tennessee-absentee-ballot-application-updated-removes-covid-19-language-november-election/5605418002/"> Lyle’s ruling last year that expanded absentee voting</a> — an action he deemed as judicial overreach. “What Chancellor Lyle did was illegally interfering our election process by trying to suspend state law and implement her own policies, which is blatantly against the law,” he told The Tennessean. The judge handled a lawsuit filed last year in Davidson County Chancery Court asking the court to confirm COVID-19 concerns were a valid excuse for not voting in person under existing Tennessee law.  Rudd argues Lyle overstepped her authority in ordering the state to interpret the law that way. Rudd said Lyle could either declare the existing state elections law unconstitutional or rule to uphold the law. But he said she did neither. “She can only throw out a law and declare it unconstitutional. She cannot replace it,” he said. “She just superseded state law.” Rudd said he has gathered 64 co-sponsors and expects to bring it to a House vote within the next two weeks. If both legislative chambers vote in favor, an ad hoc joint committee will be formed to discuss Lyle’s removal, he said. The state constitution allows the removal of judges or state&#8217;s attorneys &#8220;for cause&#8221; with a two-thirds majority vote in both houses.</p>

The case had already been rejected by lower courts. A judge in Wisconsin said Powell’s requests for relief were beyond the court’s powers to address “absent the mythical time machine.” “The Supreme Court&#8217;s failure to date to address the massive election fraud and multiple constitutional violations that  wrought a coup of the presidency of the greatest country in world history completes the implosion of each of our three branches of government into the rubble of a sinkhole of corruption,” Powell said in an email to Forbes this week. “It is an absolute tragedy for the Rule of Law, the future of what was a Republic, and all freedom-loving people around the world.”</p>

While election offices across the country were already planning for a high profile election, Covid-19 and related public health measures caused major disruption. The new America Goes to the Polls report, a collaboration between Nonprofit VOTE and the U.S. Elections Project, digs deep into the data to not only rank all 50 states by their official voter turnout numbers, but also to examine how policies like Same Day Registration and Vote at Home (which many states expanded in light of the pandemic) made a real impact on the U.S. electorate. Join Dr. Michael McDonald of U.S. Elections Project and Nonprofit VOTE&#8217;s own Caroline Mak as they explore the data and policies that drive turnout. <strong>When:</strong> March 11, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://elections.wisc.edu/restoring-election-confidence/">Restoring Confidence in the U.S. Election System</a>: The 2020 presidential election shook public confidence in the U.S. election system, leading to dozens of lawsuits and an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Join a virtual panel of experts as they offer recommendations about how to go about the vital task of rebuilding public trust in the administration of elections. <strong>When:</strong> March 16 at 4pm CST. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
