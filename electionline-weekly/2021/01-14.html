							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>High Turnout Wide Margins</strong><br />
<em>Local election officials launch election admin podcast</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Sometimes, good things really can come from Twitter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6462" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HTWM-298x300.png" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HTWM-298x300.png 298w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HTWM-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HTWM.png 668w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" />As a relatively new clerk,<a href="https://www.showmeboone.com/clerk/"> Boone County, Missouri</a> Clerk Brianna Lennon wanted to know if anyone knew of resources to help share election administration information that went beyond policy and reform and focused on bureaucratic questions like, how many employees work in your office and how do you cross-train or how do you decide what ballot styles you&#8217;ll use for each election.</p>
<p>“I put the question out to Twitter on a whim and got such an overwhelmingly supportive response that a podcast would be useful that it didn&#8217;t take long to pull it together, especially with Eric&#8217;s help,” Lennon said. “The goal is to provide other election authorities with new ideas and answer questions for people new to the space who might not necessarily know where to start.”</p>
<p>The Eric that Lennon is talking about is<a href="https://stlouiscountymo.gov/st-louis-county-government/board-of-elections/"> St. Louis County, Missouri</a> director of elections Eric Fey and the two have teamed up to create an elections administration-focused podcast called<a href="https://anchor.fm/highturnoutwidemargins"> High Turnout, Wide Margins</a>.</p>
<p>Since debuting in the waning days of 2020, Lennon and Fey have dropped four more podcasts with the latest arriving today and featuring<a href="https://anchor.fm/highturnoutwidemargins/episodes/EAC-and-the-VVSG-with-Ben-Hovland-eoospg"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission Chairman Ben Hovland discussing the EAC and VVSG</a>.</p>
<p>Previous episodes have included:<a href="https://anchor.fm/highturnoutwidemargins/episodes/Election-Security-with-Noah-Praetz-eof1mc"> Election Security with Noah Praetz</a>,<a href="https://anchor.fm/highturnoutwidemargins/episodes/Election-Mail-with-Tammy-Patrick-eok1mt"> Election Mail with Tammy Patrick</a> and<a href="https://anchor.fm/highturnoutwidemargins/episodes/Clerking-in-Smaller-Counties-with-Batina-Dodge-eok1tc"> Clerking in Smaller Counties with Scotland County, Missouri Clerk Batina Dodge</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_6461" style="width: 296px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6461" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-6461" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lennon-286x300.png" alt="" width="286" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lennon-286x300.png 286w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lennon.png 670w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6461" class="wp-caption-text">Brianna Lennon</p></div>
<p>Both Fey and Lennon had appeared in podcasts before, but neither one had ever hosted or produced their own. Lennon said it&#8217;s as pared-down as possible. She bought a USB microphone, split a Zoom subscription with Fey, created an Anchor account, and edits on a free download of Audacity.</p>
<p>“It is really just the two of us, but mostly Brianna,” explained Fey about the production of the podcast. “We collaborate on topics and timing, but Brianna does all of the editing.”</p>
<p>So far they’ve had 400 total plays which averages out to 60-150 plays per episode so far and Lennon said the reaction from people has been really positive.</p>
<p>“Five stars. I’m their #1 fan. It’s the podcast we need, when we need it,” said Alysoun McLaughlin, deputy election director in<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/elections/index2.html"> Montgomery County, Maryland</a>. “And they’re really good at it. At a time when most election officials are still nursing our wounds from 2020, it’s invigorating to see Brianna and Eric put so much creativity and enthusiasm into this podcast.”</p>
<p>Lennon and Fey said whole experience has been really surprising and surprisingly fun.</p>
<div id="attachment_6460" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6460" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-6460" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fey-285x300.png" alt="" width="285" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fey-285x300.png 285w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fey.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6460" class="wp-caption-text">Eric Fey</p></div>
<p>“I really only wanted to do this because I thought it would be fun and I would get to commiserate with folks in the election community,” Fey said. “That is what I like best about attending conferences anyway and we haven’t been able to attend any in a while. I was joking about having 4-5 listeners, but not by much. The elections community is small and I really didn’t think anyone would care to listen to a couple of Missourians. The feedback, though, seems to be positive so far and a bunch of people have asked to be on an episode.”</p>
<p>Lennon said the target is to keep the episodes at 60 minutes or less.</p>
<p>“30-40 minutes ends up being a target, both because I think it&#8217;s a more digestible format (you can listen to it on a commute or lunch break) and because, any longer than that, I think the conversation can get derailed,” Lennon said.</p>
<p>Future topics include poll worker training, election Twitter, state/county relationships, and reporting on elections. Although they say they don’t have any hard and fast rules about topics to cover, they are really trying for now to focus on the  nuts and bolts of running elections.</p>
<p>“Most of the things I know about elections I’ve learned from listening to other election administrators of all stripes and backgrounds,” Fey said. “That is what I hope to continue to do by having this podcast. It would also be great if a few of my colleagues around the country could pick up a couple of nuggets from it as well. It we can accomplish that then I consider the endeavor a success.”</p>

The Clearinghouse Awards, also referred to as the “Clearies,” honor the enterprising spirit and hard work of election officials across the country. In the challenging circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis, the Clearies offer the opportunity to recognize the resourcefulness of officials who adjusted their efforts to account for the ever-evolving pandemic. This year, the EAC is also pleased to offer a new category distinguishing cybersecurity and technology initiatives that improve election security of voting systems and strengthen U.S. elections.</p>
<p>The EAC will present awards in the categories of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities,</li>
<li>Outstanding Innovations in Elections,</li>
<li>Best Practices in Recruiting, Retaining, and Training Poll Workers,</li>
<li>Creative and Original “I Voted” Stickers, and</li>
<li>Outstanding Innovation in Election Cybersecurity and Technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jurisdictions of all sizes are encouraged to submit their work. Entries must be received by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, January 22, 2021</strong></span>. Submissions will be judged on innovation, sustainability, outreach, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and the generation of positive results.</p>
<p>“The 2020 Clearie Awards will help recognize the innovation and hard work of election officials across the nation during an extremely well-run general election with record turnout,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “Election officials did an amazing job this fall as they navigated unprecedented health concerns due to COVID-19, a substantial increase in early and mail or absentee voting, and poll worker shortages. The best practices developed from 2020 will be highly valuable for future elections. The EAC Commissioners look forward to honoring these hard-working public servants who do so much to serve voters and further our democracy.”</p>
<p>The 2020 Clearies will build on the successes of past years, encouraging innovations in election administration and publicizing achievements across the elections community. Under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the EAC is charged with serving as a clearinghouse for election administration information. The Clearies and the efforts they celebrate play an important role in helping the EAC fulfill this mission.</p>

Under state law, Trump&#8217;s campaign had to pay $3 million before the recount could begin. But after the recount, Republican members fo the finance committee  prevented the state election commission from reimbursing the counties because they wanted to review receipts. “Although the receipts from Dane and Milwaukee counties have raised concerns, we now have the information we need to approve their request,&#8221; said a statement from Rep. Mark Born of Beaver Dam, a co-chairman of the committee. The other co-chairman of the committee, Sen. Howard Marklein of Spring Green, said lawmakers would consider changing how much election officials can bill campaigns for future recounts. “We continue to have concerns about the high hourly rate paid to workers, expensive rental costs when we have county-owned buildings sitting empty and inflated operational expenses. We plan to consider options for the future. This committee will protect the state’s checkbook,&#8221; Marklein said in a statement. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, That drew a rebuke from Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, a Democrat, who noted the state wasn&#8217;t paying for anything.  &#8220;What &#8216;state checkbook&#8217; are they talking about?  The recount was funded by the Trump campaign,&#8221; McDonell wrote in an email to the paper. Recount workers in Dane County were paid $30 an hour, which McDonell said was necessary because of the risks of the coronavirus pandemic. Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said he was glad the funding was being released but that there was “no legitimate basis for objecting to reimbursing us for the cost of the recount in the first place, as all of our expenses were reasonable and necessary.”</p>

The room will be renamed the &#8220;Willis C. &#8220;Bill&#8221; Bullard Conference Room,&#8221; according to the board resolution, which will need full board approval as it allocates up to $15,000 for the  renaming.  Bullard, a Republican, served in the State Legislature, both the House and Senate, from 1982 to 2002. He then was elected to the Oakland County Board of Commissioners where he served four terms, including six years as chairman. In 2010, Bullard succeeded Ruth Johnson as Oakland County Clerk/Register of Deeds when she was elected Secretary of State. He was defeated for re-election to a full term as county clerk in 2012 by Oakland County Clerk Lisa Brown, who also defeated Bullard in the 2016 general election. Bullard started his political career in 1978 when he was elected Highland Township Trustee and served in that position for two years before being elected Highland Township Supervisor.</p>

Democrats and Republicans have largely butted heads on steps necessary, beyond funding, to ensure elections were safe from foreign interference, with Republicans often raising concerns that legislation proposed by Democrats may serve to federalize elections. With the House and Senate controlled by opposing parties, Congress was largely unable to address election security concerns beyond funding. But as power shifts to Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the White House, key senators are already planning to make a new push for election reform and security legislation. “Free and fair elections are central to our Democracy and our identity as Americans, which is why I’m going to continue working to ensure that our elections remain safe, transparent, and free from foreign influence,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the incoming Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told <em>The Hill.</em></p>

The bill will provide for the hours of operation for each advance voting center; require judges of probate to manage advance voting; and require appointing boards to appoint poll workers to work at advance voting centers. The bill will be referred to the House committee on Construction, Campaigns and Elections upon the convening of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 2.</p>

Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Willimantic, said the proposal to continue the mail-in balloting was being accelerated because of the pending special session in February for a Stamford Senate seat, as well as upcoming May elections in some towns and cities, to allow residents to avoid polling places in the pandemic. There are pending proposals to change the state Constitution to allow a range of election reforms to make it easier for voters, but they will require statewide votes in 2022 or 2024, and will come before the committee later in the session, which ends June 9. An executive order from Gov. Ned Lamont allowed no-excuse mail-in balloting in the party primaries last summer.</p>

But Kemp said he unequivocally supported measures to tighten voter ID laws for mail-in ballots. “It’s a simple way to make sure that type of voting is further secured, and it’s a good first place to start,” Kemp said, adding: “It’s completely reasonable in this day and time, and in light of what’s going on, it would give all voters peace of mind and wouldn’t be restrictive.”</p>

The bill would require election authorities to accept mail-in ballots that were submitted without sufficient postage and allow election authorities to set up collection sites or drop-boxes that accept ballots without postage. Lawmakers approved those measures last spring for the 2020 election in order to accommodate concerns about voting in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic. But those earlier expansions of mail-in voting expired on Jan. 1. The bill&#8217;s sponsor, Edwardsville Democratic Rep. Katie Stuart, said those vote-by-mail provisions were successful in the 2020 general election and should continue in the upcoming consolidated elections. The consolidated primary election is scheduled for Feb. 23. &#8220;This will be permanent because our election authorities who chose to use it found it was successful,&#8221; Stuart said.</p>

As the Ranking Minority Member of the House Elections and Apportionment Committee, Pfaff will support the House Democratic Caucus’ initiative to allow no-excuse absentee voting in future elections and enact a fair redistricting process. She also plans to reintroduce her bill that will allow same-day registration at the polls and extend voting hours to 8 p.m. “Voters should choose their representative, not the other way around,” said Pfaff. “It’s my mission to ensure that the voting process is not only easier and safer, but also better represents the people of Indiana by creating an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission that is fair, impartial, and transparent. We must remove the hurdles that stand in the way of Hoosiers participating in democracy.”</p>

Rebecca Rausch (D) has filed a bill to change state election law to<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bill-voting-mail-permanent-ma-125648132.html"> expand no-excuse mail voting</a> to voters in any state, municipal or special election. Rausch&#8217;s bill not only expands mail-in voting to everyone, it also mandates infrastructure upgrades. Cities and towns would have to provide ballot drop boxes, and Galvin would have to create a dedicated portal where voters could register for mail-in status. The bill would also grant permanent mail voting status to anyone who wants it. During the 2020 elections, voters had to request mail-in ballots before each election. Rausch&#8217;s bill would also allow clerks to place mail-in ballots into voting tabulator machines before Election Day — a key provision to prevent counting delays. In the September Democratic primary, the results of the 4th Congressional District were delayed by several days after about 3,000 mail-in votes in Franklin were misplaced.</p>

The bill establishes a new voter identification card free-of-charge to individuals who lack proper identification and cannot afford it. The legislation would require voters to produce valid, government-issued photo identification when voting in person or by absentee ballot. Individuals unable to provide valid proof of identity or residence would be able to cast a provisional ballot, affording the voter a period of time in which they could obtain valid identification. Same-day voter registration would also remain intact.</p>

The legislation is in response to election irregularities. Onder says occurred in many states during the 2020 presidential election. Onder’s bill would prohibit the exclusive use of electronic vote tabulation in Missouri, and require that every citizen’s vote is recorded on a paper ballot, which can be verified in the event of discrepancies.</p>

Slama said her constitutional amendment (LR3CA) requiring voters to bring their photo to the polls — a proposal that has been introduced nine out of the past 10 years — would &#8220;combat voter fraud&#8221; and &#8220;preserve public confidence in the legitimacy of the elected government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Carol Blood introduced LB 11 to the legislature. The bill would allow there to be an electronic process for a registered voter<a href="https://nebraska.tv/news/local/legislature-introduces-bills-related-to-early-voting-and-covid-19-exposure"> to request an early voting ballot</a> using the Secretary of State&#8217;s Website.

The measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Andrew Zwicker (D-South Brunswick), would provide a 14-day early voting period beginning 15 days before the day of a general or May municipal election — but only in towns that pass an ordinance approving early voting — ending on the Sunday before election day. It would also appropriate funds for election officials to purchase electronic poll books and voting machines that can interface with them.</p>

There were nine measures passed Monday. They include: legalizing drop boxes for absentee ballots, decreasing the rate absentee ballots are denied, providing a system for absentee ballot tracking, speeding up ballot counting, and sending a constitutional amendment to voters to allow universal no-excuse voting absentee ballot.</p>
<p>As part of his 2021<a href="https://thefulcrum.us/cuomo-voting-reform"> State of the State agenda</a>, Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to extend the early voting period, make voting by mail more accessible and speed up the ballot counting process. These reforms would build on election changes the state has made in recent years. &#8220;Our election system, on which our democracy is built, has, and continues to be, under attack by those seeking to undermine the founding principles of our nation and we must not only protect it, but ensure it can be accessed by all,&#8221; Cuomo said in his<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-proposal-historic-new-york-state-election-reform-part-2021-state-state"> announcement</a>. The governor is now calling on state legislators to put a no-excuse absentee voting amendment on the ballot for voters to decide next fall. Cuomo&#8217;s other proposals only require approval by the Legislature. In addition to expanding who can vote by mail, Cuomo also wants to give New Yorkers more time to request an absentee ballot. Currently, voters cannot request a mail ballot more than a month prior to Election Day, putting pressure on election administrators to fulfill requests in a short amount of time. Cuomo plans to advance legislation allowing voters to request mail ballots 45 days ahead of an election.</p>

The Senate State Affairs Committee has agreed to sponsor<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/22029"> Senate Bill 24</a>. That’s the same committee where Republican senators stopped HB 1050 in March on a party-line vote. The bill had made it through the House 41-26, with only Republicans opposing it.

He lost to Democrat challenger Liz Snyder by just 11 votes.  Alaska’s Supreme Court agreed with a lower Superior Court ruling on Friday shortly after justices heard arguments in the case. Pruitt’s lawyer, told the court that the Division of Elections mishandled how it moved the polling location in that East Anchorage district. She argued that the state didn’t give voters enough time or notice to find their new polling location. A Superior Court found in late December that the state could have done more but had acted in “good faith.” And the state’s lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Laura Fox told the court that the state had acted reasonably, especially given the extraordinary events of the pandemic.</p>

The Arizona Constitution’s purpose in allowing cities to adopt charters was to give them control of matters of purely local concern, said Jean-Jacques Cabou, an attorney for the city. And in this case, he said, Tucson voters have said they like having their elections in odd-numbered years so that local issues do not get swept up in, and buried under, debates about who should be president or governor or about statewide ballot issues. “Let’s be clear: The electors of the city of Tucson have consistently and very recently have said, ‘We want odd-year elections, leave us alone,’” he told the justices, noting that Tucson voters decided as recently as November 2018 to keep their odd-year elections. According to Capitol Media Services, what the justices decide will have implications beyond Tucson. There are 19 communities in the state that have taken advantage of a provision in the Arizona Constitution allowing them to adopt charters to govern local matters which, until now, have included things like terms of office and when to hold elections.</p>

In fact, Farnsworth is no longer a state senator. But Thomason noted that Fann and Sen. Warren Petersen, who succeeded Farnsworth as chair of the Judiciary Committee in the new 55th legislative session, issued a new subpoena on January 12 demanding not just the same documents but even more, including access to “all original paper ballots.” And the subpoena wants access to the county’s voting equipment and software. Jack Sellers, the new chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, did show up at 9 a.m. January 13, at the Senate, as the new subpoena ordered. So did newly elected County Recorder Stephen Richer and new County Treasurer John Allen. But they brought none of the materials with them. Thomason said that new subpoena likely requires the county to file new legal briefs. And he set a hearing for January 20 to consider the matter, saying he hopes the two sides can work things out.</p>

They argue that only legal ballots should be counted, implying illegal ones were counted, and that there should be a recount with the ability to match vote-by-mail envelopes with their ballots.  The lawsuit states it is &#8220;imperative that the mail-in ballots be scrutinized to determine that the voter is actually alive, not incapacitated, and executed the mail-in ballot correctly.&#8221; Walker has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming it was filed past the state deadline to contest an election; it did not establish grounds to contest the election; and it did not sue the proper party, the Canvassing Board.</p>

The lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Steve Jones to rule in their favor<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/federal-lawsuit-challenges-fairness-georgia-elections/ZAfqZVmxHmXbAdfgc85TzL/"> in the case</a> that has been pending since Democrat Stacey Abrams lost the 2018 election for governor to Republican Brian Kemp. But attorneys for Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by Abrams that filed the suit, told Jones that Georgia’s elections continue to disenfranchise voters through voter registration cancellations, absentee ballot rejections, long lines and poll closures. Jones didn’t immediately decide Tuesday on the state’s motion for summary judgment, a key step before a potential trial. He questioned whether he has the authority to consider anything beyond the secretary of state’s voter registration cancellation practices because county governments handle most election functions.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has ended his court challenges to try to reverse his loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. An attorney for Trump filed notice in court Thursday that he<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/trump-attorney-ends-four-lawsuits-challenging-georgias-election/WN7SQPFE7NGUHHQJ2A5WTA4L7Q/"> is voluntarily dismissing four lawsuits</a> making unsubstantiated allegations about ineligible voters, election equipment problems and fraud. No judges in Georgia have ruled in Trump’s favor. “Rather than presenting their evidence and witnesses to a court and to cross-examination under oath, the Trump campaign wisely decided the smartest course was to dismiss their frivolous cases,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. The court dismissals came after Congress accepted electoral votes Wednesday showing that Trump had lost the election. Raffensperger had sent a letter to Georgia’s members of Congress with a point-by-point rebuttal of Trump’s allegations about voting machines, ballot counting, signature verification and illegal voters.</p>

Matthew DePerno, an attorney representing an Antrim County man who filed the lawsuit, previously asked  Elsenheimer to allow a team to review election machines in Antrim County. The judge agreed, and a team reviewed the machinery. Subsequently, DePerno posted a 23-page preliminary report that alleges Dominion Voting System machines are designed to &#8220;create systemic fraud and influence election results. Dominion and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have denied these allegations, noting a slew of problems with the analysis in the report. Although the report included the name of the firm and analyst who oversaw the review and subsequent report, DePerno also asked the judge to prohibit the release of the names or other identifying information of anyone who participated in creating the report.  &#8220;The parties who have been identified as expert witnesses are a matter of record. They will remain a matter of record,&#8221; Elsenheimer said.</p>

The request filed Monday with a federal court in Albuquerque would dismiss the lawsuit from Trump but allow the concerns to be revisited. Trump campaign attorney Mark Caruso of Albuquerque could not be reached immediately for comment. “Simply withdrawing this lawsuit does not undo the weeks of lies and disinformation parroted by President Trump and leaders of the New Mexico Republican Party,” Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said in a statement Monday. She had requested that Trump’s campaign be sanctioned for pursuing meritless litigation.</p>

Last week, the Republican-controlled state Senate refused to seat Brewster, a Democrat. Ranjan, a Trump appointee, rejected the claims of Republican Nicole Ziccarelli that undated mail-in ballots should not be counted, noting, “The court finds that the Supreme Court expressly held that the undated ballots at issue remain valid ballots that are properly counted under state law.”</p>
<p>Judge John P. Capuzzi Sr.<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/poll-watchers-presidential-elecion-delaware-county-20210113.html"> dismissed an election challenge</a> brought by two Republican poll watchers and a failed congressional candidate, saying their petition lacked a “scintilla of legal merit.” The challenge, filed Dec. 22, sought sanctions against the county’s Board of Elections, saying poll observers were kept too far away from the areas where absentee and mail-in ballots were being counted in the November election. The challengers said the practice violated the terms of a judge’s Nov. 4 order clarifying the rules for poll observers. Capuzzi, who issued that order, dismissed those claims Wednesday and chastised the group’s lawyer for filing the challenge so long after the matter had been ruled on by the state Supreme Court, calling the petition “frivolous” and “contemptible.” “Strikingly, at the time of the filing of this frivolous action, the issue now brought forth by the petitioners has been adjudicated by the highest court in the Commonwealth, i.e. the Delaware County Board of Elections had full authority to establish observation areas as it deemed fit,” Capuzzi wrote. “Consequently, there is a total absence of legal merit in the petitions.”</p>

For a 17-minute period on the morning of the March 3, 2020, presidential primary voters seeking information via the state&#8217;s online polling-place finder were instead referred to a site operated by a partisan progressive group after the state&#8217;s online tool crashed. Secretary of State Steve Simon quickly took responsibility for the lapse, which he said happened when a civil servant staffer in his IT department acted too quickly to find a link to redirect voters. Simon also denied any political motivation on behalf of the staffer. According to T<em>he Minneapolis Star-Tribune</em>, the report found Simon&#8217;s statements were accurate but it said multiple staffers were to blame in addition to the single IT staffer Simon initially described. The report also concluded that Simon&#8217;s office was not prepared to adequately redirect visitors from its web poll finder and that the office did not have a detailed definition of what would have been an appropriate alternative online source to share. In an interview after the report&#8217;s release, Simon said it &#8220;corroborated and reaffirmed&#8221; his statements that quickly followed the glitch. The Legislative Auditor meanwhile concluded that Simon&#8217;s office took &#8220;appropriate and necessary steps&#8221; to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future — including updating its elections emergency plan to include preapproved web addresses for an alternative poll finder.</p>
