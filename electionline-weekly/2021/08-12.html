														<p><strong>Chain of custody</strong><br />
<em>DOJ, CISA and EAC have new guidance to help elections officials</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>While most (all) elections officials have a variety of chain of custody procedures in place, the<a href="https://www.justice.gov/"> U.S. Department of Justice</a> (DOJ), the  <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) and the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"> Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) have all recently released guidelines/best practices/insights to help local elections officials ensure the integrity of their voting systems and provide transparency.</p>
<p>The EAC’s<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/bestpractices/Chain_of_Custody_Best_Practices.pdf"> best practices</a> outline items election officials should consider when developing or revising their chain of custody procedures for physical election materials, voting systems, and the use of third-party auditors for conducting audits and electronic discovery.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/chain-custody-and-critical-infrastructure-systems"> CISA Insights</a> are focused on critical infrastructure, of which<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/06/statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-infrastructure-critical"> election infrastructure was designated</a> by former Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson in January 2017.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6136" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DOJ-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />The<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1417796/download"> DOJ guidance document</a> provides information on how states must comply with federal law when preserving and retaining election records and the criminal penalties associated with the willful failure to comply with those requirements. This guidance document also details the statutes that prohibit the intimidation of voters and the department’s commitment to act if any person engages in actions that violate the law.</p>
<p>Combined, these are three valuable new tools in the fight for election security and transparency. They can also play a key role in restoring and reassuring the public’s faith in voting systems.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“CISA regularly provides information to critical infrastructure partners across all sectors to help them manage risks to their systems. The guidance on safeguarding the chain of custody of critical systems is part of this mission,” said Geoff Hale, director of the Election Security Initiative at CISA. “While it may be particularly relevant to election officials at the moment, this risk management guidance reflects the leading practices that secure vital systems and data across critical infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Hale was quick to point out that this new guidance is not an indication of assessed poor practices, rather, it serves to reinforce leading practices across critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>“State and local elections officials are doing incredible work preparing for and administering elections amid the complex challenges of staffing shortages, cyber risks, threats of violence, and pervasive disinformation,” Hale said. “Securing the chain of custody of critical systems safeguards against unauthorized or unknown access and reduces the chances of damage and manipulation. Chain of custody documentation provides a foundation to either support or debunk claims about their elections. This guidance we issued is another tool local election officials can use to build trust through secure practices.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-6655 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="185" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" />Every election jurisdiction has its own controls for ensuring the chain of custody. Controls may include locks, seals, audit logs, witness signatures, or other security measures. The EAC<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/bestpractices/Chain_of_Custody_Best_Practices.pdf"> Chain of Custody Best Practices</a> is intended to provide best practices, checklists, and sample forms for maintaining a proper chain of custody related to the successful operation of an election but is not meant to be comprehensive of every election process. Jurisdictions are reminded to implement these voluntary best practices only after reviewing federal, state, and local laws and regulations.</p>
<p>“Audits have come under national scrutiny after the 2020 election, but most states have conducted post-election audits for decades,” said EAC Chairman Don Palmer. “What the 2020 election cycle demonstrated, is the need to have thorough written procedures and chain of custody forms that can demonstrate to the public that all of the measures election officials take to ensure the integrity of elections are followed in practice.”</p>
<p>According to Palmer, drawing from the EAC staff expertise, the new best practices document gives examples of checklists, forms, and other recommendations in one concise reference for officials to improve the systems already in place or think of these processes in a new way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7308" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/EACChainofCommand-300x202.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/EACChainofCommand-300x202.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/EACChainofCommand.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In addition to pressure from legislators and others for “audits” of the 2020 election, the number of tenured elections officials resigning in the past year also has the potential to leave a vacuum of information. Having strong chain of custody procedures can help alleviate some of that stress when there is staff turnover.</p>
<p>“With increased scrutiny of election administration, it is more important than ever for election officials to re-evaluate their existing chain of custody procedures to ensure their current process adequately demonstrates the trustworthiness of elections,” Palmer said. “One of the core missions of the EAC is to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource of information regarding election administration. We hope that by providing this guidance now, between national elections, it will be a helpful resource to aid election officials with drafting updated written chain of custody policies. With increasing scrutiny of elections, a solid foundation of chain of custody procedures will allow election offices to be successful when the inevitable close election results in a recount or audit.”</p>
<p>And ultimately, chain of custody forms provide documentation that can be used to authenticate election results, corroborate post-election tabulation audits, and demonstrate that election outcomes can be trusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transparency and openness are critical for public confidence. Confidence in the credibility of election results starts with the ability to provide strong evidence that election results are an accurate reflection of voters’ intent. Visualization of the steps administrators take to maintain chain of custody of ballots and equipment increases confidence in the electoral process,&#8221; Palmer said. &#8220;The physical evidence of an election, including voted ballots and/or a voter verifiable paper audit trail, and voting equipment are the core elements of any election&#8221;</p>

Ohio was selected out of 14 submissions from 10 states.  NASED President Michelle Tassinari said: “On behalf of NASED, I am proud to present the 2021 NASED Innovators Award to the Ohio Secretary of State’s office. Ohio was the first state to allow attorneys statewide to earn CLE credit for serving as poll workers, and their idea spread quickly to other states. It also led to a national partnership between NASED, our colleagues at the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), and the American Bar Association in advance of the November 2020 election. This is exactly the kind of innovation and creativity in election administration that made the 2020 election a success under such difficult circumstances.” Electionline Weekly<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/02-06/"> wrote about the program</a> back in February of 2020.</p>

The initiative will try to leverage the allure of professional sports teams to help educate students on the civic process. “This is just the beginning,” said Carolyn DeWitt, the head of Rock the Vote. “We hope to build on this work here in Atlanta and take this model nationwide to empower young people across the country.” The program, which launches as Atlanta Public Schools students return to classes, offers lesson plans on the history of voting and the importance of local government. The goal is to reach 2,000 students in 11th and 12th grades across 10 Atlanta high schools. It will culminate with the major event at Mercedes-Benz Stadium with professional athletes, musicians and other famous figures. Students will be encouraged to register or pre-register to vote, sign up to be a poll worker and get involved in other ways. Arthur Blank, the owner of the sports teams, said the goal is to send the message that “every voice and every vote matters – and the right to vote is simply sacred.”</p>

Morris was the first female justice of the peace in the United States. She was appointed in February 1870 on South Pass City.  “Morris was a prominent supporter of Wyoming Legislative Council President William Bright’s 1869 suffrage bill that not only allowed women the right to vote, but to also hold office,” the Secretary of State’s Office said.  The historic marker is located at 2114 Warren Avenue in Cheyenne. The public can view the marker and are “encouraged to use the visit as an opportunity to learn about the life and contributions of one of Wyoming’s most prominent historical figures.” The National Votes for Women Trail is an initiative that launched in 2020 and is sponsored by the National Collaborative for Women’s History Sites (NCWHS) and the William G. Pomeroy Foundation. The trail aims to commemorate the history of women’s suffrage across the country.

We just think it’s a really important issue. Something that’s still very much relevant today, in terms of voting rights and protecting voting rights and access. So we wanted to make sure this history was brought forward and shown off a little bit,” said Interim Director Jill Roth. The eight panels detail the process women’s rights activists went through in the US and here in Wisconsin to be able to vote.</p>

Church had been with the elections office for 20 years. “She was much more than that,” said Chris Chambless, supervisor of elections. “Not only was she an accomplished election worker, rising through the ranks to clerk, but she was also the trainer and that’s where we take individuals who are highly skilled that will then pass along that knowledge and that history to new election workers.” Chambless said he was heartbroken, learning that Church died from COVID-19 complications. “Such a sweet spirit,” Chambless said. “She was always giving, always available.

She was 83. Jackson served as the county clerk from 1992 to 2002. &#8220;She was a very good clerk by the way,&#8221; Former Grayson County Democratic Party Chair Bob Slagle said. &#8220;She did an excellent job both as a clerk and with elections.&#8221; Jackson was very involved locally in activities including the League of Women Voters.  Slagle said they worked together to recruit election judges for every precinct in the county that didn&#8217;t have one. &#8220;She had to find locations for people to vote in like 60 locations in the county and she would find new places in the precincts to make it easier for people to vote,&#8221; he said. She was given the League of Women Voters citizen of the year award and the League of Women Voters Arlyss Middents Award as well as the United Way Award for Outstanding Community Service. She also received the Democratic Women of Grayson County&#8217;s first Ann Richards Award in 2008. Before becoming county clerk, Jackson taught at Sherman High School and served two terms on the SISD Board of Trustees.</p>

Brad Little (R) has created a new<a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/aug/08/gov-little-appoints-task-force-to-tackle-cybersecu/"> Cybersecurity Task Force</a> that will provide recommendations to improve business, government and personal cybersecurity defenses and enhance the educational pipeline for cybersecurity workforce needs. It will identify cybersecurity assets, resources and public-private partnerships across Idaho, according to the release. Little said he directed the task force to ensure Idaho’s election infrastructure remains secure, transparent and resilient from new and evolving threats. He said because the Gem State is home to the Idaho National Laboratory, the state is well positioned to counter online attacks and cybersecurity challenges. “We’ll need increased resources, partnerships and active collaboration between a broad range of organizations to successfully protect from ever-growing cybersecurity threats, and I’m confident my Cybersecurity Task Force is up to the task,” Little said in the release. “I’m also asking the task force to find new ways to protect Idaho’s election infrastructure, because fair and free elections are a hallmark of Idaho’s proud representative democracy and the expectation of every Idahoan.”</p>

<p>The U.S. Senate adjourned for summer recess without taking up<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/567290-schumer-sets-september-voting-rights-fight-after-gop-blocks-quick-debate"> voting rights legislation</a>, but according to The Hill, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-New York) teed up a Senate vote for mid-September on taking up the election debate. He&#8217;ll need 10 GOP votes to start debate, assuming every member of his caucus votes yes, likely dooming the new effort absent a significant, unexpected, shift from moderate Democrats on changing the chamber&#8217;s rules. &#8220;Voting rights, voting rights, will be the first matter of legislative business when the Senate returns to session in September. Our democracy demands no less,&#8221; Schumer said.</p>

The city will need about $700,000 to remodel its Thane warehouse, and purchase ballot-counting equipment. Juneau implemented a temporary vote by mail system for the 2020 election due to concerns over COVID-19. Currently, that requires city officials to use an Anchorage facility for ballot-counting. That’s what will happen again in 2021, but if this new proposal doesn’t hit any snags, Juneau would have its own facility next fall. The proposal will be introduced at the Aug. 23 assembly meeting.</p>

The elections choose the mayor, city council members, auditor, and clerk and recorder. Moving the election up a month was proposed by Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López after nearly a year of planning. López suggested this option will help his office, which oversees elections, better prepare for runoff elections Moving the election a month ahead would provide more time to prepare for a run-off by changing the city’s law requiring it to take place roughly 30 days after the municipal election. The run-offs would still take place in June under the new proposal. It will be up to the full City Council to decide whether to send the proposal to voters to decide this fall.</p>

Jim Moylan and Sen. Joe San Agustin. The proposals from the senators are found in two separate pieces of legislation.</p>
<p>Bill 173-36 would make seven amendments to local statutes, including allowing for the cancellation of certain primary elections. According to the measure, a vote during a primary election for governor and lieutenant governor, senators, mayors or vice mayors won&#8217;t need to be conducted &#8220;if fewer than the maximum number of partisan candidates who can advance to the general election are running for both political parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill 174-36, adjusts multiple deadlines associated with elections. For instance, the legislation proposes to shift the timeframe for candidates to submit their nominating petitions – going from between 130 and 60 days before a primary election to between 160 and 90 days. The change would give residents more time to consider for whom they will vote.The legislation also gives residents less time to register to vote, suggesting that the GEC&#8217;s registration period end 21 days before an election, instead of the current 10-day cutoff. Bill 174 would additionally move up the primary to the first, instead of the last, Saturday of August. Other reforms proposed in the bills include: clarifying the GEC is responsible for designating a 100-foot marker from a polling site where electioneering is prohibited; changing the name of a voting precinct to a &#8220;voting district;&#8221; specifying the &#8220;name&#8221; of a candidate to be what appears on a birth certificate, passport, or other government document; giving more flexibility for the GEC to count provisional ballots; mandating a special election for a vacancy in the delegate position; and allowing for the electronic registration of electors.</p>

SB 1 is the latest sweeping voting bill before lawmakers, each a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats in the Texas Legislature. During the hearing before the vote, Jeff Miller with Disability Rights Texas said this latest bill does address some of the issues his group raised during the last few times Republicans took up similar voting bills, but ultimately, if passed, the legislation will “end up disenfranchising voters with disabilities.” The sponsor of SB 1, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, said he has been listening to feedback about the bill and the process. “We are trying to make the bill better and accommodate everybody,” he said. After hours of testimony, the committee approved the bill along party lines. It now heads to the full Texas Senate for final approval.</p>

The proposed change would dispense with partisan primary elections, in which political parties send the top vote-getter to the general election. Instead, the “Fair Elections Initiative” creates a single, nonpartisan primary election including all candidates. The top five finishers in that primary election advance to the November general election, regardless of political party. The November general election would no longer crown the top vote-getter as the winner, regardless of whether the candidate secures a majority or not. Instead, the winner would be determined by ranked-choice voting. The idea is similar to a ballot initiative approved by voters in Alaska in 2020. The issue could be put to voters in November 2022, but there’s a long road ahead. If the lieutenant governor approves the initiative, backers need to hold at least seven public hearings around the state and prepare a fiscal impact statement to demonstrate how much the initiative would cost if it were to become law. Reasons for rejecting an initiative include being unconstitutional, if it’s deemed “nonsensical,” or it could not become law if passed. Then they would still need to collect nearly 138,000 signatures. They must also meet specific signature thresholds in 26 of the state’s 29 state Senate districts. Sponsors have until Feb. 15 to meet those requirements.</p>

The bills Evers vetoed would have required voters to fill out two forms instead of one to vote absentee, added restrictions on who can return completed absentee ballots, required elderly and disabled voters to provide IDs to vote absentee in most cases and prohibited clerks from correcting defects on absentee ballot envelopes. Other bills vetoed would have created a backup system for voting in nursing homes and required nursing home administrators to notify relatives when special voting deputies will visit the facility. Another would have allowed election observers to sit or stand within 3 feet of poll workers during recounts. Another bill he vetoed would have required municipalities that livestream their counting of ballots to record it and save it for 22 months. Other election records must be retained for that amount of time.</p>

Chuck Gray (R-Casper) to give the Wyoming Legislature the<a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/rocketminer/elections/election-audit-bill-fails/article_7e3f9c5b-04c9-5a57-81ca-cb1dd80be5bd.html"> power to audit elections</a>. Gray, who is running for Congress against incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in next year’s Republican primary, has made “election integrity” a centerpiece of his campaign. Gray has also touted his visits to the site of an election audit in Arizona inspired by former President Donald Trump’s disproven claims the 2020 election was stolen from him. County clerks’ offices are responsible for auditing elections at the county level. Wyoming does not require a statewide audit of election results. Gray’s proposal, which failed by a raised hand vote of 8-2, proposed bringing the Wyoming Department of Audit — which primarily handles financial and government performance audits — under the umbrella of the legislative branch. He also proposed authorizing it to audit elections. Sen. Anthony Bouchard (R-Cheyenne), a member of the Management Audit Committee and one of Gray’s opponents in next year’s race, accused Gray of pulling a political stunt. While he said he supported similar legislation in the past, Bouchard has largely rejected claims of rampant voter fraud in the 2020 election. “I’m disgusted that you’re pulling this election issue because you’re running for office here,” he said.</p>

The election system vendor accused the outlets of spreading misinformation about the 2020 election by accusing Dominion of rigging the ballots in President Biden&#8217;s favor via their voting machines. These lies have harmed the company, its employees, and its customers; workers have been threatened, their offices vandalized, and the company has had to spend upwards of $600,000 on security for employees, the suit alleges. The suits also name OAN CEO Robert Herring as well as his son, OAN president Charles Herring, the Chief White House Correspondent for OAN, Chanel Rion, and a network personality, Christina Bobb. Dominion has also sued Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of Overstock; he appeared often on OAN and was interviewed as an &#8220;expert,&#8221; but similarly spread misinformation about Dominion and the 2020 election, the suits allege.</p>
<p>In other Dominion litigation news, U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/11/dominion-powell-giuliani-lindell-lawsuits/"> denied requests</a> by former president Donald Trump’s former lawyers and allies to throw out more than $3 billion in defamation lawsuits over false claims that a voting machine company’s technology was used to rig the 2020 presidential election. The ruling allows lawsuits by Dominion Voting Systems against former Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, to move forward. In a written opinion, Nichols said that Powell and Lindell made their claims “knowing that they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth.” “A reasonable juror” could conclude that Powell did not have a video of Dominion’s founder saying that “he can change a million votes, no problem at all,” as she had claimed, the judge wrote. Nichols also wrote that a sensible juror could conclude that Lindell’s insistence on “the existence of a vast international conspiracy that is ignored by the government but proven by a spreadsheet on an internet blog is so inherently improbable that only a reckless man would believe it,” referencing Lindell’s assertion that a spreadsheet he shared on Twitter as proof of Trump’s victory was evidence.</p>

A federal judge<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/georgia-voters-lose-fight-for-free-stamps-on-absentee-ballots/"> denied</a> the bid for free postage last year, rejecting a class action brought by the nonprofit Black Voters Matter and two Georgia voters against Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and DeKalb County election officials.  An attorney for the plaintiffs told a three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based appeals court that requiring voters to pay for postage to vote by mail is the equivalent of a poll tax outlawed by the 24th Amendment. Sean Young, legal director for the ACLU of Georgia, argued that the state has unfairly abridged the right to vote by mail by conditioning it on voters’ ability to pay for postage. Young asked the panel to refer back to the court’s 2020<a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202012003.enb.pdf"> decision</a> in Jones v. Governor of Florida, which he said established the definition of a tax as “any government monetary extraction that is not a penalty.” He told the panel that the definition of a tax is broad under the law.

The total tab was $289,000. Belford knocked the tab down to $112,614 and decided Grogan should only have to post half of that amount &#8212; $56,307 &#8212; in advance. Belford said that while the court&#8217;s &#8220;paramount obligation&#8221; is to ensure there is a true and accurate vote count, &#8220;the posting of a security should never stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of this task.&#8221; In the county auditor&#8217;s race, Grogan, a Republican from Downers Grove, lost to Democrat William White, also of Downers Grove. Grogan had 233,046 votes to White&#8217;s 233,121 votes. State law allows a judge to order a candidate who requests a recount to provide a bond or cash deposit to cover some or all of the costs. If the candidate wins the recount, the money is returned. Belford denied the clerk&#8217;s request to have Grogan pay the $43,309 costs of the election-division workers who would be involved in the recount, saying the workers would be working anyway.</p>

In the seven-page opinions, Klavans wrote that Republican Herb McMillan, a county executive candidate, and George Gallagher, a candidate for the City Council Ward 6 seat waited too long to take legal action after learning of the city’s plans to mail ballots to voters in mid-June. Klavans ordered the lawsuit,<a href="https://www.capitalgazette.com/politics/ac-cn-vote-mail-lawsuit-20210723-20210723-fw7peuoxkbajravua7s57f24qq-story.html"> which was filed in late July</a>, be dismissed with prejudice, which means a new lawsuit can’t be filed on the same premise. McMillan and Gallagher said they are considering an appeal of the ruling.</p>
<p>The Maryland State Board of Elections has<a href="https://patch.com/maryland/across-md/maryland-elections-board-blind-advocates-reach-agreement-efforts-improve-ballot"> settled a longstanding dispute over ballot-marking devices</a> that disability advocates say forced them to cast a segregated ballot. The terms of the settlement were publicly announced by the National Federation of the Blind, which<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2019/08/02/national-federation-of-the-blind-sues-state-board-of-elections-over-ballot-privacy/"> filed a lawsuit</a> over ballot privacy in August 2019. At issue are the state&#8217;s ballot-marking devices, which allow voters who are blind or have other disabilities to use headphones, magnification, touchscreens and other features to independently cast ballots. But the machines also produce a ballot printout that&#8217;s a different size and shape than the paper ballots cast by a vast majority of Maryland voters. Under the terms of the settlement as announced by the federation, the Maryland State Board of Elections will take several steps to address privacy and access concerns: The elections board will ensure that additional ballot-marking devices are available at the polling places of three plaintiffs who documented access and equipment issues in the lawsuit. The state will also ensure that additional machines are in place at polling places where there have been issues in past elections and at precincts that would experience significant delays waiting for a replacement if a machine breaks down; Training materials issued to election judges by the state will instruct them to ensure that at least ten voters at each polling location use a ballot-marking device, which will help protect privacy. Election judges at polling places that do not meet the 10-voter requirement will be subject to additional monitoring and training; When the state next buys or leases election equipment, officials will include the capability for ballot-marking machines to produce a ballot substantially similar in size, shape, and content to hand-marked paper ballots as a factor in picking which voting system to purchase or lease; and Elections officials will not discourage the use of ballot-marking devices or encourage the use of hand-marked paper ballots in public messages or election judge trainings. The elections board will also give the National Federation of the Blind data about the use of ballot-marking devices and complaints by voters with disabilities for each election through 2024. A $230,000 financial settlement to cover the legal fees and costs of the National Federation of the Blind and the plaintiffs is subject to approval by the Board of Public Works. The panel is expected to take up the settlement agreement at its Sept. 1 meeting, according to court filings.</p>

The lawsuit specifically charged that the state’s disability transportation programs, including NJ Transit Access Link and the Community Transportation network, had failed to provide voter registration opportunities as required under section 7 of the<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/campaigns/after-federal-lawsuit-new-jersey-will-allow-voter-registration-through-disability-transportation-agencies/"> National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA). “Under the NVRA, these offices must distribute a voter registration application to each person who applies for their services, and along with each recertification, renewal or change of address form relating to such services, unless the person involved declines in writing to register to vote,” the Justice Department wrote. “However, NJ Transit Access Link and Community Transportation programs have not been providing the voter registration opportunities guaranteed by the NVRA.” According to the terms of the consent decree, the State of New Jersey will designate its disability transportation services as voter registration agencies, allowing them to supply voter registration services going forward. The decree is subject to approval from the federal district court in New Jersey. “The right to vote is a constitutional principle that forms a cornerstone of our democracy,” said acting U.S. Attorney Rachael Honig. “We appreciate that the State of New Jersey has worked with us to ensure that all New Jersey residents, including those with disabilities, enjoy convenient opportunities to register to vote.”</p>
