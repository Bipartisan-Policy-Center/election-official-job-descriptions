Earlier this summer Democracy Fund hosted a <a href="https://democracyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DF-Language-Access-Webinar-Recording.mp4">Language Access for Voters Webinar</a> on actions to take in preparation for the release of the upcoming determinations in December.</p>
<p>The webinar features commentary from Terry Ao Minnis, Senior Director of the Census and Voting Program for Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC) and an all-star panel of election officials and experts (Andy Kang, Pennsylvania Immigration &amp; Citizenship Coalition; Jason Chavez, Arizona Secretary of State’s Office; Elia Burgos, Cuyahoga County, OH; Jacqueline DeLeon, Native American Rights Fund; and Kira Romero Craft, Latino Justice PRLDEF) hosted by Astrid Ochoa.</p>

<p><strong>What preparations should be underway?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Community Awareness</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>What language requirements might you have? Pay attention to new places of worship, stores with a focused clientele, media outlets in languages other than English—these may all be signals of changing demographics in your community.</li>
<li>Make sure that your frontline staff are capturing requests for assistance or language translations when they take calls or provide services at your front counters.</li>
<li>Speak to other elected officials about the request that they are getting.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Inventory</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Make a check list of all forms and documents that you provide to the public that will need to be translated.<a href="https://civicdesign.org/projects/language/"> Center for Civic Design has a repository</a> of translation materials and instruction as does the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/language-access"> Election Assistance Commission</a>.</li>
<li>Review your website structure and speak with your webmaster on the best way to proceed with additional language content. Time to refresh the website: There is a<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/course/building-an-election-website/"> great template offered by Center for Technology in Civic Life that is low-cost/free</a>.</li>
<li>Survey staff – including pollworkers, troubleshooters, and rovers – to identify what language skill resources you already possess.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Translation Services</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Contact your jurisdiction’s court system to see what translation services are already being used and possibly under contract. County/City Managers are another source of pre-existing relationships to leverage.</li>
<li>Reach out to your Secretary of State or State Election Board and other local officials to discuss uniformity of translation and share processes. State associations are the perfect communication channel for this type of discussion. To schedule, reach out to association leadership.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Advisory Board</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Even with certified translation, localized review is important. Establish an Advisory Board and meeting cadence early in the cycle help to forge productive relationships that are mutually beneficial to attendees, and ultimately the voters.</li>
<li>Share inventories of materials, review draft content, discuss the training process, solicit outreach opportunities, and negotiate when and where services will be offered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the Federal Registry’s publication of the 2021 language determinations in early December, Democracy Fund will virtually host the virtual 2021 Language Assistance Summit on December 13th and 14th. Day one will focus on the legality of language assistance and the Census. Day two will focus on language assistance implementation.</p>
<p>At the summit, participants will share best-practices and ideas to provide the best possible service to voters and celebrate the diversity of languages. For the first time, we invite the submission of short videos to play in between our panels and presentations. This is an opportunity to highlight your staff, translators, pollworkers, even voters, and to elevate their voices in this critical discussion on providing unbiased assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what we are looking for in 3-5 minute videos: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Personal story about what language assistance has meant to the person or someone they love.</li>
<li>  Personal story about the importance of integration of language and culture into formal settings like a polling place, feeling welcomed and not an afterthought.</li>
<li>  Personal story of the empowerment knowledge has in casting a ballot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing unbiased assistance is critical. Demonstration of how to read the ballot to a voter without intonation or inflection is a skill best practiced.  We are looking for short videos of:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Staff reading the 2020 Presidential Election Presidential race as it appeared in your jurisdiction in other languages.  Title, vote for, and then candidates in the manner they would read the content if reading for a voter.</li>
<li>  Samples of different languages welcomed—above and beyond Sec 203!</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2021 summit is free, and you can register<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/democracy-fund-language-access-for-voters-summit-registration-169522158339"> here</a>.

Gavin Newsom. In the days leading up to the recall, election administrators were forced to deal with a<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-10/election-chiefs-wary-of-california-recall-vote-fraud-claims"> barrage of unfounded claims</a> of voter fraud, which some worried could lead to violence. The leading candidate in the recall process quickly conceded and made little mention of fraud in the concession. Overall, recall day in California went well with<a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/california-recall-elder-campaign-links-to-voter-fraud-reporting-site-as-gop-pushes-unfounded-claims/"> very few problems</a> reported from in-person voting. In<a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/content/news/Tehama-County-tabulator-unable-to-read-some-ballots-due-to-print-error-575310961.html"> Tehama County</a>, some mail ballots had a print error that has caused the tabulator to not be able to read the ballots, according to the Tehama County Clerk and Recorder/Registrar of Voters. The error was caused by a human error by Tehama County’s ballot printing vendor. In<a href="https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/election-day-curbside-drop-off-speeds-things-up-at-kern-county-election-office"> Kern County</a>, elections officials praised the use of curbside drop-off for ballots that helped speed up the process. In<a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/local/voters-frustrated-when-ballot-scanning-machine-quit-unexpectedly-at-redding-polling-place"> Shasta County</a>, a ballot scanner at one polling place temporarily stopped working, but voters were able to put their ballots in a drop-off bin. While there were no major problems reported in<a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2021/09/14/no-major-polling-problems-reported-as-la-county-heads-to-the-polls-for-recall-vote/"> Los Angeles County</a>, one of the largest voting districts in the country, one poll worker at a<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/west-hollywood-election-worker-dressed-in-trump-2020-attire-no-longer-works-at-vote-center/2692185/"> West Hollywood</a> polling place caused quite a stir when he showed up decked out in Trump paraphernalia from head to toe. After he refused to change he was escorted from the polling site. There were some lines at vote centers in<a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2021/09/14/recall-election-lines-reported-at-some-oc-vote-centers-as-turnout-nears-50/"> Orange County</a>. It’s estimated that the recall’s final cost could be close to<a href="https://kesq.com/cnn-regional/2021/09/15/california-recall-price-tag-could-be-more-than-300m-secretary-of-state-says-as-experts-call-for-reform/"> $300 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7415" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Utah-County-300x140.png" alt="" width="204" height="95" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Utah-County-300x140.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Utah-County.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" />Voter Education:</strong> Several dozen people showed up to a recent voter education event in <a href="https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2021-09-09/amid-an-influx-of-public-records-requests-utah-county-clerk-hosts-an-election-transparency-night">Utah County, Utah</a> to learn more about the state’s election process. Josh Daniels, Utah County clerk/auditor, told KUER that after last year&#8217;s presidential election, there were a lot of questions about voting integrity. “We are getting an unprecedented amount of public interest in the results of the 2020 election, in the topic of election security,” Daniels said. “Election officials are under more scrutiny than ever before,” Daniels said. “They&#8217;re being asked questions they&#8217;ve never been asked before. There&#8217;s public records requests that are at an all-time high. So [we’re] just trying to be proactive and host an event like [this] to get out ahead of it and share what we do and answer questions.” Daniels spoke about topics like security measures in place and how they track the ballots <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-7419" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ChaffeeCo.png" alt="" width="160" height="130" />from the mail to their office. Rep. Steve Christiansen, R-West Jordan, also attended the event. He said he wanted to hear about the concerns from voters because he’s planning to introduce election reform legislation during this upcoming General Session. “All I am attempting to do is to introduce changes that will help people to feel much more comfortable, that our elections are being conducted in a trustworthy way,” Christiansen said. Daniels said the county plans on hosting more events in the future to answer questions from residents and bring more transparency to the process. Additionally, in <a href="https://www.chaffeecountytimes.com/free_content/county-clerk-offers-tours/article_ba005222-1640-11ec-8abd-13328bf6f1fc.html">Chaffee County, Colorado</a>, the clerk’s ballot processing space has recently gone through a renovation that will allow for more room for staff and greater transparency for election observers. Clerk Lori Mitchell is providing tours for those interested in checking out the new space.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7414" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Degraffenreid-257x300.png" alt="" width="192" height="224" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Degraffenreid-257x300.png 257w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Degraffenreid.png 506w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" />Pennsylvania Department of State</strong>: This week, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D)<a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-nws-pa-wolf-elections-nominee-20210913-2lrk65gkkjgllc4kfpuvkydmxu-story.html"> withdrew his nominee to be Pennsylvania’s top elections official</a>, accusing state Senate Republicans of turning the confirmation process into a partisan charade. Wolf said Republican leaders were seeking a “record number” of hearings to confirm his acting secretary of state, Veronica Degraffenreid, and said she has been the victim of desperate and baseless smears by the top-ranking GOP leader. According to The Morning Call, Wolf says the highest-ranking state senator, Republican Jake Corman of Centre County, has accused Degraffenreid of hiding something without giving her an opportunity to respond. In response, Corman issued a statement saying the Senate was not obligated to honor Wolf’s request to withdraw her from consideration and the GOP caucus is considering how to proceed with her nomination. The governor said he was convinced Senate Republicans “plan on using her confirmation as an opportunity to descend further into conspiracy theories and work to please the former president by spreading lies about last year’s election.” “There were no irregularities, no conspiracies and no fraud that occurred,” Wolf said. He said Degraffenreid will continue in the secretary’s role on an acting basis.</p>

This award is presented to an election official to recognize their excellence in elections administration, according to a Cobb County statement. Eveler helped carry Cobb County through the 2020 election cycle, using the new statewide voting system administered by Dominion Voting Systems, which has a nearly $107 million contract that began in July 2019. She was presented the award by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger during the banquet on the final night of the Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 conference on Jekyll Island. Congratulations also go out to Canton Township, Michigan Clerk<a href="https://www.hometownlife.com/story/news/2021/09/13/canton-township-clerk-michael-siegrist-named-michigans-top-clerk/8240630002/"> Michael Siegrist</a> for winning the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks Township Clerk of the Year award by Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson during a ceremony held in Frankenmuth.  &#8220;When I took office in 2016, I didn&#8217;t know how to be a clerk,&#8221; Siegrist told Hometown Life. &#8220;I had to learn. Outgoing clerk Terry Bennett gave me a couple key clerks&#8217; cell phone numbers as people to call if I had issues. One clerk I reached out to was Northville Township&#8217;s Sue Hildebrand when I couldn&#8217;t figure something out, and she was great. Like they say, sometimes life gives you the test before the lesson.&#8221; Siegrist believes his passion for paying forward the help he received five years ago is a major reason he secured the award for Michigan&#8217;s top clerk in 2021. &#8220;I love to assist new clerks, just like Sue Hildebrand helped me,&#8221; Siegrist said. &#8220;What&#8217;s cool about this award is that I was nominated by four people. It&#8217;s a pretty proud moment in my career.&#8221;</p>

The Freedom to Vote Act includes many provisions from the<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/14/1036812609/senate-democrats-offer-a-new-voting-bill-but-a-gop-filibuster-likely-blocks-the-"> For the People Act</a>. The revised bill would make Election Day a public holiday, ensure that every state offers same-day voter registration, set minimum federal standards on mail voting and ban partisan gerrymandering, among its provisions. The bill also includes a voter identification provision but would allow voters casting ballots in person to &#8220;present a broad set of identification cards and documents in hard copy and digital form.&#8221; The new legislation, unveiled Tuesday morning by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and several co-sponsors, builds off a framework proposed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) who had opposed an earlier, sweeping measure from his party. Along with Manchin, the new bill&#8217;s co-sponsors are Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Jon Tester of Montana, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Alex Padilla of California, along with Maine independent Sen. Angus King. &#8220;The right to vote is fundamental to our Democracy and the Freedom to Vote Act is a step in the right direction towards protecting that right for every American,&#8221; Manchin said. &#8220;As elected officials, we also have an obligation to restore [people&#8217;s] faith in our Democracy, and I believe that the commonsense provisions in this bill — like flexible voter ID requirements — will do just that.&#8221; The new legislation also includes steps to prevent election subversion. The statement said it would establish &#8220;protections to insulate nonpartisan state and local officials who administer federal elections from undue partisan interference or control.&#8221; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the chamber will proceed to the bill as soon as next week.</p>

The facility will support a permanent move to<a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2021/08/10/juneau-vote-by-mail-center/"> holding local elections by mail</a>. Juneau did that for the first time in 2020 because of pandemic concerns, and will again for the election that begins this week and ends Oct. 5. For now, Juneau’s election officials are relying on Anchorage for a secure facility and equipment to count ballots. City officials expect the facility to be ready for next year’s local election.</p>

The reason: 7,000 day-of votes received via drop boxes and mail slowed the process. It was the first time the city used the voting methods in a local election. At their meeting on Wednesday, the city council approved an ordinance that, if signed by acting Mayor Kim Janey, would provide <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2021/09/15/boston-city-council-sends-acting-mayor-a-request-for-pre-paid-mail-in-ballots-after-tabulation-delay">pre-paid envelopes</a> to voters who request to vote by mail, since postage payment was an impediment for some. Councilor Lydia Edwards estimated that it would cost at most $150,000.</p>

Roy Cooper. In a 58-47 party-line vote, the House gave final approval to Senate Bill 360. The measure states that, if the state&#8217;s top lawmakers are part of a lawsuit, either as defendants or interveners, it can&#8217;t be settled without their permission. The bill was drafted in response to a settlement last fall that changed the state&#8217;s absentee ballot rules, allowing a later deadline for mailed ballots and ballots to be accepted without a witness signature. Rep. Destin Hall, R-Caldwell, said during House debate that the challenge to the state&#8217;s absentee ballot rules essentially became &#8220;a friendly lawsuit&#8221; because it was filed by Democratic lawyers represented the plaintiffs, Democrats held the majority on the State Board of Elections and Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein&#8217;s office represented the state.</p>

Ralph Northam (D)<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/virginia-governor-holds-signing-ceremony-for-state-voting-rights-law/"> ceremoniously signed legislation</a> which aims to further protect the right to vote in a state with a history of disenfranchising minorities.  “Voting is the backbone of our democracy,” Governor Ralph Northam said at a ceremony in Norfolk for the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, a first of its kind effort in the South.  Flanked by the Black, female elected officials who were the architects of the legislation, he said the law is an important part of righting the state&#8217;s racist past. “Everybody, without any obstacles, should have the opportunity to vote,” Northam said.  The bill protects against changes to election rules or circumstances that could limit the voting rights of minorities via a state-level preclearance requirement. If a town or county seeks to change voting laws, they must first submit the proposed changes to the state attorney general’s office to review it against existing state and federal nondiscrimination laws. The Virginia legislation, which also makes it easier for people to sue in cases of voter suppression, was signed into law by Northam in March and it took effect in July.  The law has already been put to use since it took effect this summer. According the Virginia Attorney General&#8217;s Office, filings have been summited by 10 localities. Three were questions related to future redistricting issues and the other seven were requests for changes to local election laws that were granted with no objection. Mecklenburg County General Registrar Jason Corwin was among those who had to go through the new preclearance process when they moved his office to a new building.  “It was a fairly smooth process,” he said of the review before the AG’s office. He wasn’t sure the process was needed for his district, one that’s still majority-minority, as he said officials there strive to include minority voices whenever their election operations change.</p>

The high court without comment rejected the appeal filed after an appeals court and trial court both ruled the documents are public records that must be released. The court also dissolved a stay on the appeals court ruling it put in place on Aug. 24 so it could review the record and decide whether to accept the appeal. The Arizona Court of Appeals had ruled that the documents sought by the watchdog group American Oversight detailing how the recount and audit are being conducted are public and must be turned over. The court said the main contractor, Florida company Cyber Ninjas, was subject to the records law because it was performing a core government function that the Senate farmed out. &#8220;Allowing the legislature to disregard the clear mandate of the (public records law) would undermine the integrity of the legislative process and discourage transparency, which contradicts the purpose of both the immunity doctrine and the (law),&#8221; acting presiding Judge Maria Elena Cruz<a href="https://www.americanoversight.org/document/american-oversight-v-arizona-senate-maricopa-county-audit-records#8-19-court-deny-relief"> wrote for the three-judge panel.</a></p>

Attorneys for the state and lawyers for Kansas residents challenging the law in two federal lawsuits agreed to the amount during negotiations. They filed a joint request Friday to have U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson sign off. The attorneys suing the Kansas secretary of state’s office over the law would receive $1.53 million to cover their fees and another $370,000 for expenses. The lawyers had sought more than $3.3 million.</p>
<p>Also in Kansas, this week Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson heard arguments from plaintiffs in a<a href="https://www.leavenworthtimes.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/14/kansas-civic-groups-say-election-laws-hurts-voter-registration-work-impersonating-official/8332795002/"> suit seeking to halt controversial voting laws</a> enacted this year, saying it is substantially harming their operations and speech rights ahead of the November municipal election. Their objection centers on two election laws that took effect earlier this year amid a nationwide effort in Republican states to tighten voting laws. The groups — led by Loud Light, Kansas Appleseed and the League of Women&#8217;s Voters — filed suit over the matter in June, arguing the laws violated the Kansas Constitution. Lawyers for the groups later filed for a temporary restraining order, blocking implementation part of one of the laws — House Bill 2183 — until a fuller ruling could be made on the case. The group&#8217;s main argument stresses that their voter registration activities puts them at risk for prosecution under a provision in the bill which criminalizes impersonating an election official. Bradley Schlozman, a private attorney representing the state on the matter, noted the language of HB 2183 only applies if an individual is knowingly aiming to represent themselves as an election official. Watson said she would have a ruling on the restraining order &#8220;very shortly.&#8221;</p>

The tally filed Wednesday came two weeks after a judge said the lawyers, including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, would pay a penalty for pursuing the case. The final figure will be determined later. Detroit was represented by lawyers in private practice. They’re seeking $182,000. The Michigan attorney general’s office is requesting about $22,000.</p>

Greg Gianforte earlier this year. Two are already the subject of existing lawsuits: Senate Bill 169, which tightened voter identification requirements, including requiring that student IDs be augmented with another form of identification for in-person voting; and House Bill 176, which ended Election Day registration in Montana. House Bill 506 previously received attention for a series of last-minute changes to the bill by Republicans, who amended it to alter the process for drawing Montana&#8217;s new congressional district. Thursday&#8217;s lawsuit challenges a different aspect of that law, which prevents ballots from being mailed out to new voters in advance of their 18th birthdays. In their lawsuit, the groups argue that voter participation among young Montanans jumped substantially during the 2020 election, adding that the three plaintiffs have been actively involved in increasing turnout among voters between the ages of 18 and 29. “The laws at issue here were passed for no reason other than the professed bogeyman of voter fraud, for which legislators did not and could not produce evidence,” the lawsuit continues. “Indeed, bill sponsors could not identify any benefits of their bills that would justify the adverse impact they will have — together and separately — on the ability of Montana youth to remain active and engaged participants in democracy.”</p>

The dispute started after 2020 census results were released in August and appeared to show that Haledon leapfrogged over North Haledon in population. Haledon filed a lawsuit, arguing for the greatest representation on the regional school board in light of the new numbers. As of now, North Haledon elects four trustees, and Haledon three. Prospect Park, which is not involved in the case, has two members. Haledon scored a small victory when Judge Ernest Caposela ordered from his Paterson bench that ballots for Haledon and North Haledon not be printed until further notice. And he ruled that the Passaic County clerk must accept new candidates from Haledon who want to run for the regional school board.</p>

Lawyers for the civil-rights organization pointed to a passage of state election law, dating back more than a century, that criminalizes the act of providing food or water to people waiting in line to vote and is known as the “Line-Warming Ban.” “The Line Warming Ban needlessly criminalizes the provision of such support,” the complaint states, arguing that it blocks entities like the Brooklyn NAACP, “from engaging in the protected expressive conduct of celebrating our democracy and the determination of voters willing to wait in long lines to exercise their right to vote.”</p>

The issue first arose in 2018 when Harris County resident Jillian Ostrewich wore a Houston firefighters T-shirt to a polling place and election workers told her to turn it inside out because it related to Prop B, a pay parity measure for firefighters on that ballot that year. Claiming she was unconstitutionally censored and her right to free speech infringed upon, she sued Harris County and state officials. The case puts to the test a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from June of that year in which the justices struck down a Minnesota law that banned voters from displaying “issue-oriented” apparel at the polls for being overbroad. The Texas suit was brought by Pacific Legal Foundation, the same California-based libertarian public interest law firm that won the Minnesota case.</p>
