							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Flagged tweets with election misinformation continued to spread both on and off platform</strong><br />
<em>New study from NYU finds intervention on one platform doesn&#8217;t stop the spread</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="221" />Before and after the 2020 presidential campaign, Twitter flagged hundreds of Donald Trump’s tweets as election misinformation, either attaching a warning label or blocking engagement with the tweet entirely. Although blocking engagement effectively limited their spread, messages with warning labels spread further and longer on Twitter than did those without labels, according to a<a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/twitter-flagged-donald-trumps-tweets-with-election-misinformation-they-continued-to-spread-both-on-and-off-the-platform/"> new study</a>. Moreover, the blocked Twitter messages were posted more often and received more visibility than other messages on Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/twitter-flagged-donald-trumps-tweets-with-election-misinformation-they-continued-to-spread-both-on-and-off-the-platform/"> paper</a>, authored by researchers at<a href="https://csmapnyu.org/"> New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics</a> (CSMaP), appears in the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review.</p>
<p>“These data cannot tell us whether Twitter’s warning labels worked or not,” says Zeve Sanderson, co-author of the paper and executive director of CSMaP. “It’s possible Twitter intervened on posts that were more likely to spread, or it’s possible Twitter’s interventions caused a backlash and increased their spread.”</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, the findings underscore how intervening on one platform has limited impact when content can easily spread on others,” added paper co-author and research scientist Megan A. Brown. “To more effectively counteract misinformation on social media, it’s important for both technologists and public officials to consider broader content moderation policies that can work across social platforms rather than singular platforms.”</p>
<p>For the study, the team identified 1,149 political tweets from then-President Donald Trump posted from November 1, 2020 through January 8, 2021. Of these, 303 received a “soft intervention” from Twitter (they were labeled as disputed and potentially misleading, but the platform did not remove or block them from spreading), 16 received a “hard intervention” (they were labeled with a warning message and blocked from engagement), and 830 received no intervention. The authors also identified these same messages on Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit and collected data from those platforms, where they may not have limited the posts due to differing content moderation policies.</p>
<p>The research yielded two findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>While hard interventions limited the further spread of those messages on Twitter, tweets that received a soft intervention actually spread further than messages that received no intervention at all.</li>
<li>Messages that received hard interventions on Twitter spread longer and further on Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit than messages that received either soft or no interventions on Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the authors note, this study was possible because data from these platforms has been made publicly available, either through the platforms themselves, third-party tools, or other researchers.</p>
<p>“Research on social media’s impact on society has made tremendous strides in the last decade. But our work has often been hampered by a lack of platform transparency and access to the necessary data,” observes NYU Professor Joshua A. Tucker, a co-author of the study and co-director of CSMaP. “Increasing data access is critical to measuring the ecosystem-level impact of content moderation and producing rigorous research that can inform evidence-based public and platform policy.”</p>
<p>The paper’s other authors included CSMaP’s other co-directors, Jonathan Nagler, a professor in NYU’s Department of Politics, and Richard Bonneau, a professor in NYU’s Department of Biology and Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.</p>

In parts of the Golden State officials are making alternate plans for voters displaced by wildfires. Bill O’Neill, registrar of voters for<a href="https://www.modbee.com/news/california/article253607263.html"> El Dorado County</a>, told the Modesto Bee that he’s heard from many voters in his area displaced by the Caldor Fire.  “We’ve had a lot of calls, a lot of emails,” O’Neill said.  O’Neill said that he and his staff have been out to evacuation sites, both formal and informal, to meet with residents and to offer them options when it comes to voting.  “We want the last thing that they ever have to think about to be, ‘How do I vote in this election?’” O’Neill said. In<a href="https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2021/08/20/yolo-county-elections-office-partners-with-dignity-health-on-new-ballot-collection-program/"> Yolo County</a>, the county is partnering with Dignity Health to launch a new vote-by-mail collection pilot program. On the 14th, a deputized Ballot Drop Box retrieval team from the county elections office will visit Dignity Health Woodland Memorial Hospital to retrieve ballots. Vote-by-Mail ballot collection will be open to all individuals working within the facility and any patients that have their Vote-by-Mail ballot and envelope ready to be collected. In<a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/ballots-mailed-confusion-san-joaquin-county-voters/37377842"> San Joaquin County</a>, some voters were confused the sample ballot, which was sent with the official ballot in a cost-saving measure, had the word “official” printed on top of it.  Austin Erdman, the interim San Joaquin County registrar of voters, said the sample and official ballots were mailed out together in an effort to save taxpayers money from having them sent separately. &#8220;It&#8217;s a cost-saving measure and also because [of] the size of the vote-by-mail. We&#8217;re trying to save trees,&#8221; Erdman explained. In<a href="https://abc7.com/recall-election-stolen-ballots-vote-by-mail-torrance-police/10969902/"> Los Angeles County</a>, authorities are investigating why 300 unopened vote-by-mail ballots for the upcoming recall election were found &#8211; along with a gun, drugs and stolen mail &#8211; in a car parked at a Torrance convenience store. The discovery was made Aug. 16 The registrar&#8217;s office told a local television station that these ballots had been sent out but were not filled out and returned by voters. They said there is no indication the ballots were taken specifically in an attempt to influence the results of the recall vote, as there was other stolen mail found with them. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to indicate this was focused on the election,&#8221; the county registrar&#8217;s office said. In<a href="https://www.sbsun.com/2021/08/24/voting-drop-box-vandalized-in-ontario-officials-say-ballots-likely-not-targeted/"> San Bernardino County</a>, a ballot drop box was vandalized in the town of Ontario. “As two county drop boxes were vandalized at the same location, it does not appear that ballots for the September 14, 2021 California Gubernatorial Recall Election were the target of the vandalism,” Bob Page, registrar of voters, said in a statement. “We are doing all we can to make sure our elections are safe and secure.”</p>

Since the pandemic began, the state has offered more ways for people to absentee vote in a half-dozen elections — including last year&#8217;s presidential and congressional elections — and boosted the number of early voting days for some of those elections because of the risks of the coronavirus. But Ardoin said he doesn&#8217;t intend to submit an emergency plan for the Oct. 9 and Nov. 13 elections to lawmakers and Gov. John Bel Edwards for consideration. He said only a tiny percentage of voters used the prior COVID-19 emergency rules to submit absentee ballots, and he said vaccines are widely available for those interested. With municipal elections on Nov. 2,<a href="https://www.theday.com/local-news/20210824/connecticuts-covid-19-absentee-voting-option-remains-as-another-pandemic-election-approaches"> Connecticut</a> clerks say they’re adjusting to a new normal. As was the case in the 2020 general election, and due to a provision in the state budget passed this legislative session, all voters will be able to check the COVID-19 box as a reason for voting via absentee ballot. “We were given direction from the Secretary of the State’s Office that we’re allowed to use COVID as the reason for voting absentee. Anyone who’s afraid of contracting COVID or expects they’ll be sick, it’s the same policy that we used last year,” Groton Town Clerk Betsy Moukawsher said. Kate Wall, president of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association, confirmed that an email was sent to town clerks from the Secretary of the State’s Office in recent weeks saying clerks could send out absentee ballot applications to all voters if they’d like, but it’s not mandated. Federal COVID-19 relief money that went toward sending out absentee ballot applications to eligible voters, which the state Secretary of the State’s Office did last year, will not be available to municipalities this year. In<a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2021/08/20/summit-county-covid-19-mask-early-voting-2021-election/8166452002/"> Summit County, Ohio</a>,  an order requiring the public to mask up in county buildings includes the early voting site for the general election, which begins in less than two months however Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro’s office said it would look the other way when it comes to the early voting center, though the public will be asked to mask. Although the secretary of state’s office has yet to issue any statewide guidance for 2021 elections with regard to masking, the office said it is aware of the situation in Summit. “All lawfully registered Summit County voters who wish to vote early in-person must be allowed to do so,” LaRose spokesman Rob Nichols said. “And local public officials cannot unilaterally add extra preconditions to an individual’s fundamental right to vote.” Shapiro’s staff, as well as Democrats and Republicans on the board of elections, say masks won’t be a barrier to voting.</p>

Lucky for Ramsey, Elections Surveyor Michael Arvanites had stopped by the location in his role as a troubleshooter and began CPR after being alerted to the situation. “I put my ear to his chest, couldn’t hear a heartbeat,’’ Arvanites recalled. “I started hand-only CPR and he came out of it and grabbed my arm. Right around then, Mike Cusick had flagged down the firefighters and they took over.’’ Carolina Ramsey credited Arvanites for saving her husband’s life. “Mike came running out, he’s an Eagle Scout,’’ she said. “The CPR revived him. He was dead.’’Once transported by ambulance to Staten Island University Hospital, Robert Ramsey received emergency treatment, then underwent coronary bypass and aortic valve replacement surgery. Arvanites, who learned CPR as an Eagle Scout, refused to take all the credit. He instead praised a great group effort by poll workers, police and firefighters. His Elections Co-Surveyor Robert Bozza helped too, he said, and one of the coordinators, Lori Lamirata, brought water to everyone on a very hot day and kept the crowd at bay to allow rescue efforts to take place.</p>

A large,<a href="https://www.pharostribune.com/news/article_2313c64c-01f9-11ec-ac3b-430b8ce04764.html"> heavy, old-style voting machine</a> has been alone in a Cass County 4-H Fairgrounds building for a few years, collecting dust but not votes. What is known is that it hasn’t been used in an election in at least 25 years. And it’s so old, it predates the internet. What is unknown is exactly who it belongs to. According to the Pharos-Tribune, most likely, it was given to the Cass County Historical Society earlier this century. However, the Cass County Clerk’s Office and the Cass County Election Board are sorting that out and are getting help from the community. The machine, which measures 6 feet long, 4 feet high and 3 feet wide, was in a storage building at the fairgrounds. Now that they’re cleaning up the building, the fairgrounds staff has to do something with what is left. “I don’t think we can just get rid of a voting machine,” Lynn Korniak, Purdue 4-H Extension director said. So she contacted Cass County Clerk Destry Richey, and Richey contacted the Indiana Secretary of State’s Election Division and previous Cass County Clerk Beth Liming. It’s older than the eight years Liming was clerk, and Liming believes that the machine is one of a set that the Cass County Commissioners scrapped.</p>

Based on a thorough review of the publicly available information, this report identifies seven core defects that undermine the review’s credibility and should call into question any of the review’s findings. The seven defects are: lack of transparency, lack of impartiality, problematic contracting, faulty ballot review process, unacceptable error built in, insufficient security, and false public allegations.</p>
<p>In the excerpt of the report below, the co-authors detail why the Cyber Ninjas are unlikely to produce reliable results from their work:  “The review of ballots and voting equipment being undertaken in Veterans Memorial Coliseum by Cyber Ninjas and other contractors deviates in significant ways from the procedures outlined in Arizona state law and best practices adopted around the country. As the contractors, who have little or no experience with election administration, have rapidly scaled up procuring equipment, establishing procedures, and hiring staff, significant problems have appeared. They include processing errors caused by a lack of basic knowledge, partisan biases of the people conducting the audit, and inconsistencies of procedures that undermine the reliability of the review and any conclusions they may draw. In particular, the operation lacks the consistency, attention to detail and transparency that are requirements for credible and reliable election reviews.” A copy of this report is available <a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=dOOQzUBvOXAxCaULtariHXbRgRYb6xyGIK1VD38Jj9IR-2B-2B6VF2smFBUH-2FileGSVuuSXR-2BVd9BeOyZCc51rOa06JA8UWVlYONz7IArT8Dh5aO4xt7h4lvGQiYSGitye9wSg676Hu-2FyO6xsti8TylxrKi8ho-2B7yiGYaZEC1BohDRs-3D9BU1_-2F7L-2FB5nlo9Oufu4MyDuH3e8wcmKJO5FAexiZQvqW29BNzNTfeSUmhhDFfdr2v7LQJC506cFwIBqPm5QWTaNEeOchj0Ie3bPnftkP3CHr-2FYPzaCJ8NVQNbZ9Ze1JtF3vRj0SEawSXUaeuBQosaAYf0Uvq1otVKmZMFYOb1BOYp-2B828kqNpjCcUyLzGz0dwqkexvMYhS6N1wFVAkEF5SIABlPi0Den-2F6tjI0RjHZxIyAnB-2FUir1ImPJlVYVxKy9GjubfQazoGL4tHBy4d5o4WE7K6f0Y0Uu-2FoyTSi-2B7W4FlSFaXbNB157Z2ru0Pq4wYka5AkZc6RI01igQrmCjf8d-2FcTZWV-2FkPgvBLVUDyIls7543t7Or561FfZUimOgRm2Yb1uP3hGtHKJkrzJdWkRY8Uhw-3D-3D">here.</a></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: House Democrats have passed legislation that would strengthen a landmark civil rights-era voting law weakened by the Supreme Court over the past decade, a step party leaders tout as progress in their quest to fight back against voting restrictions advanced in Republican-led states. The bill, which is part of a broader Democratic effort to enact a sweeping overhaul of elections, was approved on a 219-212 vote, with no Republican support<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-us-supreme-court-laws-bills-voting-rights-40773a3825d282478a6e88dff887d2ce">. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</a>, named for the late Georgia congressman who made the issue a defining one of his career, would restore voting rights protections that have been dismantled by the Supreme Court. Under the proposal, the Justice Department would again police new changes to voting laws in states that have racked up a series of “violations,” drawing them into a mandatory review process known as “preclearance.”  The practice was first put in place under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But it was struck down by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court in 2013, which ruled the formula for determining which states needed their laws reviewed was outdated and unfairly punitive. The court did, however, say that Congress could come up with a new formula, which is what the bill does.  In many cases, the new bill wouldn’t apply to laws enacted in the years since the court’s 2013 ruling. That likely includes the wave of new Republican-backed restrictions inspired by Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen 2020 election. One provision in the bill would ban many types of voter ID laws, including those already on the books.</p>

Several people speaking to the panel also recommended changes to the Show-Me State&#8217;s ballot initiative process, recommending that it be more difficult for voters to directly amend the state&#8217;s constitution or pass laws. The bulk of false information surrounding elections came from those who attended or followed a conference in South Dakota hosted by My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell.  Trish Vincent, who serves as Ashcroft&#8217;s chief of staff, told the committee the state has &#8220;a very secure system&#8221; with &#8220;layers of security.&#8221; Greene County Clerk Shane Schoeller, the only county official to testify to the committee Tuesday, said he and other local officials &#8220;welcome scrutiny,&#8221; but are confident in their ability and security to conduct and certify election results. The only technological hiccups they&#8217;ve encountered, Schoeller said, were not with election machines but with registration ones.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7348" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Allegheny-CountyPA-300x279.png" alt="" width="211" height="196" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Allegheny-CountyPA-300x279.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Allegheny-CountyPA.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" />Pennsylvania:</strong> Three ordinances aimed at amending<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2021/08/24/allegheny-county-council-meeting-committee-on-government-reform-election-policies-ordinances-public-observation/stories/202108240146"> Allegheny County</a>’s elections policies were introduced at county council this week. All three sought to amend the administration code to “establish a uniform policy” for various election policies, like public observation of voting machine testing procedures, observation of state-mandated election audits and public review of all videos taken within election facilities. These ordinances were proposed “to foster transparency in the election process within Allegheny County,” according to the ordinance documents. The measures were sent to council’s Committee on Government Reform without discussion. Pennsylvania law already permits the county Board of Elections to appoint “watchers at primaries and elections,” however, even with amendments as recent as 2020, it doesn’t expressly allow for public viewing of the pre-election setup or the testing of voting machine hardware.</p>

The measure will be offered in the 2022 session that opens January 11. “A number of states (45) have the ability to do this,” Secretary of State Steve Barnett told other board members. The Legislature blocked his office’s attempt in the 2021 session at online voter registration. The Senate voted 21-13 for a version allowing registered voters to make changes online but specifically prohibiting online registration. The House State Affairs Committee failed 6-7 to pass a more-amended version that allowed online registration in some instances. Barnett said he sensed an appetite among lawmakers for allowing registered voters to make changes online.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3942" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Texas:</strong> By a 9 to 5 party line vote, a<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/23/texas-voting-bill-legislature/"> House committee advanced Senate Bill 1</a>. The bill adds an extra hour of required early voting hours, moving it from eight hours to nine, and it increases the number of counties that are required to provide at least 12 hours of early voting each weekday of the second week of early voting. But it also creates a new window for early voting — between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. — to forbid Harris County’s efforts to provide overnight voting for shift workers and others for whom typical hours don’t work. The bill also makes it a state jail felony for local election officials to distribute unsolicited applications for a mail-in ballot, even to voters 65 and older who automatically qualify to vote by mail, or to provide applications to local groups helping to get out the vote. The legislation grants poll watchers “free movement” at polling places and makes it a criminal offense to obstruct their view or distance the watcher “in a manner that would make observation not reasonably effective.” The bill also says poll watchers cannot be removed from the polling place for violating the law or the election code unless they were previously warned their behavior was illegal. The bill heads to the chamber’s Calendars Committee, which is then expected to place it on an agenda so it can be taken up by the full House as soon as this week.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5218" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> An attorney for the Libertarian Party of Alabama asked an 11th Circuit panel to overturn a federal judge’s order rejecting the party’s challenge to a law which allows<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/alabama-libertarian-party-fights-for-access-to-voter-rolls-at-11th-circuit/"> some political parties to get a free copy</a> of the state voter registration list while others are charged a fee. A free electronic copy of Alabama’s voter registration list is provided to every political party that satisfies the ballot access requirements for an election. The list contains information for every legally registered voter in the state, including their name, address and voting history. Parties can meet the access requirement either by achieving at least 20% of the entire vote cast for a state officer in the prior general election or by filing a petition with signatures of at least 3% of qualified voters who cast a ballot in the last gubernatorial election. The political parties that do not qualify for a free copy of the list are charged one cent per voter record. An attorney for the Libertarian Party of Alabama told a three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based appeals court Tuesday that a copy of the complete statewide list would cost nearly $36,000. The party claims the law violates its 14th Amendment equal protection rights and First Amendment free speech rights.</p>

It&#8217;s the second consecutive day that a court has ruled against the Arizona Senate in its fight over records related to the audit, including email and other communications. The Court of Appeals said in its order that documents from Cyber Ninjas, the lead contractor on the audit, are public records. A Superior Court judge already ruled the same way, but the Senate appealed the decision. Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, said she would appeal this decision, too. The Senate has argued that it will turn over records in its possession but does not need to provide records held by Cyber Ninjas because they are not covered by the Arizona Public Records Law. The courts have disagreed. &#8220;The Senate defendants, as officers and a public body under the (records law), have a duty to maintain and produce public records related to their official duties,&#8221; the Appeals Court judges wrote in Thursday&#8217;s decision. &#8220;This includes the public records created in connection with the audit of a separate governmental agency, authorized by the legislative branch of state government and performed by the Senate’s agents. &#8230; The requested records are no less public records simply because they are in the possession of a third party, Cyber Ninjas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Arizona Supreme Court said it<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/08/24/supreme-court-to-consider-senate-public-records-case/"> will not decide the issue</a> of whether all of the documents in the hands of Cyber Ninjas that show how it has conducted its audit. are subject to public disclosure until at least Sept. 14. The full court kept in place a stay that had been granted by Kathryn King. She had agreed to delay the order from the state Court of Appeals requiring the Senate to immediately produce anything in the hands of the private firm it hired to conduct the review of the 2020 general election.</p>

Judge Mitchell Beckloff issued a tentative ruling Aug. 13 denying the Long Beach Reform Coalition’s request, and after hearing oral arguments from the county and the coalition’s legal teams, issued a final order upholding his initial decision. Beckloff ruled that the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Clerk Dean Logan acted within the law by passing on recount costs that approached $240,000 to the coalition because the law stipulates that the costs of recounts are to be paid by the requestors. The sum would have been most expensive in county recount history. “The notion respondent complied with the law in connection with the Measure A recount undermines any claim respondent acted arbitrarily,” Beckloff wrote in his final order.</p>
<p>Attorneys filed papers in Los Angeles in opposition to a lawsuit<a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/08/25/motion-to-oppose-halting-recall-election-lawsuit-filed-in-la/"> seeking to have the gubernatorial recall election called off</a> or the ballot drastically changed before the Sept. 14 deadline to submit ballots. Lawyers for California voters Carla Endow, Lisa Long and Marllus Gandrud filed the motion in federal court to intervene in litigation brought by two other voters against Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who is conducting the recall election. The Aug. 14 lawsuit filed on behalf of plaintiffs Rex Julian Beaber and A.W. Clark seeks a preliminary injunction to halt the recall election or — falling short of that — to add Gov. Gavin Newsom to the ballot as a candidate. The suit argues that the state’s recall provision violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution by allowing sitting governors to be replaced by candidates who have received fewer votes. Over 1 million ballots have been received by election officials.</p>

Boulee ruled against a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-strikes-down-part-of-georgia-voting-law-that-banned-photography/JCMUOR5AVJDSPNEPIZNU3PNESA/"> broad ban on photographing</a> voted ballots Friday, throwing out a part of Georgia’s new election law while allowing the rest of it to stand. The decision is the first time a judge has invalidated a section of the 98-page voting law, which also limits ballot drop boxes, requires more ID to vote absentee and allows the state government to take over county elections. Boulee rejected the law’s sweeping prohibition of photographing or recording any filled-out ballot, finding that such far-reaching restrictions violate freedom of speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Boulee upheld other parts of the<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/new-georgia-law-changes-voting-rules-and-maybe-results/4QBKQXRS45GUZHBSQ67W4FVLRY/"> law</a> fought in the lawsuit, including a requirement that voters request absentee ballots at least 11 days before election day and a prohibition on election observers communicating information to anyone other than election officials. “The court recognizes that a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted sparingly, especially when it enjoins enforcement of a statute, but finds it is appropriate here given the constitutional rights at stake and plaintiffs’ satisfaction of the requisite burden,” Boulee wrote in a 39-page order. Seven other lawsuits opposing the law, including a case by the U.S. Department of Justice, are also pending.</p>
<p>The Georgia Supreme Court<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-high-court-double-voting-insufficient-to-overturn-local-race/JSW7BNXRV5E53DFW7MEX74QH5I/"> upheld a Long County election</a> where seven people cast illegitimate ballots, less than the nine-vote margin in the race. The ruling ends a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/double-voting-and-election-irregularities-alleged-in-long-county-ga/HUFM6XYON5G3XLWFJKBAJVEC5Q/"> yearlong case</a> that sought a new election for probate judge after the losing candidate alleged double-voting, nonresident voting and incomplete absentee ballot documents. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s finding that six people voted twice and one person wasn’t a resident of Long County, located in southeast Georgia. But those improper votes fell short of the number needed to overturn the election. “Those seven ballots were not sufficient to place the results of the election in doubt given the nine-vote margin of victory in this case,” Justice Carla Wong McMillan wrote in a 7-0 decision. Former Long County Probate Judge Bobby Harrison Smith lost to Teresa Odum 1,375 to 1,366.</p>
<p>A self-described voting watchdog organization and a Republican state legislator who represents a suburban Atlanta district are suing to prevent the state’s<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/suit-backed-by-georgia-lawmaker-challenges-states-ballot-barcode-system/"> continued use of an electronic voting system that uses a barcode</a> to verify how a ballot is cast. The nonprofit VoterGa and Rep. Philip Singleton argue in the petition filed in Fulton County Superior Court that the current Dominion Voting Systems ballot marking devices violate state law because voters cannot be certain that the scanned QR codes accurately reflect their votes. The paper ballot voters are given to scan into a computer lists printed names of selected candidates that are supposed to be captured by the barcode. “The primary (claim) in this petition is this system is illegal because it accumulates in-person votes that are hidden in QR Code,” VoterGA founder Garland Favorito said. “The QR code is unverifiable to the elector even if you have a code reader.” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is dismissive of the lawsuit. “Last year in the largest recount in U.S. history, it was proven that the QR code and the plain text both reflect the voter’s choice,” Raffensperger said in a statement. “An academic study showed that voters do review their ballots. This lawsuit is a waste of time and taxpayer money and will fail.”</p>

The Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution, a coalition of mostly Idaho attorneys, also joined Reclaim Idaho’s lawsuit. The state’s highest court ruled that the law would have infringed on a fundamental right for a citizen-led initiative. The Legislature and Secretary of State’s Office “failed to present a compelling state interest for limiting that right,” the Supreme Court wrote. “Ultimately, the effect of SB 1110 is to prevent a perceived, yet unsubstantiated fear of the ‘tyranny of the majority,’ by replacing it with an actual ‘tyranny of the minority,’ ” the Supreme Court wrote in its opinion, adding that the law conflicts with “the democratic ideals that form the bedrock of the constitutional republic created by the Idaho Constitution.” The new law is now void. The Idaho Legislature will have to pay Reclaim Idaho and the committee their attorney fees for the lawsuit, on top of the fees paid its own attorney to defend the law.</p>

The court ruled appellants, Herb McMillan and George Gallagher, two Republican candidates who have argued the city’s new election system does not follow City Code, failed to show that their appeal was “desirable and in the public interest,” according to the order signed by Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera. “I am happy that the petition was denied. We believe mail-in-voting will be necessary going forward, especially as we focus on public health precautions and navigate our way out of the pandemic,” City Attorney Mike Lyles said in a statement. “Our team has worked to ensure the integrity of this election despite attempts to disrupt it with this legal action.” With the ruling, the city may now proceed with mailing out ballots on Aug. 30 to registered Democratic voters in the three contested primaries in Ward 3, Ward 4 and Ward 8 for the upcoming Sept. 21 primary election.</p>

Parker of the Federal District Court in Detroit  ordered<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/politics/sidney-powell-election-sanctions.html"> sanctions to be levied against nine pro-Trump lawyers</a>, including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, ruling that a lawsuit laden with conspiracy theories that they filed last year challenging the validity of the presidential election was “a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process.” In her decision, Parker ordered the lawyers to be referred to the local legal authorities in their home states for possible suspension or disbarment. Declaring that the lawsuit should never have been filed, Judge Parker wrote in her 110-page order that it was “one thing to take on the charge of vindicating rights associated with an allegedly fraudulent election,” but another to deceive “a federal court and the American people into believing that rights were infringed.” “This is what happened here,” she wrote. In her decision, Parker accused Powell and Wood of abusing “the well-established rules” of litigation by making claims that were backed by neither the law nor evidence, but were instead marked by “speculation, conjecture and unwarranted suspicion.” “This case was never about fraud,” Parker wrote. “It was about undermining the people’s faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so.”</p>

At a hearing conducted last week via teleconference in Minnesota, Schiltz described the &#8220;tremendous overlap&#8221; between the cases in Minnesota and D.C. Attorneys for Lindell and MyPillow said they preferred to continue litigating in Minnesota but would not stand in the way of a transfer. &#8220;Your lawsuit here is basically saying that lawsuit out in D.C. is illegal,&#8221; Schiltz said. &#8220;I understand you&#8217;re alleging it is part of a bigger conspiracy … but the lawsuit in D.C. is the centerpiece of your lawsuit here, and it kind of seems strange that we would take discovery and litigate whether the D.C. lawsuit is a good lawsuit here while you&#8217;re out in D.C. taking discovery and litigating whether the D.C. lawsuit is a good lawsuit out there.&#8221;</p>

The ruling said, “It is apparent that the Legislature did not intend for election commissioners and deputy chief election commissioners to be recognized as county officers.” Instead, the court said, election commissioners and their deputies are to be recognized as county employees. The court case looked at a 1913 law known as the Election Act which allows the governor of a state to appoint an election commissioner in counties with a population over 100,000 people (Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy Counties). The law also allows an election commissioner to appoint a chief deputy election commissioner of the opposing party. A 2019 opinion by Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson questioned the constitutionality of appointing election commissioners and their deputies in Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy Counties. In response to the opinion, Gov. Pete Ricketts refused to appoint a Douglas County Election Commissioner and Peterson later filed a lawsuit.</p>

The petitioners have, in return, filed suit to force a referendum onto the ballot. On July 29, Ruccione rejected the first petition from the group of organizers, citing what he said was an insufficient number of signatures and other deficiencies in the petition. His rejection letter gave the petitioners ten days to collect more signatures and resubmit. In the following ten days, the organizers collected another 2,100 signatures, bringing the total to 3,450, and submitted them to Ruccione on August 9. They also indicated they would sue if the petition was rejected once again.  Ruccione said he would review the new petition by August 13, but soon afterwards pushed his own deadline back to August 18. On Friday Ruccione said that while his office has still only reviewed 655 of the 2,100 new signatures, he is rejecting the petition once again, on the grounds that it did not sufficiently correct other the errors present in the first petition.</p>

GOP state lawmakers, who were defending the law in court, plan to appeal Monday’s ruling to a higher court. But if the ruling is upheld on appeal, then people convicted of felonies in North Carolina will regain their right to vote once they leave prison. “Everyone on felony probation, parole or post-supervision release can now register and vote, starting today,” the challengers’ lawyer, Stanton Jones, said in a text message after the ruling came down. It’s the biggest expansion of voting rights in North Carolina since the 1960s, said Daryl Atkinson, co-director of Durham civil rights group Forward Justice and a lawyer for the challengers in this case. The law’s challengers argued that felon disenfranchisement laws were explicitly created to stop Black people from voting in the years after the Civil War and coincided with a widespread campaign to accuse newly freed Black people of felonies — troubling trends, they said, which have continued into the current day. If the  ruling survives on appeal, North Carolina will be the only state in the South to automatically restore voting rights to people after they leave prison. Legislative leaders have<a href="https://www.heraldsun.com/news/state/article253705363.html"> replaced state government attorneys</a> with a private lawyer to defend them in litigation challenging the rules on when felony offenders can get their voting rights restored.</p>

The lawsuit, filed in May by Look Ahead America LLC, steers clear of any explicit allegation that Dominion voting machines were used to defraud the 2020 presidential election. Look Ahead accused the Stark County Board of Elections of violating open meetings laws as it considered its eventual recommendation that the County Commission (which was also dismissed from the lawsuit Friday) buy new machines from Dominion. Heath wrote in an<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21047817-dominion-dismissed-from-lookahead-lawsuit"> order of dismissal</a> that the law “does not extend nearly as far” as Look Ahead seeks. She said Ohio’s Open Meeting Act laws don’t give courts the power to “invalidate” decisions of a body that may have violated the act. It also doesn’t allow them to invalidate a decision by the county commission, which isn’t even accused of violating any open meetings law, Heath determined. “Plaintiffs further do not explain how the Open Meetings Act can in any way restrain the commercial activity of a private company [Dominion] several degrees removed from the initial decision of the BOE,” she wrote.</p>

Sebastiani, 63, had been on the job for 10 months when she was fired in June for what commissioners said was a series of errors and office leadership failures that plagued the election bureau during the November 2020 presidential election and the May 2021 primary. According to the four-count lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, Sebastiani claimed commissioners routinely criticized her work, blamed her for staff mistakes and refused to take responsibility for their roles in creating problems that arose both before and after the elections. Sebastiani also accused commissioners of political coercion and claimed the secretary for Commissioner Sean Kertes ordered her to switch her voter registration from Democrat to Republican.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://marchonforvotingrights.org/">March On For Voting Rights</a>: On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King led 250,000 people on a historic March On Washington. There, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, he delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, calling on the nation to rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. At the time, Black Americans were living under the tyranny of laws—called “Jim Crow” laws— that legalized racial discrimination. His speech that day has become one of the defining moments in American history. Today, state legislatures are pushing America back to the Jim Crow era with laws that reinstate systemic discrimination at the ballot box. That is why, on August 28, 2021—58 years to the day after his father’s march—Martin Luther King III will help to lead Americans on another march to demand federal voting rights protection. <strong>When:</strong> August 28. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC and cities throughout the country.</p>
