							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Like a Trapper Keeper for Civic Holidays</strong><br />
<em>Website brings together several major democratic engagement organizations</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7229" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CivicsHoliday-300x143.png" alt="" width="445" height="212" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CivicsHoliday-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CivicsHoliday-1024x488.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CivicsHoliday-768x366.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CivicsHoliday-1536x732.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CivicsHoliday-2048x976.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" />Nearly a decade ago,<a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/"> National Voter Registration Day</a> became one of the nation’s first Civic Holidays. In recent years, it’s been joined by<a href="https://votereducationweek.org/"> National Voter Education Week</a>,<a href="https://www.voteearlyday.org/"> Vote Early Day</a>, and<a href="https://electionheroday.org/"> Election Hero Day</a>.</p>
<p>That can be a lot of holidays for a busy, civic-minded college student (or anyone really) to keep track of, so enter what we like to call the virtual Trapper Keeper —<a href="https://civicholidays.org/"> CivicHolidays.org</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://civicholidays.org/">CivicHolidays.org</a> is a one-stop website that allows users interested in celebrating any of the four fall Civic Holidays to learn about and participate in each of the events, and to find the resources they need to plan celebrations in their communities.</p>
<p>The new site is the work of the<a href="https://slsvcoalition.org/"> Students Learn Students Vote Coalition</a> (SLSV) in partnership with the national organizations running the individual holidays. SLSV is a national hub and largest nonpartisan network in the country dedicated to increasing student voter participation. The SLSV Coalition is essentially the central nervous system that helps coordinate hundreds of national and local/on-campus organizations working to empower college students to participate in elections and be more civically <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-7231" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NVRD-300x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="228" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NVRD.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NVRD-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />engaged.</p>
<p>“The goal was always for each Civic Holiday to complement one another and build off and lead into each holiday,” explained Marissa Corrente, deputy director of SLSV. “Following 2020 we realized that our intent wasn’t always perfectly clear to our partners, and the feedback we gathered from partners following the 2020 Election Cycle supported that. There was clear value in streamlining things to make them even more collaborative.”</p>
<p>According to Corrente, the idea – and opportunity &#8211; for <a href="http://civicholidays.org/">CivicHolidays.org </a>really came about during the SLSV Coalition&#8217;s Annual Post Election Gathering.</p>
<p>“During the event we pulled together all the holiday leads and did an intentional ideation session with partners from across the Coalition about the civic holiday space,” Corrente explained. “We asked<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YPhXww2Br93ePdZzNw8LsWJEj3hOqpEWpML1mOQkDgY/edit?usp=sharing"> broad questions and holiday-specific questions </a>and one of the biggest takeaways was that we needed to create a resource where folks could easily learn about and get plugged into all the different voter-focused civic holiday opportunities at once. The group began convening regularly in January <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7233" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voter-Ed-Week-300x108.png" alt="" width="300" height="108" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voter-Ed-Week-300x108.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voter-Ed-Week.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />and the website was one of the first pieces we tackled.”</p>
<p>According to Eddy Zerbe, special projects director with SLSV, college students have consistently high political and civic engagement but that didn’t always translate to voting rates until the last few years. One reason for that Zerbe said is because students tend to face several unique challenges as first-time voters.</p>
<p>From figuring out voter registration requirements, to learning what and who is on your ballot, to figuring out how to actually vote and what documentation you may need, voting can be a difficult process for those who have never done it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7230" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Election-Hero-Day-300x118.png" alt="" width="300" height="118" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Election-Hero-Day-300x118.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Election-Hero-Day.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The new site walks students through the voter engagement cycle, registering them to vote, teaching them what&#8217;s on their ballot, and helping them cast their vote &#8211; and it does so in a very fun and celebratory way across the entire nation, said Zerbe.</p>
<p>“Young and college-aged voters are new to the process. Eighteen is often a time of significant change for young people from graduating high school, starting work or attending college, to moving to a new home,” said Debi Lombardi, program director,<a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/"> National Voter Registration Day</a>. “On top of that, how to register and vote varies greatly from state to state and is not always addressed in high school. The Civic Holidays and the site we run jointly can provide support for new and young voters at every step of the voting process while celebrating that they are likely voting for the first time!”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7232" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VoteEarlyDay-300x178.png" alt="" width="239" height="142" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VoteEarlyDay-300x178.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VoteEarlyDay.png 456w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" />Although the site launched this year, during election low season, Lombardi was quick to point out that every election matters.</p>
<p>“The pandemic highlighted the critical role that local elected officials play in our day-to-day lives and the health of our communities. More than ever, people were tuned into what their local and state elected officials were doing and how that would impact their lives from wearing masks to ensuring effective vaccine rollout,” Lombardi said. “We launched the site this year to make it easier for partners to engage voters in their city and statewide elections taking place across the country this year addressing the needs of their community.”</p>

							<h2>Best Practices</h2>
														<p><strong>Chain of custody is essential to a transparent and trustworthy election</strong><br />
<em>EAC releases best practices</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission has released a<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/bestpractices/Chain_of_Custody_Best_Practices.pdf"> Chain of Custody Best Practices</a>.</p>
<p>Chain of custody is essential to a transparent and trustworthy election. Every election office should have written chain of custody procedures available for public inspection prior to every election. Once a chain of custody process is initiated, it must be followed with every step documented. Upon completion, the process should be reviewed and updated based on any lessons learned. This report outlines items election officials should consider when developing or revising their chain of custody procedures for physical election materials, voting systems, and the use of third-party auditors for conducting audits and electronic discovery.</p>
<p>Chain of Custody refers to the processes, or paper trail, that documents the transfer of materials from one person (or place) to the next. Every state and local jurisdiction has its own controls for ensuring the chain of custody of election materials is properly maintained. These controls may include locks, seals, audit logs, witness signatures, or other security measures. This document is intended to provide best practices, checklists, and sample forms for maintaining a proper chain of custody related to the successful operation of an election but is not meant to be comprehensive of every election process. Jurisdictions are reminded to implement these voluntary best practices only after reviewing federal, state, and local laws and regulations.</p>
<p>While the chain of custody process varies by jurisdiction, here are few key questions to keep in mind when developing your chain of custody materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the item that is going to be transferred?</li>
<li>Are adequate safeguards in place?</li>
<li>Who currently has access to this item?</li>
<li>What makes this item unique (description, serial number, physical condition, etc.…)?</li>
<li>When and where is this item being transferred (time, date, location)?</li>
<li>Where is this item being transferred to?</li>
<li>Who is transferring this item?</li>
<li>What is the condition of the item to be delivered?</li>
<li>Who witnessed this transfer?</li>
<li>When and where did the item arrive?</li>
<li>What is the condition of the item upon receipt?</li>
</ul>
<p>The chain of custody of ballots, voting equipment, and associated data is essential to ensure the election system remains trustworthy. Documentation of the chain of custody also provides evidence that all voting procedures were followed. It is a best practice for chain of custody procedures to be clearly defined in advance of every election, well documented and followed consistently throughout the entire election lifecycle or process.</p>
<p>The key to an effective chain of custody is to have a set of procedures which are followed in practice. The procedures should be in writing with all steps documented. Chain of custody should be thought about as a wholistic process that takes all required pieces (e.g., data collection, transparency, processing, review, etc.) into account.</p>

Despite that, city does not meet the criteria for a Section 203 designation and therefore, until recently, voting materials had not been provided in Arabic. Advocates in the city are calling on the city clerk to add voting information in Arabic. And while the city did recently add an absentee ballot request form in Arabic to its website, advocates would like to see more. Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told the Detroit Free Press that the city still doesn&#8217;t have Arabic-language ballots, Arabic-language options on its website to alert non-English speakers to the forms, and there is no drop-off box or satellite location in the eastern part of the city, which has sizable numbers of Arab Americans. Dearborn is about 47% Arab American, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. But voting turnout in areas where Arab Americans make up a large percentage, such as the eastern and southeastern sections, is much lower, according to voting data. &#8220;With the largest concentration of Arab Americans, the city clerk should on his own initiative make sure that all voting information is available in Arabic, including on the web,&#8221; Ayoub said. &#8220;It&#8217;s skewing voter participation and it&#8217;s a method of voter suppression.&#8221; While Dearborn Clerk  George Darany did not respond to the Detroit Free Press, he did respond to an email from Ayoub about the issue: &#8220;Many Arabic-Only speaking voters come to the Clerk’s Office daily to vote absentee,&#8221; Darany wrote. &#8220;They usually bring a relative to help them with the translation. If they do not have someone to help them, we have Arabic speaking employees to help.&#8221; Darany said in his email: &#8220;I want to make clear that accessibility to voting is provided to EVERY REGISTERED VOTER regardless of what primary language they speak. We are currently working on having sample ballots in Arabic available on the City of Dearborn website and at the polls on Election day. Arabic speaking poll workers are currently being assigned where needed. We also hope to have sample Absentee Ballot Applications in Arabic available soon. Also, a Voter Registration Form is currently available in Arabic on the City of Dearborn website.&#8221;</p>

One of the biggest complaints at the hearing was the lack of voter education about the new ranking system. Civil rights attorney Esmerelda Simmons said when you look at places where ranked choice voting has worked, they did a lot to get people ready. “They had a very long educational period. They did things in school … parent teacher night. Six months, nine month education — not two months,” said Simmons. However, others pointed to the city’s board of elections as the main issue with the primary. “I know there has been criticism by some that there was not enough education, that this happened too quickly. Not true at all,” said Kate Doran of the League of Women Voters. “The problem with June’s primary election was not ranked choice voting. It was the incompetency of the Board of Elections,” said Assembly member Robert Carole. Despite issues at the board of elections and concerns about ranked choice voting, an analysis released by good government group Citizens Union concluded that<a href="https://www.amny.com/politics/ranked-choice-voting-boosted-turnout-diversity-nyc-primary/"> RCV did what it was designed to do when voters approved the system</a> in a 2019 ballot referendum: increase voter interest and participation; reduce “wasted votes;” eliminate costly and sparsely-attended runoffs; and pave the way for a city government that better represents the Five Boroughs’ demographics.</p>

One way to access technology that can save work effort and reduce the risk of errors is to enshrine the use of GIS in elections in state statute. At least eight states around the country have already taken this step, and The<a href="https://www.nsgic.org/"> National States Geographic Information Council</a>’s GIS and elections experts used their enacted statute to create model statutory language that is now available to election administrators, secretaries of state, geographic information officers, and elected representatives around the country.

The audits will cover state expenditures of 2018 and 2020 Election Security grants, 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act grants, and any state expenditures from grant funding issued prior to FY 2011. These audits encompass $1.23 billion which make up 17% of total HAVA funds. The OIG identified Arizona, California, Delaware, Indiana, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington to be audited. The states were selected by the OIG based on an audit risk analysis that considered neutral factors, applied to all 56 of the grant recipients. The analysis considered elements such as award amount, expenditures, and results of the OIG’s previous audits of HAVA funds in each state or territory. The public accounting firm, McBride, Lock &amp; Associates, LLC from Kansas City, MO will be conducting the audits on behalf of the OIG. The firm has previously performed HAVA grant fund audits for the EAC.</p>

More than 1,000 participants ran through hypothetical scenarios affecting election operations to share practices around cyber and physical incident planning, preparedness, identification, response, and recovery.</p>

<p>“Election security is achieved through proactive planning and preparedness across the election community. Tabletop the Vote 2021 gave election professionals, federal and state security partners, and private sector representatives from around the country the opportunity to discuss and share protocols and communications to ensure a coordinated effort to strengthen and protect voting processes in the United States. We remain committed to this effort and to supporting election officials, federal partners, and others who serve on the front lines of our nation’s elections.”</p>
<p>This year’s Tabletop the Vote included representatives from across the federal government, including CISA, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Department of Defense, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Justice, U.S. Cyber Command, U.S. Northern Command, National Security Agency, National Guard Bureau, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Postal Service, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Election systems have been designated critical infrastructure on par with the nation’s power plants, banks and dams. “You can do election infrastructure in there because that is part of infrastructure,” Klobuchar said according to The Associated Press. “It’s no substitute for the For the People Act, but it is something we can start working on immediately and are working on right now.” Under the congressional budget process, certain measures regarding revenues, spending and the debt can be approved with a 51-vote threshold, which is why Democrats are pursuing it. The process allows them to bypass a near-certain filibuster from Republicans. But there’s a catch: The Senate’s nonpartisan parliamentarian can rule for the removal of any provision not directly related to the budget, or items whose budget impact is “merely incidental” to their intended policy changes.</p>

They’ll be asked this November to weigh in on whether the city should use ranked-choice voting to elect its mayor and council, starting in 2023. Ranked-choice voting “would provide opportunities for more candidates to freely run for office while encouraging positive yet competitive campaigns where the winner is chosen by a majority of the voters,” Councilmember Deven Shaff said in a Wednesday statement from the advocacy group Ranked Choice Voting for Colorado. If voters approve the ballot measure, Broomfield would follow the lead of Boulder, where in 2020, citizens decided to elect their mayor by ranked-choice voting in 2023.</p>

After allowing pandemic-era election policies to lapse on June 30, House and Senate negotiators reached a deal on a fiscal 2021 spending bill that effectively revives and extends the voting provisions until Dec. 15. A six-person conference committee filed the proposed agreement on competing supplemental budgets (H 3871 / S 2845) with the House clerk&#8217;s office Friday afternoon, 15 days after legislative leaders formed the panel. The bill could be sent to Gov. Charlie Baker next week. In its version of the supplemental budget, the House voted to make mail-in voting and expanded early voting permanent but only in even-year state primaries, general elections and municipal elections that fall on the same day. The solution that legislative negotiators reached flips the expired pandemic voting law temporarily back into effect with a new end date of Dec. 15, punting the long-term debate to another time. The bill is<a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/bill-to-extend-massachusetts-vote-by-mail-heads-to-governor-s-desk/37095974"> now headed</a> to Gov. Charlie Baker’s desk.</p>

Tom Wolf vetoed last month — now that Wolf has changed his public position to say he’s open to new voter ID requirements. Wolf told the Philadelphia Inquirer last week that he is open to new voter ID rules. In announcing his plan to reintroduce his bill, state Rep. Seth Grove (R., York), the chair of the House State Government Committee, cited Wolf’s comments to The Inquirer. It’s unclear whether Wolf will be open to negotiating the reintroduced bill. He told The Inquirer that he had prejudged the original voter ID proposal as suppressive before seeing it — and that he believes he was right — and that he didn’t negotiate because he didn’t believe Republicans were acting in good faith. But he also signaled that he is open to some stricter measures, including requiring ID for mail voting.<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/06/pa-election-law-voter-id-republican-proposal/"> Grove’s original bill would have changed nearly every aspect of elections</a>, including registration, voting by mail, in-person voting, vote counting, and post-election audits. Some provisions would likely have expanded access to the ballot, such as the establishment of in-person early voting, while others may have restricted access, especially in the state’s largest counties. For example, standards on the use of mail-ballot drop boxes would have limited Philadelphia to a lower number per resident than other counties. Grove said in his memo that the bill would be updated to include changes sought by State Reps. Jared Solomon (D., Philadelphia) and Mark Longietti (D., Mercer). The updated bill would also include $3.1 million in state funding to create and operate a Bureau of Election Audits within the Department of the Auditor General.</p>

Cuomo says the goal was to make it easier for voters to vote and to streamline some processes for boards of elections. Here are the changes: Eliminating signed absentee ballot applications and allowing absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day to be considered timely. Allowing voters to request absentee ballots through electronic means. Requiring boards of elections to post information about changes in polling places. Conforming deadlines for the mailing of applications for absentee ballots to USPS guidelines. Allowing candidates who have lost primaries to be removed from ballots as candidates for different parties. Increasing election district registrant enrollment from 1,150 to 2,000. &#8220;This sweeping, comprehensive package of legislation will make it easier for voters, candidates and boards of elections to perform their critical functions and keep our democracy running,” said Cuomo. “Elections have enormous consequences for New Yorkers across the state, and these reforms will bolster their ability to use their voices at the ballot box.&#8221;</p>

The proposal did not specify which results would be checked. The audit would apply to counties with populations over 415,000.  The bill calls on the governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker to appoint a third party to perform a forensic audit starting Nov. 1 and to be completed by Feb. 1, 2022. “Not later than March 1, 2022, the independent third party conducting the audit under this section shall submit a report to the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the house of representatives, and each member of the legislature detailing any anomalies or discrepancies in voter data, ballot data, or tabulation,” the bill reads. The legislation was filed on July 12, the same day Texas House Democrats fled to Washington. House Republicans in Austin can’t hear bills in committee or on the floor as long as there’s not a quorum of two-thirds of representatives present.</p>

Mike Dunleavy to proceed. The recall process began in 2019 and the legal fight started after the state elections director refused to certify the recall application, asserting it wasn&#8217;t legally or factually sufficient. The Alaska Supreme Court in May 2020 upheld a lower court ruling that said the Alaska Division of Elections had improperly rejected the petition seeking Dunleavy&#8217;s removal. But the decision outlining the ruling wasn&#8217;t published and publicly available until last week.  The 58-page opinion written by Justice Peter Maassen finds that if the petition meets legal grounds, then voters, not state elections officials or judges, should decide what justifies a recall. The state had argued the Division of Elections and the courts &#8220;should act as gatekeepers to determine which allegations are serious enough to be presented to the voters&#8221; and called some of the accusations &#8220;harmless&#8221; and without long-term effect, Maassen wrote.</p>

Kemp rejected arguments that only documents in the Senate’s actual possession are subject to the state’s public records law. “Nothing in the statute absolves Senate defendants’ responsibilities to keep and maintain records for authorities supported by public monies by merely retaining a third-party contractor who in turns hires subvendors,’’ Kemp wrote. He noted that Fann herself made statements that the audit is a public function. Allowing those documents to now be shielded, the judge said, “would be an absurd result and undermine Arizona’s strong public policy in favor of permitting access to records reflecting governmental activity.’’ Significantly, the information the judge said should be released to the public includes who is financing the audit. The $150,000 the Senate agreed to pay Cyber Ninjas “appears to be far short of paying the full cost,’’ Kemp said.</p>

The Florida Democratic Party, Democratic lawmakers and other plaintiffs filed the lawsuit last year in Leon County circuit court against Secretary of State Laurel Lee, state Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews and elections supervisors in Broward, Orange, Lee, Duval, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, Pinellas and Miami-Dade counties. The public-records lawsuit focused on ballot images that are created when ballots are scanned. It contended that some county supervisors of elections do not preserve the images, which could be needed to verify the accuracy of vote counts.  Then-Leon County Circuit Judge Charles Dodson in August dismissed Matthews from the case but let it move forward against Lee and the county supervisors. The supervisors went to the 1st District Court of Appeal, arguing that they should have been sued in their home counties, instead of in Leon County. The appeals court agreed Monday in a<a href="https://www.1dca.org/content/download/758966/opinion/202445_DC13_07192021_132711_i.pdf"> six-page opinion</a> and dismissed the supervisors from the case.  “In this case, the appellees (the Democratic Party and other plaintiffs) have alleged that the supervisors have put their First Amendment rights at risk, but they have not explained how,” said the opinion, written by Judge Thomas Winokur and joined by Judges Stepanie Ray and Robert Long. “They also argue that equal-protection rights may be violated if digital ballot copies are destroyed because paper ballots lost before a recount would not be tallied and some voters’ voices would not be heard. But this possible danger does not show that the supervisors are invading the appellees’ constitutional rights in Leon County, and certainly does not satisfy the requirements of (a type of legal exception) allowing them to be sued in Leon County.”</p>

The lawsuit aimed to void the election of Georgia’s Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to the U.S. Senate. The latest lawsuit contested the Senate election results and sought a new election to be conducted on paper ballots. The plaintiff, Fulton County resident Michael Daugherty, said the senate election was marred by misconduct, raising doubts that Warnock and Ossoff were the true winners. He cited allegations of improper ballot counting at State Farm Arena in Atlanta on election night in November. Those allegations were investigated and debunked by the Secretary of State’s Office. The defendants in the lawsuit included Warnock and Ossoff, as well as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the State Election Board, and election boards in Fulton, DeKalb and Coffee counties. In court briefs and arguments, they said Daugherty’s arguments have already been rejected by judges in other lawsuits. They said the problems he cited occurred in November, not during the January runoff. They argued the election challenge was filed too late and that the lawsuit was not properly served on Warnock and Ossoff. Amero agreed the challenge was not filed in time and that the senators were not properly served.</p>

Legal fights over how Indiana removes the registrations of voters who may have moved have carried out since 2017, with voter rights groups mostly winning protections against voter purges in court. On Monday, these groups added U.S. Circuit Judge Diane Wood’s<a href="https://mk0courthouseneqdhi2.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indiana-voter-purge-ruling.pdf"> 31-page decision</a> to that list of victories. The groups say two laws in recent years — SB 422 and the more recent SEA 334, or Act 334 — circumvent rules put in place by the National Voter Registration Act, or NVRA, meant to govern the fair and safe maintenance of voter registrations and target minority voters in particular. The Indiana government and proponents of the laws say they are meant to promptly correct discrepancies in the state’s voter registrations in the name of defending against election fraud.</p>

DePerno filed the claim of appeal Wednesday on behalf of Bill Bailey, of Central Lake Township. Bailey filed suit Nov. 23, accusing the county of voter fraud and of violating his constitutional rights, after initial results of the 2020 Presidential election showed about 2,000 votes cast for then-President Donald Trump had mistakenly been assigned to then-challenger Joe Biden. Bailey also accused the county of diluting his vote, after a marijuana proposal, allowing a single dispensary in the Village of Central Lake passed by a single vote. On May 18, 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin Elsenheimer dismissed the lawsuit, ruling the court had already provided Bailey with all the relief available to him. That relief included signing a court order in early December allowing Bailey’s forensic team access to the county’s election equipment and placing the equipment under a protective seal. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, an intervening defendant, then sent Bureau of Elections staff to the Kearney Township Hall on Dec. 17, to train local volunteer poll workers for a hand recount of the county’s presidential election and later conducted statewide audits. Elsenheimer noted both these events in his dismissal.</p>

A 2020 lawsuit over the polling place resulted in Dutchess County Supreme Court Justice Maria Rosa designating the college as a polling place after it was learned that BOE Republican Election Commissioner Erik Haight was “untrue” when he testified to the judge about logistics. Voters in District 5 were able to cast their 2020 ballots at the campus center after Judge Rosa ordered it. Bard sent letters to the BOE in February and March of this year seeking to be designated as a place for votes to be cast.  The BOE was supposed to designate the polling places by March 15 but failed to do it.  “The inability of the BOE to reach a different result on or before March 15, 2021, cannot turn back the clock to some point in time before Judge Rosa’s orders,” said the attorneys. A postcard mailed to voters from the BOE in April was “confusing,” according to the latest lawsuit.  Sent to voters in the district, it lists the church as the official polling place.  However, it also says “you may continue to vote at the accessible polling place on this card.”  Lawyers say that because the church is not “accessible” pursuant to the ADA, the card is misleading.</p>

An 8th U.S. Circuit of Appeals panel upheld a federal judge&#8217;s May 2020 order that the state pay $452,983. Secretary of State Al Jaeger told the Tribune in a statement that &#8220;The decision is being reviewed and all options are being considered.&#8221; He did not elaborate or say where the money would come from to pay the bill. The state in February 2020 agreed to settle longstanding legal disputes with Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa members as well as the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock Sioux tribes. The crux of the tribal claims was that North Dakota’s requirement that voters have identification with a provable street address creates a voting barrier for Native Americans who live on reservations where street addresses are hard to come by. The dispute at one point reached the U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. District Judge Dan Hovland in April 2020 approved the agreement, which included provisions that aimed to ensure Native American voters have valid IDs and can meet the address requirement. The deal also called for the state to reimburse each tribe up to $5,000 for the cost of issuing addresses and identification for that year’s election cycle, and to pay the cost of a mediator the two sides used. Jaeger at the time estimated the amount to be about $9,000. Plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys also sought more than $1.1 million in attorney fees and expenses. The state found the claim unreasonable and objected. Hovland later sided with the tribes but reduced the amount by 60%, saying some claimed expenses were excessive. The state appealed, saying the request had been filed too late. The appellate judges agreed but said the gaffe was &#8220;excusable.&#8221; &#8220;There is no evidence that the plaintiffs acted in bad faith,&#8221; the panel wrote in its decision upholding Hovland&#8217;s order.</p>

Overall, reached by phone on Monday, said he has not hired an attorney and reiterated that his voting twice was a mistake. The latest charges, filed in June, come in one of 27 cases referred by Wisconsin election officials to prosecutors out of more than 3 million ballots cast. No other charges have been brought from that group, and district attorneys have said they are not pursuing charges in 18 of those cases. The other eight are either still under review, or the district attorney did not provide an update Monday.</p>

														<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/democracy-fund-language-access-for-voters-webinar-tickets-159904810593">Language Access For Voters</a>: As we all eagerly await the release of census data, including the redistricting data file, another important data release by the Census Bureau is scheduled for December 2021 – the next set of Section 203 determinations. Section 203 has required the provision of language assistance for many Limited English Proficient (LEP) voters for more than four decades, and, when properly implemented, has increased civic participation by the covered language group. The Census Bureau is responsible for making the Section 203 determinations based on American Community Survey.  Join us to review the previous determinations to assess which jurisdictions just missed coverage in 2016, and which may be covered during the next determinations, and hear from our guest election officials and voting rights advocates what can be done in preparation for the next set of determinations. <strong>When:</strong> July 22, 3:30pm <strong>Eastern.</strong> Where: Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nfrpp.org/event/for-the-people-act-hr-1-s-1-unpacked/">For The People Act Unpacked</a>: The FPA has received enormous media attention. The partisan battles have been well covered. Most Americans favor fair and just voting rights and laws. Most want voting to be accessible and simplified.
