							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Point &lt;&#8211;&gt; Counterpoint</strong><br />
<em>Does the U.S. need another presidential election commission?</em></p>
<p>We’re going to try something new this week in electionline. A Point-Counterpoint on a current, debatable topic in the field of election administration.</p>
<p>This first topic will be about the idea of a presidential election commission to review the 2020 election and to restore trust in democracy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6731" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PresidentialSeal-300x239.png" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PresidentialSeal-300x239.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PresidentialSeal.png 672w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In the days and months following the November 3, 2020 election—in which no tangible election fraud has been discovered—some, including many Republicans in Congress, have pushed for a presidential commission on election integrity. Something akin to former President Donald J. Trump’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Advisory_Commission_on_Election_Integrity"> Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity</a> and former President Barack Obama’s<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/the-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/"> Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a>.  And of course there was the<a href="https://millercenter.org/issues-policy/governance/the-national-commission-on-federal-election-reform"> National Commission on Federal Election Reform</a> created in the wake of the 2000 election with former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter serving as honorary co-chairs.</p>
<p>Each of these past commissions have met with varying degrees of success. The proposed improvements to federal, state and local elections systems presented by the National Commission on Federal Election Reform were largely adopted in the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/HAVA41.PDF"> Help America Vote Act of 2002</a>. After a six month review, the Presidential Commission on Election Administration released a<a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/report-on-the-american-voting-experience/754/"> 112-page report</a> recommending expanded online voter registration and early balloting, updated voting equipment and share voter registration records across state lines to protect against fraud to name a few. Many of the recommendations have been codified into law in numerous state. The Advisory Commission on Election Integrity disbanded within six months of its creation and<a href="https://apnews.com/article/f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d"> uncovered no evidence</a> to support claims of widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>So what could a new presidential election commission do? We’ll let David Levine and Steven Daitch argue their points and counterpoints.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: If you&#8217;ve got an election administration issue you&#8217;d like to debate, grab a sparing partner and send us an mail mmoretti@electionline.org.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Point</strong><br />
<em>Our country needs a presidential commission to help restore trust in democracy</em></p>
<p>By David Levine, elections integrity fellow<br />
<a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/">Alliance for Securing Democracy</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6729" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DLevine-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />January 6’s deadly insurrection made it<a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Presidential-Commission-on-Election-Resilience-and-Trust.pdf"> abundantly clear</a> that there is a crisis of trust in American democracy. The rioters who stormed the Capitol building and disrupted Congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election had their anger stoked by<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/01/10/capitol-rioters-identified-arrested/?arc404=true"> repeated unproven</a> claims of voter fraud and related malfeasance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the ground remains ripe for such claims to permeate future elections as well. Rather than building on the achievements of 2020, many states are considering legislation that re-litigates the presidential election by addressing non-problems. As a result, we are now witnessing arguably<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/us/voting-rights-advocates-filibuster.html"> the most consequential struggle</a> over American elections since the civil rights era – a battle increasingly centered on a sweeping overhaul of election rules proposed by a Democrat-controlled Congress with the avowed aim of offsetting a wave of voting restrictions being considered by Republican-controlled state legislatures. If we continue down this path, we face the prospect of a near-term future featuring<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/us/republican-voter-suppression.html"> two kinds of elections</a> in which voting rights, participation and faith in the results vary widely, depending on which party wrote the rules. We should not let that happen, but how can we stop it?</p>
<p>A good first step would be for President Biden to establish a bipartisan<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/02/cybersecurity-202-experts-push-biden-establish-presidential-commission-boost-trust-elections/"> Presidential Commission on Election Resilience and Trust</a> to identify best practices and make recommendations to help ensure that more Americans believe that our elections are legitimate in advance of the 2022 midterm elections. Like the highly successful 2013<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/18/yes-u-s-election-integrity-could-be-improved-heres-why-the-pence-commission-probably-wont-do-it/"> Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a>, this body would include representatives from the private and public sectors, including state and local election administrators, as well as experts on mis- and disinformation and national security who understand how false information can undermine democracy.</p>
<p>As a former election official, I believe election administrators, lawmakers, the private sector and civil society organizations have a collective responsibility to bolster and maintain trust in elections. The 2020 election saw both a significant amount of election mis- and disinformation, and historic interest, as evidenced by the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/"> largest nationwide voter turnout</a> in over a century. As citizens become increasingly interested in the conduct of their elections – and mis- and disinformation continue to spread – the elections community must work to be<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/beyond-2020-policy-recommendations-future-election-security?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=D3P_Beyond2020%20(1)&amp;utm_content=&amp;spMailingID=24466442&amp;spUserID=NjkwNzU2OTM0MTA1S0&amp;spJobID=1920365931&amp;spReportId=MTkyMDM2NTkzMQS2"> trusted sources of information</a> who can help credibly respond to concerns and rebut inaccurate information.</p>
<p>In that vein, this Commission should focus on at least three things: 1) best practices to bolster trust in elections and increase voter confidence, regardless of who wins; 2) best practices for countering information from malign actors that undermines confidence in election integrity; and 3) how and whether to make permanent some of the administrative and policy changes implemented by state and local election officials in response to the coronavirus pandemic, such as the expansion of absentee and early voting. While some of this could undoubtedly replough familiar ground, considering the threat of bad actors to American democracy, and their continuous efforts to further undermine it, a body like the Commission has never been more necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint<br />
</strong><em>Public and private sector advocates already working to restore trust in democracy</em></p>
<p>By Steven Daitch, elections coordinator<br />
<a href="https://www.miottawa.org/Departments/CountyClerk/Elections/">Ottawa County, Michigan</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6728" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SDaitch-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="200" />A presidential commission, like the Presidential Commission on Election Administration that was formed in 2013, might be a useful tool. Such a commission may be able to bring together experts in unique and helpful ways to improve trust in American democracy. Unfortunately, the world has changed dramatically over the past several years. The year 2013 was not short on political sparring, but the gap in trust among Americans has turned into a full-blown canyon. A presidential commission of any kind would be viewed as a purely partisan endeavor.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the proposed goals for such a commission are not worthwhile. The question is, would a presidential commission be the best way to implement these goals? Any of these goals would face an immediate challenge – a significant portion of the country still believes that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. This is a pernicious lie, but one that has dramatically changed the environment in which we run elections.</p>
<p>If our purpose is to increase trust in elections, it’s worth looking at other options for meeting the goals of such a commission. One avenue is to focus on what we know already works to build trust. We know that voters trust their local election officials more than any other source of election information. We also know,<a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/most-trusted-brands-report-download/"> according to Morning Consult</a>, “reliability is the key driver of brand trust” among consumers.</p>
<p>How do we apply these lessons to trust in elections? First, voters need to hear from their local election officials. Secondly, election administrators need a consistent message. And finally, the electoral system overall must be viewed as reliable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, local election officials often lack the resources – both time and money – needed to implement a full communication strategy. But there are organizations that can help with these efforts. These same organizations can also assist with consistent messaging. Just one example of such an effort already underway is the implementation of consistent absentee ballot envelopes that were developed by the Center for Civic Design.</p>
<p>Yes, a presidential commission would help bring these parties to the same table. Absolutely. But there is already interest among agencies in both the private and public sectors to do this work. An outside organization coordinating these activities would not be directly tied to a single politician from a single political party, thereby alienating a large swath of the electorate.</p>
<p>It’s almost cliché to say that election administration “gets in the blood,” but there’s a great deal of truth in that sentiment. The reason why so many of us wake up every day excited to work in this field is because we believe in the democratic process. Whether or not a commission is formed, laws are passed, or budgets are approved, we have an opportunity to be evangelists for the cause of democracy. This, ultimately, is what will build a broader perception in the reliability of our elections. Not a single voice, but a chorus of election officials, taking democracy directly to their voters, from sea to shining sea.</p>
<p><em>Steve Daitch is the Elections Coordinator for <a href="https://www.miottawa.org/Departments/CountyClerk/Elections/">Ottawa County, Michigan</a>. In this role, he has worked extensively on voter communications, culminating in a 2020 Clearie Award for his office’s #OttawaVotes campaign.

According to the AP analysis, election officials and voting experts attribute the declines to extensive voter education campaigns; work by volunteers to help find voters and fix ballot issues; and myriad efforts to make absentee voting easier, including new ways for people to track their ballots. Concerns about U.S. Postal Service delays also played a role, motivating voters to return ballots early or take advantage of a fleet of drop boxes that were deployed for the election. Ohio’s rejection rate declined from 1.35% in the primary to just 0.42% in November. “All of those things that we did helped to reduce the error rate,” said Secretary of State Frank LaRose. “And that’s a really big success story — that we had massive absentee voting and a tiny number of errors.” For its analysis, the AP sought 2020 ballot data from swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In nine, it found the mailed ballot rejection rate declined. Pennsylvania said data was not yet available, and Arizona noted its numbers were preliminary. Of the states, Colorado sends mail ballots to all registered voters and about 75% of Arizona voters are on a permanent early voting list and automatically receive ballots in the mail.</p>

Ralph Northam said that he has<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-voting-felons-northam/2021/03/16/b171271e-868d-11eb-82bc-e58213caa38e_story.html"> restored the voting rights of 69,000 people convicted of felonies</a> under a policy change that speeds up the process, no longer requiring former prisoners to go through lengthy probations before qualifying to seek restoration. This year, Virginia’s General Assembly gave preliminary approval to a constitutional amendment that would automatically restore voting rights for felons as soon as they complete their incarceration. That measure would have to be approved by the legislature again next year and then put to the voters in a referendum before going into effect. In the meantime, Northam said he was taking a cue from that proposal and changing the timing of his process, reviewing rights as soon as someone is freed. “Probationary periods can last for years,” Northam said in prepared remarks as he announced the change at a Richmond nonprofit. “But that’s also time in which a person is living in the community, rebuilding their lives. They should be able to exercise those civil rights, even if they are still under supervision.”</p>

Johnson has sold for $85,332</a>, according to Boston-based auction firm. The legislation was designed to secure the right to vote for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in southern states, during the nation’s tumultuous civil rights era. The 10-page document is signed “Lyndon B. Johnson, August 6, 1965” and is an official printing of the law, according to auctioneers RR Auction. The document also bears the signatures of then Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and Speaker of the House John McCormack — fellow Democrats. McCormack was born in Boston and served in the Massachusetts Legislature earlier in his career. A representative of the auction house said the document was purchased by Kenneth Rendell, a historical document dealer based in the suburbs of Boston, who had been waiting decades for the signed copy to reach the marketplace Rendell said in a press release that a New York Republican member of Congress at the time had the GOP print a second copy of the bill, which he carried into the signing ceremony inside his suit jacket and slipped it in front of Johnson, who signed it after he signed the copy that went to the National Archives.</p>

This is the first time that ranked choice has come into play in a city election since being approved by voters. On Tuesday, election workers finished their first day of tallying the 7,400 ballots, sorting the first-choice votes by candidate into plastic bins labeled with their names. “I’ve been here all day watching,&#8221; Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York executive director, said at the ballot-counting site in Queens. &#8220;It’s very well thought-out,<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/3/16/22335159/queens-ranked-choice-vote-count-slogs-special-election"> it’s very organized and very orderly</a>. And it’s absolutely clear what they’re doing and how to understand the process.” Although this race is being manually tabulated, it is expected that software will be in place by the June mayoral primary. While the city BOE hopes to have software in place by June, it is still unknown is how the Board of Elections will present ranked-choice ballot counts to the public — especially in the scenario in which one candidate gets 50% of votes right away, without a ranked-choice tally. Assemblymember Daniel Rosenthal (D-Queens) last week<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A06172&amp;term=2021"> introduced a bill</a> that would mandate the Board of Elections disclose complete ranking tabulations regardless of outcome — even if a candidate won more than 50% of the vote. Rosenthal said in a release that it is “vital to maintaining the trust and transparency of ranked choice voting that the full data be released to the public.”</p>

He was 71. Wojaszek was hired as deputy clerk in 2014 following a long career in education and as mayor of Rockaway Township. According to County Clerk Ann Grossi, Wojaszek worked up until about a month before his death, despite declining health. &#8220;We owe him a great deal of gratitude for his many years of service overseeing elections and ensuring Morris County residents were well taken care of,&#8221; the Morris County Democratic Committee said in a statement. In his role as deputy clerk, Grossi said, she relied on Wojtaszek&#8217;s experience to make sure elections ran smoothly. &#8220;I used to call him my work husband, and then we would fight like brothers and sisters, but we never got mad,&#8221; she said.  He carried his passion for elections into the classroom. &#8220;He would bring the voting machines into school and do a mock election so the students would learn how to vote,&#8221; Grossi said. &#8220;He was politically brilliant and he was kind. He could handle anything that came his way. I feel such a great sense of loss. I&#8217;ve known John for 20 years, and he was always there for people.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://www.dni.gov/"> Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a> released the<a href="https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2192-intelligence-community-assessment-on-foreign-threats-to-the-2020-u-s-federal-elections"> unclassified version</a> of the National Intelligence Council’s classified intelligence community assessment on foreign influence and interference in the 2020 elections earlier this week. The report, Foreign Threats to the 2020 U.S. Federal Elections, outlines the intelligence community’s findings on foreign interference or influence activities conducted by Russia, Iran, China, and other actors. Among its key judgements, the assessment states that “we have no indications that any foreign actors attempted to alter any technical aspect of the voting process in the 2020 U.S. elections, including voter registration, casting ballots, vote tabulation, or reporting results.” Although some “successful compromises of state and local government networks prior to Election Day” were identified, the assessment concludes these intrusions were not directed at the election. The assessment further concludes that Russia, Iran, and others “spread false or inflated claims about alleged compromises of voting systems to try to undermine public confidence in election processes and results.”</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.justice.gov/"> Department of Justice</a> and<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/"> Department of Homeland Security</a> released an<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/16/joint-statement-departments-justice-and-homeland-security-assessing-impact-foreign"> unclassified summary</a> of their classified joint report on the impact of foreign activities on election infrastructure used in the 2020 elections earlier this week. The report, Foreign Interference Targeting Election Infrastructure or Political Organization, Campaign, or Candidate Infrastructure Related to the 2020 US Federal Election, outlines the departments’ findings regarding the impact of foreign interference activities conducted by Russia, Iran, China, and other actors on the security and integrity of election infrastructure. Among its key findings, the report states that “we […] have no evidence that any foreign government-affiliated actor prevented voting, changed votes, or disrupted the ability to tally votes or to transmit election results in a timely manner; altered any technical aspect of the voting process; or otherwise compromised the integrity of voter registration information of any ballots cast during 2020 federal elections.”</p>
<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security released an<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/17/odni-doj-and-dhs-release-unclassified-summary-assessment-domestic-violent-extremism"> unclassified summary</a> of their joint comprehensive threat assessment on domestic violent extremism earlier this week. The report, Domestic Violent Extremism Poses Heightened Threat in 2021, assesses that “domestic violent extremists (DVEs) who are motivated by a range of ideologies and galvanized by recent political and societal events in the U.S. pose an elevated threat to the Homeland in 2021.” The report finds that “newer sociopolitical developments—such as narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conspiracy theories promoting violence—will almost certainly spur some DVEs to try to engage in violence this year,” including violence targeting government facilities and personnel.</p>

The legislation, which faces an uphill battle in the Senate includes<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-rethink-u-s-voting-system-what-s-massive-h-n1260284"> provisions</a> that aim to make it easier to register and vote, prevent gerrymandering, improve election cybersecurity and reform campaign finance, among other initiatives. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said “everything is on the table” to pass the For the People Act. “We will see if our Republican friends join us. If they don’t join us, our caucus will come together and decide the appropriate action to take,” Schumer said. “Failure is not an option.” The bill would need a minimum of 10 Republicans votes to defeat a filibuster and move to a final vote on passage. President Joseph R. Biden (D) said that he supports the legislation as well as revising the Senate filibuster, although he does not support the elimination of the filibuster.  “This issue is bigger than the filibuster,” said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia)in his first major floor speech. “No Senate rule should overrule the integrity of our democracy.” “We must find a way to pass voting rights, whether we get rid of the filibuster or not,” said Warnock, who has held onto his role as senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, where civil rights icon the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was pastor in the 1960s. The House passed its version of the For the People Act, H.R.1, on March 3 with all but one Democrat voting in favor of and all Republicans voting against the legislation. The Senate Rules Committee is set to hold a hearing on the bill March 24.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> The Constitution, Campaigns and Elections committee approved legislation from Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, that would allow county absentee election managers to open additional places for people to cast<a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2021/03/17/alabama-house-committee-oks-more-absentee-voting-locations-shorter-application-deadline/4730349001/"> absentee</a> ballots. Shortly after, the committee approved a bill from Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, to shorten the time to mail absentee voter applications from five days before an election to 10 days.  Both bills passed on voice votes and head to the House for further consideration.  Garrett&#8217;s bill would allow counties to designate places besides courthouses where individuals could turn in their absentee ballots. The absentee election manager would have to be present at the locations for the votes to be cast. Garrett said during the committee debate over the bill that people living in suburban Jefferson County had to travel. Baker&#8217;s legislation would change state law on absentee ballot applications. Alabama law requires all absentee ballot applications to be delivered five days before an election. Baker&#8217;s bill would require mailed applications to be delivered 10 days before an election. Absentee ballot applications could still be delivered in person up to five days before an election.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4166" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />California:</strong> The Legislature is considering whether to make it more difficult for local election officials to<a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-local-elections-california-elections-54658ce494669012a596362c73442a5a"> reject ballots</a> because a voter’s signature doesn’t exactly match what’s on file. Voters who cast ballots by mail must now sign their ballot. Election officials then compare that signature to the one in the voter’s registration file. Election officials can disqualify ballots if the signatures don’t match. The secretary of state’s office issued temporary rules for the November election presuming a voter’s signature was legitimate, making an exact match unnecessary. To reject a ballot, election officials had to believe “beyond a reasonable doubt” that signatures didn’t match. Those rules are set to expire in July. A bill before the California Legislature would make them permanent. Of the more than 17.7 million ballots Californians cast in the November general election, 49,816 ballots were rejected because a signature did not match. More than 86% of all ballots cast in that election were vote by mail. “This gives confidence to all Californians that their votes are counted,” said State Sen. Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park), the bill’s author</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3843" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Colorado:</strong> The House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee voted 6-3 to move forward a  proposal  forward to the Appropriations Committee that  would lower the threshold at which counties are required to<a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/legislature/house-advances-ranked-choice-voting-multilingual-ballot-proposals/article_3e67a158-82b4-11eb-8ebc-fb5f5df5790e.html"> provide sample ballots in multiple languages</a>. Under the Voting Rights Act, that threshold sits at over 10,000 voting age citizens or over than 5% of the total voting-age population in a county who speak a common language and do not speak English “very well” as defined by the American Community Survey. The bill would lower those standards to 2,000 voting-age citizens or 2.5% of the total voting-age population in a county. That would broaden the number of counties required to provide multilingual ballots from four – Denver, Conejos, Costilla and Saguache – to 22. The bill would also require the secretary of state’s office to set up a multilingual ballot hotline to provide access to translators by the November 2022 election. The bill won support from a number of advocacy groups and county clerks, including the top election officials in Denver, Adams, Arapahoe and Jefferson counties. Adams County Clerk Josh Zygielbaum explained while his county was already moving to institute multilingual ballots, others might not because of costs. “Once this bill goes into effect, hopefully it goes into effect, those costs will actually be reimbursable through the secretary of state&#8217;s office, thereby making it easier for counties to actually afford from a cost perspective,” he said.</p>
<p>The House Finance Committee voted to approve a proposal from Rep. Chris Kennedy, D-Lakewood, seeking to increase access to<a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/legislature/house-advances-ranked-choice-voting-multilingual-ballot-proposals/article_3e67a158-82b4-11eb-8ebc-fb5f5df5790e.html"> ranked-choice voting</a> at the local level. The bill also features Rep. Jeni Arndt, D-Fort Collins, Senate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg, D-Boulder, and Sen. Faith Winter, D-Westminster, as sponsors. Cities are already allowed to use ranked-choice voting, but only three actually do. That’s because locals often rely on their county clerks to administer elections, and county clerks are required under state law to administer standard first-past-the-post elections. Kennedy’s bill would allow cities who opt into instant runoff elections to continue to have their county clerks administer their elections. The proposal last month cleared the House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, which Kennedy chairs, before winning the approval of the Finance Committee on Thursday. It now heads to the Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5354" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Delaware:</strong> State Sen. Kyle Evans Gay (D-Talleyville) has introduced a bill that would create an<a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/post/bill-introduced-make-voter-registration-automatic-through-delaware-dmv"> automatic voter registration</a> system through the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV). It would let all driver’s license or  identification card applications serve as voter registration applications when the applicant shows proof of U.S. citizenship. People registered through the automatic system the bill would establish could opt out or affiliate with a political party through a follow-up mailer. They could also affiliate at a polling place during the next primary election after their registration.  If passed, the bill would take effect two years after being signed by the Governor or five days after the state Election Commissioner certifies that the systems needed to implement it are functional, whichever comes first.  The bill has been assigned to the Senate Elections &amp; Government Affairs Committee. “Really this legislation is meant to set our system up for success today and success in the future,” Gay said. “In my mind, if we’re missing one potential voter, if we can improve the system and bring that person into the system and give them the ability to vote and participate, then we are doing something right.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> Under legislation now under consideration by Florida lawmakers, county elections supervisors would be able to<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2021/03/17/election-security-breaches-kept-secret-under-florida-legislation/4715916001/"> withhold information</a> about the ever-present possibility of systems being hacked and voter records being altered. Voting rights groups, government watchdogs and members of Florida’s congressional delegation have pushed for greater transparency in disclosing those security breaches, but a measure by Sen. Doug Broxson, R-Gulf Breeze, would go the opposite direction.  “We’ve seen in past elections a real invasion from outside sources to try to intimidate and change certain information,” Broxson said Tuesday in introducing the bill (<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/1704">SB 1704</a>). “It happened in my county.” In its first committee hearing, the bill was cleared without debate or objection. It has two more committees before it reaches the Senate floor. Because the bill expands an existing public records exemption, it will need a two-thirds vote for final passage. The measure has the full backing of the statewide Florida Supervisors of Elections association, which has made it a legislative priority.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5199" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Georgia:</strong> Georgia Republicans have introduced<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/03/17/georgia-house-committee-hears-newer-bigger-voting-omnibus-you-havent-seen-yet"> yet another omnibus bill</a> that would drastically change the state&#8217;s voting laws, this time transforming a two-page proposal about absentee applications into a<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20516177-georgia-voting-omnibus-sb-202-lc280325"> 93-page omnibus</a> released an hour before a committee meeting. As it passed the Senate, SB 202 would prohibit third-party groups from mailing multiple absentee applications to Georgians that have already requested, received or returned a mail-in ballot. Violators would face a fine. But Rep. Barry Fleming (R-Harlem) introduced a substitute that adds 50 other sections to the bill, including banning people from giving food and water to voters waiting in line, limiting early voting days for larger counties, and adding ID requirements to absentee ballots. According to Georgia Public Broadcasting, in Wednesday&#8217;s Special Committee on Election Integrity, Fleming walked through several additions to the bill but left some out. The first section reads that the General Assembly &#8220;finds and declares&#8221; a number of things about the 2020 election cycle and proclaims that &#8220;the changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political spectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting.&#8221; The most controversial language in the bill would standardize early voting days and hours, forcing most counties to be open longer and add a weekend day of early voting, while preventing larger, more Democratic-leaning counties from having a full slate of weekend voting. Some of the eliminated days include the highest proportion of Black voters during early voting, and county officials large and small have expressed concerns with the changes.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5487" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Illinois:</strong> The Illinois House Ethics and Elections Committee advanced a bill Monday that would<a href="https://qctimes.com/illinois-house-committee-advances-bill-expanding-ballot-drop-boxes-curbside-voting/article_d7ac0556-33ae-573c-b4ac-9728e872f07d.html"> expand ballot drop boxes and curbside voting</a> throughout the state. House Bill 1871 would make changes similar to those passed ahead of the 2020 presidential election during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill was introduced last month by Democratic Rep. Katie Stuart of Edwardsville. Under HB 1871, Illinois may use federal funds distributed to states for election administration through the 2002 Help America Vote Act to create and maintain secure collection sites for mail ballots. If enacted, the legislation would allow for voters with temporary or permanent disabilities to engage in curbside voting on election day or on early voting days. A curb-side voting program must have at least two election judges, with at least one from the Democratic Party and one from the Republican party, present at each vehicle where curbside voting is taking place and the ballots must be filled out without interference from the election judges. The bill would also expand mail voting by mandating that all election authorities accept any mail ballot, even if it is returned with no postage or not enough postage. Election officials would also have the option to legally maintain postage-free collection sites where voters can return their mail ballots. The law would postmark ballots received after business hours as having arrived the next day, except for ballots dropped off after hours on election day, which will be treated as having arrived on election day.</p>

If passed,<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&amp;ba=HF%20818"> HF 818</a>ensures voting rights would be reinstated once a person convicted of a felony has completed sentencing, parole and probation and paid any owed monetary damages prior to his or her sentence is discharged. Individuals convicted of child endangerment that resulted in the death of a minor or election misconduct in the first degree would need to receive a pardon from the governor. Gov. Kim Reynolds<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/Iowa%20Voting%20Rights%20Restoration%20Executive%20Order.pdf"> signed an executive order Aug. 5, 2020</a>, that restored the rights of citizenship, except for firearms, to all convicted of a felony – except for “homicide and related crimes” under chapter 707 – who had discharged their sentences by that date. Anyone seeking a pardon or to have firearm rights restored has to send an application to the Iowa Board of Parole. The bill, however, would provide a permanent policy fix.</p>
<p>Senate File 531, approved by the Senate 30-17 has also been moved forward by a House State Government subcommittee. The bill would<a href="https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/capitol-digest-bill-gives-secretary-of-state-emergency-election-powers/article_e67b598e-81d0-5b86-8d40-aec0608cf816.html"> give the secretary of state more flexibility</a> when conducting elections during an emergency. Currently, any changes the secretary of state wants to make have to be approved by the Legislative Council. The 2020 election made lawmakers aware “there are all sorts of noncontroversial, but important, changes that can be made that we shouldn’t necessarily need the Legislative Council to convene to approve every single one,” Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, said. The council would be able to address changes it believes were improper, he added. “It makes sense to give the SOS some flexibility while maintaining some oversight,” Kaufmann said.</p>

But it backed off from the temporary, pandemic-related accommodations made last year that allowed widespread mail-in absentee balloting. The bill also seeks to strengthen election security protections. The legislation would relax pre-pandemic voting law to make it easier to vote. It would allow counties to establish vote centers, where any voter in the county could vote regardless of precinct. It would maintain an online portal for Kentuckians to request a mail-in ballot but keep existing restrictions on who can vote by mail. On the election security side, the bill would result in the statewide transition toward universal paper ballots to guarantee a paper audit trail. It enhances the ability of state election officials to remove nonresident voters from voter rolls. It expressly prohibits and penalizes ballot harvesting, the practice of collecting ballots from likely supporters and returning them to election offices. The bill was returned to the House however it didn&#8217;t come up for a potential final vote before the House adjourned shortly before midnight. That means supporters will have to wait until lawmakers reconvene for a two-day wrap-up session in late March to take up the measure. If it clears the legislature, it would be sent to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.</p>

One would allow the legislature to create a process for<a href="https://www.wabi.tv/2021/03/17/legislative-committee-discusses-bill-to-allow-early-voting-in-maine/"> early voting</a> that municipalities could adopt if they choose to do so. Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn answered questions regarding the process. She says Mainers would vote in the same manner they do on election day, but ballots wouldn’t be counted until election day. Flynn says early voting can be more efficient than absentee voting, but many Maine towns may not be able to handle early in-person voting. “It’s as convenient for the voter, and as long as you have the right security measures, it’s as secure for the voter as early in-person absentee voting, but it’s a heck of a lot more efficient for the town, and I would say less costly to administer,” said Flynn. The committee voted eight to four to recommend the bill pass.</p>

The bill extends the mail-in voting option to the general public due to COVID-19 past March 31. It also lets cities and towns with a municipal caucus before June 30 to postpone the caucus up to Aug. 1. Local officials could also vote to eliminate a municipal caucus that’s happening before July 30 and rely on nomination papers to nominate candidates, according to the bill. The proposal is meant to give lawmakers more time to debate permanent election reforms, including whether the expanded mail-in voting option should stay or whether the state should offer same-day voter registration. The mail-in voting bill now goes back to the House to vote on final passage. The Senate vote, 40-0, came after discussions about potential barriers affecting voters with disabilities. The Disability Law Center raised the issue in testimony submitted to the Senate Ways &amp; Means Committee before the Senate took up the bill. The amendment requires local election officials, when notified or requested, to make accommodations for voters with disabilities “every way possible, to every extent possible,” said Senate Ways &amp; Means Committee Chairman Michael Rodrigues. Gov. Charlie Baker has<a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/baker-signs-bill-extending-mail-in-voting-until-june-30/2VO2K5FEPFAXVLZ3NKIKYJZ2VQ/"> signed</a> the bill into law.</p>
<p>A new bill co-sponsored by state Sen.

The bill, numbered SD.1378 in the Senate and HD.449 in the House, would see the state preemptively cover costs, including salaries for overtime work and hiring additional staff. State Sen. Rebecca Rausch (D-Needham) and Rep. Steven Ultrino (D-Malden) have filed the bill in each chamber, respectively. Currently, cities and towns can ask the state to be reimbursed for election costs, but still have to foot the bill upfront, Rausch said.</p>

The federal bill would affect how Americans register to vote, how ballots are cast and how states conduct elections. Advocates say it will improve voter access to people of color and prevent gerrymandering. Opponents say it would federalize election administration. State Sen.

She called H.R. 1 “an unnecessary and reckless federal overreach.” Michigan Senate Minority Leader Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, said H.R. 1 is not “misguided” but “sensible,” voicing support for measures such as modernizing systems to better track absentee ballots, enabling notifications when polling places change and ensuring that those who have completed criminal sentences are able to vote. Shirkey supported Johnson’s resolution, saying “Michigan not Washington should determine Michigan’s election laws.”  He said the H.R. 1 gives the federal government authority not only over the election process but election results as well, calling it a “federal opportunistic power grab.”</p>
<p>While vaccine selfies are all the rage right now, a bipartisan group of state representatives introduced<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2021-HIB-4510.pdf"> House Bill 4510</a> that would update Michigan law regarding ballot photography including<a href="https://www.wlns.com/news/michigan/bill-would-legalize-ballot-selfies-in-michigan/"> ballot selfies</a>. It would specifically state that Michigan voters are allowed to take photos, including selfies, of their completed in-person or absentee ballots. The new bill would specifically allow selfies with your ballot, whether in the voting booth or at home with an absentee ballot. You would not be able to display that photo within 100 feet of the polling place.</p>

Regina Plettenberg spoke on behalf of the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders, Election Administrators. She said allowing polling places to change their hours would help them keep polling places staffed with volunteers, who she said wouldn’t want to sit waiting for people who already voted by mail.  The only opponent at the hearing was Patrick Yawakie, who represented the Blackfeet Tribe. He said allowing polling places more leeway in their hours could keep people in those precincts from voting, especially people who have to work on Election Day.  “We can’t assume how the voter’s daily life is,” Yawakie said. “We can only make it easier for them to vote.”</p>
<p>Montana college students would still be able to use their school IDs when registering to vote and casting ballots, as part of a major revision to a<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/change-to-contentious-voter-id-bill-removes-new-restrictions-for-college-students/article_bb2c08f1-bd51-5a67-b59d-5b78e0726836.html"> controversial elections bill</a> passed by a House committee this week. The amendment to<a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20211&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=SB&amp;P_BILL_NO=169&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ="> Senate Bill 169</a> effectively removed one of the most contentious elements of the legislation, while also expanding acceptable forms of identification for voters to register and cast ballots. The changes, introduced in the House State Administration Committee Wednesday by Rep. Geraldine Custer, R-Forsyth, allow voters to register with photo ID issued by a Montana college or university, while also adding concealed carry permits to the list of acceptable ID. The bill already allows for registration with a Montana ID or driver’s license, tribal photo ID, military ID, driver’s license number or the last four digits of a social security number. Failing those forms of ID, the bill would still require voters to come up with some other form of photo ID (like a Costco membership card), and pair it with official documentation showing their current address, such as a utility bill or bank statement. Those changes also apply to voting, meaning voters would have to provide the same ID or information to cast ballots in person. Custer’s amendment also allows voters to cast provisional ballots if they don’t have sufficient identification at the polling place, as long as they fill out a form stating they have “a reasonable impediment to meeting the identification requirements,” including transportation, work schedule, a disability or lost or stolen ID.</p>

The return window for mail ballots would also shrink from 5 p.m. on the seventh day after the election to 5 p.m. on the fourth day after the election.</p>

Locations and the number of places for early voting vary from county to county in Oklahoma Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols, R-Oklahoma City, said voters in his precinct reported waiting longer than three hours to cast a ballot on Election Day, so he wants to make it easier for voters to access the polls. Echols said he wishes he could expand early voting access for every election, but during most there are rarely wait times. And, if he can find a way to fund it, Echols said he’d also like to expand early voting during presidential years to include Tuesdays too. A legislative budget analysis estimates that adding a day of in-person absentee balloting every four years would cost the State Election Board about $40,000 per presidential election.

Spencer Cox has signed House Bill 70 into law. Under the new law, that state will be required to<a href="https://kjzz.com/news/all-utah-mail-in-ballots-will-now-be-tracked"> track mail ballots</a> that are sent via the USPS or dropped in a drop box. Voters will be able to sign up to receive the information via text or email. The lieutenant governor&#8217;s office, that oversees elections in Utah, will set up the system and maintain a website to confirm the status of each ballot. Cox also signed HR11 which was a<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HCR011.html"> concurrent resolution</a> honoring the state’s clerks and election workers for a job well done in the 2020 election.</p>

It would then be up to voters to choose whether to return the ballots by mail, deliver them by hand, or vote in person on Election Day. The bill makes other changes used in the 2020 general election permanent. It allows for outdoor or drive-up polling places, gives towns and school districts the option of conducting voting by mail, and allows clerks to process absentee ballots up to a month before Election Day. It also proposes an allowance for voters to correct “defective” ballots that could not be counted because the voting process was not followed correctly. Primary elections are not covered by the bill. S15 has passed a second reading voice vote by 27-3 and was set for a formal vote at press time.</p>

It would also apply to legislative races and the state&#8217;s federal offices, U.S. Senator and U.S. House. But it would not apply to local races, such as county commission or city council. The original bill would have taken effect next year for the 2022 elections. Under the bill, Wyoming primary elections would be moved from August to May, and if any runoffs are needed, they would then be held in August. That would conceivably give clerks across the state less than two months to get ready for the primary election after the results of re-districting are known. In response to those concerns, the bill was amended so that it would not take effect until 2023.</p>

That&#8217;s just a fraction of the nearly $152,000 the agency said it spent defending itself against a barrage of election fraud lawsuits</p>

Losing council candidate Webster Lincoln is suing Lopez, claiming that Lopez illegally electioneered by hiring a food truck and placing it within 100 feet of a polling place to get votes. Lopez beat Webster Lincoln by 69 votes. n a tentative ruling posted on the San Mateo County Superior Court’s website Chou ruled in favor of Lopez writing that the law only prohibits the “offering of consideration for voting for a particular candidate or ballot measure; it does not prohibit the offering of consideration just for voting.” The judge found that Lopez was not enticing anyone to vote for him, but was garnering goodwill from the community by arranging for the taco truck to be parked at St. Francis of Assisi Church, which was a polling place, on Election Day. Lopez paid about $4,000 for the truck to park at the church from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. where the workers handed out free tacos to anyone who asked for one, even children. Chou notes in his ruling that neither Lopez nor any of the taco truck employees associated the truck with Lopez.</p>

A lawsuit filed in Fulton County Superior Court contends that fraudulent ballots were cast and other irregularities occurred as workers counted ballots at State Farm Arena on election night. Those allegations were investigated and dismissed by the secretary of state’s office. Amero, who is overseeing the case, said he’s inclined to order the ballots to be unsealed and reviewed by experts hired by Garland Favorito, a voting-integrity advocate. At a hearing Monday, Amero sought a detailed plan for maintaining the secrecy and security of the ballots, which — by state law — are under seal in the Fulton County Superior Court Clerk’s Office.</p>
<p>The Hall County Board of elections has sued the county over<a href="https://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/politics/hall-elections-board-sues-county-over-who-supervises-evaluates-director-lori-wurtz/"> who supervises the county’s elections director</a>. According to the Gainesville Times, after publicly airing frustrations over the supervision and performance review of elections director Lori Wurtz at various board meetings over the past month, the elections board filed a lawsuit against the Hall County government and County Administrator Jock Connell on March 16. According to the 67-page civil action document, the elections board states that the Hall County Board of Commissioners had no legal authority in enacting home rule by amending state legislation in 2018. That amendment created the elections director position and established supervisory control of the position under the county administrator. The board believes that the oversight given to Connell through the amendment &#8212; which includes the day-to-day supervision, disciplinary action and termination of the elections director &#8212; should be a power held under the umbrella of the elections board.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5257" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Michigan:</strong> Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson last year said local clerks should start with a<a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/03/court-invalidates-michigan-rule-on-how-to-verify-absentee-ballot-application-signatures.html"> presumption of validity when verifying signatures</a> on absentee ballot applications, but a court ruling says that rule wasn’t properly established. A Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled that clerks no longer need to follow those instructions for determining whether to send an absentee ballot to applicants. According to the<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/499019051/Michigan-Court-of-Claims-ruling-on-absentee-ballot-application-signature-verification"> March 9 opinion and order</a> issued by Judge Christopher M. Murray, Benson issued instructions that constituted “rules” without following the process for creating a formal rule under state and federal law. Murray wrote that “the guidance issued by the Secretary of State on October 6, 2020, with respect to signature-matching standards was issued in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act.” The Michigan Republican Party and Allegan County Clerk Robert Genetski, who jointly filed their complaint prior to the Nov. 3 election, claimed the signature standards allowed for “invalid” ballots to be counted. Murray noted in his opinion that Genetski, however, never claimed the “guidance caused him to accept a signature that he believed was invalid.” Benson’s guidelines focused on signature verification of absentee ballot applications and their return envelopes, which were to be compared against each other as well as against signatures in qualified voter files.</p>

The board met twice in executive session before announcing its decision. After the first executive session, which lasted about 20 minutes, board members said they would not consider the commissioners&#8217; apparent suggestion that they consider an updated price quote by Dominion&#8217;s competitor, Election Systems and Software. According to the Canton Repository, Commissioner Bill Smith had invited ES&amp;S to submit a new quote, which ended up being about $143,000 less than Dominion&#8217;s over a 10-year period, according to resolution language released by the commissioners last week. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s unfair to consider ES&amp;S. We have no inclination to revisit the decision and recommendation that we made previously,&#8221; said Samuel Ferruccio, chairman of the Stark County Board of Elections and chairman of the Stark County Democratic Party. &#8220;When presented to our board, Dominion Voting Systems&#8217; bid was lower than ES&amp;S. The commissioners took it upon themselves to contact the company (ES&amp;S) our board did not select and accepted a revised bid. That decision was ill advised and detrimental to the integrity of the process.&#8221; Board member William Cline, a Republican, agreed, saying &#8220;it was manifestly unfair to other bidders to allow a losing bidder to come in and take another bite at the apple. I think at best, unfair, and arguably not ethical either to solicit the bid or to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lorain County Democrats are taking Secretary of State Frank LaRose before the Ohio Supreme Court to try and<a href="https://chroniclet.com/news/254661/lorain-county-democrats-file-in-court-to-force-larose-to-accept-sweda-appointment/"> force him to appoint their chosen candidate</a>, Sharon Sweda, to the county Board of Elections. Party Chairman Anthony Giardini confirmed his party will proceed with a mandamus action to try and force LaRose to appoint Sweda, a former Democratic county commissioner, to the seat vacated by the resignation of former board member Tom Smith. The legal action should stop the clock and any further action by LaRose until the Ohio Supreme Court reaches a decision, Giardini said. After Sweda&#8217;s appointment was rejected March 3, Democrats had up until Friday to name a replacement candidate or else LaRose said he would choose for them. A mandamus action is filed to force an official to do their legally mandated duties. This action will go before the Ohio Supreme Court and could take three to six months to be resolved.</p>

Judicial Watch Inc. sued the commonwealth and election boards in Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties last April over what the conservative group described as suspiciously high voter registration rates. A moving goal post, an &#8220;implausible theory&#8221; and several other issues were cited as reasons for Conner&#8217;s case dismissal. The lawsuit alleged the three counties were not properly removing ineligible voters from registration lists in accordance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. Judicial Watch&#8217;s lawsuit relied mostly on the federal Election Assistance Commission’s 2018 Election Administration and Voting Survey, made up of responses from over 6,000 state, county and local jurisdictions collected every two years.</p>

The election documents were confusing and violated the state&#8217;s election law, Luna alleged. &#8220;Articles 2, 4, and 5 included language too long to fit on the ballot, and as a result the text of these measures were left off the Defendant’s warning,&#8221; Luna wrote in the lawsuit. Among the requests, Luna asked the court to: Find that Burlington published a misleading Town Meeting Day warning. Find that Burlington &#8220;published information that was impermissibly confusing, causing disenfranchisement of voter access to information.&#8221; And void results from items 2, 4 and 5.</p>

In a lawsuit filed this week directly with the high court, Fabick also asked the justices to limit who can return absentee ballots to clerks on behalf of voters. The lawsuit seeks to address issues that became flashpoints in the November presidential election, when absentee voting hit a record. The new lawsuit seeks to get the court to take up the issues by focusing on the upcoming election, rather than one that has already occurred. Running in the April 6 election for state schools superintendent are Deborah Kerr and Jill Underly. Fabick filed his lawsuit directly with the Supreme Court rather than starting with a circuit court, where most cases begin. The justices have discretion on whether to take the case and could reject it without considering the merits.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://connect.brookings.edu/register-to-watch-voting-rights-democracy-filibuster-senate">Voting rights and wrongs: Democracy legislation in the Senate</a>: The For the People Act of 2021, or H.R. 1, passed the House of Representatives on March 3, 2021. It is before the Senate as S. 1. The bill covers some of the most foundational aspects of American democracy: voting rights, campaign finance, and ethics rules. S. 1 has remained in the news daily because it would counter many of the 253 proposed and rapidly moving state bills in 43 jurisdictions to tighten restrictions on voting. In addition, Senate filibuster rules, which currently require 60 votes to pass most legislation, appear to pose an obstacle to the bill’s passage. Some have suggested that consideration of S. 1 may provide an occasion for relaxing those restrictions in whole or in part. On March 24, Governance Studies at Brookings will host U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and experts on democracy and Senate procedure as part of a two-panel webinar to discuss S. 1, how it relates to the wave of state legislation around the country, and its likely encounter with the filibuster. Senators Klobuchar and Merkley will discuss the bill’s provisions and how it would affect voting-related state legislation. The second panel will address those issues in the context of Senate procedure and the various proposals for reconsidering the filibuster. When: March 24, 4pm Eastern. Where: Online.</p>
