<em>What’s In &amp; Out for election administration in 2022</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6682" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="205" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-300x166.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-768x425.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" />You’ve waited all year for it, so without further ado, here is electionline Weekly’s annual list of what’s in and what’s out in election administration for 2022.</p>
<p>Not surprising, given the past few years, the tone of the list this year decidedly a bit more bitter than in years past — although we did tell contributors that minor cussing was allowed and no one took us up on that offer so maybe there’s still hope.</p>
<p>We usually like to highlight some of the folks who left the industry each year on The List, but sadly, there were just too many this year to include everyone so we went with not including anyone.</p>
<p>As always, a hat-tip to The Washington Post that began its version of<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/interactive/2021/in-out-list-2022/"> The List</a> 44 years ago in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/lifestyle/historical-year-in-review-in-out-list/1978.html?utm_term=.217652656370"> 1978</a> and inspired us to start ours. Interestingly, in this year’s<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/interactive/2021/in-out-list-2022/"> The List,</a> the Post has debating ranked choice voting as being in for 2021. None of our contributors even suggested it. We’ll see who is right in about 365 days.</p>
<p>Happy New Year and here&#8217;s to a better 2023!</p>

According to the Arizona Republic, Brnovich is withholding his required approval of the manual unless numerous sections with which he disagrees are struck from the 300-page document. Included in his objections are sections that outline how elections officials are to carry out the requirements of the<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2021/05/11/arizona-bill-remove-people-early-voting-list-heads-gov-doug-ducey/5041220001/"> two new election-related bills passed by the Legislature earlier this year.</a>  Hobbs created a draft in consultation with county elections officials statewide and after seeking feedback from the public. The law requires approval from the attorney general and the governor before it can take effect. While Hobbs accepted some of the revisions Brnovich suggested, she said others are &#8220;wholesale deletions&#8221; that have no basis in law. If the two cannot reach an agreement, the 2022 elections will be governed by the 2019 manual. This is<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2018/10/29/ducey-put-reagans-elections-manual-on-hold-after-county-recorders-complained/"> not the first time</a> the manual has been in dispute.</p>

The American Red Cross has presented<a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2021/12/good-news-staten-islander-receives-red-cross-award-for-performing-cpr-on-man-in-cardiac-arrest.html"> Michael Arvanites an elections surveyor for New York City</a> with the American Red Cross Certificate of Extraordinary Personal Action. During the June 2021 primary in New York City, Arvanites stopped by the polls at the Staten Island Technical High School at the same time poll worker Robert Ramsey collapsed while outside on a break. Arvanites, a Red Cross volunteer, learned CPR as an Eagle Scout and quickly sprang into action and performed CPR on Ramsey, who was in cardiac arrest, until emergency services arrived. “I put my ear to his chest, couldn’t hear a heartbeat,’’<a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2021/08/good-news-quick-acting-nyc-poll-worker-saves-a-life-in-cpr-rescue.html"> Arvanites recalled.</a> “I started hand-only CPR and he came out of it and grabbed my arm. Right around then, [Assemblyman] Mike Cusick had flagged down the firefighters and they took over.’’ Ramsey was taken to Staten Island University Hospital where he underwent a coronary bypass and aortic valve replacement. He survived and was expected to make a full recovery. The certificate is awarded to individuals who step up in an emergency and help save or sustain a life using lifesaving skills. These individuals exemplify the mission of the American Red Cross to prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies.</p>

She was 70. Worley was elected secretary of state in 2002. She served one term. A native of New Hope in Madison County, Worley was a teacher before she entered politics. She taught for 26 years at Decatur High School, teaching both English and Latin. Before running for political office, Worley twice served as president of the Alabama Education Association. “Nancy Worley was a true public servant and great Democrat with a heart for the people. She will be sorely missed, and we offer our condolences to her friends and family,” State Rep. Chris England said.</p>

The 9-2 vote occurred in a special Assembly meeting after members were initially set to vote on the matter last week. Such adjustments to city election rules are routine, generally happening each year to improve the process for certifying local votes. Assembly member Felix Rivera characterized such changes as “a regular process” that has happened around two dozen times since 1980. But this year, in the wake of a mayoral runoff that saw “unprecedented harassment” of local officials amid the spread of disproven claims about the 2020 presidential election, the process dragged on after acrimonious testimony from skeptical members of the public. Most of the adjustments are technical. They include provisions like putting 24-hour livestreamed monitoring of the voting center into city code, establishing training requirements for elections observers and clarifying the municipal clerk’s ability to limit in-person observers.</p>

The text of the elections bill Dunleavy said he plans to introduce isn’t available yet, but Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said that one part of the bill would make changes to the automatic voter registration of anyone who gets a Permanent Fund dividend. He said it leaves a lot of people on the rolls who don’t want to vote or who left the state. Another aspect would allow voters a chance to correct their ballot if they make a mistake, such as forgetting to sign the envelope on a mail-in ballot.</p>

The bipartisan legislation would boost clerk’s offices by depositing the fee in the general fund of the candidate’s county of residence to be used for the purchase and maintenance of voting equipment. “Most candidates didn’t even realize that their $100 filing fee could possibly be returned to them,” said Rep. Terry Sabo, D-Muskegon. “These bills remove that refund and make the jobs of our local clerks easier, while still allowing candidates the choice of gathering the signatures required or paying a now non-refundable filing fee.”</p>

While the current system allows New Hampshire’s roughly 410,000 undeclared voters to decide on election day which party’s primary they want to vote in, HB 1166 would require voters to<a href="https://www.eagletimes.com/news/proposed-legislation-would-close-new-hampshire-s-primary-elections-to-undeclared-voters/article_e96df04d-b37d-56ce-bfaa-75d1f810aa15.html"> declare a party affiliation</a> at least four months in advance. This would do away with the longstanding tradition of having New Hampshire primaries semi-closed — a hybrid type of primary in which previously undeclared voters can participate in the partisan primary of their choice. HB 1166 would restrict New Hampshire primaries to only allow members of each party to vote in their primary elections. This system, called a closed primary, is not uncommon, as bill sponsor Rep. David Love pointed out.</p>

Kathy Hochul has signed<a href="https://sunnysidepost.com/gov-hochul-signs-sen-gianaris-voting-reform-bills-into-law"> two election administration bills into law</a>. One bill requires absentee ballots to be counted by election night, while the other requires the state to increase the number of early voting sites in each county. The latter aims to cut down the amount of time candidates and the public have to wait to know the results of elections — as more and more races have been called based on absentee votes during the pandemic. The legislation would require local boards of election to count the absentee ballots as they come in, so the full — albeit unofficial — count is released on election night. It takes effect on Jan. 1, 2022. The other bill requires local boards to open at least one early voting place for every 30,000 registered voters in each county. It would nearly double the number of early voting sites across the state and expand hours at each site.</p>

April Berg (D-Mill Creek) has drafted a bill that will<a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/state-bill-would-ban-guns-at-the-ballot-box-election-offices/"> keep guns out of places where ballots are cast and counted</a>. As written, House Bill 1618 would ban firearms and other dangerous weapons from election offices, ballot counting facilities,, voting centers and student engagement hubs. Law enforcement officers would be exempt. Private security personnel hired by a county would be too, if they’ve completed firearm training. “There are already places in our society where we, based on the potential for intensely emotional situations, do not allow weapons,” Snohomish County Auditor Garth Fell  said. “Elections and political perspectives can stir equally intense emotions. This proposed bill is a reasonable step to help ensure official election facilities are safe spaces for voters and election workers.”</p>

Freeman and Moss, mother and daughter, worked as poll workers counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Fulton County, Ga., during the November 2020 election. In a lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C, the two asserted that they became the center of a series of unfounded conspiracy theories pushed by Giuliani. “As a result of their vital service, Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss have become the objects of vitriol, threats, and harassment,” they said in the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. “They found themselves in this unenviable position not based on anything they did, but instead because of a campaign of malicious lies designed to accuse them of interfering with a fair and impartial election, which is precisely what each of them swore an oath to protect.” complaint argued that Giuliani and OAN pushed claims about Freeman and Moss even after state election officials released statements debunking the allegations. The lawsuit, which names OAN president Charles Herring, founder Robert Herring and the network’s White House correspondent Chanel Rion, noted that well into 2021 OAN continued to broadcast claims that Freeman engaged in election wrongdoing, despite evidence disproving those claims.  “With no concern for the truth or the consequences of their willful conduct, Defendants baselessly portrayed Plaintiffs as traitors who participated in a carefully planned conspiracy to steal the presidential election in Georgia,” the complaint said. Freeman and Moss said the consequences of the claims have been devastating to their lives.</p>

The lawsuit is one of the last remaining Michigan lawsuits among a plethora filled after former President Donald Trump lost the election that many supporters called fraudulent, although there is no evidence to support that claim. SOS spokeswoman Tracy Wimmer said she couldn’t comment on the lawsuit, but said: “As we’ve seen many times over the past year, lawsuits are often used as (public relations) tools to undermine faith in elections so that they will be easier to overturn in the future. All clerks are officials of local government, and they make public exactly what donations they receive and how those funds are spent.”<a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/02/facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-and-wife-spent-millions-helping-michigan-hold-elections.html"> An MLive investigation into the grant funds</a> revealed they were distributed widely to both Republican and Democrat-leaning communities, but it’s impossible to perform a full analysis, since the Center for Tech and Civic Life didn’t reveal the local grant amounts and the totals weren’t tabulated by state officials. MLive found no evidence that Benson’s office specifically encouraged Democrat-leaning communities to apply for the grants. Her office did notify all clerks in the state that the grant funds existed and provided information on how to apply.</p>

That legal opinion prompted the board to unanimously support a motion from Commissioner Rosemary Franzen directing staff to prepare a resolution urging Secretary of State Steve Simon to perform an audit of the county’s results. Although the 5-0 vote was met by applause from the gallery of about 70 forensic audit supporters, the board would still vote on whether to approve such a resolution at a future meeting. Ryan — who outlined every statute, rule and court case he believed relevant to the legal questions the county board asked him to explore — said his interpretation of the law finds the authority to reopen sealed ballots after this much time rests with the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State, not local authorities.</p>

McCloskey promised a written decision on a request by Councilman Mark Razzoli to invalidate the election results, a motion by Democratic Councilwoman-elect Jill DeCaro to dismiss the complaint, or whether to take the matter to trial. The issue is whether Nancy Pinkin, the county’s top election official, followed boundaries set in the 2011 ward redistricting map put voters from the odd numbered homes on one side of Cymbeline Drive in Ward 2, and the even numbered homes on the opposite side of Cymbeline Drive residing in the Ward 4. The Middlesex County Counsel’s office, representing Pinkin, is blaming the mistake on the New Jersey Secretary of State’s office, saying the information in the Statewide Voter Registration System was incorrect.</p>

Longoria and Morgan argue in their<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Longoria-v-Paxton-Motion.pdf"> 24-page motion</a> that the mail-in voting provisions violate their First Amendment right to free speech.  The motion comes 18 days after the plaintiffs filed their federal lawsuit against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and district attorneys in Harris, Williamson and Travis Counties, seeking to block provisions of<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/872/billtext/pdf/SB00001F.pdf#navpanes=0"> Senate Bill 1</a> that created criminal and civil penalties for soliciting vote by mail applications.  A person found to have violated the vote by mail solicitation rules faces a mandatory minimum of six months in jail and up to $10,000 in fines. Longoria and Morgan argue that the law — passed during a special legislative session in September — creates a content-based restriction on their right to discuss vote by mail applications. In the complaint, the plaintiffs argue that they are not allowed to encourage or direct eligible voters to request an application to vote by mail because that could be seen as soliciting. But discouraging voters from applying to vote by mail is not prohibited.  The officials assert that the restriction does not protect a specific state interest worthy of suppressing speech.  “Senate Bill 1 subjects me to criminal prosecution for encouraging eligible voters to vote by mail so they may participate in our democracy, an option they have under Texas law,” said Longoria in a statement.</p>

Plaintiffs — Seattle-based immigrant rights group OneAmerica and Campaign Legal Center—had sought $2.1M but Hooper ruled that amount was unreasonable and reduced attorney hours claimed by more than 60% and denied other expenses, including $3,480.90 in bar admission fees for seven attorneys so they could practice law in Washington state. In the ruling, Hooper said awarding fees encourages election systems be corrected, but they “should not hamstring or injure the very representative government which the statute was meant to improve, or present local jurisdictions with overwhelming debts and the now properly representative officials with an impossible financial burden from the start of their terms.”</p>

Former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman  Gableman has issued multiple subpoenas for documents and testimony. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat,<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wis-wec-wolfe-complaint.pdf"> sued</a> on behalf of Elections Commissioner Meagan Wolfe and the WEC in October, claiming the subpoenas are overbroad, serve no valid legislative purpose and unlawfully demand testimony in private rather than publicly, among other reasons. Assistant Attorney General Gabe Johnson-Karp argued last week that the subpoenas pose “grave due process issues” because they demand private depositions at Gableman’s Brookfield office beyond statutory authority and carry the threat of imprisonment if the subpoenaed person does not comply. Lanford said at the close of proceedings she would issue a written decision on the plaintiffs’ injunction motion and the defendants’ motion to dismiss on or before Jan. 10.</p>
