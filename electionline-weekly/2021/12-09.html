														<p><strong>Defending democracy&#8211;and yourself</strong><br />
<em>How elections officials can defend themselves and their networks against doxxing</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="141" />Shortly after the 2020 general election<a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/top-washington-state-elections-official-threatened-doxxed-after-disputing-trump-campaign-s-election-misinformation"> a website threatening the lives</a> of state and local elections officials emerged. The threatening site included photos, email addresses, phone numbers and even home addresses of the election officials. Some officials were forced to temporarily move or separate themselves from their families for safety sake.</p>
<p>While the site itself was shocking, the amount of personal information it had on elections officials was not. Publishing the personal information of someone is referred to as doxxing, it doesn’t take an enemy state to do it.</p>
<p>Personal identifiable information (PII) like home address, personal phone number, what the inside of your house looks like—if it’s recently been listed for sale, either by your or a previous owner, all of that and more is easy to find with a few simple Google searches.</p>
<p>“The use of doxxing to intimidate election officials seems to have decreased but I feel like the threat is still there,” said Jennifer Morrell of<a href="https://electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Groups</a>. “Meaning, we still continue to be reminded of those that experienced it in 2020 or hear of a few people still being doxxed and it&#8217;s enough to make election officials and their staff anxious that they could be next.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7801" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.22-AM-230x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.22-AM-230x300.png 230w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.22-AM-785x1024.png 785w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.22-AM-768x1002.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.22-AM.png 958w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />Removing your personal information is time consuming and it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;re not going to be able to remove it all but going through the exercise is important.</p>
<p>“Not only does it reduce your online profile but for me personally, helped me to discover old online accounts that I had forgotten about where the company had been involved in a data breach or where my password was an old password lacking the complexity that is now recommended,” Morrell said. “It also forces you to think about your social media settings; whether you want pictures and posts to be public or private or whether you want to be on a particular social media platform at all.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, CISA released a CISA Insight on<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA%20Insight_Mitigating%20the%20Impacts%20of%20Doxing_508.pdf"> mitigating the impacts of doxxing</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, The Elections Group, in partnership with BrightLines,<a href="https://fe905b4f-785c-4a89-a73e-5999b9031591.filesusr.com/ugd/346ddd_9b3b967e26964ccc9ddcb2fbadd216c6.pdf"> produced an excellent primer</a> on how to get personal information removed from the Internet and what to do, unfortunately, if an official has already been doxed.</p>
<p><a href="https://fe905b4f-785c-4a89-a73e-5999b9031591.filesusr.com/ugd/346ddd_9b3b967e26964ccc9ddcb2fbadd216c6.pdf">Defending Democracy: Protection Election Officials From Digital Threats</a> walks users through how to secure their online presence including scrubbing as much information as possible from the Internet and creating a more secure environment for yourself moving forward. Officials can do this work themselves, or there are organizations that can help manage parts of the process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7802" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.44-AM-229x300.png" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.44-AM-229x300.png 229w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.44-AM-782x1024.png 782w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.44-AM-768x1006.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-9.40.44-AM.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" />“Election Officials see what’s happening  &#8211; in elections, but also in schools, and hospitals, and they are girding themselves for a tumultuous stretch. Election officials are nameless, faceless, public servants no longer,” said Noah Praetz with The Elections Group. “They are the face of an institution under threat from foreign and domestic actors adept at using the internet to spread the rage. Understanding and either accepting or trying to limit the risks that come with having your personal information on the  internet now is just a part of the job.”</p>
<p><strong>How to be public while being private</strong><br />
While elections officials need to protect themselves and their families, as public officials they also need to be available to the public. According to Whitney May, co-founder and director of government services with the<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/"> Center for Tech and Civic Life</a>, even though doxxing and harassment of election officials are serious, troubling trends that need to be addressed, election officials should resist the temptation to wall themselves off from the public out of self-protectiveness.</p>
<p>“As public officials, election officials should strive to keep the lines of communication open with the people in their community, and this means hearing the positive feedback along with the negative (and even the groundless),” May said. “It&#8217;s inexcusable to harass and threaten election department staff, but we still think it&#8217;s important to keep the dialogue open. An election official who&#8217;s unreachable can easily be viewed as unaccountable, and that will ultimately hurt &#8212; not help &#8212; the deficit in public trust that the election administration community is facing.”</p>
<p>May said one good option for election officials is to use the opportunity to work with a city or county attorney to develop a policy for how your election department should receive, log, and respond to phone calls and emails from the public. May said a big part of why this communication is upsetting comes from election officials feeling &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do about this,&#8221; and having a policy helps address that. Here are a few things that the policy should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be in compliance with state laws regarding open records and freedom of information requests</li>
<li>Consider usability of communication tools so that they don&#8217;t make the process unnecessarily complicated for the public and for staff</li>
<li>Include a reporting framework for how to escalate messages as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving beyond policy ideas and into a few practical suggestions, CTCL advises election departments to consider how tech and logic might be able to automate or streamline some of the communication. A simple way to think about this is, how might election departments categorize messages from the public and channel them to the right places?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5301" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png 526w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“We know, for instance, that election departments are being swamped with FOIA requests right now, and there&#8217;s no need for messages like those to mingle with routine election inquiries like ‘How do I register to vote?’ or complaints like ‘Why did you close my old polling place?,’ May said.</p>
<p>According to CTCL, election departments can do things like set up their phone systems to prompt callers to select a phone line or voicemail inbox that corresponds to the topic of their call. Similarly, election website contact forms can prompt people to choose a topic. In this way, you can help channel messages to individual staff members who are best positioned to handle them rather than having all the messages go to the same place and the same person. Even something super simple and low-tech like setting up a few office email addresses for specific topics &#8212; things like voterquestions@countyelectionsgov, datarequests@countyelections.gov, and concerns@countyelections.gov &#8212; could help to categorize the communication that comes in.</p>
<p>While there were thousands of pieces of elections-related legislation introduced at the state level this year, only a small amount addressed threats to elections officials and none of it addressed the privacy of officials&#8217; information specifically. Morrell with The Elections Group thinks that should change.</p>
<p>“In the current environment, it may be that elections officials’ personal information will need to be protected similar to how such information is protected for law enforcement and other figures in the criminal justice system. Many states elect Sheriffs and judges — making them directly accountable to the public,” Morrell said. “That accountability does not grant the public the right to know personal information about these officials, and understanding the implications of malicious actors being able to easily access this information has led states to prudently protect access. The same protections should be extended to elections officials and their staff.”</p>

More than 24.2 million people live in 331 counties and other jurisdictions requiring the language assistance under the federal Voting Rights Act, a jump from 19.8 million in 2016, the last time the list was updated. The overwhelmingly majority of residents in these jurisdictions require Spanish language assistance. Among the other languages in which voting materials are required, depending on the jurisdiction, are Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hindi, Korean, Vietnamese, as well as several American Indian and Alaskan Native languages. The new list reflects the increasing diversity of some U.S counties and other jurisdictions.  Prince George’s County, Maryland, a majority-Black county outside Washington, was added to the list because of its growing Hispanic community. Minnesota didn’t have any counties on the list in 2016, but two Minnesota counties were included in 2021 — Ramsey County with a Hmong language requirement and Houston County to account for its American Indian population. In Philadelphia, officials already were required to provide language assistance for the Hispanic community but now must also do the same for the Chinese population.</span></p>

The series of rulings by the state Elections Commission is the latest instance of authorities rejecting claims that the grants were illegal. Over the last year, three courts dismissed lawsuits over the grants. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in the latest development, the commissioners tossed out </span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/26/wisconsin-conservatives-file-challenges-over-private-election-funding/7439066002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new set of challenges over the grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were filed this spring. &#8220;The Commission finds that the Complaint does not raise probable cause to believe that a violation of law or abuse of discretion has occurred. All claims are hereby dismissed,&#8221; attorneys working for the commission wrote in a letter they sent Wednesday to the lawyer who spearheaded the challenges. At issue is $8.8 million in grants the Center for Tech and Civic Life gave to Wisconsin’s five largest cities — Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Racine and Kenosha. No one has challenged smaller grants the center gave to about 200 other Wisconsin municipalities. If two or more commissioners asked, the commission would have had to hold a hearing and take a vote on what to do. No commissioner asked for a hearing. Under commission rules, that means it has adopted the attorneys&#8217; conclusions. </span></p>

Dauphin County&#8217;s Elections Director, Jerry Feaser, told Fox43 for every person who accepts a write-in victory in an election, there are stacks of rejections. Feaser says the rejections can stem from people who either didn&#8217;t know they had been wrote-in or someone had done it as a joke. However, with a little training, Avi Hameroff plans to be Lower Paxton Township&#8217;s newest Minority Inspector of Elections. He will help oversee election days in his precinct, check-in voters, and help with provisional ballots. Hameroff will serve a four year term. He will earn a $140-per-Election Day stipend, plus $20 for attending a training session. The money, he says, is irrelevant. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a reminder that any of us can serve. Welcome to the world of elections Avi. We’re happy to have you, no matter how you got here.</p>

Activists are setting up what are being referred to as “<a href="https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2021/12/grassroots-voting-stations-arent-illegal-but-they-are-core-to-the-district-3-recall-fight/">grassroots voting stations</a>” to help residents print and mail ballots. According to the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog, King County Elections says it began hearing complaints about the ballot printing during the General Election. Elections officials say registered voters are able to access and print their ballot online. “This is primarily for our service and overseas voters, voters with a disability, as well as for local voters who maybe lost their ballot or realized they didn’t receive one at the last minute. It saves folks a trip to a Vote Center,” a statement from KCE reads. KCE says campaigns and organizations are also allowed to help people print their ballot. “Even if someone prints out a ballot and returns their original ballot that we mailed to their house, we will only count one,” the statement reads. “Each ballot – even those printed online – have their own unique identifiers that are tied to the individual voter so we cannot accept more than one ballot per voter.” Officials say the printed ballots go through “exactly the same process as mail ballots.” “Our alternative format team confirms that they voter is appropriately registered and hasn’t already returned a ballot. The signature is verified – printed ballots required the exact same declaration as the one on the back of the return envelope. And then it’s processed just like every other ballot.”</p>

The Committee to Bring Voter ID to Massachusetts, a ballot committee behind the initiative, needed to collect at least 80,000 signatures into Secretary of State Bill Galvin’s office — the first of several hurdles to get onto next year’s ballot. But the committee wasn’t able to muster the signatures by the December 1 deadline. A summary of the proposed ballot question, which cleared a legal review by Attorney General Maria Healey, points out that voters who don’t have ID, or forget to bring it with them, would still be allowed to cast a ballot by filling out an affidavit at the polling station certifying their identity. Proponents have also filed several bills in the current legislative session to require voter ID that are pending before the Committee on Election Laws.</p>

Eric Burlison (R-Battlefield) says that he will introduce legislation in the upcoming session that will propose requiring voters to<a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/missouri-bill-may-require-voter-id-and-change-election-judge-requirements/"> show a photo ID before voting, reforming election judge qualifications, and prohibiting cities from using outside funding for elections</a>. “The 2020 election cycle raised numerous issues regarding mail-in ballots and the systems in place to count those votes. As a result, I have decided to file legislation that will ensure that Missouri has safe, fair, and secure elections,” writes Sen. Burlison. “In order to maintain our system of government and ensure the will of the voters is followed, we must do everything we can to ensure the integrity of our elections. This legislation promotes safe and fair elections, and I am looking forward to discussing these issues further with my colleagues in January.” Legislators were able to pre-file bills in Missouri on December first</p>

The Senate version was substituted for the Assembly version, and the legislation now goes to Gov. Phil Murphy for his signature. The bill also appropriates $7 million to the Department of State to reimburse the counties for the costs of implementing it. Under current law, election workers are paid $200 per day each time the primary election, the general election or any special election is held, according to the bill. The state has reimbursed $125 of the payment to election workers while the counties have paid the rest. The bill increases the state’s reimbursement to $225 while keeping the counties’ sum at $75. Murphy temporarily raised poll-worker pay to $300 per day for the Nov. 2 election by executive order.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Christopher DePhillips has introduced a bill that permits county election officials to count mail-in ballots as they are received instead of waiting until Election Day. The bill (A6143) requires county boards of elections that<a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/fair-lawn-slash-glen-rock/sections/elections/articles/bergen-assemblyman-introduces-bill-allowing-vote-by-mail-ballot-counting-before-election-day"> start canvassing vote-by-mail ballots before</a> Election Day to ensure the security of the process and confidentiality of the ballots until polls close.</p>

Roy Cooper (D) a Republican-backed bill that would force elections officials<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article256219177.html"> not to count any mail-in ballots that arrive after polls close</a>. “The legislature ironically named this bill ‘The Election Day Integrity Act’ when it actually does the opposite,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Election integrity means counting every legal vote, but this bill virtually guarantees that some will go uncounted.” One of the GOP sponsors of the bill, Sen. Paul Newton of Cabarrus County, said in a press release that he believes moving up the deadline would improve voters’ confidence in elections. The bill lawmakers passed in November, which Cooper has now vetoed, is Senate Bill 326 or the Election Day Integrity Act. It would require that no mail-in ballot delivered to elections leaders after 7:30 p.m. on Election Day can be counted, no matter when it was put in the mail.</p>

The committee approved the audit along party lines Tuesday evening. The letter requesting the audit, which was shared with KUER, asks staff to examine “the integrity and accuracy of voter rolls … The legitimacy and security of submitted ballots … [and] the integrity of the systems and processes of election offices.” It does not mention the 2020 election. House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, requested the inquiry even though former President Donald Trump won in Utah last year. But Schultz said this isn’t about a particular party. “I don&#8217;t understand what we&#8217;re afraid of,” he said. “I&#8217;m hopeful that the audit that comes back clean and restores confidence or gives the citizens of the state confidence in our election process.” Republican Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who oversees the state’s elections, said she welcomes the audit and feels confident it won’t find widespread fraud. Still, she worries that it contributes to a false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen. “I think that Rep. Schultz is sincere in his desire to increase voter confidence,” Henderson said. “I do worry about the overall narrative and how this may contribute to it &#8230; It&#8217;s really destructive to people&#8217;s public trust and we need to be very cautious about that.” She said her office and county clerks regularly conduct election audits. She also has visited many clerk offices around the state this year to examine their processes and said they were all safe and secure.</span></p>

It would also create emergency ballots for people who wouldn’t be able to make it to their polling locations for unforeseen reasons.  The initiative would also let a candidate to start a sample audit after an election. Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen says the proposal wouldn’t make voting any more secure than it is now.  She believes the initiative would set Utah’s election system back 40 years. Weber County Clerk/Auditor Ricky Hatch agrees the proposal would be significantly more expensive than our current election system.  He was asked to work on the fiscal note for the proposed initiative. “I’m not done, but I’m already at $22 million,” Hatch said. The initiative is also being criticized by Utah Division of Indian Affairs Director Dustin Jansen.  He says the law would not recognize tribal ID cards as accepted forms of ID. And many Native Americans live far away from their polling locations.</p>

Proponents of<a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/runoff-election-bill-fails-to-clear-legislative-committee/article_d5f02567-4b79-5047-8278-98cb15535da5.html"> runoff elections</a> say they would prevent someone from succeeding with less than a majority vote — a regular occurrence in Wyoming Republican primaries with multiple candidates. The committee indefinitely tabled runoff legislation and voted down a constitutional amendment that would have served as a necessary counterpart to the bill. The committee voted down the amendment first, with five lawmakers in favor, eight against and one excused. Without a constitutional amendment, the runoff bill was essentially moot, and the committee voted in favor of tabling it. If the bill was successfully signed into law, it would not have gone into effect until 2024.</p>

Electionline doesn’t cover redistricting too much other than the practical implications for election administrators but we thought we’d provide you a brief roundup of some of the ongoing legal battles. In<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/lawsuits-will-challenge-georgias-new-maps-that-favor-republicans/6GLRYA6XBFFWDLITQ2GPYI4KYQ/"> Georgia</a>, several lawsuits have been filed over the state’s new maps with plaintiffs arguing that the state’s redrawn districts reduce the voting strength of people of color who accounted for the state’s population growth over the past decade but could lose representation after next year’s elections. In<a href="https://www.wral.com/nc-candidate-filing-for-2022-elections-to-begin-monday/20020272/"> North Carolina</a>, the start of candidate filing for U.S. House and legislative seats was blocked on this by an appeals court panel — only to be restored hours later when most Court of Appeals judges agreed they wanted to decide whether a longer filing delay was warranted. A three-judge panel of the intermediate level appeals court had issued a temporary stay and told state and local officials not to begin accepting candidates for those seats. Their districts are the subject of litigation that argue the lines approved by the Republican-controlled General Assembly last month are illegal partisan gerrymanders. The panel had given Republican legislative leaders and the state until Thursday to respond to the arguments of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, which leads a lawsuit. The league&#8217;s attorney said the candidate filing period should be suspended for a while so appeals courts can scrutinize the actual maps. An order signed by the court&#8217;s clerk late in the day declared a majority of the judges agreed to rehear the matter, and that the temporary delay of the filing period has been vacated. Ten of the 15 Court of Appeals judges are registered Republicans. <span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/nc-supreme-court-order-delays-primaries-until-may/20024648/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Carolina Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suspended candidate filing for the 2022 primary elections and ordered that the primaries be delayed until May 17. </span>The<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/12/07/ohio-supreme-court-takes-up-legislative-redistricting-this-week/"> Ohio</a> Supreme Court heard arguments in three cases this week  over the state’s new maps. All of the lawsuits question the constitutionality of the maps, especially provisions of the constitution that directed the commission not to draw maps that favor or disfavor one political party over another, and ensuring compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed suit against<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/06/doj-sues-texas-over-voting-rights-black-and-latino-voters/8888355002/"> Texas’</a> redistricting plans. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the state&#8217;s redistricting maps approved by the Texas Legislature earlier this year effectively dilute the voting strength of people of color. &#8220;The right to vote is foundational to our democracy,&#8221; Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said, adding that the federal government&#8217;s complaint claims that Black and Latino voters have been denied an &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; to participate in the voting process because of the reconfiguration of state voting districts. &#8220;Several of the districts were drawn with discriminatory intent,&#8221; Gupta said. The<a href="https://www.kxro.com/wa-supreme-court-accepts-redistricting-maps-finalized-by-commission/"> Washington</a> Supreme Court ruled that a plan adopted by the state’s redistricting commission “substantially complied” with statutory deadlines, and declined to adopt a new redistricting plan for the state.</p>

After Navajo Nation sued Arizona in 2018 over varying dates to correct unverified signatures, the Legislature imposed strict deadlines mandating the ballots be corrected within five days of the election. While not explicitly addressed by the law, Arizona’s secretary of state and attorney general enforced an Election Day deadline on missing signatures. According to the state, the former is an issue of verification, while the later is an error of voter negligence. Rather than letting voters sign their original ballot, Arizona sends a provisional ballot for a second chance to cast their vote. Therefore the state argued it isn&#8217;t possible to correct the issue after Election Day. The Arizona Democratic Party</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/voting-rights-15/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state in June 2020 claiming the deadline for missing signatures denied voters due process and violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. After a federal judge ruled in favor of the Democrats, the state</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/tossing-unsigned-ballots-on-election-day-ok-arizona-tells-ninth-circuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Ninth Circuit and oral arguments took place in July 2021. “The state had an important regulatory interest in reducing the administrative burden on poll workers, especially during the busy days immediately following an election. In light of the minimal burden on the voter to sign the affidavit or to correct a missing signature by Election Day, the state’s interest sufficiently justified the election-day deadline,”</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AZ-v-Hobbs-Opinion.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Circuit Judge Susan P. Graber, a Bill Clinton appointee, for the majority.  In the 20-page opinion, Graber described the state’s examination of ballots and efforts to contact voters who forgot to sign them as “a measure of grace.” A voter who learns their ballot signature was missing at 7:01 pm after polls close on Election Day is simply out of luck. While the majority found Arizona’s rule constitutional, Graber clarified the opinion “merely sets a floor. Nothing in our opinion should be construed as dissuading Arizona, or other states, from providing a more generous deadline than the Constitution requires.”</span></p>

The statement argues that attorneys for Florida and Secretary of State Laurel Lee “misconstrue the legal standards governing enforcement of these provisions.” “The DOJ also asserts that the state of Florida misapplied the law,” said Mark Shlakman, professor of law at Florida State University. “So, the DOJ position, and it’s weighing in on a relatively narrow basis, multiple grounds, but it’s really attempting to clarify…that a summary judgment would avoid altogether any focused consideration of the facts.” The DOJ brief also argues that the state of Florida’s motion for summary judgment “rests on a legal error: it fails to recognize that the burdens imposed by SB 90’s provisions can be compounding, as well as individually burdensome.”</p>

The defamation suit, filed in Missouri where the site&#8217;s publishers Jim and Joe Hoft reside, says that The Gateway Pundit wrote a series of articles falsely accusing Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea &#8220;Shaye&#8221; Moss of altering election results after former President Donald Trump narrowly lost the state in the 2020 election. Other suits are pending against fellow pro-Trump outlets Newsmax and One America News as well as Fox News for claims made about voting machine vendors and their employees. &#8220;With no concern for the truth or the consequences of their willful conduct, Defendants baselessly portrayed Plaintiffs as traitors who participated in a carefully planned conspiracy to steal the presidential election in Georgia,&#8221; the lawsuit reads. &#8220;Within 24 hours, the claims had been publicly and definitively refuted by Georgia elections officials through a detailed explanation of what the misinterpreted video actually showed: no suitcases; no illegal ballots; no voter fraud.&#8221; The lawsuit says after elections officials knocked down the claims made by The Gateway Pundit and other pro-Trump media outlets, Jim and Joe Hoft continued to write false stories about the two election workers while knowing that they were not true.  The suit also details harassment the two Black women faced after The Gateway Pundit stories received traction, including at least 400 emails, 75 text messages and countless phone calls. Strangers showed up to their homes, including two occasions where people tried to force their way inside to make a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s arrest.&#8221;</p>

McDonald asked that a judge consider the case and “declare the election of the defendant void.” The complaint listed the city of Springfield and Brown as defendants. In<a href="https://framinghamsource.com/index.php/2021/12/07/judge-orders-new-election-for-framingham-district-3-city-councilor/"> Framingham</a>, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Chris Barry-Smith has ordered a new election for Framingham District 3 City Council. “I find that: (1) two votes counted for Feeney during the recount should have been counted as blank, leaving Steiner with two more votes than Feeney; (2) Feeney has identified two voting irregularities that place in doubt the results of the District 3 election; such that (3) the election as to District 3 councilor is set aside and a new election is ordered,” wrote the judge in a ruling.</p>

The nine sanctioned attorneys, who were ordered to divide the costs equally, included Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, two of the more prominent promoters of the former president’s false claims about the 2020 election results being tainted by voter fraud and irregularities. The order is a follow up to Parker’s decision in August that the attorneys would be required to pay the legal fees of the city of Detroit and state elections officials involved in the case, with the amount to be determined later. Parker also referred them at that time for further disciplinary action, including possible disbarment, saying their lawsuit targeting Michigan’s voting results represented “a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process.” Parker ordered that payment be made to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) in the amount of roughly $22,000, with the remaining $153,000 to be paid to the city of Detroit. Parker agreed to pause enforcement of the payments if her ruling in the sanctions case is appealed.</p>

Secretary of State Michael Watson had filed suit after the election commission refused to certify the results 10 days following the election. “CMEC is required to either certify the winners of the general election or to order a new election after holding a hearing to determine if the facts warrant doing so,” Weill wrote. “Since the latter was not done &#8211; and, frankly was not a realistic possibility given the facts of the case &#8211; the CMEC’s only option per statute is to certify the election results.” Under the order, the commission must certify the results of the mayor’s race, as well as the council races for Wards 3, 4, 6 and 7 within seven days. The commission did not sign off on the results, saying that a judge had declared the actions of the group that oversaw the Democratic primary invalid.  Weill says state statute allows the commission to call new elections at individual precincts in certain circumstances, such as candidates or candidate surrogates campaigning within 150 feet of a voting precinct. The statute limits commissioners’ power to call for new election specific to ballot boxes, not all boxes in a multi-precinct election, Weill wrote.</p>

The 2020 election initially resulted in a 772 to 772 tie between Democrat George Rutzler and incumbent Sandford Ross, a Republican. But a challenge by Democrats led to the Ocean County Board of Elections invalidating ballots cast in the vote-by-mail election by two elderly voters who apparently misunderstood the instructions and signed both the outer ballot envelope and the actual ballot. That led to Rutzler being certified as the winner and sworn into office. In April, Superior Court Judge Arnold Goldman removed Rutzler from office and ordered a June special election. By a 3-1 vote, the Ocean County Board of Elections challenged Goldman’s order.   Frank Holman, the GOP county chairman, voted against the appeal, but the two Democrats – including Matthew Sage, whose job as South Toms River municipal attorney was on the line – were joined by Republican Israel Schenkolewski, a Lakewood rabbi who has served on the board for decades. In their appeal, the deputy state attorney general Dominic Giova argued that Goldman erred by reinstating the ballots cast by F.D. and D.C., saying the signed ballots ought to have nullified them. The appellate panel disagreed with Giova. “We construe the statute to direct that ballots with markings or signatures are to be counted, ‘unless’ the Board or a court finds the voter ‘intended’ to mark or sign the ballot ‘to identify or distinguish’ the ballot,” the judges wrote.  “The factual question is what the two voters intended by signing their ballot.” “We interpret that statute to create a presumption in favor of counting the ballot unless a fact finder determines that the marking or signature on the ballot was intended to identify or distinguish the ballot.,” the judges said.  The trial court’s findings concerning the intent of F.D. and D.C. are supported by credible evidence in the record.</p>

Tennessee voters must apply for a vote-by-mail or absentee ballot by completing and submitting an application to their local election commission, who will then handle the process of sending out ballots to those eligible voters.  But state law imposes a felony charge for anyone who shares those applications with another person if they&#8217;re not an employee of an election commission.  Voting rights activists last summer sued the state in an attempt to overturn the law. They argue handing out the application is an effective part of get-out-the-vote campaigns to put the tools in people&#8217;s hands more easily. Richardson denied a motion for an injunction against the law in September, ahead of the presidential election last fall.  He reiterated most of the same arguments in Tuesday&#8217;s ruling.  &#8220;The Court must decide for itself what the Law does and does not prohibit. And as the Court explained at considerable length in its Preliminary Injunction Opinion, the Law simply does not prohibit any conduct that is expressive,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Law does not restrict expressive conduct and thus is not within the scope of the First Amendment.&#8221;</span></p>

Chandler City Clerk Dana DeLong said the process was informative and that 202 ballots were counted—a 203rd ballot was received but not counted because the voter signed their name alongside a smiley face. &#8220;We learned a lot about the process and had representatives from the county recorder&#8217;s office and state to watch,&#8221; DeLong said. &#8220;We were able to have this conversation about the process and what we were doing. We are the first city in the state of Arizona to use this technology for an election. It was on brand for Chandler, being the first and innovating.&#8221; Residents were able to vote from their mobile devices throughout the month of November. When the votes were tabulated at City Hall Dec. 1, the ballots were printed out and counted, DeLong said. Voters responded to a series of questions, including a question that asked them to rank the voting modality they prefer the most—voting in person, blockchain voting, using drop-off centers and mailing ballots. DeLong said people who voted said they preferred mobile voting and blockchain technology; the second method voters preferred was mail-in ballots. But the mock election likely won&#8217;t change city of Chandler elections any time in the near future, DeLong said. The city does not run its own elections, rather elections are held through Maricopa County, so the county would need to adopt the blockchain technology. &#8220;It was good being able to talk about this and see where we could go in the future, and the county wanted to try it; now we know Chandler could participate,&#8221; DeLong said. &#8220;It was a great learning experience.&#8221;</p>

Tusk, a former campaign advisor to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and one-time Uber official, has in recent years funded mobile-voting pilot programs across seven states — including Washington, West Virginia, and Oregon — largely to support overseas and military voters. But his effort in D.C. would represent the first push to make mobile voting a permanent part of elections for all voters. “D.C. will be a pioneer for opening this up for all eligible voters. It would be the first in the nation to do that for D.C. elections,” says Jocelyn Bucaro, a former elections administrator in Denver who now leads Tusk’s Mobile Voting Project. “D.C. is really proving to be a place for progressive election reform and making voting easier and more convenient for voters. And I know the D.C. Council is committed to that. So we wanted to join their efforts and be supportive if we can.”</p>
