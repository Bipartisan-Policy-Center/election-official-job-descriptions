<p><strong>One in Three Election Officials Report Feeling Unsafe Because of Their Job</strong><br />
<em>New Report Offers Solutions to the Various Threats to Election Officials</em></p>

<p>“We will demand the truth and you will [expletive] pay for [expletive] lying [expletive] remarks you little liberal [expletive] RINO! We will [expletive] take you out. [Expletive] your family! [Expletive] your life! You [expletive]! Watch your [expletive] back!”</p>
<p>This is just one of the countless voicemails left for election officials across the country who conducted safe and secure elections during a pandemic in 2020. These public servants did their duty despite death threats, armed protesters, security details — and everything else that 2020 threw at them.</p>
<p>These threats should concern everyone, not just election officials. We all have a role to play in protecting election officials in today’s environment.</p>
<p>In partnership with the <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/">Bipartisan Policy Center</a>, the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law</a> this week published a<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/election-officials-under-attack"> report</a> on the state of the election official profession and the toll of the unprecedented attacks on these officials’ authority, credibility, and personal safety that surged in the run-up to the 2020 election and have not stopped. The report features a survey finding that one in three election officials report feeling unsafe because of their job, and one in six reported <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-7099" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-6.38.35-PM-231x300.png" alt="" width="210" height="273" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-6.38.35-PM-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-6.38.35-PM-787x1024.png 787w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-6.38.35-PM-768x999.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-6.38.35-PM.png 810w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" />having been threatened due to their job. The authors provide solutions for the various problems facing election officials, with calls to action for local, state, and federal governments as well as social media companies and other institutions.</p>
<p>“Threats of violence, smear campaigns, laws and lawsuits undermining election officials at every turn – this is what the professionals who uphold our elections and democracy are facing every day,” said<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/lawrence-norden"> Lawrence Norden</a>, director of the Election Reform Program at the Brennan Center for Justice and co-author of<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/election-officials-under-attack"> Election Officials Under Attack: How to Protect Administrators and Safeguard Democracy</a>. “The attacks will keep coming – and succeeding – unless there is a multipronged intervention across government and society to stop the purveyors of the Big Lie from making it impossible for election officials to do their jobs: conducting free and fair elections without partisanship.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/election-officials-under-attack">Election Officials Under Attack: How to Protect Administrators and Safeguard Democracy</a> identifies four factors making election officials’ work more difficult and dangerous: threats of violence and other safety concerns; increased disinformation being spread about elections, especially online and often by public officials; rising pressure to prioritize party interests over a democratic process; and unsustainable workloads. For each problem, the authors present multiple, urgent solutions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6255" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-768x512.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“The continued threats against election officials and attempts to undermine their independence months after the presidential election are antithetical to a free and fair democracy,” said<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/matthew-weil/"> Matthew Weil</a>, director of the Election Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “There are reasonable, implementable solutions that will safeguard our elections going forward and the recommendations in this report are developed with the direct input and participation of election officials from across the country.”</p>
<p>Here is a selection from the report’s recommendations, listed by the type of challenge confronting election officials:</p>
<p><strong>Threats of violence against election officials and other safety concerns.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Justice should create an Election Threats Task Force, which would work with federal, state, and local partners to provide expertise and resources to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of threats to election officials. (This could be an initiative housed in the Civil Rights Department&#8217;s Voting Rights Enforcement Unit, which Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Friday he was planning to expand.)</li>
<li>States should pass laws to protect officials’ personal information and provide grants for officials to purchase home security equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increased disinformation being spread about elections, especially online and often by public officials.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency should support the creation of a comprehensive directory of U.S. election officials, which could be shared with internet platforms so they can amplify accurate information from those officials.</li>
<li>Social media companies should strengthen their efforts to push back against individuals who spread mis- or disinformation repeatedly, including by delaying posts of repeat disinformation spreaders to allow for vetting.</li>
<li>Party monitors, who became sources of misinformation in 2020 about election procedures and the vote counting process, should be required to attend additional training and should be accountable for violating rules and spreading disinformation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rising partisan pressure to prioritize party interests over a democratic process, such as former President Trump’s call to Georgia’s secretary of state.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>States should explore structural changes to election administration to insulate officials from attacks on independence, including protecting election officials’ scope of authority over counting and certifying elections, and guaranteeing a minimum level of funding for elections so that officials can resist political pressure without fearing they are risking the resources needed to do their jobs.</li>
<li>States should create election administration advisory boards that include election officials and members who represent statewide officeholders, legislative leadership, voting rights organizations, and other stakeholders to foster effective communication and the depoliticization of election administration policymaking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unsustainable workloads for current election officials and challenges recruiting future administrators.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Election officials should leverage existing relationships with state and local election official associations which can help empower officials to improve working conditions and better impact election-related policy.</li>
<li>Election officials can develop relationships with local colleges and universities to help build talent pools for future recruitment.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/election-officials-under-attack">Election Officials Under Attack: How to Protect Administrators and Safeguard Democracy</a> is based on dozens of interviews with election officials across the country about their experiences during the 2020 elections. These interviews were conducted by the Brennan Center and the Bipartisan Policy Center, with assistance from Harvard Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation.</p>

In the final installment, the team identifies key areas they believe should be a focus for state and local officials and their allies in the policy and research communities. For each, the team describes what they  have learned from the research as well as where they know there is still a lot to learn — critical questions that call for further experimentation and evidence. The key areas include: sustainability advancement, networks and community, and voter-centric practices.</p>

In a speech that invoked the nation’s long and, at times, faltering progress toward ensuring every American’s right to vote, Garland likened the fight against efforts to curtail ballot access to past campaigns enshrining voting rights for Black Americans in the Constitution and the seminal Voting Rights Act of 1965. Garland said the additional trial attorneys, which he plans to hire over the coming 30 days, will scrutinize new laws and existing practices across the nation for potential discrimination against Americans of color, including in new measures GOP state lawmakers<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/02/state-voting-restrictions/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4"> are pushing</a>. They will enforce provisions of the Voting Rights Act by challenging such laws or practices in court — and prosecute anyone found to intimidate or threaten violence against election officials. The expanded unit will also monitor the growing number of post-election ballot reviews<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-false-claims-fallout/2021/05/19/87aeacc4-b7f9-11eb-a6b1-81296da0339b_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_7"> being called</a> for around the country by supporters of former president Donald Trump in search of signs of violations of federal laws, Garland said, and will watch over upcoming redistricting efforts to call out discriminatory practices. “To meet the challenge of the current moment, we must rededicate the resources of the Department of Justice to a critical part of its original mission: Enforcing federal law to protect the franchise of all eligible voters,” Garland said in his address to department employees. He added: “Where we see violations, we will not hesitate to act.”</p>

Yavapai County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said she did not know if the people knocking on doors around Prescott are working on behalf of a political organization, but raised concerns that information residents provide could result in identity theft. “I don’t want some of our more vulnerable residents giving information and thinking they’re giving it to the recorder’s office,” she told the paper. Hoffman said local officials had received reports of two incidents last week in which people claiming to be from her office asked voters if they voted in the last election and who they voted for. In one case, a pair of people knocked on the door of a local resident and sought to verify the names of people living in the home. But the duo declined to produce any identification when asked, including anything verifying connection to the recorder’s office, Hoffman said. The Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office told residents the recorder would never send anyone to a residence asking survey questions or asking voters for personal information, and asked anyone approached in a similar fashion to contact local law enforcement.</p>

The Kentucky Opera will co-present a new one-act opera commissioned by the Santa Fe Opera called<a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/arts/music/2021/06/16/kentucky-opera-co-presents-juneteenth-show-about-fannie-lou-hamer/7491507002/"> &#8220;This Little Light of Mine&#8221; </a>for Juneteenth. This free online workshop is about voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, a Black woman whose fight for equal rights helped implement the Voting Rights Act of 1965. According to the Courier Journal, The project, composed by Chandler Carter with a libretto by Diana Solomon-Glover, portrays key events in Hamer&#8217;s life, including how the injustices of the Jim Crow laws emboldened her to demand the right to vote for Black Americans, and how she shook the political world during the “Freedom Summer” of 1964 by helping found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Hamer was known for her powerful voice during the civil rights movement and her will be used throughout the production, Carter said, where parts of Hamer&#8217;s speech testimony are incorporated into the musical score. &#8220;You hear Fannie Lou Hamer&#8217;s voice sounding through the loudspeakers incorporated into the scene and incorporated into the music underneath. So it punctuates and frames the story,&#8221; Carter said. The free pre-recorded workshop will be available on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KentuckyOpera"> Kentucky Opera’s YouTube channel</a> on June 19 at 6 p.m. and will remain available for on-demand viewing.</p>

Huser served as the county clerk for 32 years. Huser served as mayor of Scappoose from 1979 to 1988. At various points throughout her long career, she served as president of the Oregon Mayors Association, Oregon Association of County Clerks, Columbia County League of Women Voters and Scappoose Kiwanis.  Upon her retirement from that position, former County Clerk Reta Kerry asked her to accept the appointment of County Clerk, and Huser has filled that role since. On Columbia County’s County Clerk website, Huser wrote in welcome, “I am honored that you have elected me to this important position since 1989. It has been my pleasure to issue marriage licenses, manage county elections and provide passports, among my other various duties.”</p>

He was 74. In a statement issued with the Vernon Town Council, Mayor Daniel Champagne and Town Administrator Michael Purcaro said, &#8220;John Anderson was a longtime leader and public servant of the Town of Vernon, and a good friend to many.&#8221; Anderson was a respected registrar, a position he had held since 2013, Purcaro said. He also served as a special constable since 2014 and &#8220;fulfilled a significant leadership role&#8221; on the Water Pollution Control Authority for many years, town officials said.  The statement continued, &#8220;John epitomized life and service in a small town. He was woven into the fabric of this community. Losing someone like John creates a loss, a vacuum that will not be easy to fill. He was a person who could always be counted on and who cared deeply about Vernon. John&#8217;s devotion to volunteering and public service are part of his legacy.&#8221;</p>

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a key swing vote who often breaks with her party, said she<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/06/10/murkowski-proposes-expanding-no-excuse-mail-voting-as-alternative-to-democrats-election-reform-bill/?sh=3aff6b1c7867"> opposes H.R. 1</a>, Democrats’ sweeping election and campaign finance reform package, but supports individual provisions, namely expanding no-excuse absentee voting. Murkowski told reporters she sees H.R. 1 as too “overwhelming and all-encompassing.” Murkowski said certain provisions in the bill are “probably worthy of support,” noting Alaska has no-excuse absentee voting, which means residents can request a mail-in ballot without having to give a reason such as illness, age or absence from the state. Murkowski said she “didn’t have any appreciation” of “how many states are so extraordinarily limited and restricted” with mail-in voting, calling for those restrictions to be “addressed.” Murkowski also reiterated her<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/05/17/manchin-and-murkowski-team-up-on-bipartisan-voting-rights-compromise-but-it-may-be-too-little-too-late/"> support</a> for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would restore the federal government’s ability to vet proposed changes to polling rules in places with a history of racial discrimination in voting, a power that was taken away by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling. Ten Republican senators are needed for any Democratic election reform bill to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate.</p>
<p>Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has circulated a<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-manchin-voting-rights-bill-changes/"> list of demands for voting legislation</a> among his Democratic colleagues, indicating he may be willing to consider a revised version of the sweeping voting and elections reform bill that the Senate will take up at the end of the month. Manchin told reporters on Wednesday that he had shared with his colleagues &#8220;things I can support and vote with&#8221; in the For the People Act. According to a<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iBBrDKRkfAXQxUeOdDGe17CPVymGWfMe/view?usp=sharing"> copy of the list</a> obtained by CBS News, these areas of support include provisions banning partisan gerrymandering and mandating at least 15 consecutive days of early voting for federal elections. Manchin&#8217;s list also includes areas of compromise relating to ethics and campaign finance. However, he supports some provisions that could be unpopular with progressive Democrats, such as requiring a voter ID with &#8220;allowable alternatives&#8221; for providing proof of identity to vote and allowing elections officials to purge voter rolls. He also does not appear to support no-excuse mail-in voting, although he would want to require states to send absentee ballots to eligible voters ahead of an election.</p>

Lawmakers attempted to restore access to the ballot box for people on parole during the regular legislative session that ended last week, but the omnibus bill failed to come up for a vote in the House. Instead, the bill — a wide-ranging proposal intended to broaden the state’s voting rules, allowing different state agencies to automatically enroll new voters and giving people time off work to vote — made it into the budget implementer that was approved in the Senate Tuesday evening and is scheduled for a vote in the House Wednesday. The current law on who is disenfranchised is confusing, said Michael Lawlor, former undersecretary for criminal justice policy and planning under former Gov. Dannel Malloy and now a professor at the University of New Haven. “There are all these different statutes, and I think people mistake ‘parole’ for all forms of supervised release, which is definitely not the case.” According to Lawlor, the current felony disenfranchisement statute only bars people from voting who are incarcerated for a felony or on parole, not other forms of paroled supervision, like special parole, transitional supervision. That confusion over eligibility was part of the reason why the Secretary of State’s Office <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2021/GAEdata/Tmy/2021SB-00005-R000326-Merrill,%20Denise%20W.,%20Secretary%20of%20the%20State-Connecticut-TMY.PDF">supported</a> the bill during the legislative session. Gabe Rosenberg, spokesman for the office, said that uncertainty over who was and who wasn’t eligible potentially made people hesitant to vote, choosing to instead err on the side of caution and not cast a ballot. “As people return to their community from incarceration, the earlier they vote, the more likely they are to continue to vote and be more connected civically to their communities, and that’s a public good,” Rosenberg said, noting that the proposed language makes it simple: if you are incarcerated for a felony, you cannot vote, but if you are not locked up for a felony, you can cast a ballot.</p>

No Republicans voted for the amendment, even though many of them were in the House in 2019, when the first leg of the amendment was approved in a landslide 38-3 vote. Democratic Rep. David Bentz, sponsor of the bill, suspects the national debate over mail-in voting likely played a role in the GOP members switching their votes this time around. “Unfortunately, I think the rhetoric around this particular policy has been tainted … over the last year,” he said on the House floor Thursday. “From 2019 until now, nothing has changed about the efficacy, the security of absentee voting in Delaware or nationwide. The only thing that has changed, unfortunately, is the political rhetoric around it.” Currently, Delaware law permits absentee ballots only if people won’t be able to vote in person because they are participating in “public service” of the state or nation, working elsewhere, are on vacation, have an illness or physical disability, or have a religious reason. Republican House Minority Leader Danny Short said members of his caucus reexamined the amendment since that 2019 vote and came up with significant reservations about the bill. “I believe they intend to turn no-excuse absentee voting into a ‘vote-by-mail’ system — a scheme that will benefit Democrats. Any doubt about the partisan nature of this issue was erased after today’s vote,” Short said. “We may not have seen the last of this bill, but House Democrats have given us even less reason to trust their good intentions on this issue.”</p>

The<a href="https://fastdemocracy.com/bill-search/dc/24/bills/DCB00016602/"> bill</a> would expand voting eligibility to legal permanent residents — Green Card-holders — and would apply to the elections for mayor, D.C. Council, State Board of Education, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and attorney general. “People who have made their permanent homes here should have a hand in who represents them in government,” Nadeau said in a<a href="https://www.brianneknadeau.com/updates/press-release/councilmember-brianne-k-nadeau-re-introduces-bill-allow-permanent-residents"> press release</a>. “The District of Columbia has long been a place that has welcomed immigrants into our community, and it’s time to allow for their full participation in our institutions.” At-Large councilmembers Elissa Silverman, Robert White, and Christina Henderson, along with Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto, Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George, and Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen co-introduced the bill. Similar bills have been introduced in the D.C. Council several other times.</p>

Sharon Hewitt, had been negotiated behind closed doors for about two weeks. Agreement came in the closing moments of the two-month-old legislative session. The result merged much of the language from two similar House-passed bills with the Senate measure. Louisiana’s current fleet of voting machines are aging and replacement parts aren’t easy to find. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin has been trying to nail down a deal for new machines. Hewitt’s SB221 would set up commissions to review and make recommendations about the types of systems available as well as bids from vendors. The Secretary of State would still make the final decision. But state law currently requires the Secretary of State to only purchase direct-recording electronic voting machines, the variety now being used. The legislation merged House Bill 653, by Central Republican Rep. Barry Ivey and House Bill 704, by Denham Springs Republican Rep. Valarie Hodges, with Hewitt&#8217;s bill. Both House bills had more detailed versions of how new voting machines should be chosen and used along with when paper ballots could augment the voting procedures. Rep. John Stefanski, R-Crowley, who handled the legislation in the House, tamped down some opposition by saying the structure set up in SB221 allows more participation by the public and ensures that the next voting machines the state purchases are more in line with what other state have bought.</p>
<p>Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a bill into law that would<a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/politics/louisiana-extends-early-voting-for-presidential-elections/289-1480dfe1-7768-424e-8b73-ba2f99dedcc8"> extend early voting periods</a> for presidential elections in the state. Edwards signed House Bill 286, authored by Democrat state Rep. Frederick D. Jones, which extends the early voting period by three days. Louisiana law previously allowed for early voting from 14 to seven days prior to a scheduled election. Edwards said he was proud to sign the bill amid the Republican Party’s efforts to limit access to voting across the country. “That’s not the case here in Louisiana, where we are now adding more early voting days for one of the most consequential and popular elections people vote in – the presidential election,” Edwards said. The governor said the new law will give Louisianans more opportunities to cast their votes and make their voices heard. “I am thankful the Legislature sent me this bill and I will continue to advocate to expand access to voting,” Edwards said. HB 286 was approved by a 91-7 vote in the House and a 35-0 vote in the Senate.</p>

The Senate approved the bill 22-12 without debate, with minority Republicans in opposition. In the House, the measure passed on a vote of 81-61, also on party lines. Both chambers must still cast final votes on the bill. The online voter registration bill is sponsored by Rep. Teresa Pierce, D-Falmouth. Currently Maine voters can request an application to register online but must return that application to their local election officials by mail or in person. Maine residents can also register in person on Election Day. The bill,<a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/display_ps.asp?LD=1126&amp;snum=130"> L.D. 1126</a>, also has the support of Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat. Bellows said that while Maine already enjoys one of the highest voter participation rates in the U.S., online registration would make voting even more accessible.</p>
<p>A push to have Maine’s attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer<a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2021/06/15/politics/bangor-lawmakers-push-to-popularly-elect-top-maine-officials-stalls-in-house/"> elected by voters</a> stalled on Tuesday after only a narrow majority of the House of Representatives backed sending a proposed constitutional change to the ballot.<a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0288&amp;item=1&amp;snum=130"> The bill</a> from Sen. Joe Baldacci, D-Bangor, would put the amendment before Maine voters to ask if they would prefer the secretary of state, the treasurer and the attorney general to be elected by a majority vote. The Maine Legislature — assembled together — currently picks those officeholders and it is the only state to pick an attorney general that way. The chamber initially passed an earlier version of the bill in a closely divided 74-68, which fell short of the two-thirds vote that would be required to send a constitutional amendment to voters. When a ranked-choice voting provision was added, the body rejected it in a 81-62 vote.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Legislature has approved a<a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/maine-lawmakers-approve-bills-to-make-voting-easier/36689339"> semi-open primary system</a> that would let independent voters participate in Democratic and Republican primaries in the state. Sponsors said all voters pay for elections. While independents, which represent 32% of Maine voters, registered Democrats and Republicans could not cross over and vote in the other party’s primary without changing their affiliation with the state. The bill has bipartisan support.</p>

The bills, which were sent to the GOP-led House on party-line 19-16 votes, are among a wave of Republican-sponsored measures to tighten voting rules in various states. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will veto the bills if they reach her desk, but the GOP could eventually sidestep her with a maneuver that lets the Legislature enact citizen-initiated ballot proposals, Michigan voters without a photo ID now can sign an affidavit and cast a ballot at their polling place. More than 11,400 of nearly 5.6 million voters did that in the November election. Under the legislation, they would instead vote a provisional ballot and have to either verify their voter registration or their identity and residence within six days for it to count. Voters currently seeking an absentee ballot by mail or at an election clerk&#8217;s office must sign the application, and the signature is matched to the voter file. The legislation would require applicants to include a copy of their photo ID, their driver&#8217;s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Those who do not would get a provisional ballot. The $10 fee for a state ID card already is waived for certain people, including the elderly, those on welfare or disability assistance, the homeless and veterans, she said. GOP senators on Wednesday introduced bills they said would remove all financial barriers to getting a card. Michigan&#8217;s existing voter ID requirement was first enacted in 1996, declared unconstitutional by a Democratic state attorney general in 1997, reenacted in 2005 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2007.</p>

But he said he is &#8220;praying&#8221; the For the People Act &#8220;gets shot down in Washington and we don&#8217;t have to deal with it.&#8221;  Senate on Thursday concurred with an amendment passed by the New Hampshire House a week ago that says that if the federal bill, S.1, passes the U.S. Senate and becomes federal law, New Hampshire will retain the authority under its state constitution to control all aspects of its elections for state and county offices.<a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/s1-amendment-to-sb89-1621033186.pdf"> The amendment</a> says that if the For the People Act becomes federal law, ““all procedures and requirements relating to elections conducted pursuant to the New Hampshire constitution and as prescribed by New Hampshire law shall remain in full force and effect for all state and county officers.” The procedures include those related to voter eligibility, voter registration, absentee voting, conducting the voting and counting of votes. The state would most likely not have authority over the conduct of federal elections for federal offices – setting up the possibility of a two-tiered elections system, one for federal offices governed by federal law and another for state and county offices governed by state law.</p>

Senate Bill 31, which will return to the House and Senate for final votes, includes language ensuring that people who are in penal facilities awaiting trial or serving a misdemeanor sentence can cite their incarceration as a reason to receive absentee ballots. The bill, as agreed to, adds to the absentee voter request affidavit a new line stating: “I am confined to a penal institution for a misdemeanor or while awaiting trial.” On a separate issue addressed in the bill, Senate Bill 31 says that in cases in which an individual reports previously having been registered to vote in another state but is now registered to vote in New Hampshire, the Secretary of State’s Office will have the responsibility of notifying election officials of the other state that the person is now registered in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>House and Senate conferees have agreed to<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/house-senate-conferees-agree-to-move-state-primary-to-first-tuesday-in-august-beginning-in-2024/36732148"> move the date of the state primary</a> election from the second Tuesday in September to the first Tuesday in August and left open the possibility of having the new date in place in time for the 2022 midterm elections. As it stands, the agreement reached Tuesday by the conference committee calls for the new primary date to not take effect until Jan. 1. 2023, which would mean the first early August state primary would not be held until 2024. The deal must now be approved by the full House and Senate – and if it is, it would then go to the desk of Gov. Chris Sununu. Sununu has voiced clear opposition to any change in the primary date from the current second Tuesday in September.</p>

Counties with less than 500,000 voters will need to have one early voting site for every 30,000 registered voters.  It&#8217;s a significant change from the existing law, which mandates early voting sites for every 50,000 registered voters regardless of the county&#8217;s size. The minimum number of sites required can&#8217;t be greater than 10 — a provision that will remain in effect for smaller counties.  The bill also requires counties to place at least one early voting site in their largest municipality. It would increase the number of hours early voting locations must be open on holidays and weekends from five to eight, and allow sites to stay open until 8 p.m. (instead of 6 p.m.) on Saturdays and Sundays.  The state Senate passed the bill by a 45-18 vote. The state Assembly approved it Thursday evening.</p>

Under Senate Bill 326, dubbed the Election Day Integrity Act, all absentee ballots must be received by the time polls close on Election Day to count. Currently, ballots can arrive up to three days late, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. According to the state elections board, 11,635 ballots arrived within three days of Election Day last fall. The bill passed on a 28-21 party-line vote and now heads to the House.</p>
<p>Two other measures also passed on party-line votes and move on to the House: Senate Bill 724 would provide a mobile unit to help people get<a href="https://www.wral.com/senate-sets-election-day-deadline-in-nc-for-mailed-ballots/19729388/"> photo identification</a> cards that they could use once legal issues over North Carolina&#8217;s voter ID requirement are resolved and IDs are required at the polls. It also writes online voter registration into state law and expands voting access for visually impaired people. Senate Bill 725 prohibits state and county officials from accepting<a href="https://www.wral.com/senate-sets-election-day-deadline-in-nc-for-mailed-ballots/19729388/"> money from private sources</a> to run elections.</p>

Details of the 149-page bill, dubbed the<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1300"> Voting Rights Protection Act</a>,  bill grew out of testimony offered to the House State Government Committee through 10 hearings it held on election reform. The same committee gave the legislation its<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2021/06/republicans-push-ahead-with-election-reform-bill-over-dems-objections.html"> first approval</a> this week over objections of Democrats.  Among the highlights of the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">It would allow voters to visit a staffed county voting center on the Monday through Friday of the week before the election to vote in person. Counties would be allowed to set the hours and establish one polling center for every 100,000 residents, with a maximum of 10.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It would allow for mail-in ballot return receptacles — a new term for drop boxes that are staffed by poll workers who can review mailed ballots to ensure they are signed and dated correctly.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It would require counties to reach out to voters whose mail-in ballots have issues that would prevent them from being counted to allow them the opportunity to fix them by 8 p.m. on Election Day. In the November 2020 election, some counties did this and others didn’t. Grove said this would ensure uniformity across the state.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It would allow counties to begin preparing mailed ballots for counting five days before Election Day, which is a change counties have demanded to ensure a more timely release of election results particularly when there is a large voter turnout. This was a priority to counties along with another provision in the bill that moves up the mail-in or absentee voter application deadline to 15 days before an election, instead of the current seven days.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It allows for curbside voting on Election Day at all polling places to ensure access for voters with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>  Under this bill, all voters choosing to vote in person would be required to produce a driver’s license, or a PennDOT-issued non-license photo ID, or a free Department of State voter identification card, or a free county-issued scannable, durable voter registration card. Or a voter could sign an affidavit affirming their identity under penalty of perjury.</li>
<li>  Moving up of the voter registration deadline to 30 days before the election that is intended to give county election officials more time to process applications.</li>
</ul>

If the ordinance passes the council, voters would get the final say in the November election. If approved, the change would take effect on Jan. 1, 2022. While Washington state law bars certain local governments from enacting such reforms, King County has the authority to do so as a charter county. A legislative effort to allow all cities and counties to adopt ranked-choice systems failed earlier this year.</p>

Another bill would require K-12 schools to teach students a course on voter education, such as the importance of voting, how to vote and additional information to prepare them for when they become eligible to vote.  The Department of Public Instruction would be responsible for developing the curriculum about the electoral process which would be at least one hour of voter education every school year, under the bill.   &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a great way to help young people pay attention earlier to help education themselves and to learn more about the candidates,&#8221; said Democrat Senator Kelda Roys of Madison, a co-sponsor of both bills. &#8220;Democracy works best when more people can participate, especially young people.&#8221;</p>

The case, brought by comedian Paul Rodriguez, Rocky Chavez, League of United Latin American Citizens and California League of United Latin American Citizens, sought for the high court to consider whether the state&#8217;s winner-take-all approach to selecting its presidential electors was constitutional. Attorneys argued that &#8220;by diluting and discarding votes&#8221; the method &#8220;violates Petitioners&#8217; right to cast an effective vote&#8221; and that it &#8220;severs the connection between voters and presidential candidates&#8221; allowing candidates to ignore California voters. The court&#8217;s action, made without comment, comes amid calls to change the electoral process and as former President Donald Trump along with GOP allies continue to push lies of election fraud despite no evidence after President Joe Biden&#8217;s 2020 electoral victory. California, which has the largest population of any state, currently has 55 electors &#8212; the most electoral votes in the country.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Andre Birotte<a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2021/06/15/federal-judge-tosses-local-lawsuit-that-echoed-trump-claims-of-election-fraud/"> dismissed with prejudice</a> a lawsuit filed by California Republicans that echoed false allegations made by former President Donald Trump about the validity of the 2020 election. The lawsuit, filed in January by a conservative election watchdog group and 10 failed GOP congressional candidates against a slew of state and county elections officials, claimed the November election in California was rife with “mass irregularities and opportunities for fraud.” The plaintiffs argued that such conditions have been brewing in California for years, but were exacerbated by changes made last year to make sure all voters in the state had access to a ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic. Birotte wrote in a 13-page ruling published Tuesday that the plaintiffs didn’t offer concrete evidence that problems affected the outcome of California’s November elections. Birotte also said he agreed with the defendants’ statement that the lawsuit amounted to “an incremental undermining of confidence in the election results, past and future.”</p>

The latest case is narrowly tailored to one section of the law that involves what are known as third-party voter-registration organizations. The law, in part, requires the organizations to inform voter-registration applicants that the organizations might not meet legal deadlines for delivering forms to elections officials. Also, the organizations are required to tell applicants how to register online. The challenge, filed in federal district court in Tallahassee, contends the law (<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/90">SB 90</a>) requires a “misleading warning” and violates First Amendment rights. “The mandatory disclaimer serves no legitimate governmental function or purpose, as there is no evidence that Floridians have been confused about the nature of community-based voter registration activity,” said <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/harriet_tubman_freedom_fighters_corp._v._lee.pdf">the lawsuit</a>, filed by attorneys for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Fair Elections Center. “There is no suggestion that plaintiffs or similar voter registration groups have regularly turned in late forms or that they would make anything other than their best efforts to timely submit forms.” The lawsuit also said the requirements “serve to significantly impede plaintiffs’ mission of connecting with new voters and those without Florida driver’s licenses and printer access (who must print, sign, and submit their applications created online in order to register to vote) because in-person registration is more effective for reaching these prospective voters and field registration using paper forms is the most effective means of promoting voter registration at the events, festivals, and communities where plaintiffs operate.”</p>

Gretchen Whitmer used to issue sweeping pandemic orders. The decision came after two Democrats on the Board of State Canvassers opposed ratifying the ballot measure in April, despite a finding from the elections bureau that enough signatures had been collected. The justices said the four-member panel “has a clear legal duty to certify the petition.” The board’s Democrats had called for further investigation into alleged wrongdoing by some circulators. The canvassers will meet soon to certify the petition. The GOP-controlled Legislature will likely enact the measure rather than let it go to a public vote in 2022.</p>

In that challenge, incumbent Craig “Boots” Diaz, believed that his challenger, Zack Grady, was wrongly certified to appear on the ballot. The crux of the legal challenge centered around a recent opinion from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office interpreting a 2019 law to mean that candidates for municipal offices must live in the ward they wish to represent for at least two years before qualifying to hold office. The Secretary of State&#8217;s office has previously interpreted the 2019 law to only require a two-year residency somewhere within the municipality, not within any particular ward. The attorney general&#8217;s opinion was issued days before the municipal qualification deadline, which drew a rebuke from Secretary of State Michael Watson and caused three candidates in Oxford to drop out of their respective races.</p>

Former Las Vegas Councilman Stravos Anthony had sued challenging the results. Chief Justice James Hardesty wrote the unanimous opinion for the court, disagreeing with Anthony’s attorneys, who argued discrepancies in the voting process met the definition of an election being “prevented.”  “Because voters had the opportunity to vote in the November 3, 2020, general election and were not prevented from casting their votes for District C, we conclude that the district court properly found that the election was not ‘prevented&#8221; under (state law),” Hardesty wrote. “Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.”</p>

In an order issued late Wednesday, the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court scheduled a June 23 hearing on the matter in Albany but rejected Attorney General Letitia James&#8217; request for an immediate injunction that if granted would have required the elections board to comply with the lower court ruling while the appeal is handled. The hearing will be held three days after early voting ends for June&#8217;s primaries. On Monday, state Supreme Court of Claims Judge Judge Adam W. Silverman tossed out Rensselaer County’s three early voting locations as too remote and not providing equitable access for people of color and ordered the Board of Elections to have new polling places selected by Wednesday.

Ronald Knapp, who lost a Republican nomination for county council by 57 votes, had filed paperwork seeking a hand recount and reconciliation. The county argued Knapp’s request must be rejected because his filing did not meet legal requirements. A recount would take the election bureau a week or two and require assistance from other departments, officials said. Burke said Knapp, who was representing himself, failed to comply with some fundamental legal requirements, including a state law mandate to post a bond or cash based on the number of machines involved in the recount. The judge said he admires any citizens willing to run for office and tries to provide some latitude with litigation filers representing themselves. However, Burke said judges take an oath to uphold the law, and he cannot overlook fatal legal defects in Knapp’s filing.</p>

In a 28-page ruling, Piersol ruled the “State did not meet its burden of showing that the burdensome requirements of SB 180 challenged by Plaintiff as violating the First Amendment are substantially related to the State’s interests in election integrity and avoiding fraud.”  Piersol issued a preliminary injunction. Dakotans for Health, a group looking to get Medicaid expansion on the 2022 ballot, filed the lawsuit. “This court agrees that the State has an important regulatory interest in preventing fraud and its appearances in its electoral processes. But the record does not support the conclusion that SB 180’s public disclosure requirements combat actual instances of fraud or forgery committed by petition circulators in the signature gathering process,” the ruling said.</p>

Parish, a pastor, came in third in last month’s election to represent South Dallas’ District 7, short by just 28 votes to advance to the runoff election, in which the candidate in second place, Kevin Felder, lost to incumbent Adam Bazaldua. In a complaint filed May 21, Parish claimed irregularities with voting locations made the race void. On June 11, the Supreme Court denied a petition by Parish for a new election and did not offer an opinion. Parish’s complaint argues the race’s tight election results made the problems reported at several polling places significant. Nine polling sites, many of which were in South Dallas, had problems ranging from broken voting machines, to workers who couldn’t access buildings or supplies because they didn’t have keys, to too few electrical outlets or extension cords for voting machines. Some voters were turned away.</p>

Newly created voter education videos will be collected and placed on the page for easy access. The latest video in the series brings the total number available to 11. The video talks about incarcerations and felonies and discusses their effect on voter registration. The new video completes the chapter on Registration Management. This is the third completed chapter, along with the Citizen&#8217;s Guide to Voting and Voter Registration. According to the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office, five more chapters are scheduling for release throughout the year, including Absentee Voting, Election Day, Ballot Tabulation, Election Policies and Election Crimes. “The purpose of this series is to give Idaho citizens an in-depth look at the systems and processes behind Idaho’s elections,” says Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck. “Educated citizens are less likely to be susceptible to misinformation, and that makes for a safer, more secure voting experience for everyone.”</p>

This was a small but impactful change,” LaRose told StateScoop of the EAC update that allows the inclusion of wireless radios. The changes were made by the Ohio Board of Voting Machine Examiners, a four-person bipartisan group that reviews and certifies the election equipment used by the state’s 88 county boards of elections, including electronic pollbooks, printers and ballot scanners. “A voting machine shall not be connected to the Internet.  A voting system or voting machine is prohibited from containing any wireless communication hardware or software components,” the updated standards read. “I’m no luddite when it comes to this stuff,” LaRose said. “I’m all about embracing technology. But the actual casting of ballots, that should be completely air-gapped.”</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/events/how-can-we-strengthen-trust-in-the-integrity-of-presidential-elections/">How can we strengthen trust in the integrity of presidential elections?:</a> Distrust of the results of presidential elections has been particularly intense in recent years. Many Democrats believed Donald Trump won the 2016 election through interference by Russian disinformation campaigns, and an even larger percentage of Republicans believe Democrats stole the 2020 presidential contest. This denial of election results is indisputably corrosive to the American political system’s long-term well-being. Please join AEI’s Kevin R. Kosar and a panel of experts as they discuss various ways to strengthen the public’s trust in the results of our presidential elections. <strong>When:</strong> June 21, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://freespeechforpeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bmd-forum-program-formatted-2.docx.pdf?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=e97ac4b4-e993-4355-94aa-3b32eb1b7399">Today&#8217;s Electronic Voting Machines: An Examination of the Use and Security of Ballot Marking Devices</a>: Amid mounting evidence of vulnerabilities in electronic voting machines, and the growing focus on securing our elections, broad consensus has emerged among election officials, computer scientists, national security experts, election stakeholders and voters, that all votes should be recorded on a paper ballot. For years, that meant most voters would mark choices with a pen on a pre-printed paper ballot, and that voters that maybe unable or uncomfortable hand-marking their ballot would use an assistive ballot marking device. Assistive ballot marking devices are essential to provide differently-abled voters the opportunity to mark a paper ballot privately and independently. We will take a deep dive to answer these and other questions regarding the use of universal-use ballot marking devices. <strong>When:</strong> June 22, 12pm-5pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257">Election Audit Specialist</a>, VotingWorks— VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair. We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment. About the Job: Your goal is to make election administrators successful when running Arlo, VotingWorks’ risk-limiting audit software, to conduct risk-limiting election audits. You succeed when these election administrators succeed in delighting audit board members, voters, and the public. You’ll need to become very skilled with the Arlo software, the VotingWorks voting machines and general risk-limiting audit procedures. You’ll support election administrators and audit board members with tier 1 support (basic software and procedure questions) that includes light training and troubleshooting in preparation for and during audit conduct remotely. Occasionally, you’ll be asked to provide the same support in-person. Your enthusiasm for the product, the process, the mission, and the team should be infectious, surpassed only by your organizational skills and ability to multitask. You know that no matter how robust a technology, at the end of the day it’s people who make other people successful and you feel personally responsible for ensuring that everyone who uses Arlo feels successful. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257"> click here</a>.</p>
