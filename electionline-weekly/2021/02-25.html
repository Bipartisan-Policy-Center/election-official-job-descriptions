							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>GIS in elections in state statute</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSGIC Geo-Enabled Elections paves the way</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Jamie Chesser<br />
</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSGIC Geo-Enabled Elections project</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/data-transparency-model-statute-in-focus-at-elections-geosummit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Elections GeoSummit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convened in December, it was a poignant moment for anyone involved in elections to reflect on Americans’ confidence in elections, and what should be done to restore or strengthen it. The event, created by National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC), shared information on how election accuracy, transparency, and efficiency can be enhanced using geographic information systems (GIS) in elections management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GIS is the best tool for election data management,” says Wesley Wilcox, Supervisor of Elections in Marion County, Florida, in a</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/gis-for-successful-redistricting-marion-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recent NSGIC case study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And many election directors around the country agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6654" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NSGIC-02.25.21-300x155.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="155" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NSGIC-02.25.21-300x155.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NSGIC-02.25.21.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />GIS as a technology improvement is becoming mainstream in elections management, where it adds a visual, more automated, dimension to locations – the number one factor determining which individuals are eligible to vote in which races. GIS turns a voter’s address into a digital pinpoint on a map, and any geographical boundary, like that of a congressional district, into a digital polygon, also on a map. When the two are layered on top of each other, it becomes visually apparent whether all the right voters have been captured in the right voting districts, and will be allowed to vote in the right races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming months, election offices will also be turning to GIS to help with redistricting. Using this technology, it is quick and easy to analyze population at the census block level and assign those blocks to districts. This ensures that new voting districts have equal population, which is a cornerstone of redistricting. Some redistricting tasks which – using traditional methods – could take hundreds of hours can now be done in minutes, as</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/first-county-maricopa-ariz-shares-lessons-from-geo-enabling-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this recent NSGIC case study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it’s true to say that the November 3, 2020, election in fact went very well, with perhaps fewer glitches than any previous nationwide election, it is also true that many Americans’ confidence in elections has been rocked recently. GIS has a role to play in increasing the transparency of voting information. Voters themselves want to see, to verify, that they have been placed correctly on the map and how their location is surrounded by boundaries demonstrating that they have been placed in the right house district, school district, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not-for-profit organizations also crave this transparency. League of Women Voters of the United States, Center for Tech and Civic Life, and Democracy Works – all keynote speakers at the Elections GeoSummit – made their cases for transparent access to election information at the Elections GeoSummit. Among other data, they would like easy access to digital precinct boundaries in order to play their roles in elections; encouraging and informing citizens wishing to run for office, providing information to campaigns, running get-out-the-vote drives, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While allowing many parties – including the public – to access and use voting data might give some people pause, the experience of many states and counties that have contributed to NSGIC’s Geo-Enabled Elections project points to the opposite: the more entities who access and deploy data, the better the data itself gets. For example, using school district taxpayer information and cross-checking it against voter registration information using GIS, a large county in Nebraska found some voters who had been both voting in and contributing tax dollars to the wrong school district. Both data sets have now been improved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voters, too, benefit from being able to access election information in a visual format. This is another reason why states, counties, academic institutions, and independent organizations all advocate for available and transparent election information. Says Bert Granberg, co-chair of the steering group of the Geo-Enabled Elections project: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When voters can explore and use election-related maps, it builds their familiarity and trust in our democratic process, and it can also help residents to engage with their elected representatives. After all, the geography of elections is something we all relate to and expect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that using GIS technology in elections management enhances accuracy and saves time and resources, many states are starting to look for ways to improve state statute to fully enable the use of GIS in elections, as well as to secure ongoing funding for the technology’s use in elections. One of the most appreciated panel discussions of the Elections GeoSummit addressed this topic, and a paper with model language is expected to be published in the fall. The model statute language will likely highlight the need for transparency in election data. For example, the draft language discussed at the Elections GeoSummit would require a state’s election office to publish an official statewide voting precinct map shortly after changing any precinct boundaries; the information would be offered in an electronic GIS file format and available to the public at no charge. To access recordings from this session,</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/data-transparency-model-statute-in-focus-at-elections-geosummit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see information here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the November 2020 election, Maricopa County, Arizona, was one of many places that found themselves the subject of intense public scrutiny. Gary Bilotta of the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office recently contributed a</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/first-county-maricopa-ariz-shares-lessons-from-geo-enabling-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> case study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how the county geo-enabled their elections using GIS. He was also a speaker at the Elections GeoSummit and commended the county – noting especially the collaboration between geographic information officials and elections officials – on how it used GIS to ensure all election data was accurate, transparent, and reliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSGIC has developed</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/best-practices-gis-in-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> best practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help states and counties get started on, as well as elevate, their use of GIS technology in elections. These essentially form building blocks, and although every jurisdiction is different and may apply the building blocks in different ways that work for them the best practices are universal and can help every jurisdiction improve their elections through enhanced use of GIS. The Best Practices Guidance documents can be</span><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/best-practices-gis-in-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> downloaded for free here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

							<h2>In Their Own Words</h2>
														<p><strong>Benjamin Hovland’s year-long EAC chairmanship comes to an end</strong><br />
<em>Outgoing chairman reflects on challenges and accomplishments</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Benjamin Hovland<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />With my year-long term as chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) coming to an end this week, it has been an opportunity to reflect on the challenges and accomplishments of the past year. I am proud of the work we have done and how the election community came together to take on the unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I became chair in late February 2020, the presidential primary season was still in its early stages. Election officials around the country were preparing for a high-turnout presidential election year, with a particular focus on election security and the threat of foreign interference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then unexpectedly the COVID-19 pandemic hit, with dozens of states having yet to hold primary elections. The pandemic required an immediate shift in resources and guidance to address the challenges COVID-19 presented and to respond to the demands of voters. Of course, this necessitated an increased investment to conduct both the largest mail or absentee ballot election most jurisdictions had ever experienced, while ensuring polling places met CDC standards and were as safe as possible for voters and election workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help address cost concerns, the EAC quickly and diligently worked to distribute $825 million from Congress in 2020. We also provided support to states and jurisdictions looking to utilize those funds. $425 million was designated for election security and an additional $400 million was allocated through the CARES Act in April of 2020 to support election officials adapting procedures for voting during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strategically pivoted resources with a focus on sharing best practices and practical information to help election officials as they confronted obstacles and made difficult decisions of how to best administer their elections. By chairing the elections infrastructure joint COVID-19 working group, we utilized and further developed meaningful partnerships with state, local, federal, and private sector stakeholders. This work resulted in timely and critical guidance for election officials as well as the collection and distribution of lessons learned from the 2020 primary elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6653" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hovland-251x300.png" alt="" width="251" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hovland-251x300.png 251w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hovland.png 668w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" />Another way the EAC contributed was the establishment of the first-ever National Poll Worker Recruitment Day, which galvanized national recruitment efforts to alleviate concerns about a significant shortage in poll workers due to COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic was certainly a major focus, the EAC has also been busy preparing the agency to better meet its mission for years to come. This was significantly aided by Congressional support and increases to the EAC’s budget from an all-time low operating budget of $7.95 million in FY19 to $11.27 million in FY20 and $15.5 million for FY21. The funds allowed the agency to establish a new Cyber Access and Security Program, which provided security training, best practices and other assistance for election officials. We also filled several other mission-critical roles throughout the agency and nearly doubled our staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working to respond to the pandemic and serve our stakeholders, we simultaneously relocated the agency from Silver Spring, Maryland to a new location near Judiciary Square in Washington, D.C. that can accommodate our growing staff and will prove much more conducive to the agency’s mission and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just a few weeks ago, we fulfilled one of the EAC’s most important responsibilities by adopting a new version of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines. This version, known as the VVSG 2.0, represents the first major overhaul of the standards in 16 years and a major leap forward for future election systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am confident that seeing the elections community come together and share information to help each other problem-solve and address the challenges of the pandemic to better serve the American voters will be one of the highlights of my career. You cannot give enough credit to the public servants that run elections in cities and counties across this country who put their health on the line and worked countless hours for their voters and our democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the 2020 election taught us anything, it is that our democracy is precious, we must invest in it to make it stronger and we must continue the work of making it better. I look forward to continuing our work at the EAC and finding additional ways for the agency to support election officials, voters and, our democracy. </span></p>

According to The Arizona Republic, the auditors found that the county used certified equipment and software, no malicious hardware was found on voting machines, the machines were not connected to the internet, and the machines were programmed to tabulate ballots accurately, according to a letter from county election directors to the supervisors. These results, along with the previous audits the county and political parties did and other security protocols &#8220;confirm that Maricopa County Elections Department&#8217;s configuration and setup of the tabulation equipment and election management system provided an accurate counting of ballots and reporting of election results,&#8221; county election directors Scott Jarrett and Rey Valenzuela wrote in the letter. Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers said in a statement on Tuesday that the county was releasing the audit results &#8220;so that the public can see what we see and know what we know: no hacking or vote switching occurred in the 2020 election.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

Biden (D) has named three people to fill three of the four vacancies on the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/24/dejoy-hearing-usps-live-updates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Postal Services Board of Governors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute and former director of elections for Denver. The other two nominee are Ron Stroman, the Postal Service’s recently retired deputy postmaster general [Stroman is a former Fellow at The Democracy Fund] and Anton Hajjar, the former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union. If all three win Senate confirmation, the nine-member board would be made up of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans with McReynolds as the lone independent. The news of the nominees came the same day Postmaster General Louis DeJoy</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970504457/postmaster-general-dejoy-faces-questioning-about-mail-delays"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> testified before Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the ongoing issues facing the agency. While DeJoy face some bipartisan grilling, the testimony between the Postmaster General and Democrats was particularly testy with Democrats. In an exchange with Maryland’s Jamie Raskin, DeJoy said, &#8220;You can sit here and think I&#8217;m bringing all this damage to the Postal Service,&#8221; but &#8220;the place was operationally faulty because of lack of investment and lack of ability to move forward, which is what we&#8217;re trying to do.&#8221; Asked by Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., how much longer he intended to stay as postmaster general, DeJoy responded: &#8220;A long time. Get used to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Information About Disinformation</strong>: Much attention has been given to the role social media played in the mis/disinformation campaign surrounding the 2020 general election. This week however, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to Comcast, AT&amp;T, Spectrum, Dish, Verizon, Cox and Altice, asking about</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/media/disinformation-cable-television.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their role in “the spread of dangerous misinformation.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The committee members also sent the letter to Roku, Amazon, Apple, Google and Hulu, digital companies that distribute cable programming. “To our knowledge, the cable, satellite and over-the-top companies that disseminate these media outlets to American viewers have done nothing in response to the misinformation aired by these outlets,” two Democratic representatives from California, Anna G. Eshoo and Jerry McNerney, wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Congress can raise the issue of whether cable providers bear responsibility for the programs they deliver to millions of Americans, but it may have no way to force them to drop networks that have spread misinformation. And unlike broadcast stations, cable channels do not have licenses that are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The lawmakers’ letter asks the companies, “What steps did you take prior to, on and following the Nov. 3, 2020, elections and the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks to monitor, respond to and reduce the spread of disinformation, including encouragement or incitement of violence by channels your company disseminates to millions of Americans?”</span></p>

The Rev. Joseph Lowery, C.T. Vivian, attorney Bruce Boynton and the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis will be honored during the 56th annual commemoration of Bloody Sunday. The four will be honored during the Martin &amp; Coretta King Unity Breakfast on March 7 in Selma. The breakfast will be held as a drive-in, and people will remain in their cars during the breakfast while speakers will address the crowd from a stage. There will then be a “slow drive” across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and wreaths will be placed honoring the four, former state Sen. Hank Sanders said. While much of the annual Bridge Crossing celebration will be virtual this year, Sanders said they wanted to have events that people could safely attend.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6450" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: Reps Andy Kim (D-New Jersey) and Donald Norcross (D-New Jersey) introduced the</span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/reps-kim-norcross-introduce-alice-paul-voter-protection-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alice Paul Voter Protection Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will protect a citizen’s access to vote by prohibiting the interference of voter registration efforts. The Alice Paul Voter Protection Act protects voter registration efforts by making it unlawful for any person to hinder or prevent another person from registering or aiding another person in registering to vote. The legislation also encourages the establishment of best practices to ensure that states protect these critical rights. “Alice Paul was a leader in ensuring and protecting the right to vote. It’s important we honor her legacy by continuing her work, and I’m proud to introduce a bill inspired by that legacy that stands up for the rights of all Americans to have unfettered access to the ballot box,” said Kim. “This bill is also just one step in a larger fight to make our democracy work better for the people. I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to make it easier for every American to participate in our democratic process.”</span></p>

Laura Hall (D-Hunstville) has introduced legislation that would</span><a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2021/02/24/house-republicans-sound-skeptical-no-excuse-absentee-voting-bill/4546259001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permanently remove an excuse requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for absentee voting. The bill has the support of Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, a Republican, and would not remove other absentee voting requirements, like photo identification or an affidavit and witness requirement. Supporters cited the success of last year&#8217;s election, which saw record numbers of absentee ballots cast in Alabama, and said dropping the excuses would improve ballot access in a state. But circuit clerks and probate judges who spoke against the measure suggested that it could weaken current voter laws, and encourage new ways of casting ballots they lacked the resources to implement.   &#8220;By removing the (excuses), it essentially establishes early voting,&#8221; said Carla Woodall, circuit clerk of Houston County. &#8220;We have no foundation to support early voting.&#8221;</span></p>

Kevin Meyer recently introduced Senate Bill 83, an election integrity bill that he said would provide additional tools for the Alaska Division of Elections in increase Alaskan’s</span><a href="http://www.sitnews.us/0221News/022121/0022121_election_legislation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trust in elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the voting process. The bill allows for increased post-election audits, stronger requirements for absentee ballot voter certificates and limited by-mail voting in communities under 750. Additionally, it requires the division to determine the costs of recounts in regulation instead of statue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> House Bill 2373, introduced by Rep. Tim Dunn, R-Yuma — would require every person and group that registers people to vote to get a</span><a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/02/19/bill-would-require-people-groups-registering-voters-to-register-with-elections-officials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unique identifier number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the county recorder if they submit more than 25 voter registration forms in a calendar year. The groups or people then have to place their unique identification numbers on every voter registration form they submit.  The bill cleared the House Government and Elections Committee Feb. 17 on a party-line vote, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.  “This is a very clear attack on the voter registration groups that have come together since SB1070 to completely change the State of Arizona for the better by bringing hundreds of thousands of new voters of color to the table, empowering them, walking them through the process … and making sure they actually have a voice,” said Randy Perez of LUCHA. “We’ve increased turnout among the Latino electorate by double while expanding the electorate. This is very clearly targeted at the work that we do every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate has revived a stalled bill that would purge about 200,000 people from a list of voters who</span><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/bill-to-purge-arizona-permanent-early-voting-list-revived1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatically get mail ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The measure died on the Senate floor last week when Republican Sen. Paul Boyer joined all 14 Democrats in opposition, holding it short of a majority. But a Senate committee revived the proposal on Tuesday and Boyer said on Feb. 24 his concerns have been addressed. The measure would end the popular permanent early voting list, requiring people to vote at least once in every two election cycles to stay on the list. Boyer was said he was concerned that people would be dropped from the list for missing just one primary or general election, but legislative lawyers have assured him that a voter would need to miss both the primary and the general for two consecutive cycles. State election officials say about 200,000 voters currently meet that criteria. They’ll get a letter asking them whether they want to remain on the permanent early voting list and will be removed if they don’t respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Appropriations Committee voted along party lines to</span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2021/02/24/arizona-legislature-revives-bill-cut-people-mail-voting-list/4544545001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shorten the period for voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by mail by requiring counties send out ballots 22 days ahead of an election, instead of 27 days.  Senate Bill 1593 also would require mail ballots to be postmarked no later than the Thursday before Election Day. Currently, election officials count ballots that are received up to 7 p.m. on Election Day. Critics argued the measure would disadvantage those who vote by mail from rural areas, where mail service can be delayed. And others noted that not all mail is postmarked.</span></p>

The majority-Republican Senate approved the measure by a 25-9 vote, sending it to GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson&#8217;s desk. The majority-Republican House approved the measure earlier this month. Hutchinson said he&#8217;ll review the measure and make a decision on it next week. Under the state’s current law, a voter who doesn’t present photo identification but signs a statement can cast a provisional ballot that will be counted unless the county election commission finds it invalid. If enacted, the law will still allow someone without ID to cast a provisional ballot that will be counted only if they present an ID to the county clerk or election board by noon the Monday following the election. Supporters of the change said it was needed because of the lack of a standard for matching the signature on the affidavit to the voter&#8217;s registration.</span></p>

Paul Lundeen (R-Monument), Coloradans would be</span><a href="https://kiowacountypress.net/content/colorado-secretary-state-opposes-election-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required to vote in-person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beginning in 2022 unless a mail ballot is requested. Under the legislation, which is titled the &#8220;Improve Public Confidence Election Validity&#8221; bill, registered voters would also be required to select which way they prefer to cast their general election ballot at a polling location within the county of the elector&#8217;s residence. All votes must also be counted by the end of Election Day. Lundeen described the bill as legislative hardball, adding that the legislative process is driven by dialogue and amendment, two things the bill was meant to achieve. &#8220;Senate Bill 21-007 would disenfranchise Coloradans by reducing voter access to mail ballots and making it harder to vote,&#8221;  said Secretary of State Jena Griswold, noting that 94% of Coloradans voted in the November general election with a mail ballot. A Senate panel</span><a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/colorado-democrats-republican-eliminate-mail-in-voting-system-fraud/73-002b528f-0847-4723-9102-afbb9e484dda"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Colorado House committee has advanced a bill to make it easier for cities and counties to transition to a</span><a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/a-bill-to-make-ranked-choice-voting-an-easier-option-for-cities-passes-its-first-committee-test"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system. House Bill 21-1107 would require the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office to come up with a uniform set of rules for the implementation and certification of this type of voting. The bill does not require cities or counties to take up the voting system. The office would also establish an audit process for it and find a software provider for counties to use to run these elections.</span></p>

Under current law, people seeking mail-in ballots must provide a reason why they cannot be at the polls on Election Day. Valid excuses include military deployment, travelling out of state for business and illness. House Joint Resolution 59 would allow for early voting. The two bills actually would not establish early voting or no-excuse absentee voting, but they would amend the state constitution to allow for such changes. The measure allowing for early voting has already cleared both chambers, although not by a three-fourths vote. So it needs to be approved by a simple majority this year to earn a spot on the November 2022 ballot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Janet Cruz joined Rep. Susan Valdes in filing identical versions of the bill, SB 1528 and HB 869. The legislation would alter current state election law, which does not require</span><a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/406307-tampa-lawmakers-file-proposal-requiring-pre-paid-postage-be-enclosed-in-vote-by-mail-ballots"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prepaid postage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be enclosed in vote-by-mail ballots. It is currently up to each county’s supervisor of elections whether or not to provide the postage. Valdes said the bill was partially inspired by Hillsborough County’s Supervisor of Elections office, which does provide paid postage for return. “It works phenomenally in Hillsborough County, so we figured if we can do it in Hillsborough County, why can’t we just do it all across the state,” Valdes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation filed this year would</span><a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2021/02/22/florida-lawmakers-pitch-more-privacy-for-voters-themselves/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shield registered voters’ emails, addresses, date of birth and phone numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mark Earley, vice president of the association representing Florida’s election supervisors, supports the effort. “We need to have better protections. Our voters are trusting us with their data. If they can’t trust that they can get registered to vote and still maintain some kind of personal privacy that’s a bad statement about where we are,” said Earley. There’s one notable exception in the bill. Political parties and candidates could still access the voter registration data.</span></p>

HB 531, filed by Rep. Barry Fleming (R-Harlem) was introduced directly into the Special Committee on Election Integrity. Section 12 of the bill would provide &#8220;uniformity&#8221; to the three-week early voting period, requiring all counties to hold early voting from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday for three weeks before the election, plus a mandatory 9-to-5 period of voting the second Saturday before the election. It would allow counties to extend hours to 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., but would prohibit counties from holding early voting any other days — including Sunday. In HB 531, voters would need to include their driver&#8217;s license number, state ID number, or a copy of acceptable form of photo ID. The driver&#8217;s license number or state ID number is already required for the newly created online request portal, and photo ID is required to vote in person. The proposal would also shrink the window voters can request an absentee ballot and limit the timeline that county officials can mail them out. No absentee ballot could be requested earlier than 11 weeks before an election or later than two Fridays before the election, and absentee-by-mail ballots would not be sent out until four weeks before day of the election. The bill restricts the location of secure drop boxes to early voting sites, and limits the use of those drop boxes to just the days and times where early voting takes place. Another section would ban county elections offices from directly accepting outside funding for elections. Legislators did amend the bill this week to</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/sunday-voting-restored-in-georgia-bill-that-tightens-election-rules/DMWUG2DVMBHZ7IDP4KZSRYZ7LY/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restore Sunday early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Under the bill, which was approved 35-18 mostly along party lines, voters would have to provide a driver’s license number, state ID number or a copy of photo ID when requesting absentee ballots. Currently, absentee ballots are verified based on voters’ signatures and registration information rather than an ID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that would create a</span><a href="https://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/politics/bill-creating-new-state-elections-assistance-officer-passes-georgia-senate-heres-whats-next/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chief elections assistance officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state employee who would work with local elections offices on training and evaluating voting processes, has passed the Georgia Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate approved a bill this week that would</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-state-legislature/georgia-bill-clears-senate-to-let-state-take-over-local-election-boards/JOMQA2LX3VH65MG4O44IXY2ADE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow the state to take over local election offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that fail to meet standards.</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/89"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 89</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow the State Election Board to establish criteria for “low-performing” election offices and, if they don’t improve, to replace the local officials with new election superintendents indefinitely. Supporters said the bill would mean more support for local election officials, as well as accountability for those that have repeatedly had election problems. Critics said the state already has the authority to investigate and hold local officials accountable. They say the proposal would usurp local control of elections guaranteed in the Georgia Constitution.</span></p>

The Hawaii bill says officials would not process applications for an identification card or driver’s license until an applicant fills in a section related to voter registration. Officials would automatically send an applicant’s information to election officials unless the applicant specifically indicates he or she does not want to be registered to vote. The seven members of the committee unanimously passed the legislation, which heads to the full Senate for consideration saying it would increase access to voter registration. It would also help ensure the accuracy of voter registration rolls by sharing data between the driver’s license and ID database and the statewide voter registration system, the office said.</span></p>

The law would also require that if any absentee ballots are opened before election day, they are maintained in an electronically accessed and secured area that is under 24-hour video surveillance livestreamed to the public. Also, a minimum of two election officials must be present whenever the absentee ballots are accessed. The law would also require the video to be archived for at least 90 days after the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate also approved another election bill 35-0 involving absentee ballots that have a problem preventing them from being counted. Typically, county clerks contact a voter when they discover they have done something that prevents their vote from being counted, such as forgetting to sign the outside envelope. The legislation puts into law the ability of clerks to contact voters when an issue is discovered with a returned absentee ballot. The proposed law sets a deadline of 8 p.m. on Election Day to fix any problems with absentee ballots, the same deadline used for other ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A revamped version of a proposed law making it a felony in Idaho for third parties to collect and return multiple ballots to election officials headed to the full House for debate and a vote after it passed in committee this week. The House State Affairs Committee approved the bill that has several significant changes from the bill that was pulled from the House floor earlier this month after debate tilted toward almost certain defeat. The new bill changes from two to six the number of ballots a single family member can deliver. It also redefines family to include adopted children. The proposed law limits who can handle multiple ballots to election officials, U.S. postal service workers and parcel delivery services.</span></p>

Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, said at a Judiciary subcommittee on House Study Bill 143. In fact, most of the comments offered, according to The Gazette, at the subcommittee hearing were very similar to those heard over the past two years since Gov. Kim Reynolds’ called for the amendment in 2019. The House overwhelmingly passed it, but the Senate has yet to take action to put the issue on the ballot. Before voters get a chance to weigh in, the amendment must be approved by the House and Senate in this two-year General Assembly and again in the 2023-24 session.</span></p>

The bill would cut early voting from 29 days to 20, require most mail-in ballots to be received by county election officials by the time polls close on Election Day, instead of allowing votes to be counted as long as they were postmarked by Election Day and arrived by noon on the Monday following the election. The bill also prohibits the use of a U.S. Postal Service postmark as a way to verify when a ballot was mailed. Polling times also would be reduced by an hour, closing at 8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. And the bill would also prohibit county auditors from mailing absentee ballot request forms to eligible Iowa voters-something that was widespread during the pandemic-unless a voter requests a form. It would reduce the mail and in-person early voting period, tightly regulate how absentee ballots can be returned and require polls in all elections to close at 8 p.m., an hour earlier than currently for general elections.

Secretary of State Michael Adams backs both versions of the legislation —House Bill 574 and Senate Bill 259. Both bills would allow four days of no-excuse early voting before elections — fewer than the three weeks made available last year through an executive order — but the first time such early voting would be allowed under state law. While both bills would keep the state&#8217;s new online absentee portal where voters can request an absentee ballot, they would no longer allow any and all registered voters to use that method — as most Kentucky voters did in last year&#8217;s election, helping to create the largest total turnout in state history. Under both bills, only the individuals previously allowed under state law to vote absentee because of age, illness, disability or temporary residence outside the county or state could use the online portal. Adams, a Republican, called the bills &#8220;the most significant election reform legislation in the past quarter-century&#8221; for Kentucky. </span></p>

Arthur Ellis (D-Charles) would change how the</span><a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2021/02/bill-would-shift-party-control-of-local-election-boards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> political makeup of local election boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is determined. Under Ellis’ proposal, the makeup of election boards would be based on the party affiliation of the majority of voters in each jurisdiction, rather than the governor’s political party. At a Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee meeting, Ellis argued that his proposal is needed to make local boards of elections reflect the counties they represent. In Maryland, all local election boards have five regular members. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have alternates who only vote if a member is absent. “In order for the social contract to be upheld, there needs to be a democracy that respects and abides by the opinions of the majority of people in that area,” Ellis said, arguing that election boards should reflect voters’ preferences rather than the governor’s. “We just don’t want any kind of hegemony, one group having dominance over the other,” he said. The proposal received bipartisan interest, with Senate Minority Leader Bryan W. Simonaire (R-Anne Arundel) calling it a “fairer way” to select the leadership of local boards of elections.</span></p>

HB 4362  would amend Michigan Election Law to require local clerks to send absentee ballot applications with prepaid return postage to every registered voter with the costs to be reimbursed by the state. The bill would also allow clerks to tabulate absentee ballots up to 22 days before election day, counting ballots or establishing results would be prohibited, and notify absentee voters about a problem with their signature and establish a process to fix the problem. HB 4361  would ensure voters automatically received absentee ballot applications by requiring local clerks to maintain a permanent absent voter list. The bill would also help clerks establish polling locations based on likely in-person voters.</span></p>

Supporters said under the current system, absentee ballots often continue to be mailed to addresses, even though the voter has moved or died, creating opportunities for voter fraud.

BIPA restricted ballot collection to family members, caregivers, household members and acquaintances, while limiting them to dropping off no more than six ballots. It also instated fines of up to $500 for each unlawfully collected ballot. HB 406, sponsored by Republican Rep.

Republican Assemblywoman Jill Dickman introduced AB 163 on Monday. Major provisions of the legislation would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue voter identification cards to Nevadans without IDs. If a person’s identity is questioned at the polls, a person would have to “furnish proof of identity to respond to such a challenge,” a preliminary version of the bill reads. The proposed law would also require Nevada’s Secretary of State to match voter registration lists with records from the State Registrar of Vital Statistics, specifically to crosscheck the names of dead Nevadans at least once a month. This process already happens at the county level, but not with a statewide standard other than to be “regularly maintained.” Current law also requires the DMV to work with the Social Security Administration to update the list.</span></p>

Assemblyman Vince Mazzeo, whose Assembly State and Local Government committee passed the bill in October, said it would be a mandate funded by the state. “It would be in the neighborhood of the upper $30 millions,” Mazzeo said of the cost statewide. The bill would require each county to set up at least three designated early voting locations, with the number based on population.

The bill passed 87-7 and now heads to the Senate. The document must include the student&#8217;s legal name, current residential address in the state, the date the residential address was established and date of birth. When issuing the document to students, the school would also provide each student with information regarding voter eligibility requirements. Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the document would act as a “utility bill” for students when they need to supplement their North Dakota ID while voting in a district to which they recently moved.  Voters who have a valid North Dakota driver’s license but may not have an updated address can bring a utility bill or some other form of verification that they live in the district in which they are attempting to vote. This bill would give students, who would typically not have access to a utility bill if they live in a residence hall, access to a document to prove they live in their district.</p>

Janice Bowling has introduced legislation that would eliminate the early voting period and</span><a href="https://www.tullahomanews.com/news/local/bowling-moves-to-strike-early-voting/article_db856d9c-7168-11eb-b5a1-dfbd2f828be7.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> un-digitize the voting process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all Tennesseans. Bowling filed the bill (SB1510) for introduction in the Tennessee General Assembly Feb. 11. According to Bowling, the impetus for filing the fill was to address concerns over the integrity of the state’s elections. “There are a lot of people across the nation, but also right here in Tennessee that are concerned that the integrity of the vote is compromised, partly due to the electronics,” she said. The text of the bill says county election commissions “shall not use voting machines” and instead must use specially watermarked paper ballots for all elections. Bowling ended up</span><a href="https://www.wate.com/news/politics/tennessee-bill-to-abolish-early-voting-and-voting-machines-is-withdrawn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pulling the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

House Bill 1239, by Mt. Juliet Republican Rep. Susan Lynn and Republican Sen. Frank Niceley of Strawberry Plains, would authorize election commissions to use existing fingerprint databases to verify the identity of voters. “We’ve been identifying people with fingerprints obviously for a very long time. There’s nothing unusual about it,” Lynn said. “In order to provide voters with more confidence that each person cast their ballot, why not open it up and allow fingerprint registries to be used?” House Bill 1239 does not include fingerprinting voters at voter registration, but Lynn considers this bill a first step.</span></p>

The Senate Government Operations Committee voted 4-1 to support the bill, S.15, which now heads to money committees that will assess the cost. The measure would require town clerks to mail out ballots to all active, registered voters for general elections, pandemic safety issues or not. Every voter would have the chance to return their ballot by mail, deliver it to the polls, or vote as they always have in person. A key element of the bill would allow people who make errors when filling out their ballots to fix the problem and still have their votes count. During last year’s dramatic expansion of voting by mail, the rate of defective ballots also spiked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

Ralph Northam’s desk for his signature. If signed into law, House Bill 2081, sponsored by Del. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria, would prohibit knowingly possessing firearms within 40 feet of the locations beginning one hour before polls are open and an hour after they close. Violation would be a Class 1 misdemeanor if convicted, which is punishable by up to 12 months in jail, a fine up to $2,500 or both. Exceptions to this rule would include qualified or retired law-enforcement officers, a person occupying his own property if it falls within the boundary or a licensed armed security officer performing his duties within that boundary. The bill would also prohibit possessing firearms within 40 feet of a meeting place for the electoral board meeting to determine the results of an election or a place used for a recount.</span></p>

Ralph Northam’s desk. Senate Bill 1239, sponsored by Sen. John Bell, D-Broadlands, would allow general registrars to contract to these third parties for printing, assembling and mailing the ballots. This would not allow third parties to handle ballots that have already been cast. The Democratic-led bill passed with some bipartisan support, clearing the Senate 27-12 and the House of Delegates 70-30. The legislation would also direct the State Board of Elections to adopt emergency regulations set in the bill to ensure secure and timely delivery of voter information to the contractors and reports of mailed absentee ballots from the contractors.</span></p>

Evers wants to allow clerks to count absentee ballots on the day before election day if they want.</span></p>

Tony Evers&#8217; state budget would</span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/18/tony-evers-calls-expanding-early-voting-part-state-budget/6788023002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand early voting, allow clerks to count absentee ballots before election day and require a voter bill of rights to be posted at every polling station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Evers wants to allow local officials to decide when early voting should begin, instead of limiting it to the two weeks before election day. Evers is seeking to add a provision to state law that would require polling stations to post notices telling people they have a number of rights, including the right to vote if eligible, review a sample ballot before voting, cast a secret ballot, get assistance if they are disabled and report illegal activity. The notices would also have to alert people that they are allowed to vote if they are in line before the polls close. Evers also wants to allow people to vote from a polling precinct as long as they have lived there for at least 10 days. Evers’s budget would tweak the state’s voter ID law and would drop the requirement that students using current college IDs provide proof of enrollment. In addition, his plan in some cases would allow students to use expired IDs for voting, just as other voters can use expired driver&#8217;s licenses for voting.  The governor would require state technical colleges and University of Wisconsin System schools to ensure they issue IDs that are valid for voting purposes. Evers also wants to change how special elections are scheduled. Evers&#8217; new schedule would allow more time between primaries and special elections to ensure military and overseas voters had more time to return absentee ballots, as the federal law requires. The governor is also seeking to establish automatic voter registration, following the example of some other states that place people on the voter rolls as soon as they turn 18 or move to the state, provided they are eligible to vote.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers are introducing a package of bills that would make significant changes to</span><a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/republican-lawmakers-introduce-absentee-voting-changes/article_a68be949-d11c-53c5-8579-da248d106eb1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a surge in mail-in ballots last fall led to unfounded allegations of voter fraud by then-President Donald Trump and his allies. The package of legislation, introduced by Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, would create a number of new rules for absentee voting after President Joe Biden won the state with more than 20,600 votes. Trump tried unsuccessfully to get courts to reject ballots based on allegations that absentee ballot laws weren’t followed. The legislation would attempt to address some of Trump’s complaints. Overall, the Trump campaign sought to throw out more than 220,000 ballots cast in heavily Democratic Dane and Milwaukee counties. The bills would limit who can certify themselves as an indefinitely confined voter. Current law allows those who are indefinitely unable to vote in person due to age, physical illness, infirmity or disability an exemption from having to provide a photo ID to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan group of state lawmakers is seeking to blow up how Wisconsin chooses members of Congress by</span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/24/ranked-choice-voting-gets-backing-bipartisan-group-wisconsin/4556936001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making primaries nonpartisan and establishing ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for general elections. Backers say the changes would foster bipartisanship because candidates would be inspired to appeal to the broadest slice of the electorate, not just those in their party. The effort is being led by two Republicans and two Democrats. Under legislation unveiled this week, in House and Senate races people could vote for any candidate, regardless of party. The five candidates who got the most votes in the primary would get on the general election ballot. In that election, voters would rank the candidates. If the top candidate had a majority, he or she would be the winner. If no one had a majority, the lowest-performing candidate would be eliminated and those who backed that candidate would see their second choices assigned to the remaining candidates. The process would be repeated until one candidate had more than 50% of the vote. The Wisconsin proposal would change how House and Senate candidates are chosen, but not candidates for governor, the Legislature or other offices.</span></p>

Sponsored by Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper, the legislation has been floated several times in recent years, and has been unsuccessful in each case, failing by a narrow margin in the House of Representatives last year. This year’s version of the bill, however, has gained the support of 55 co-sponsors in the House and Senate. Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Buchanan voicing his support of the bill as a “proactive” measure to increase voter confidence in the integrity of the state’s elections. The bill has undergone numerous improvements – including an expanded definition of government identification that includes tribal identifications and Medicare cards – several argued the bill still had loopholes that could potentially marginalize voters over a non-existent concern over Wyoming’s election security.</span></p>

He said review of them may be particularly subjective, for example on the validity of signatures, and require state officials to sift through millions of ballots. Each state determines its own election procedures, for balloting in person or by mail, within the safeguards of the federal Voting Rights Act and Constitution. It should be noted that Thomas’ wife Ginny is a vocal supporter of Trump and an early backer of the rally that resulted in the insurrection at the Capitol.</span></p>

In interviews and other public appearances, the lawsuit says, Lindell repeatedly spread those claims while viewers were urged to buy his products. His company has offered discounts to customers who use the promo codes “QAnon” and “FightforTrump,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit says Lindell contributed to a “viral disinformation campaign” about Dominion on social media, in broadcast interviews, at pro-Trump rallies and in a two-hour documentary about supposed election fraud — titled “Absolute Proof” — that he created and paid to have aired 13 times this month on One America News. Megan Meier, an attorney representing Dominion, described Lindell as a canny business executive with an interest in algorithms and game theory. “We don’t think he really believes it,” she said of the election fraud misinformation he has spread. “We think he’s making money off of it.” “Now I can get to the evidence faster. It’s going to be amazing,” Lindell told The Washington Post. He added that he plans to continue releasing “more movies, more documentaries” about alleged election fraud.</span></p>

They made that choice. You can’t throw up all these roadblocks, and then complain that we’re pushing through the roadblocks.”</span></p>

Daunt, who was appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as a Republican member of the Board of Canvassers in January, on Tuesday agreed to dismiss the lawsuit. He claims victory, pointing to a recent announcement by Benson’s office that it plans to remove 177,000 outdated registrants from the voter files but maintains the lawsuit was legitimate. He said it’s “unfortunate” that Benson “had to be prodded through litigation” to fulfill her duty to keep an accurate voter registration file. State officials aren’t conceding Daunt’s allegations of improper maintenance.  “It was clear when the suit was filed in June of last year when federal law barred most voter-list maintenance, that this was a press release masquerading as a lawsuit filed to undermine public confidence in the integrity of our elections,” Benson said. “The suit prompted no action from us. As we have said publicly all along, strong voter registration rates and accurate voter rolls are good for democracy. And we have continued taking steps to responsibly maintain the state’s voter list since my first day in office by joining the Electronic Registration Information Center, proposing bipartisan legislation to give clerks more tools to update registrations, mailing absentee voting applications to all registered voters and now using that mailing to carry out the largest and most transparent list cleanup in a decade.”</span></p>

A motion to dismiss filed last week by deputy solicitor general Gregory Zunino asks a Carson City judge to deny a request for an injunction against Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, asserting the lawsuit’s claims are based on the “demonstrably false” premise that the state does not verify the citizenship status of its electorate. The plaintiffs — former Assemblyman Al Kramer, former Washoe County District Attorney Dick Gammick and real estate developer Roger William Norman — claim votes were cast by noncitizens who registered through the state’s automatic voter registration program at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Their lawsuit accuses Cegavske of not removing noncitizens from the voter rolls, as required by state law, and is aimed at forcing her to do so.</span></p>
