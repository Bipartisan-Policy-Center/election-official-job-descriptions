														<p><strong>A primary interrupted</strong><br />
<em>September 11, 2001 New York primary halted by terrorist attack</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>Primary election day on September 11, 2001 in New York dawned without a cloud in the sky. Temperatures were moderate, humidity was low, the sky was a cerulean blue. It was the kind of election day every official dreams of.</p>
<p>In New York City and a handful of other jurisdictions in the state, polls had opened without incident at 6am. The remainder of the polls in the state where elections were being held were set to open at 12pm.</p>
<div id="attachment_7389" style="width: 419px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7389" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-7389" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.1-300x205.png" alt="" width="409" height="280" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.1-300x205.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.1-1024x699.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.1-768x524.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.1.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7389" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of the New York City Campaign Finance Board.</em></p></div>
<p>On the ballot in New York City were Democratic and Republican primaries for mayor and numerous races for city council which had just expanded to 51 members.</p>
<p>Douglas A. Kellner, current co-chair of the<a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/"> New York State Board of Elections</a>, was Democratic commissioner from Manhattan on the<a href="https://vote.nyc/"> New York City Board of Elections</a> (NYCBOE) at the time. Kellner, who typically spent election day out in the field visiting some of Manhattan’s 300+ polling sites was instead in a borough office monitoring a new trouble reporting system.</p>
<p>According to Kellner, the day started with only routine problems. Then, two hours and 46 minutes after polls opened in New York City, that dream of a picture perfect primary day quickly turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>“The first plane crashed into the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. We had a clear view of the huge fire from our office about a mile away. We all assumed it was a horrible accident.  Seventeen minutes later, I was looking out the window and saw the second plane flying low above the Hudson River and then crash into the other tower of the WTC,” Kellner said. “When we saw the second plane crash, nearly all of us immediately knew it was not an accident. We wanted to know more.”</p>
<p>Kellner said officials were desperate for news and so they eventually commandeered a television set from a modeling agency that shared the office building with the NYCBOE.</p>
<p>“We were receiving frantic calls from the field,” Kellner said. “Five poll sites near the World Trade Center had been evacuated or taken over by first responders. Poll workers throughout the borough were calling to ask whether they could shut down.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7393" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.2-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.2-300x224.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sept11.2.png 460w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Meanwhile, Thomas Wilkey, who was then executive director of the New York State Board of Elections, was in town from Albany for primary day. Wilkey said that while he typically arrives at the Board of Elections office for the opening of the polls, that morning he happened to be getting a later start.</p>
<p>“I was waiting for the car [at the hotel] and it didn’t come and didn’t come and my phone was ringing like crazy and I turned on the TV and looked out the window down towards lower Manhattan and thought ‘Oh My God,’” Wilkey said.</p>
<p>Back in the borough office, Kellner and his Republican counterpart Commissioner Fred Umane who was out in the field, began discussing what to do about the election given the fearful calls to the office and that Umane was reporting back about fears and concerns at the polling site he was visiting. Kellner said they understood only the mayor or the governor had the emergency power to close the polls.</p>
<p>“I telephoned the executive director at the general office of the New York City Board of Elections, just two short blocks from the World Trade Center,” Kellner said. “He agreed to help me reach the mayor’s office. That proved to be impossible. In the meantime, at 9:59, the South Tower collapsed. I learned about the collapse from the horrified screams of our clerks who watched it out the window. Two minutes later, the executive director telephoned me to say that the New York City Police Department was withdrawing their police officers from all poll sites.”</p>
<div id="attachment_7391" style="width: 266px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7391" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7391" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kellner-256x300.png" alt="" width="256" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kellner-256x300.png 256w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kellner.png 338w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7391" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Douglas A. Kellner</em></p></div>
<p>Kellner and Umane knew they had no legal authority to shut down the election, but they felt they had no alternative.</p>
<p>“I conferred with the judges assigned to election duty in our office, but they said they had no authority, and it would have to be our decision. I thought that this was one of those decisions that would end my career if I got it wrong. How could an election commissioner decide to cancel an election?” Kellner said. “We issued the directive to have the staff inform our poll site coordinators to shut down their poll sites in an orderly manner and direct the poll workers to go home. I telephoned the executive director to inform him of our decision. A few minutes later, he telephoned the Queens Supreme Court justice assigned to rule on all cases arising in the mayoral primaries. The judge verbally agreed to close all the poll sites throughout the city. Remarkably, just two minutes later we saw on national television the report that New York City had cancelled the primary election.”</p>
<p>Wilkey meanwhile was working the phones to Albany to both the governor’s office and the state board of elections office in an effort to get all polls closed that day and the election postponed. Gov. George Pataki eventually called a halt to voting that day.</p>
<p>According to Kellner, the debate over holding the replacement primary began even while the fires were still burning downtown.</p>
<p>“I emphasized that it was important for our democracy to reschedule the primary as soon as practically possible,” Kellner said. “A couple of days later, a special session of the State Legislature cancelled all votes cast on September 11 and reset the primary for September 25. They enacted special absentee ballot provisions to accommodate voters who lived in the downtown New York quarantine zone.”</p>
<p>A new election was scheduled for September 25 with a runoff on October 10.</p>
<p>“Watching the whole operation come together was amazing,” Wilkey said. “Not only were they [BOE staff] numbed by what had happened, but they had to immediately go to work and do this all over again. From my point of view, it was incredible and heroic.”</p>
<p>In short order, all the lever voting machines that survived that day — one polling place near Ground Zero suffered significant damage and one of those voting machines is now on display at the<a href="https://www.911memorial.org/"> 9/11 Memorial and Museum</a> — were returned, reset and prepared for the new election.</p>
<p>Kellner, said it was a herculean task for the board of elections to prepare for the new election during that short window. The board’s main office was in the quarantine zone and moved to a makeshift office under the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p>A larger task facing the board of elections than the recalibration and quick redistribution was the fact that the firm that printed the poll books was located in the World Trade Center and the voter database records were lost. According to Kellner, it took a major effort to recover the backup from its Iron Mountain storage site and to print and distribute new books in time.</p>
<div id="attachment_7392" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7392" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7392" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wilkey-300x298.png" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wilkey-300x298.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wilkey-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wilkey.png 342w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7392" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Thomas Wilkey</em></p></div>
<p>Additionally, the board of elections had to find replacements for poll sites taken over by emergency uses, those sites served about 100,000 Manhattan voters.</p>
<p>“We had a particularly difficult time arranging new poll sites for Greenwich Village; we had to close a street and erect tents for a poll site with 10,000 assigned voters,” Kellner said. “The police reported to us that there were credible threats of terrorist attacks at several poll sites located in major buildings. Everyone was on edge, but staff working non-stop for those two weeks were able to manage the logistics for the replacement primary. It was a major step to prove that New York could recover from the horrible tragedy.”</p>
<p>As if all this wasn’t enough the board of elections had to do most of this without their director. Daniel DeFrancesco, the board’s executive director at the time required surgery that could not be delayed.</p>
<p>“’Tom, I’ve got a problem. I talked to my doctor and postponing the surgery is not an option,’” Wilkey recalls DeFrancesco saying to him on September 12. Wilkey agreed to stay in the city and help as much as he could with preparations. Wilkey said the times he had to go down to the office or near Ground Zero were particularly emotional because at one point, the State Board had offices on the 33rd Floor of the South Tower and Wilkey was very familiar with the building and knew many people who worked there.</p>
<p>“I remember going back the following Monday or Tuesday  [to the city board of elections office] and getting into that area you had to go through all kinds of security and when you got down there it looked like a war zone,” Wilkey said. “And you got out of the car, the air was still thick, still smoke from the debris, it was overpowering and you just stood there and looked. And then to get down there on the day of the runoff, they took groups of us down but it was like, oh my god, this once glorious building and all of the people….”</p>
<p>Wilkey said he fielded calls from elections officials all over the country with offers of help, but ultimately it was the NYCBOE staff that pulled off the election and runoff.</p>
<p>‘That office gets criticized for a lot of things,” Wilkey said. “Things are gonna happen and mistakes are gonna be made and I’ve seen them now through three separate crises [September 11, Super Storm Sandy, the pandemic] and they had to go in and put on an election, and I think sometimes those heroic efforts get overlooked and they need to be honored and congratulated.”</p>

The<a href="https://eoldn.org/"> Election Official Legal Defense Network</a> (EOLDN) connects licensed, qualified, pro bono attorneys with election administrators who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/08/1034811510/election-workers-are-under-attack-a-group-of-lawyers-plans-to-defend-them">need advice or assistance in the face of threatened prosecutions or physical threats</a>. Election workers from all over the country, at the state and local level, can contact EOLDN over the internet or by phone at any time, to request to be connected to a lawyer who can help them, at no cost. This service is available regardless of the election official’s political affiliation, or whether they work in a blue or red state or county. ​​”Election officials face an increasing wave of state laws subjecting them to criminal penalties for performing their professional duties, while at the same time facing threats of violence to themselves and their families,” CEIR Executive Director David Becker, and Bob Baur and Ben Ginsberg, co-chairs of EOLDN, said in a statement  This comes in the wake of the 2020 election and its aftermath, despite that election being the most secure and transparent election in American history, with record turnout, during a global pandemic. These attacks on election officials, the referees in democracy, must be fought and election officials need to know they are not alone. The Election Officials Legal Defense Network will provide these public servants with the advice and protection they need, at no cost.”</p>

Jon Bell Edwards to<a href="https://www.nola.com/gambit/news/clancy_dubos/article_b3ce548a-0fdd-11ec-987d-6fce220f4d4b.html"> delay the state’s fall elections in the wake of Hurricane Ida</a>. Ardoin <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_3d349ef8-10d5-11ec-a37f-27340693ba1a.html">asked Bell to move the primary</a> to November 13, which was the original runoff date for the October 9 election. Ardoin said the runoff should now be December 11. “A number of issues stemming from Hurricane Ida’s devastation, including questions about nursing home operations, postal service delivery, extensive power outages, polling location damages, and election commissioners and staff members still displaced, would make holding the election on its original dates virtually impossible without impairing the integrity of the election,” Ardoin said. Along with election day voting, early voting dates also will be pushed back. If past protocols are followed, and if the new primary date is Nov. 13, the new dates for early voting in the primary will be Oct. 30-Nov. 6, except for Sunday, Oct. 31. “The situation is a mess,” long-time Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court Jon Gegenheimer told Gambit, adding that he had recently asked Ardoin to recommend the delay. “We have more than a thousand poll commissioners scattered about, some with destroyed homes, and Lafitte and Grand Isle are just about destroyed.” Ardoin made his recommendation based on assessments conducted by local clerks of court, many of whom have seen their parishes devastated by the storm. During a federally declared emergency, Edwards has the authority to change the election date, in consultation with legislative leaders. Silas Lee, a sociology professor at Xavier University said postponing the election makes sense. “People are traumatized,” Lee says. “They’re focused on trying to rebuild their lives. There’s also a lot of displacement. When people leave their homes, which offer emotional and physical security, and their lives are disrupted by a sudden catastrophic disaster such as this, it causes what psychologists call ‘collective stress.’ It’s very intense. “In south and southeast Louisiana, they’re not focused on elections. They’re trying to regain their social footing. Many don’t even feel human right now. They’re challenged by the stress of living and trying to get services back. Everything is disrupted. It’s even more of a challenge because we have a natural disaster on top of Covid, which is still very much a factor. No word yet on whether or not Ida’s destruction will also impact November elections in New Jersey and New York City.</p>

According to the publication, analysis of recently released election data shows that some whiter, wealthier neighborhoods were more likely to employ the new ranking system than lower income areas of the city, many of which are home to Black, Latino and Asian communities. And voters in the south Bronx had a higher incidence of ballot mistakes, which invalidated some of their picks. Taken together, the data suggests a largely successful but uneven rollout of the new practice, which was pushed by the de Blasio administration and good government groups and influenced by the candidates themselves — some of whom likely swayed the behavior of their supporters. Overall, the vast majority of voters who weighed in on the Democratic nominees for mayor and comptroller filled out their ballots without incident. In most districts, less than 2 percent of ballots contained an error in which the voter tried to rank multiple candidates as one selection, which would have invalidated that particular ranking.  But several neighborhoods in the South Bronx had a slightly higher share of erroneous ballots, and many overlapped with lower usage of ranked-choice voting.</p>

The state Assembly voted to do that months ago. But because the Senate made some changes to the proposal, the Assembly must vote on it one more time before sending it to Newsom, who will decide whether to sign it into law. Republicans opposed the bill citing a recent incident in Los Angeles County where a man was found sleeping in his car with 300 unopened ballots for the Sept. 14 recall. California&#8217;s state government does not print and mail ballots. That job falls to the state&#8217;s 58 county governments, which vary in size and funding. Since most of the state&#8217;s more than 22 million registered voters already vote by mail, this bill — if it becomes law — would require an additional 2.3 million ballots to be mailed for statewide elections.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3942" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TexasCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Texas:</strong> Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/01/texas-voting-bill-greg-abbott/"> signed SB1 into law</a>. SB 1 is set to take effect three months after the special legislative session, in time for the 2022 primary elections. While SB 1 makes some changes that could expand access — namely increasing early voting hours in smaller, mostly Republican counties — the new law otherwise restricts how and when voters cast ballots. It specifically targets voting initiatives used by diverse, Democratic Harris County, the state’s most populous, by banning overnight early voting hours and drive-thru voting — both of which proved popular among voters of color last year. The new law also will ratchet up voting-by-mail rules in a state where the option is already significantly limited, give partisan poll watchers increased autonomy inside polling places by granting them free movement, and set new rules — and criminal penalties — for voter assistance. It also makes it a state jail felony for local election officials to proactively distribute applications for mail-in ballots, even if they are providing them to voters who automatically qualify to vote by mail or groups helping get out the vote.</p>
<p>In the waning hours of the second special legislative session, by a 17-14 vote the Senate approved<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/02/texas-elections-audits/"> Senate Bill 97</a> that would create a new county-level auditing process for elections and give all state or county party officials the ability to trigger mandatory reviews. It was filed by state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, who has acknowledged the Senate is “operating a little bit at warp speed” to move the legislation in the waning days of the special legislative session. The House never considered it, as time ran out on the special legislative session.</p>

The committee will not sponsor it during the upcoming session, but an individual lawmaker could sponsor it; Voted 11-2 to introduce a bill that would<a href="http://www.buffalobulletin.com/news/article_eff7a13e-0cc0-11ec-bf79-8f2a1cacfe29.html"> give county clerks more time to process absentee ballots</a> before Election Day; and Advanced two bills related to creating runoff elections to the committee’s next meeting, where members will decide whether it will get committee sponsorship. The draft bill would give county clerks more time to process absentee ballots before an election, allowing them to count absentee ballots beginning on the Thursday or Friday before Election Day, if needed. The votes still would not be made public in any way and would not be incorporated into the total vote count until after polls close on Election Day. Additionally, by a 7-6 vote, the committee voted to advance a bill shift the state’s elections to a<a href="https://www.wyofile.com/lawmakers-advance-runoff-election-legislation/"> runoff system</a>, but not a ranked choice system.</p>

The plaintiffs in the case argued that had they moved to a foreign country they would have retained their right to vote in U.S. elections, but because they moved to non-state territories, they were wrongfully denied that right. The lawsuit was originally filed on behalf of Air Force veteran Randall Jay Reeves, who moved to Guam in 1996 to work for the Federal Aviation Administration, but lost his ability to vote after being transferred to Hawaii in 2002 before going back to Guam. Another plaintiff, Vicente “Ben” Borja, a Navy veteran who is now the lead plaintiff in the case, lived in Hawaii before moving to Guam in accordance with his wife’s dying wishes. The plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in October 2020 to challenge Hawaii’s Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act, or UOCAVA, enacted in 1986, which they claim violates their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the Constitution. The complaint notes that even citizens who have never set foot on U.S. soil are eligible to vote, yet former Hawaii residents who move to Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands or American Samoa, all legally considered U.S. territory, must currently forfeit that right. The defendants, which includes the federal government and Hawaii&#8217;s chief election officer, twice sought to have the case dismissed, claiming the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution</p>

A divided three-judge panel said about 12 days ago that these people should be able to vote, and it issued a court order to that effect, opening the door for people in that situation to register. With Friday&#8217;s decision from the Court of Appeals, the state&#8217;s prohibition against felons voting until they have completed their entire sentence remains in place while the lawsuit runs its course. Plaintiffs in the case quickly asked the state Supreme Court to reverse the reversal, filing Friday afternoon for an immediate temporary stay. &#8220;Unless this court acts, over 56,000 people who have already been told they can legally vote will be disenfranchised, and the administration of North Carolina&#8217;s upcoming municipal elections will be thrown into confusion,&#8221; attorneys said in their filing. Here&#8217;s the status for now, and going forward unless the N.C. Supreme Court acts: People who have completely finished a felony sentence, including paying fines and finishing any supervised release, can vote in North Carolina, as has been the case for decades. People who have finished their active sentence, but are still on probation or still owe money, cannot vote.</p>

The lawsuits claim the legislation violates a broad range of federal laws — the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 — and the First, 14th and 15th Amendments. “Egregiously, SB 1 takes particular aim at voters with disabilities, voters with limited English proficiency — who, in Texas, are also overwhelmingly voters of color — and the organizations that represent, assist, and support these voters,” the plaintiffs in the Austin lawsuit wrote in their complaint. The plaintiffs in the San Antonio lawsuit, which includes Harris County, also raise claims that lawmakers intentionally discriminated against voters of color in pushing the legislation. The plaintiffs attack head on the lack of evidence that fraud is a widespread problem in Texas elections. In the San Antonio lawsuit, they argue SB 1’s “additional burdens and restrictions” cannot be justified by invoking “unspecified and unproven voter fraud” when there is no proof that it occurs “beyond the very few examples already identified through Texas’s pre-existing processes and procedures.” “Rather … SB1 is a reaction to Texas’s changing electorate, which is now more racially diverse and younger than ever before,” they wrote in their complaint. The<a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2021/09/07/texas-faces-three-lawsuits-against-restrictive-new-voting-law-signed-tuesday-by-gov-greg-abbott"> League of United American Citizens has also filed suit</a> against the law in U.S. District Court in Austin. &#8220;LULAC strongly opposes this attack on our voting rights and freedoms because they have one and only one purpose: to dilute our voice at the ballot box and continue to stop electoral change in Texas,” LULAC National President Domingo Garcia said in an emailed statement. “Texas voters deserve fair, open, and transparent elections, not a process rigged to deny our communities, whose numbers are growing, the right to vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal has upheld a lower court ruling that the state is on the hook<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/03/texas-voter-id-lawsuit/"> for $6.8M in legal fees</a> — the last vestige of the legal battle over the 2011 restrictions the state set on what forms of photo identification are accepted at the polls. The Texas attorney general’s office had appealed that lower court ruling, which found the plaintiffs in the litigation — Democratic U.S. Rep.<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/marc-veasey/"> Marc Veasey</a> of Fort Worth, individual voters, voting and civil rights groups, the NAACP-Texas and the Texas House’s Mexican American Legislative Caucus, among others — were the “prevailing parties.” “It seems obvious that they are,” the 5th Circuit judges wrote Friday. “Plaintiffs successfully challenged the Texas photo ID requirement before our en banc court, and used that victory to secure a court order permanently preventing its enforcement during the elections in 2016 and 2017.” “The State of Texas obviously cannot go back in time and re-run the 2016 and 2017 elections under a photo ID requirement,” the 5th Circuit judges wrote in their Friday ruling.</p>
