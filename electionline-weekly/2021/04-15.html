</strong><em>CISA works to get election website to move to .GOV domain</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6599" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While the 2020 election may have been the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election"> most secure election</a> in our nation’s history, mis/disinformation leading up to November 3, 2020 and most certainly in the days and weeks that followed has plagued elections officials.</p>
<p>“Election officials continue to face an uphill battle of misinformation being spread about elections and voting,” said Trish Robertson, public relations officer for the<a href="https://www.colliervotes.gov/"> Collier County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Office</a>.</p>
<p>But the county has made a change that it hopes will help elections officials and voters alike.</p>
<p>“By changing our website to CollierVotes.gov, we hope voters will be confident in using our website knowing that the .gov means it belongs to an official government organization in the United States,” Robertson said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5130 alignright" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />With the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA)<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/03/08/cisa-announces-transfer-gov-top-level-domain-us-general-services-administration"> taking over responsibility for the TLD program</a> under the DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2020, the agency is looking to support election offices and understand where it can ease their transition and get more sites migrated to the .GOV domain.</p>
<p>Because only US-based government organization can obtain a .GOV domain, using one shows you’re official. Anyone, malicious actors included, can get a .COM, .NET, .ORG, or .US domain.</p>
<p>“The public turns to election officials as the trusted source of information for their elections. The .GOV top level domain perfectly supports that trusted role,” explained Geoff Hale, director of CISA’s Election Security Initiative. “Increasing the public’s expectation that government information is at .GOV will make it harder for malicious actors to succeed when they attempt to impersonate governments. .gov also has technical benefits to using .gov over other TLDs, like mandatory two-factor authentication on the .gov registrar and notifications of DNS changes to administrators.”</p>
<p>In September 2020,<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/executive-perspectives/us-county-election-websites-still-fail-to-fulfill-basic-security-measures/"> cybersecurity firm McAfee</a> found that a majority of county election websites in all 50 states — 80.2 percent — lacked the .GOV validation that confirmed they were an official government site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-6848 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DOTGOV-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DOTGOV-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DOTGOV-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DOTGOV-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DOTGOV.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While moving to the .GOV top level domain has been a key security topic promoted throughout the election community as November 3 approached, only 16.4% of U.S. county election websites implemented U.S. government .GOV validation and HTTPS encryption.</p>
<p>Those numbers have improved slightly since September considering that  there are still only 6400 registered .GOV addresses nationwide there is plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>“In an Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council (GCC) meeting in February, members held a fruitful discussion between secretaries of states and local election officials on their interest in the .GOV, as well as some of the hurdles that they may face,” said Geoff Hale,. “Many described their experience, from local supervisors of elections in Florida proactively pursuing these safeguards, to Secretaries’ varied approaches, directing action or reimbursing the changes.</p>
<p>.GOV operates differently than other domain name registries in that it’s not first-come-first-serve. Municipalities can only get domain names that are associated with their geographic boundaries. The transition from an existing domain name to another is a technical exercise that often requires renaming files and changing links, but it’s also a branding and marketing exercise.</p>
<p>“While the burden of that effort will largely remain on registrants, CISA plans to create and maintain a transition guide to help governments think through that transition and aid their business cases in making the move. The DOTGOV Act does contemplate the use of Homeland Security Grants for “migrating any online service” to .GOV, a process we will work out with FEMA,” Hale said.</p>
<p>Hale noted that local election officials have raised concerns around branding – many voters and stakeholders are familiar with the current domains.</p>
<p>“As part of CISA’s transition guide, we’ll make sure to encourage redirects from an old site to a new .GOV address. We’re also interested in supporting government organizations who have built up some brand equity in the former domain name so they can obtain an equivalent .GOV domain,” Hale said.</p>
<p>The DOTGOV Act reports Congress’ finding that “the .gov internet domain should be available at no cost or a negligible cost” to U.S.-based government organizations. According to Hale, CISA is working on this. The way .GOV domains are priced is tied closely with the service contract to operate the TLD, and change in the price of a domain is not expected until next year. The Act also contemplates the use of Homeland Security Grants for “migrating any online service” to .gov, a process we will work out with FEMA.</p>
<p>According to Kristen Muthig, director of communications for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, HAVA funds can be used for the process of transitioning to a .GOV address. Muthig noted that the funds can cover any cost associated with making that transition.</p>
<p>In 2019, as part of an<a href="https://www.ohiosos.gov/globalassets/elections/directives/2019/dir2019-08.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=eb90cd294260aec10a04166d76996d7656a2d85f-1618414704-0-AdwWc9rqft7lgq7Mm1RARIDIAL4RFpREWZdXj_3bpUJZ-SFIc66cWM6Ly-Lgr6gfru577igKJugGSR5txlb4ExfagjYRY91KIdAeZzIKqQpzCiVT6DTwHZZpVKLoOJXJn3YAR-UkxNTdpSVq6HXAMltRGtZiAFSL_Y0Kf7CJQhmKR1hX5SOUluETzIxvGMHrSEAsmDYy1q4EfE0wkyldScxjvNLj4LqBlvLQm6uW2w13UoQP7etwjJEayBX-gjoMHe_B0NYOFBWFPm7nXh_6pgU2-SIPsObl_HehoCXIF-Wl2WspgB9_GBC-vwtbEz3mpAg0E_QBXT_L1VUwUNIz5d6YuV6fcXyhtqasmoWYN9pzRfHHJXt2g8M0KzdQ47gopL6js36YGPMpV8LW1GjYtgkpnjdXq4VODtIBZpBbQni96OwQaXkS0wGxjKGqn2KB--XsRbamvUTsps3qRCP63N5pWY6AOdIdcsWvF6TxNtjuSYgQ_OypsnTmPnnbcq7NwQ"> election security directive</a> to county boards of elections,<a href="https://www.ohiosos.gov/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=2bc9b5712ea414991e02dedc3bb30a06efeac7f5-1618431957-0-AUbThgIZ2Rtg3iapPHXMRQMa0dhnZkca5ZAzgUwpYdT0gNdGHnuMWEycheu8oSNBs2wUSCoeO7b2J3MuaiX9lUmVDBjPMpwI9sxpLSxdLsbnlUwHCZ0rUhv8zQbMbdCaNWplGzxJxcvhcTJMr3d2lR25sAHVNkshy6gM2vs3VhD8Sf15lMcekIzVr8GXvviR7Qodq8EtsNcmQNHcjjTpy2qovUJKx1cdVjsj4rOU8eakz36cYp8zyHMvVuBw2EYa6ggoHWd-h8o14q_a7CQI9D8ir0K6ZbRSRe7XBegVuS8_ooqAYS2h2AtPsJiLJv7nyphukX-IqnWMgmfmhF1RDwTvvYGke4ZY-lSIY4NQUkqRUAIC790Fk211Aos4hAMAj3zIPMRZNz3NF-ppBiLdve9tGl6_P9yIXpJ_1SD-aFN3t0QUTD13IEMI90g114wvXw"> Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose</a> mandated that all counties elections offices move to a .gov (or .us) address and no county business could be conducted on any email accounts other than .gov or .us. All 88 county boards of elections had moved to .gov by the end of 2020. According to Rob Nichols, spokesman for the secretary of state’s office, the office allocated $50,000 per county in cybersecurity grant money for .gov (among other things), and worked with individual boards of elections, helping them with technical assistance and support as needed.</p>
<p>In 2020<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2020_03_12.html"> Iowa Secretary of State</a> Paul Pate pledged $1 million to help Iowa counties move to a .GOV web address using HAVA fund.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4531" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vote.Screen.Image_-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vote.Screen.Image_-300x203.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vote.Screen.Image_-768x520.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vote.Screen.Image_-1024x694.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Of course, the transition to a .GOV address isn’t always up the county’s elections office but may rely on  a countywide IT infrastructure. Hale said CISA is working with its partners in the GCC (i.e., NACo, iGo, etc.) and other election stakeholder partnerships (i.e., NCSL, NGA, NASCIO, etc.) to develop resources that will seek to address concerns like this of election officials, particularly the small and midsized jurisdictions that may need additional assistance.</p>
<p>Oh, and for all you Hamiltons, Montgomerys, Washingtons and Fayettes out there that have web addresses to make you stand out from all the rest, don’t worry, CISA has this under control.</p>
<p>“Because determining who gets ‘springfield.gov’ can be a fraught process, CISA will, like GSA before us, maintain rules around who gets which domain names,” Hale said. “Though each request is reviewed for alignment with those rules, there’s also an e<a href="https://home.dotgov.gov/registration/requirements/#city-and-county-exception-requests">xception process</a> that CISA will maintain.”</p>
<p><strong>One County’s Experience</strong><br />
Collier County, Florida recently went through the switch from a .COM to a .GOV address and has some advice to offer from their experiences.</p>
<p>“It starts with an application and then a lot of verification with Jennifer Edwards, our Supervisor of Elections, and other points of contact registered to the new domain,” Robertson explained of the process. “Once approved, there is a second tier of verification which was conducted with our IT staff and then we finally were able to make the switch. From start to finish it took us about two weeks before we were able to have the .gov website up and running.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6849" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-11.52.30-AM-1024x173.png" alt="" width="640" height="108" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-11.52.30-AM-1024x173.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-11.52.30-AM-300x51.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-11.52.30-AM-768x130.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-11.52.30-AM.png 1526w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Collier County is taking this opportunity to make some other changes as well such as updating elections email addresses to the .GOV domain and working on a new design for their website. Because they are implementing three changes, they’ve decided to conduct their public education campaign in stages. Robertson explained the stages:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Building our search engine optimization and making internal updates; this includes making our staff, vendors and community partners aware of the change so they can update their bookmarks to our new web address and update their contact information for our staff.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> (currently completing): Updating materials; this includes new business cards, updating our social media platforms and linked text on our website; recreating outreach materials, etc.  We have a shared document that each department has been adding to ensuring nothing gets missed. Everything from our voicemail to the logo on our office’s vehicle has to be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Official roll out in June; once our new website design is completed, we will set a deadline where everything that has our old information will be stopped for distribution. The good news is that coming off an election cycle, our outreach department is in a decent spot for reordering supplies. Things that we do have left over (pens/tote bags) we plan to donate to local nonprofits. We then plan to distribute a press release and launched promoted social media posts and possibly some printed materials if needed.</p>
<p>For those county elections offices considering the move to .GOV Robertson has three pieces of advice.</p>
<p>“Research how this experience went with other counties. Be patient. Get your staff involved – on the surface this seems like just a small website change (literally three letters being changed), but it will affect everything and everyone,” Robertson said. “By getting the entire team involved, it will help with efficiency and creative solutions when they are needed (e.g. what do we do with 1,500 pens that have our old website on them?!?).”</p>

<em>12 recommendations highlight tangible steps</em></p>

<p>Entitled<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/voting-experience-2020/"> Improving the Voting Experience After 2020</a>, these 12 recommendations highlight the tangible steps states and local jurisdictions must take to provide the accessible and secure election ecosystem that Americans expect. The pandemic ushered in a burst of election administration transformation borne of necessity. Long-term, sustainable election rules only work when they incorporate the unique perspectives and expertise of election administrators representing voters across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>“The 2020 election showed us just how fortunate American voters are to have dedicated election professionals securing their right to vote,” said Matthew Weil, director of BPC’s Election Project. “This task force report builds on the lessons learned in 2020 to develop forward thinking reforms that increase access and transparency across the country.”</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center launched the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"> Task Force</a> on Elections in February 2019. It is comprised of a geographically and politically diverse group of state and local election officials devoted to making meaningful improvements to United States elections. Members were selected for a variety of reasons to aid in this goal; among them are the partisan preferences of the jurisdictions they serve, the region of the country in which they live, and their perspective on election administration from either the state or local level.

Businesses included Amazon, Netflix and Starbucks. Individuals that signed on included Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and music star Ariana Grande. Law firms and nonprofits also signed the statement. According to The New York Times, the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/ceos-corporate-america-voting-rights.html"> statement was organized</a> in recent days by Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express, and Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck. A copy appeared on Wednesday in advertisements in The New York Times and The Washington Post. The statement does not address specific election legislation in states, and Mr. Chenault told The New York Times there was no expectation for companies to oppose individual bills. “We are not being prescriptive,” he said. “There is no one answer.”</p>

Hankins is being replaced by Matt Finfgeld, her son. &#8220;Most families, when they have their dinner discussions, they talk about sports or news or something,” Hankins told the Richland Source. “We talk about politics and elections.” Finfgeld was the unanimous choice by the bipartisan elections board earlier this month to replace Hankins, who is leaving the department after 38 years, the last 26 as director. Finfgeld has worked part-time for the local elections board since 1992 in a variety of roles. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even imagine training a person coming in off the streets to run an elections board,&#8221; Hankins said. &#8220;I just can&#8217;t imagine a person with no experience trying to do this job.&#8221; Finfgeld, who started his tenure loading and unloading election equipment, has trained poll workers, acquired new polling locations, tested voting machines prior to each election and been a rover, traveling to voting sites to ensure things run smoothly. Hankins had originally planned to retire in 2020, but COVID kept her on the job and now she’s ready to relax. Hankins has made it clear to her replacement that she has no plans to work the polls going forward, including the upcoming May 4 primary election. &#8220;Let someone younger do it,&#8221; she said with a laugh.</p>

The measure, unanimously approved last week was proposed by Mayor John Dailey. Dailey said he has been watching “voter suppression” efforts in other states and approving a paid holiday for municipal employees is a chance for Tallahassee to lead an effort to expand rights. “In our country, voting is a right. It is a human right,” he told the Tallahassee Democrat. “I think we have the opportunity to set the example.” The city commission action would cost roughly $67,000 during an election year due to employee overtime for areas where certain employees cannot take time off, such as fire, police and utility workers.</p>

Doug Ducey (R) signed legislation banning the use of<a href="https://www.yourvalley.net/stories/arizona-governor-signs-bill-banning-private-election-grants,225492"> private funding</a> for elections but said the money the state received last year from organizations with funding from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s foundation was helpful and used with &#8220;integrity.” But the governor said election officials should not be forced to rely on private grants for voter outreach, staffing or other expenses in the future. While he said nothing in the new law should be interpreted as a sign the state is unappreciative, the bill is needed to preserve the integrity of and voter confidence in elections. “With public confidence in our elections in peril, it&#8217;s clear our elections must be pristine and above reproach — and the sole purview of government,” Ducey said in a signing letter. Republicans who control the Legislature voted for the measure, with some questioning how county officials used the money. Democrats warned the measure could starve election offices of the funds needed to run secure and efficient elections because lawmakers consistently underfund state and county elections operations.</p>
<p>Ducey vetoed a bill that would have given the secretary of state control of an<a href="https://www.titusvilleherald.com/news/state_news/article_87aa9373-db99-5d13-b553-12bad5f893d7.html"> online voter registration system</a> that is currently managed by the Arizona Department of Transportation. In explaining his first veto of the year, Ducey said Arizonans recognize and appreciate the website developed by ADOT, and transferring control to the state’s top election official would remove checks and balances from the system. The bill would have taken affect in 2023, after the end of Democrat Katie Hobbs’ term as secretary of state. Hobbs supported<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/75139"> HB2360</a>, which was sponsored by Republican Rep. John Kavanagh. The measure would have required Hobbs&#8217; successor to work with a committee of county recorders to run the website.</p>

Ken Hammer (R-Benton) targets the volunteer groups of young people who traveled among polling places last November with boxes of<a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2021/04/12/giving-snacks-water-to-arkansas-voters-outlawed-under-bill-now-headed-for-final-approval"> bottled water and chips</a>. Hammer said candidates cannot go within 100 feet of polling locations, and other groups shouldn’t be allowed to, either. He suggested t-shirts worn by these refreshment fairies might be political in nature and aimed at influencing votes. The<a href="https://www.ky3.com/2021/04/14/arkansas-lawmakers-approve-changes-to-states-election-laws/"> full House</a> approved the bill 74-23.</p>
<p>A bill that would implement stricter scrutiny of<a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/post/bill-amending-absentee-ballot-processes-arkansas-passes-legislature"> absentee voting applications</a> in Arkansas has received final legislative approval and is heading to the governor&#8217;s desk. The Senate, by a vote of 27-8 on Tuesday, passed <a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1715.pdf">House Bill 1715</a>. It would change several aspects of absentee voting in the state, including banning county clerks or other designated election officials from distributing absentee ballot applications or ballots to voters who had not requested them. The bill would also require the creation and approval of a uniform voter statement by the State Board of Election Commissioners. Another part of the legislation would require election officials to verify the signatures of a voter’s absentee ballot application with their voter registration application. If the signatures do not match, an absentee ballot would not be mailed.</p>
<p>SB 485 a bill that would eliminate<a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/post/bill-eliminating-early-voting-day-election-again-fails-committee"> early voting</a> in Arkansas on the Monday before an Election Day has failed in a Senate committee for a second time. During a voice vote, members of the Senate State Agencies &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee did not have enough yes votes to advance<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FSB485.pdf"> Senate Bill 485</a>. It would eliminate all early voting in Arkansas on the day before both a preferential primary or general election day. Though the bill failed again, the chair of the committee, Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, said the bill’s sponsor could bring the bill back to the committee in another attempt to pass it.</p>
<p>The Senate State Agencies &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee oted to advance<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1517.pdf"> House Bill 1517</a>, which would allow for<a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/post/bill-eliminating-early-voting-day-election-again-fails-committee"> online voter registration</a> in Arkansas. The bill would create the &#8220;Voter Integrity and Voter Registration Modernization Act of 2021,&#8221; requiring the Secretary of State to prepare and administer electronic voter registration application forms. The system would be available to users for free. In order to be eligible to vote, the online registration must be completed at least 30 days before the date of the election. Applicants would be required to provide a current valid driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number.</p>
<p>Other bills still moving through the Legislature include: SB 556 to allow the takeover of Arkansas election in cities of populations over 50,000 by the state Election Commission for undefined emergency reasons. SB 557 to transfer supervision of elections from full-time, trained county employees to partisan, part-time election commissioners. SB 644 to establish a legislative committee with investigative powers into local elections, and further shifts authority from local officials to state legislators with a personal stake in the election outcomes. HB 1112, now Act 249, that eliminates the voter ID verification statement option for voting, for those without current photo ID.</p>

The legislation will create an AVR system in which adults who have provided proof of U.S. citizenship during a DMV transaction will have their information provided automatically to the Secretary of State. Citizens who do not wish to register to vote may opt-out.  California began modernizing the voter registration system in 2018 with upgrades that expanded voter registration through an opt-in system. SB 583 will expand voter registration by developing and deploying an automated process for registering eligible voters through the DMV, while also providing enhanced protections for people who are ineligible to register.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> A<a href="https://news.wfsu.org/state-news/2021-04-09/vote-by-mail-proposal-gets-an-overhaul-in-the-florida-house"> controversial elections bill</a> focused largely on the state’s vote-by-mail process underwent an overhaul in the Florida House, but critics say it still poses unnecessary barriers to voters. The revamped proposal, which addresses issues such as the use of mail-in ballot drop boxes and signature verification, relaxes some restrictions included in an earlier version of the bill. Under the proposal approved Thursday by the House Appropriations Committee, supervisors could continue to use drop boxes at their offices if they are “continuously monitored in person” during regular office hours. Those drop boxes could be made available after hours only if they are “secured from tampering and monitored by video surveillance.” Copies of the videos would have to be provided to candidates or political parties within 24 hours of requests. The House plan (HB 7041) would allow drop boxes to be used at other locations, but only during early voting hours. The boxes would have to be staffed by supervisors’ employees. The measure, sponsored by Spring Hill Republican Blaise Ingoglia, also would require supervisors of elections to designate drop boxes at least 30 days before elections and prohibit officials from changing or moving the boxes after they’ve been designated. Contents of the boxes would have to be emptied and returned to supervisors’ offices daily. Voters who want to submit ballots at drop boxes would have to show proof of identification or sign an “attestation” saying they did not have identification with them. The revised House bill would subject supervisors to a $25,000 civil penalty if drop boxes are available when early voting is not underway.</p>
<p>The Senate Rules Committee<a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-nsf-florida-election-law-changes-20210414-ui2e6346kjf73ni53uhtutvapq-story.html"> debated, but did not vote on SB90</a> this week. The bill (<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/90">SB 90</a>) would, among other things, curtail elections supervisors’ use of ballot drop boxes; change the process for verifying mail-in ballot signatures; and make it more difficult for voters to change registrations. The plan could also have an impact on hundreds of thousands of Floridians who registered to vote when they received their driver’s licenses or state identification cards. Senate sponsor Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, argued the changes are needed to protect against vote-by-mail fraud but acknowledged that Florida’s elections last year ran smoothly and that no evidence of fraud exists. But Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley told the committee that several provisions in Baxley’s bill are problematic, including a section that addresses the duplication of mail-in ballots that are damaged or unreadable by tabulation equipment. Under the proposal, elections supervisors would be required to allow observers “to stand in close enough proximity to observe the duplication of ballots in such a way that the observer is able to see the marking on each ballot and the duplication taking place.” But Earley said the provision raised serious concerns for the Florida Elections Supervisors association because of space issues and because it could allow dozens of people to be close enough to see personal identifying information about a voters’ secret ballots. The provision “presents very grave security” issues, Earley said. But Baxley said supervisors will have to figure out a way to cope.</p>

The measure was approved with one lone vote against it. The bill now returns to the Senate and will likely head to conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate amendments. The most significant discrepancy between the two lies in specific language whether one would be required to opt into or opt out of registering to vote. Under the Senate’s proposal, a qualified applicant would automatically be registered to vote upon completion of the license/identification card application unless affirmatively declining registration; under the House’s proposal, one would not be registered to vote until they’ve made the choice to register.</p>

The measures were defeated on 8-5 votes, with majority Democrats on the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee united in opposition. All would have required a photo ID, but they differed in details such as the kinds of photo IDs that could be used. The three bills, which go to the full Legislature for votes later this year, come as Republican-controlled legislatures across the U.S. are pushing for changes to voting laws that critics say will strip or erode voting rights for minorities, the elderly and the impoverished. The committee also rejected an amendment to one of the bills that would have required voters to show an identification document acceptable as proof of residence for voter registration. This could include documents that do not bear a photo of the voter, such as a utility bill. A fourth bill, L.D. 1099, was rejected unanimously by the committee. It would not only require photo identification at the polls, but would also<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2021/04/14/bills-requiring-photo-id-for-maine-voters-poised-for-defeat-in-legislature/"> strip voting rights</a> from incarcerated Mainers.</p>

<p>The Senate voted down a bill  that would have restricted<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/bill-restricting-ballot-collection-voted-down-by-montana-senate/article_0b384acc-ba52-589c-8381-2328690a49fd.html"> absentee ballot collection</a>, with some Republicans joining Democrats who opposed the measure as creating an unnecessary barrier for mail-in voting.<a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20211&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=HB&amp;P_BILL_NO=406&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ="> House Bill 406</a> sought to outlaw a practice commonly used by get-out-the-vote groups, in which organizations submit mail-in ballots collected from voters. Under the measure, voters could have still let family members and legal guardians submit their ballots for them, but they would have been be required to enter their personal information into a state registry subject to public information laws. Sen. Bryce Bennett, D-Missoula, pointed out that an amendment added to the bill Friday by a Senate panel went further than just prohibiting get-out-the-vote groups from collecting voters’ ballots. Caregivers for voters with disabilities, limited mobility or medical problems would also be prohibited from turning in those ballots. “This bill is not just unconstitutional, as I’m sure the courts will find. It’s just cruel,” Bennett said. The bill failed on a 23-27 vote on second reading, with eight Republicans joining all 19 Democrats in voting against it.</p>

Gov. Chris Sununu signed the bill into law on Monday saying, while the state&#8217;s elections were safe and secure, the bill would get to the bottom of what happened in Windham during the November 2020 general election.  The bill allows for a full audit of New Hampshire&#8217;s AccuVote optical scanning machines, memory cards, ballots, and other evidence from the Windham election.</p>

Members of a county’s Board of Elections would determine the new location, which must be within the same municipality as it was originally located. “It is not fair for some New Jersey residents to have to trek miles to drop their ballot off while other residents have multiple boxes to choose from within just blocks of each other,” said Assemblyman Moen (D-Camden, Gloucester). “Rather than spending taxpayer money on entirely new boxes, this law will permit county boards of elections to better allocate the resources they already have. Allowing them to determine better locations for boxes that are unnecessarily close together will help give more voters equal access to these secure receptacles.”</p>

This is the state-level trial over the constitutionality of a 2018 voter ID law. There is also a separate lawsuit, over the same law, moving forward in federal courts. No elections have been held using voter ID since the law was passed in 2018; it was put on hold until this trial. The trial is expected to last multiple days. The first day  included opening arguments from both the plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of voter ID and the legislators who are defending it, and at least one witness for the plaintiffs. The trial is being livestreamed online, on the Wake County Superior Court page on YouTube, allowing anyone to watch. Unlike a normal trial, which has a single judge and usually a jury, this trial will have no jury and three judges. That’s how all constitutional cases are handled in North Carolina.</p>

There won&#8217;t be a ruling before the primary election on May 4 but Stark County Board of Election had hoped to buy the new voting machines in time for elections later this year. The elections board has until April 26 to file all its evidence and legal briefs. Stark County commissioners have until May 10 to file its briefs, then the BOE must respond by May 14. The Ohio Supreme court noted the clerk of court shall refuse to file any requests for a time extension. “Whether this case is heard quickly or on a normal timetable, we’re confident that the law and evidence support the position of the county commissioners. They have the ability and the duty to carefully review recommended expenditure to ensure taxpayers are getting the best value, The elections board filed the 69-page lawsuit in the Ohio Supreme Court, and a motion to expedite the case due to a &#8220;fast approaching election-related deadline of June 15, 2021.&#8221; The board is seeking an order from the Supreme Court directing county commissioners to acquire Dominion Voting Systems Image Cast X machines,” attorney Mark Weaver, who represents county commissioners, said.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-768x524.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wisconsin:</strong> The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that state election officials<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/09/wisconsin-supreme-court-keeps-thousands-voters-rolls/7145342002/"> do not have to quickly take people off the voter rolls</a> when they suspect they may have moved. The ruling means the Wisconsin Elections Commission will not force tens of thousands of people off the rolls near a major election, such as the 2022 contest for governor and U.S. Senate. The state law at the heart of the lawsuit over when to take voters off the rolls does not apply to the Elections Commission, the majority concluded.  &#8220;There is no credible argument that it does,&#8221; Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority. Joining Hagedorn in the majority were conservative Chief Justice Patience Roggensack and liberal Justices Rebecca Dallet, Jill Karofsky and Ann Walsh Bradley. The lawsuit over the voter rolls stretches back to 2019, when the bipartisan Elections Commission sent letters to about 232,000 voters who it believed might have moved. It asked them to register at a new address or confirm they had not moved. Three voters represented by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty filed the case, arguing the state had to immediately take the voters off the rolls. The court&#8217;s ruling will affect how the commission acts in such matters in the future and could allow election officials to continue to take a year and a half to decide when to take voters off the rolls.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/event/voting-rights-and-democracy-reform-states-and-hill">Voting Rights and Democracy Reform in the States and on the Hill</a>: With Georgia passing legislation to dramatically restrict voting access, and with similar legislation pending in other states, fundamental issues of voting and democracy are now front and center in Congress. A sweeping set of election reforms recently passed the House as H.R. 1 and are now before the Senate. The fate of these efforts, and the future of fundamental Senate procedures such as the legislative filibuster, could be decided in the weeks ahead. Join the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation as we convene advocates from the states and Capitol Hill to discuss what is at stake and the strategies being used in the fight for voting rights and democracy reform. Speakers include: Lisa Gilbert, Public Citizen; Wade Henderson, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Representative John Sarbanes, Maryland&#8217;s 3rd Congressional District; and Tova Wang (Moderator), Harvard Kennedy School. <strong>When:</strong> April 19 4pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

Despite concerns regarding COVID-19 and foreign interference, election officials from federal agencies with oversight over election security, national organizations, nonprofits, and vendors described the election as “the most secure in American history.” Following the first part of this election retrospective that focused on lessons learned from the 2020 elections, a panel of election officials and experts will discuss what comes next for election security policy. To break down what policymakers need to know to prepare for future elections, experts will discuss voter turnout, conducting elections during uncertainty, voting by mail, in-person voting, audits, misinformation, ballot access and equity, and cybersecurity. Presented in partnership with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) Committee on Science, Technology, and Law (CSTL).
