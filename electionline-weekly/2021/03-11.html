														<p><strong>What the new VVSG 2.0 means for state, local elections officials</strong><br />
<em>It will likely be years before effects are apparent in marketplace</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after a six-ish year process, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC)<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2021/02-11/#tab-2"> voted to approve</a> the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines"> Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</a> (VVSG) 2.0.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6312" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The VVSG are a set of guidelines for voting systems, which the EAC has adopted to be the specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if a system can obtain EAC certification. VVSG 2.0 is the third iteration of the guidelines since they were first approved in 2005.</p>
<p>According to the EAC, the VVSG 2.0 represents a significant advancement in defining guidelines that will serve as the cornerstone of the next generation of voting systems. It lays the groundwork for 21st century voting systems that are desperately needed with improved cybersecurity, accessibility, and usability requirements. The VVSG 2.0 also supports various audit methods supporting software independence to confirm the accuracy of the vote and increase voter confidence.</p>
<p>This all sounds great, but what exactly does it mean for state and local elections officials, especially in the post-2020 world?</p>
<p>Eddie Perez, Global Director of Technology Development,<a href="https://www.osetfoundation.org/"> OSET Institute</a> said state and local elections officials need to be patient and moderate their expectations.</p>
<p>“It will likely be years before the effects of VVSG 2.0 are apparent in the marketplace, in terms of having new voting systems to buy,” Perez said. “…[W]hile the passage of newer, more modern requirements for auditability, accessibility, and security are an important step forward and beneficial to U.S. election administration, by themselves, they are not likely to produce overnight improvements in election officials’ concerns about the slow pace of technology change, costs, and relatively limited choices for voting technology.”</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps for Certification</strong><b><br />
</b>According to the EAC, the manual allows manufacturers to start certifying components incrementally to VVSG 2.0 while they work on making their full systems compliant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Much of this testing can be reused when they bring their full systems in for VVSG 2.0 certification and should reduce the complexity of testing required and amount of time a new system certification with no existing baseline might otherwise take,” said Mona Harrington, executive director of the EAC. “The EAC is committed to continuous review of the program to remove unnecessary friction points while improving the quality and integrity of certified systems.”</p>
<p>While manufacturers can submit minimal software changes (formerly known as de minimis changes), what counts as &#8220;minor&#8221; remains murky, experts said. It also remains unclear whether the EAC will allow manufacturers to patch or update existing certified systems, without additional EAC testing, when security patches or updates are available.</p>
<p>Because the VVSG 2.0 voting system standards and the testing and certification program that goes with it are both new, it will take even more time for manufacturers to do the research, development, and testing required to make new systems. Perez likened the process to turning a battleship.</p>
<p>“I predict that the very earliest that VVSG 2.0-compliant systems could exit federal certification and be ready for the (additional, sometimes long) state approval process will be 2023,” Perez said. “That’s an optimistic timeline, for more ambitious manufacturers. In terms of broad trends, I don’t think the U.S. will see many EAC- and state-certified 2.0 compliant systems actually purchased and deployed until probably 2025 and beyond. And I predict that the peak of the new “refresh cycle” across many states is likely to be in 2026 and 2027, before the 2028 Presidential Election.”</p>
<p>Perez thinks  that for manufacturers and election official buyers alike, 2025, after the Presidential Election, is likely to be the beginning of the “sweet spot.”</p>
<p>“The brave 2023 buyers or the early adopters in 2025 are likely to be closely watched by many election officials and they will pave the way for a more general refresh of voting technology across the country in 2026 or 2027, before the 2028 Presidential Election,” Perez said. “For many of those buyers, this means that about ten years will have elapsed since their last voting system purchase, in 2017 or so. This also means that voting systems designed to the new VVSG 2.0 standard are likely to still be in use in some jurisdictions around 2040 – two decades from now.”</p>
<p><strong>Implementation and Costs for Elections Officials</strong><b><br />
</b><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5129" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NH-Primary-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NH-Primary-300x195.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NH-Primary-768x500.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NH-Primary.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The passage of VVSG 2.0 does not have an immediate impact on the voting systems state and local elections officials are currently using. According to Perez, election officials are likely to face changes in the future if and only if their states choose to either decertify older systems or if states require EAC certification to the newest VVSG 2.0 requirements as a prerequisite for state approval.</p>
<p>Eventually jurisdictions are most likely going to need new equipment that meets these new standards. It is doubtful that any existing equipment will be compliant.</p>
<p>“It is unlikely that a jurisdiction’s current system could meet all requirements. Most voting system vendors participated in the VVSG working groups and have incorporated changes to meet some of the requirements, but it is unlikely that a jurisdiction’s current system – in its current configuration – could meet all requirements,” explained Ryan Macias, consultant/SME – Infrastructure Security &amp; Technology with RSM Election Solutions, LLC and former acting director of the EAC Testing and Certification Program.</p>
<p>Macias said election officials should speak with their voting system vendors to determine what it is going to take to bring their current systems into compliance with the requirements.</p>
<p>“I am sure all voting system vendors have, or will be, mapping their current configurations against the new requirements,” Macias said adding that hardware, and the firmware that runs the hardware, needs updating just like software does.</p>
<p>While there are ways to update firmware, many voting systems use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware that goes end-of-life (EOL) meaning that it is no longer supported or available, Macias explained. The election community recognized hardware will need to be modified more often than previously and included requirements in the VVSG for COTS hardware to address this concern.</p>
<p>According to Perez, broadly speaking, anyone hoping for dramatic changes that would make certification less expensive or faster will be disappointed and it’s difficult to say for sure whether systems designed for 2.0 compliance will be more expensive, or not.</p>
<p>“My instinct tells me that voting system manufacturers know how small and price-sensitive the industry is, and they also have lots of experience that tells them how much state, county and local government officials are willing to pay for their products,” Perez said. “My expectation is that, no matter how much additional complexity and/or cost comes with the new requirements, manufacturers will continue to try to price their products similarly to what election officials are used to today.”</p>
<p><strong>Sunsetting Current Systems</strong><b><br />
</b><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3340" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The EAC is currently drafting a VVSG lifecycle policy that will address things like the sunset of older versions.</p>
<p>“With all jurisdictions that require EAC certification or testing to VVSG standards currently on VVSG 1.0, we will be cautious not to cause recently acquired systems to fall out of support or to create a situation where jurisdictions are forced to upgrade before they are ready,” explained Harrington. “To this end, we will consult with all key stakeholders to ensure that the policy does not result in unintended negative consequences.”</p>
<p>The passage of VVSG 2.0 does not have an immediate impact on the voting systems that election officials are currently using, in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Component Certification Pilot Program</strong><b><br />
</b>The EAC has created a component certification pilot program that is designed to evaluate the feasibility of component testing using the common data formats required in VVSG 2.0. Under this program, a component manufacturer would need to identify an existing VVSG 2.0 certified system or systems that their component is compatible with and should be evaluated against. A voting system test lab would then evaluate the component against all applicable VVSG 2.0 requirements as well as artifacts (data interchange files, ballot formats, etc.) of the relevant certified system(s) to determine compatibility and compliance with the requirements.</p>
<p>“A successful pilot will demonstrate that the common data formats are sufficient for the level of interoperability required by a stand-alone component interacting with a certified system,” Harrington said. “An unsuccessful pilot should provide valuable information on where new common data format definitions are needed or where existing definitions can be bolstered to provide the desired level of interoperability.”</p>
<p>Harrington added that it should be noted that a “system integrator” already has the ability (under the 2.0 version of the manual as well as the newly approved 3.0 version) to bring a “hybrid” voting system in for testing and certification that is made up of components from various voting system manufacturers.</p>
<p>“While most systems currently use proprietary data interchange formats that limit this type of integration, the EAC is hopeful that the interoperability requirements in VVSG 2.0 may enable these hybrid voting systems to be certified in the future,” Harrington said.</p>
<p><strong>VVSG 2.1? 3.0?</strong><b><br />
</b>We’ve all been there. You buy a new piece of technology and you’re barely out of the store with it before it becomes obsolete. Moving forward, Harrington said the EAC plans to review the VVSG, test assertions, and manuals annually to create a more agile program that is responsive to changing conditions and technological developments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3338 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-201x300.jpg 201w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-768x1147.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-685x1024.jpg 685w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" />“Where required, such as with the VVSG principles, guidelines, or requirements, updates will follow the HAVA prescribed process with review by our advisory boards as well as public comment periods,” Harrington said. “The EAC will take great care that this regular update cadence does not create a situation where the ‘goalposts’ are constantly shifting for voting system manufacturers and will maintain compatibility with previous iterations.”</p>
<p>If this compatibility cannot be maintained, the version of the VVSG would be incremented (from 2.x to 3.0) to reflect this and would require updated laboratory accreditation as well as a defined implementation timeline.</p>
<p>“The EAC is committed to continuous review and improvement of our testing and certification program, including the VVSG,” Harrington said. “Our hope is that VVSG 2.0 can be updated regularly instead of relying on wholesale changes that take years to develop, vet, and approve.”</p>

							<h2>BPC Patriot Award</h2>
														<p><strong>BPC Honors All the Local and State Election Officials</strong><br />
By Matthew Weil</p>
<p>The United States has never seen an election like the 2020 Presidential cycle. Aside from the incredibly high interest from supporters of both parties, the COVID-19 pandemic struck in the middle of the primaries, lasted through the November election, and is still with us today.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Elections are, at their core, a human process. Thousands of professional election officials recruit and train millions of volunteers to process voter registrations, operate polling places, and count the nearly 160 million ballots cast.  Faced with seemingly impossible odds, America’s state and local election officials rose to the challenge of maintaining democracy even with the added challenge of social distancing, changing primary schedules, and the rapid implementation new methods of voting. Their ability to adapt quickly to these circumstances is a testament to the skill and commitment of these too often unheralded public servants.</p>
<p>State and local election officials, and all of their staff and volunteers, also risked their health and safety throughout 2020. Some were stricken ill by the pandemic, and worse, sadly some died. The extremely high stakes and tensions of the 2020 presidential contest brought down upon many of them threats and intimidation requiring round the clock police protection and physical separation from their loved ones. Still, they endured.</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, DC works to address the key challenges facing the nation, by driving principled and politically viable policy solutions on a range of important policy areas.  We believe in a constructive collision of ideas. That’s why we host the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/policy-area/elections/"> BPC Task Force on Elections</a>, a group of currently serving local and state election officials from twenty-five different states and representing jurisdictions across the political spectrum. We are also convinced that this year it is crucial to highlight and celebrate election officials’ capacity for achievement despite the political pressures and strains during and after the 2020 election.</p>
<p>BPC created its Patriot Award in 2016 to recognize leaders who demonstrate political courage and exceptional leadership in their careers, even during the most partisan of times. The award honors Americans who, in placing the interests of the nation above all else, bring credibility and honor to government. In 2020, BPC honored Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) with its fifth annual Patriot Award. Previous honorees have been former OMB and CBO director Alice M. Rivlin (2019); Governor Tom Kean, Sr. (R-NJ) and Congressman Lee Hamilton (D-IN) as 9/11 Commission co-chairs (2018); President Joe Biden (2017); and Congressmen John Lewis (D-GA) and Sam Johnson (R-TX) (2016).</p>
<p>Free and fair elections underpin our democracy. That’s why it seems exceptionally fitting that our nation’s election administrators be honored in that same pantheon as previous BPC Patriot Award Honorees. At a<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/laa-2021/"> virtual ceremony on March 10, 2021</a>, BPC presented its sixth annual Patriot Award to New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver and Louisiana Secretary of State R. Kyle Ardoin on behalf of all local and state election officials across the country.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3999" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/New-Mexico-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="245" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/New-Mexico-223x300.jpg 223w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/New-Mexico.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" />In accepting the award, Secretary Oliver said, “The work of government is the work of bringing people together to solve problems in spite of our differences…. Election administration has a certain unique place within our government that fits me well because there’s truly no room or purpose for partisanship.” She added that “too often, even the work of election administration is clouded by partisan aims that undermine the ideals of our democratic republic…. This, however, simply tells me the work is not finished. The problems are not solved. Being the recipient now of an honor like the Patriot Award puts into even greater focus why I do this work and where we can all go from here.”</p>
<p>Secretary Ardoin noted that “as Louisiana’s elected Secretary of State, I’m proud to be the public face of our citizens and the 474 employees of our office, and our election partners throughout the state, who fought through never-before-seen circumstances like <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4537" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ardoin.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="275" />early voting lines, voter registration deadlines, COVID-19 protocols, multiple natural disasters, and other previously unforeseen issues.” He concluded with a “pledge to continue the level of excellence that this award is founded upon and will work to provide our state and—through my leadership of NASS—our country with a strong defense of our electoral system.”</p>
<p>“I wish BPC could have presented each and every dedicated election administrator with their own Patriot Award this year. I know administrators aren’t in it for the notoriety, but each and every one of you deserves the biggest ‘thank you’ for your dedication to the best of American ideals. Thank you for all that you did in 2020 and continue to do everyday to improve the voting experience.”</p>

Biden (D)<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/07/biden-sign-order-promoting-voter-access-marking-selma-anniversary/4612970001/"> signed an executive order on voting rights</a>. The<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/"> order</a> directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information. That includes directing heads of all federal agencies to submit a &#8220;strategic plan&#8221; to the White House within 200 days on how their departments can promote voter registration and participation. Additionally, the U.S. federal chief information officer will coordinate across federal agencies to &#8220;improve or modernize&#8221; federal websites and digital services that provide election and voting information under the order.  &#8220;Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted,&#8221; the president said in a virtual address to the Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast on Sunday just before signing the order. &#8220;If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.&#8221;  Biden&#8217;s executive order would also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct federal agencies to assist states with voter registration efforts under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.</li>
<li>Order the General Services Administration to improve and modernize the federal voter registration website Vote.gov.</li>
<li>Order recommendations on leave for federal employees allowing them to vote or volunteer as nonpartisan poll workers</li>
<li>Direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to evaluate and publish recommendations on steps needed to ensure the online federal voter registration form is accessible to people with disabilities.</li>

Not only was there a global pandemic to contend with, but trust in our election processes were severely eroded. “Poll workers and officials were required to make critical last-minute decisions on how to best hold an election during the worst health crisis this country has seen in over a century, all the while being demeaned and undermined from all angles. It’s for this fortitude, perseverance and sacrifice that American City &amp; County has made the decision to honor and uplift these individuals. You quite literally pulled democracy back from the precipice, and for that we all owe you a debt of gratitude.” Congratulations to everyone, you deserve this award and a lot more.</p>

Of that,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/09/975198962/postal-service-delivered-vast-majority-of-mail-ballots-on-time-report-finds"> 93.8% was delivered on time</a> to meet the agency&#8217;s service standard for first class mail of two to five days. That&#8217;s an increase of 11% from the 2018 midterm elections. It&#8217;s also, the inspector general noted, 5.6% better than on-time delivery rates for all first class mail, a standard the Postal Service has not met for five years. The Post Office&#8217;s goal for on-time delivery of first class mail is 96%. The report credited the Postal Service for implementing &#8220;extraordinary measures to accelerate the delivery of ballots to ensure they were included in the election process.&#8221; &#8220;This included expedited delivery of ballots through Express Mail and postmarking and sorting ballots for local delivery at delivery units, rather than sending them to mail processing facilities,&#8221; the report said. It found fault with communications about election mail process changes with local mail-handling managers, which it said risked delaying some election mail, and recommended the Postal Service issue clear guidance about those procedures in future elections.</p>

The Press-Gazette found that former City Clerk Kris Teske complained for months before she resigned that the mayor&#8217;s office had overtaken election planning however city officials dispute her account. The city of Green Bay and Democrats also say the Wisconsin Spotlight<a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/green-bay-democrats-dispute-report-that-private-group-took-over-citys-election-administration/article_1e00ec02-707d-5634-8fcf-0f6e4f9467b3.html"> report made “egregious and false accusations”</a> about the integrity of the November election in Green Bay, that the city followed state and federal laws, and that the allegations are “completely without merit.” “The election was administered exclusively by city staff,” a city of Green Bay statement said. “No ballots were ever in the care or custody of these consultants.” At a recent informational hearing of the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections lawmakers heard testimony from former Brown County Clerk Sandy Juno, election observers and an attorney who possibly faces discipline for making baseless claims in a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin&#8217;s election results. City officials were not called to testify at the hearing. Republicans have called for the resignation of Green Bay’s mayor. Democrats on the committee did not attend in person or question the witnesses. In a statement after the hearing, Reps. Mark Spreitzer, D-Beloit, Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, and Jodi Emerson, D-Eau Claire, said Republicans were fueling &#8220;conspiracies and falsehoods&#8221; about the November election.</p>

The<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/542479-senators-introduce-bill-to-provide-funds-for-cybersecurity-training-for"> Invest in Our Democracy Act</a> would establish a $1 million grant program to cover up to 75 percent of the costs of tuition for cybersecurity or election administration training for state and local election officials, along with their employees.  The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) would oversee the grant program, with EAC employees also eligible to receive funding for training. The bill was originally introduced in 2019 by Klobuchar and Collins but did not advance in the Senate.</p>

Beasley said that the secretary of state’s office received $800,000 to conduct the limited, post-election audit from the federal government prior to the 2020 election.  “It is not going to take any money out of the state general fund, and I don’t think it is going to take any money out of the counties involved,” Beasley explained. “The audit will include a North Alabama county, a Central Alabama county and a South Alabama county. One county has to be of large population and one has to be rural.”</p>

Instead, early voters would need to<a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/gop-led-arizona-senate-votes-to-require-affidavit-or-other-id-for-early-voters/article_49a9116b-7cb9-54fe-bd1e-4efcf1a13ab5.html"> provide an affidavit with their date of birth and number of a state driver’s license, identification card or tribal enrollment card</a>. If they don’t have such identification, they would have to send a copy of any other federal, state or locally issued ID card. The proposal by Sen. J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler, would first require someone to provide their voter registration number. Then they would have to enclose a physical copy of something showing their address, such as a utility bill, vehicle registration form, property tax statement or a bank statement dated within the past 90 days.</p>
<p>The House approved<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/75215"> HB 2569</a> in a party-line vote. The legislation would ban election officials at all levels of government — city, county and state — from receiving<a href="https://www.capradio.org/news/npr/story?storyid=975746051"> private funds</a> to help pay for any aspect of election operations, including voter registration. Republican Rep. Jake Hoffman, the bill&#8217;s sponsor, said it&#8217;s a matter of election integrity. That means keeping elections free of influence or interference, he said.</p>

If passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Asa Hutchinson, the proposal would change the end of early voting from 5 p.m. on Monday to the Saturday at 4 p.m. before the election. This would effectively shorten the amount of days to early vote by one day. Currently, Arkansans can vote starting 15 before election day. The bill has been referred to the Senate committee on state agencies and governmental affairs.</p>

One resolution applies to laws on no-excuse absentee voting. The other regards laws on early voting. The committee left its votes open until Friday evening, but members present voted largely along party lines for the resolution on absentee ballots. Some Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the resolution on early voting.</p>

Brian Shupe is planning to introduce legislation to remove<a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2021/03/de-lawmaker-seeks-to-remove-dual-voter-registration-requirements/"> dual registration requirements</a>. Shupe explains that right now most Delaware residents have to register twice to gain access to all elections in the State. First they register with the State, for statewide elections. But then also with their local municipality to be eligible for local elections. The former Milford Mayor references his hometown saying they have about 10,000 people who live there but only about 1500 are eligible to vote locally. “A lot of people just don’t know and they will actually show up on election day and they’ll just assume that they registered through the State of Delaware, they’ve been registered for 20 years . . . and they show up and they say, ‘I’m sorry you had to register separately with they City of . . .,’ whatever it is,” says Shupe.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> A bill that would<a href="https://www.mysuncoast.com/2021/03/10/vote-by-mail-overhaul-clears-committee-party-line-vote/"> put limitations on vote by mail</a> and ballot drop boxes has cleared the Senate Governmental Oversight and Accountability Committee. The committee voted 4-2 along party lines to advance SB90. In addition to banning the use of drop boxes for voters to drop off ballots, the bill would only allow “immediate” family members to collect and deliver ballots for voters. That would seek to prevent “ballot harvesting,” which involves other people being able to collect and deliver ballots. Among other things, the bill would require voters to resubmit requests for vote-by-mail ballots for the 2022 elections, even if they have already submitted a request under current law. Also, the bill would prevent supervisors from providing vote-by-mail ballots unless requests are made and require voters’ signatures to match the most-recent signatures on file. The bill has the backing of the state’s Republican governor but many local elections officials have spoken out against the legislation. Lake County Supervisor of Elections Alan Hays, a former Republican senator, said many people don’t have immediate family members who could help with vote-by-mail ballots. He said current law allows voters to designate in writing other people who can pick up ballots. “Do you have any idea how many people, like my dear mother, don’t have immediate family members living nearby, thus they won’t be able to have their ballot picked up for them,” Hays said.</p>

The legislation would reduce the availability of absentee voting, restricting it to those who are at least 65 years old, have a physical disability or are out of town. In addition, Georgians would need to provide a driver’s license number, state ID number or other identification. The Senate approved the bill on a party-line 29-20 vote, a one-vote majority of the chamber’s 56 senators required by the Georgia Constitution for legislation to pass. Four Republican senators excused themselves, along with Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, the Senate’s presiding officer who opposed the bill but doesn’t get a vote. The bill now advances to the state House of Representatives. “America is at a turning point right now. Our democracy is in peril and our society divided along increasingly partisan lines,” said state Sen. Elena Parent, D-Atlanta. “It will not work. Voters see through transparent attempts to cling to power through suppressive and anti-democratic means.” Republicans said additional safeguards are needed to restore voter confidence and prevent the possibility of voter fraud, but state election officials have said there’s no evidence of widespread fraud.</p>
<p>Senator Lester Jackson (D-Savannah) has filed a bill that would<a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2021/03/10/georgia-bill-would-merge-chatham-board-elections-registrars-legislative-session-savannah-voting/6939515002/"> merge the Chatham County Board of Elections with the Board of Registrars</a>. Merging the two boards has been something both Democrats and Republicans have considered for a few years, but this is the first concrete step taken toward actually getting it done.  &#8220;Chatham County needs to look at not only streamlining these boards and the process but look to become more efficient,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;It works well in 99% of the counties in Georgia, so I think it&#8217;s something that has to come to pass.&#8221; The split board is a rarity in the state. Chatham is one of the only counties in Georgia that splits the responsibilities surrounding elections work between two offices. The other is Union. As the bill is currently written — which is subject to change before being voted on — the merged board would be called the Board of Elections and Registration of Chatham County. The new board would take the form of the current BOE’s elected members: five board members, two democrats, two republicans and one chairman.</p>

Under the new law, early voting will be cut to nine days, more mail-in ballots must be received by the time polls close on election day and poll will be close at 8pm instead of 9pm on Election Day. “It’s our duty and responsibility to protect the integrity of every election. This legislation strengthens uniformity by providing Iowa’s election officials with consistent parameters for Election Day, absentee voting, database maintenance, as well as a clear appeals process for local county auditors. All of these additional steps promote more transparency and accountability, giving Iowans even greater confidence to cast their ballot,” Reynolds said, in a statement.</p>

Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery), would allow registered voters to<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/03/04/house-rejects-republicans-amendments-to-expanding-absentee-ballot-list/"> opt-in to an absentee ballot list</a> so they wouldn’t have to reapply for a mail-in ballot before every statewide election. The bill also would set new requirements for upkeep of the absentee ballot list: Voters could be removed if they are removed from the state voter registration list, if any mail sent to them by election officials is returned as undeliverable, or if they don’t return an absentee ballot for two consecutive statewide general elections. House Republicans attempted, but failed to add five amendments to the bill, including requiring voters to apply in-person, with a government-issued ID, to be placed on the list to automatically receive an absentee ballot.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://thebottomlinenews.com/student-and-military-voter-empowerment-act-passes-maryland-house-of-delegates/"> Student and Military Voter Empowerment Act</a>, sponsored by House Majority Leader Eric Luedtke, was passed by the House today with a bipartisan 104 – 23 vote. Under the legislation, universities must create a Student Voting Plan to ensure that students have information about voter registration and mail-in ballot request  deadlines, polling locations, and transportation options.  It also allows military members to register to vote online using the Common Access Card, which is a Department of Defense-issued ID card. And it has local Boards of Elections reach out to military installations, university campuses, and nursing homes when deciding where to place precincts.</p>
<p>The Senate has given preliminary approval to<a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2021RS/bills/sb/sb0010T.pdf"> a bill</a> that would prevent people<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/03/04/bills-on-digital-tax-guns-at-polling-places-move-to-final-senate-votes/"> from carrying a gun in or near a polling place</a> in Maryland. But lawmakers spent over half an hour debating whether certain exceptions should be made for law enforcement officers. Senate Bill 10, introduced by Sen. Jeffrey D. Waldstreicher (D-Montgomery), would ban people from carrying or displaying a firearm on the premises of a building being used as a polling site during an election, including in a parking lot, and would prevent someone from carrying or possessing a firearm within 100 feet of a polling place.</p>
<p>House Bill 1345 would create<a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2021/03/bills-aiming-to-allow-ballot-curing-curbside-voting-make-progress-through-md-general-assembly/"> consistent design standards for mail-in ballots</a>. It would also standardize what’s called ballot curing – or allowing voters to fill in missing information or fix incorrectly completed ballots.</p>
<p><a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb1020">HB1020</a> would allow for<a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2021/03/bills-aiming-to-allow-ballot-curing-curbside-voting-make-progress-through-md-general-assembly/"> curbside voting</a> across the state.

Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues said during Thursday’s Senate session that his committee would accept written testimony on the bill, H. 73, until 10 a.m. Monday, an hour before the Senate gavels into its next session. The bill would extend COVID-19 vote-by-mail provisions currently slated to expire at the end of March for three additional months, allowing voters to cast ballots early by mail for any municipal or state elections held through June 30. Municipal officials would also be able to authorize early in-person voting for annual or special municipal elections held on or by June 30.</p>

Democratic lawmakers accused their Republican colleagues of crafting legislation based on misinformation about the security of Michigan&#8217;s election.  Other bills passed by the House would press clerks to stay current with their election training, consolidate precincts, require clerks to create a permanent absent voter list and expand the number of voting jurisdictions that establish designated counting boards to process and count absentee ballots. A <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(shg5xcu3scj3if5kplxgkayx))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2021-HB-4127">bill</a> introduced by Rep. Matt Hall, R-Emmett Township, that passed the House 61-48 largely along partisan lines would require the Secretary of State to send a postcard to voters assigned a placeholder birth date on their voter file. The House approved a bill that requires the Secretary of State to send a notice to registered voters who have not voted since the 2000 general election. <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(shg5xcu3scj3if5kplxgkayx))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2021-HB-4129"> A bill</a>, introduced by Steve Marino, R-Harrison Township, would require a list of the names of county and local clerks who aren&#8217;t current with their continuing election education training to be published on the Secretary of State&#8217;s website. Once clerks can provide evidence that they&#8217;re current with their training, their name would be removed. It passed the House 87-22.  The final two pieces of election reform the House lawmakers passed would allow clerks to consolidate precincts, require clerks to maintain an permanent list of absentee voters and change the rules for the counting boards charged with processing and counting absentee ballots.</p>

The bill&#8217;s sponsor, Rep. Yolanda Young (D-Kansas City), said the motivation behind her sponsorship of<a href="https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills211/hlrbillspdf/0181H.01I.pdf"> House Bill 324</a> involved consideration for visually impaired senior citizens, and as it relates to voting. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a senior, you typically deal with some of the problems of aging, which includes visual impairments,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;My community has a high degree of diabetes, high blood pressure and so forth, which affects their vision.&#8221; Chip Haley, a member of the Missouri Council of the Blind, said the bill includes an important factor in regard to elections. &#8220;It addresses that issue where it not only speaks to the issue of making accessible voting available during federal elections, but during all elections, whether it be state or local, it doesn&#8217;t matter, and that&#8217;s very important,&#8221; Haley said.</p>

The original bill required voters to obtain a photocopy of their drivers’ license or other forms of identification when returning an absentee ballot. The latest version of the bill, passed along party lines Thursday, instead alters the ID requirements for requesting an absentee ballot. It also allows voters to provide the last four digits of their Social Security number or another form of identification deemed acceptable by their local clerk.</p>
<p>A House bill would completely revamp current New Hampshire election laws, and place new limitations on who, how, and when people can vote in the state. <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB86/2021"> New Hampshire House Bill 86 (HB86-FN)</a> seeks to eliminate same-day voter registration and exact provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. Secondly, it would change New Hampshire’s primaries from semi-closed to closed, meaning voters must be registered with the party whose ballot they want to vote for prior to election day. The last measure is the one that will have the greatest impact on University of New Hampshire (UNH) students: in order to vote in the state of New Hampshire, students must prove they receive in-state tuition. This measure would effectively ban out-of-state students from choosing to vote in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The House Election Law Committee heard testimony this week on several elections-related bills including House Bill 362 which would repeal the use of a<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/republican-voting-bills-draw-opposition-from-college-students-during-committee-hearings/35769345"> student’s address</a> at an educational institution as his or her place of domicile for voting purposes. Current law allows a student to claim domicile in the New Hampshire city or town in which he or she lives while attending the institution.</p>
<p>Another bill,<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=559&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 429</a>, would remove a voter’s ability to show a<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/republican-voting-bills-draw-opposition-from-college-students-during-committee-hearings/35769345"> college identification</a> card in order to receive a ballot. The bill would also allow students who are legal residents of the state to receive in-state tuition at state colleges and universities. The sponsor, Rep. Al Baldasaro, R-Londonderry, said it was a mistake to have those IDs in the law as an allowable means of proving domicile and obtaining a ballot because many students who show those IDs are non-residents.</p>
<p>Under House Bill 531, a person registering to vote within 30 days of an election or on election day who does not provide documentation showing he or she is domiciled in the town or ward in which the person seeks to vote will be allowed to<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/republican-voting-bills-draw-opposition-from-college-students-during-committee-hearings/35769345"> register on a provisional basis</a> and then be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. The ballot would be set aside and not immediately counted, and the voter would have until five days after the election to provide the necessary documentation. If the documentation is provided, the vote would be counted; if the documentation is not provided, the vote would not be counted.</p>
<p>The committee took action on a number of other elections-related bills:</p>
<p><a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=42&amp;txtFormat=html">House Bill 61</a> and<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=258&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 516</a> would remove all current specific conditions under which a voter may obtain and use an absentee ballot &#8212; and in doing that, would legalize universal no-excuse absentee voting. Supporters said that as a practical matter, the state had universal absentee voting last year as people were simply able to cite health concerns about COVID-19 to vote absentee, but opponents said the 2020 process was specifically a response to the pandemic and should not be a permanent practice. House Bill 61 would also allow for partial processing of absentee ballots by city and town clerks prior to election day. The committee recommended the House kill House Bill 61 on a vote of 11-8 and voted 11-9 that the House kill House Bill 516.</p>
<p>&#8212; The committee recommended on an 11-9 party line vote that the full House kill<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=112&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 144</a>, which would streamline the absentee voter request form.</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=531&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 285</a> was recommended for passage by the House on an 11-9 party line vote. The bill would tighten the process for the secretary of state to verify local voter checklists.</p>
<p>&#8212; The Republican majority recommended passage of<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=400&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 291</a>, which would require the secretary of state to issue detailed public reports on absentee voting information following elections. The vote that the bill ought to pass was 11-9 in favor.</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=399&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 292</a>, which would require a voter to verify his or her identity if he or she is requesting that an absentee ballot be sent to an address other than the address shown on the community&#8217;s voter checklist, was recommended for passage, 11-9.</p>
<p>&#8212; The committee voted 11-9 to recommend the full House kill<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=796&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 491</a>, which would have allowed a voter to change his or her ballot after casting it if more than the allowable number of votes for an office were marked, either through an error by the voter or an extraneous mark on the ballot.</p>
<p>&#8212; The committee voted 20-0 that the House should kill<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=281&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 372</a>, which would expand the enforcement of state election laws to include county and municipal attorneys, in addition to the authority currently held only by the attorney general&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>The committee also voted to retain until 2022 for more study and work:</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=501&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 406</a>, which would allow the public to observe the processing and counting of absentee ballots without obstruction and from six feet away. The vote was 12-8.</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=762&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 537</a>, which would move the state primary election from the second Tuesday in September to the first Tuesday in September in some years when necessary to comply with federal requirements to send ballots to uniformed and other overseas citizen voters 45 days before a general election. The vote was 20-0.</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=648&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 480</a>, which would allow public access to ballots that have been cast following recounts. The vote was 11-9.</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2021&amp;id=749&amp;txtFormat=html"> House Bill 524</a>, which would require the secretary of state to conduct recount the vote totals of five locations in the state that use electronic voting machines to verify the machine counts. The vote was 11-9.</p>

However, they would not be able to vote in federal elections, which are presidential and congressional elections. The sponsor said this is a way for younger people to have a say in their communities. Teenagers who spoke out in favor of this bill said they’re impacted by decisions legislators make and want to be better represented. The bill cleared its first committee and it now heads to the Senate Judiciary. If passed, this would go into effect for the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>A proposal that could have opened the door to<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/ranked-choice-voting-measure-stalls-040200788.html"> ranked-choice voting</a> in New Mexico election was derailed Monday in a Senate committee. But backers of the measure vowed to bring back the idea, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference in what’s also described as an “instant run-off.” “We look forward to a further discussion about this next year,” said Sen. Daniel Ivey-Soto, D-Albuquerque, after a tie 5-5 vote in the Senate Rules Committee left the measure effectively stalled. In its revised form, Senate Joint Resolution 22, would have authorized — but not mandated — the Legislature to permit the use of alternate voting methods like ranked-choice voting. It would have also required approval from state voters, likely in November 2022, in order to take effect.</p>

Bill supporters, like Sen. Shawn Vedaa, say outside money could influence elections, and counties already have enough funds. Those opposed to the bill expressed concern the law could go too far, by preventing a group from donating lunches to poll workers, for instance. Vedaa says the bill became necessary after Facebook offered millions in election administration grants to states ahead of the 2020 election. The Secretary of State’s office weighed in on the bill in committee, saying it generally opposes private money in elections, but not always. In 2020, Anheuser-Busch offered sanitizer to each state for elections, which the Secretary of State’s office said it did not accept for logistical reasons.</p>

Meyer also said members of the Government and Veterans Affairs Committee spoke with the Secretary of State’s office and various county auditors and determined the bill was unnecessary because they’ll be allocating polling places.</p>

Those backing the measure say the publicly available data would allow for stronger engagement with voters of color and would make it easier for state and local elections officials to address racial inequity in voting access. Similar data is already collected in fields including education and health care to improve outcomes in different demographic groups, and the same should be done for the state’s elections. Providing demographic information would be voluntary. Oregonians currently have four ways to register to vote, and the bill would require that the option of providing race, ethnicity, and preferred language information be available in each manner. During a committee hearing, House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, questioned the need for the information to be public, if the intent is to simply study participation.

The original legislation included measures to also expand the State Election Commission board, giving House and Senate leaders the authority to appoint members — an authority only allowed right now by the governor. But the House stripped those provisions out of the proposal entirely, avoiding a longer fight on the chamber floor that would have delayed its passage.<a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/query.php?search=DOC&amp;searchtext=3444&amp;category=LEGISLATION&amp;session=124&amp;conid=36637808&amp;result_pos=0&amp;keyval=1243444&amp;numrows=10"> H.3444</a>, would empower the State Elections Commission to “supervise and standardize the performance, conduct, and practices” of county election commissions and “ensure those boards’ compliance with applicable state or federal law or State Election Commission policies, procedures, and regulations.” Local elections officials are speaking out against the legislation. In a letter to lawmakers, Charleston County’s elections board chairwoman, Christie Companion Varnado, wrote that they were “deeply concerned about the implications” the proposal would have on them. “While uniformity in the election process is desirable in many respects, due to differences among the counties, one size does not always fit all,” Varnado wrote. Varndado said that the legislation would let the state agency “implement policies and procedures with absolute authority without having a full understanding of the distinctive nature and needs of each locality.”</p>

The resolution to remove Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle from the bench failed Tuesday after more than an hour of debate in the House Civil Justice Subcommittee. Tennessee Rep. Tim Rudd, R-Murfreesboro, who chairs the House subcommittee on elections and campaign finance, said he filed the bill in response to Lyle’s 2020 ruling to expand absentee voting during the pandemic — an action he deemed judicial overreach. The resolution drew staunch opposition from Democratic lawmakers, who were joined in part by Republican colleagues on Tuesday to speak against the resolution in subcommittee debate.</p>

<p>The Utah Legislature has given final approval to a bill that would<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/03/06/utah-lawmakers-expand/"> allow more cities to try ranked choice voting</a> in their local elections, beginning this year.<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0075.html"> HB75</a>, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Stenquist, R-Draper, would broaden an existing ranked choice voting pilot project that the Legislature passed in 2018. The program allows municipalities to give the alternative kind of election a try before ranked choice voting is adopted more widely, if at all. Two Utah cities already adopted ranked choice voting for city council races: Payson and Vineyard. In 2019, Payson elected three city council members using ranked choice voting. Another bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Winder, R-West Valley City, would have adopted ranked choice voting for all state or county primary elections with more than two candidates. However,<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0127.html"> HB127</a> died without a public hearing. The first version of HB75 would have required county clerks to administer this type of election if a city chose to try it, raising the hackles of county clerks who felt it would bring too many complications. An amendment that finally broke the logjam that had stalled the bill allows cities the option of contracting with a county clerk in a different jurisdiction to administer a ranked choice vote election.</p>

The plaintiffs in Tully et al. v. Okeson et al., 20-2605, filed a<a href="http://media.ibj.com/Lawyer/websites/opinions/index.php?pdf=2021/march/Tully.pdf"> petition for a writ of certiorari</a>  with the U.S. Supreme Court. They argue Indiana is violating the 14th Amendment and 26th Amendment by allowing voters age 65 and older to cast their ballots by mail but requiring voters age 64 and younger to vote in person. Pointing to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals’ conclusion in Tully that the “‘privilege’ of mail-in voting is not part of the constitutional ‘right to vote,’” the plaintiffs stressed the need for the Supreme Court to review. They assert<a href="https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/7th-circuit-affirms-restrictions-on-absentee-voting-judge-stays-injunction-in-noon-deadline-case"> the 7th Circuit decision</a> deepens the existing splits among the state and federal courts over the application of the Supreme Court’s voting rights precedents. Indiana has yet to reply to the petition. “Particularly as dozens of states consider revisions to their voting laws in advance of the 2022 election cycle, the decision threatens to create significant uncertainty and disruption for voters, legislators, and election officials,” the plaintiffs’ petition states. “This Court should review, and set aside, the Seventh Circuit’s decision.”</p>

LULAC seeks an order prohibiting them from enforcing the law, claiming it infringes on the right to vote, especially for those in minority communities. “It creates an undue burden on our constitutional right to vote,” LULAC Political Director Joe Henry said in an interview. “It reduces the amount of time that that our community members can vote early. It reduces the amount of hours that people can vote on the day of the election. And it removes our community members who miss one general election, so they are invisible to us, and also places restrictions on county auditors on what they’re able to do to promote the right to vote.” The lawsuit alleges violations of the Iowa Constitution’s right to vote, free speech, free assembly and equal protection. “None of the bill’s challenged provisions will actually serve to make elections more secure or increase the public’s confidence in the electoral process,” the complaint states. “Instead, they will impose undue and unjustified burdens on a wide range of lawful voters, including some of the state’s most vulnerable and underrepresented citizens: minority voters, elderly voters, disabled voters, voters with chronic health conditions, voters who work multiple jobs, and voters who lack access to reliable transportation or consistent mail service.”</p>

It was the last active legal challenge from Trump or his supporters to change the outcome of Wisconsin&#8217;s election. The Trump campaign in its lawsuit asked the Supreme Court to decide whether absentee ballots cast in the November election should be disqualified, arguing state and local election officials implemented &#8220;unauthorized absentee voting practices in disregard of the Wisconsin Legislature’s explicit command that absentee voting must be &#8216;carefully regulated.&#8217; &#8221; &#8220;This is the inevitable end to the ignominious litigation assault on Wisconsin’s November 2020 election,&#8221; Jeff Mandell, an attorney representing Gov.

The report lays out how some Republicans relentlessly pushed misinformation and conspiracy theories about election fraud, and kept at it even after Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. &#8220;Statements which are readily available in the public arena may be part of any consideration of Congress&#8217; constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities,&#8221; Lofgren writes. &#8220;Accordingly, I asked my staff to take a quick look at public social media posts of Members who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election.&#8221; All information in the report was already available publicly, but this is the first comprehensive review of how lawmakers relentlessly promoted falsehoods about the election on Facebook and Twitter. It compiles posts between November 3, 2020 and January 31, 2021 from the 147 House Republicans who voted to overturn the election&#8217;s outcome. The report shows that some of former President Donald Trump&#8217;s most vocal supporters in the House posted more than 100 attacks on the election&#8217;s integrity in less than three months.</p>

The study’s authors and other researchers say the findings underscore the need to disable such accounts to stop the spread of misinformation. “If there is a limit to how much content moderators can tackle, have them focus on reducing harm by eliminating the most effective spreaders of misinformation,” said said Lisa Fazio, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University who studies the psychology of fake news but was not involved EIP report. “Rather than trying to enforce the rules equally across all users, focus enforcement on the most powerful accounts.” The report studied how these narratives developed and the effect they had. It found during this time period, popular rightwing<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter"> Twitter</a> accounts “transformed one-off stories, sometimes based on honest voter concerns or genuine misunderstandings, into cohesive narratives of systemic election fraud”. Ultimately, the “false claims and narratives coalesced into the meta-narrative of a ‘stolen election’, which later propelled the January 6 insurrection”, the report said. “The 2020 election demonstrated that actors – both foreign and domestic – remain committed to weaponizing viral false and misleading narratives to undermine confidence in the US electoral system and erode Americans’ faith in our democracy,” the authors concluded.</p>

A judge ruled in September the state had to start allowing residents to add their names to voter rolls when updating driver&#8217;s license information after MOVE Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project sued, marking the first time online voter registration was allowed at all in Texas. The lawsuit successfully argued the National Voter Registration Act (also called the “motor voter law”), which requires states to let residents register to vote when applying for or renewing a driver’s license, should also apply if that process is online.</p>

Each polling place is also required to have at least one direct recording electronic voting system or voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities.
