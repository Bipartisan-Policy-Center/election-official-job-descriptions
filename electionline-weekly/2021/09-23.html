							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Lessons Learned from the 2020 Election</strong><br />
<em>A new report produced for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6793" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png" alt="" width="300" height="51" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The 2020 election showed us a robust and resilient electoral system, according to a<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/lessons-learned-2020-election"> new report</a> released today by the<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/"> Election Data &amp; Science Lab</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the<a href="https://www.aei.org/"> American Enterprise Institute</a> (AEI). The report, commissioned by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, evaluates the core functions of election administration in the 2020 election, with focused analysis on those parts for which data are available.</p>
<p>A record 160 million Americans voted in the 2020 election. For the first time in American history, over half of those votes were cast before Election Day. These historical markers exist alongside the logistical challenges faced by voters and election officials <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AEI.png" alt="" width="146" height="102" />because of the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges faced as the society and economy at large grappled with how to function in light of pervasive mobility restrictions and public health precautions.</p>
<p>We find the U.S. election system <strong>proved to be highly effective in the 2020 election despite being one of the most divisive and challenging elections in history</strong>. Even with record turnout and significant logistical hurdles for both voters and polling locations, the report finds that Americans overwhelmingly had a positive voting experience. Election officials avoided worker shortages and instituted safety measures that made Americans feel safe and generally enthusiastic about voting.</p>
<p>But the report also finds that vote-counting has been slowing down for 30 years, and the unprecedented cost of implementing safety measures at election caused chaos across federal, state and local governments. The vote-counting process after Election Day was also messy, with record numbers of mail-in ballots causing delays across the country.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="184" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px" />The purpose of this report is to provide an account of how the American system of election administration responded to the significant barriers erected by the pandemic challenges. It is temporally bounded by the presidential primaries at the beginning of the calendar year and the certification of the results at the end.  For the most part, the report relies on analyzing the mountain of data produced administering the election and during the period after it.  The report is comprehensive in its scope, touching on voter registration, the conduct of in-person and mail voting, paying for the election, tabulating the vote, voting technology, and voter confidence.</p>
<p>The main lesson learned from the 2020 election is that <strong>the system was robust and resilient</strong>.  Voters turned out at historical levels; they reported a positive experience when they did.  This resilience had two principal sources, the hard work of election officials and the enthusiastic response of the society.  In the end, members of the election administration profession developed a wide range of new capabilities and competencies; the society increased its sense of responsibility for the system’s robustness.  One hopes that government and society at all levels will continue in this spirit over the coming years to improve the election administration system even more.</p>

The names should be very familiar to everyone. Former Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar will head the CIS elections security mission as the vice president of election operations and support, Kentucky State Board of Elections Executive Director Jared Dearing will serve as the senior director of elections security and South Carolina Elections Director Marci Andino will assume a leadership role as the director of the EI-ISAC. “CIS is delighted to have Kathy Boockvar, Jared Dearing, and Marci Andino assume key leadership roles in our work supporting U.S. elections organizations,&#8221; said CIS President and Chief Executive Officer, John Gilligan. &#8220;Kathy, Jared, and Marci come to CIS with extensive recent experience advancing the security of our elections infrastructure, and we are thrilled to be able to leverage that experience for the benefit of our EI-ISAC members and the elections infrastructure at large.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6479" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vaccination2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vaccination2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vaccination2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Vax and Vote:</strong> Attempting to<a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-vaccinations-early-voting-combined-effort-palm-beach-county-20210920-ufo5qoinszarrldejvxmfjuh5m-story.html"> increase voter turnout and COVID vaccination rates</a>, Broward and Palm Beach County will offer both at early voting sites in the upcoming special primary election. Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link and Broward Supervisor of Elections Joe Scott said they hope “Vote and Vax” helps bring about more voting and more vaccinations. “Many of the communities in District 20 have low vaccination rates. Vote &amp; Vax is a great opportunity for Broward voters to elect their candidate and elect NOT to get COVID. The whole community wins,” Scott said via text message. The League of Women Voters of Florida praised the plans to combine vaccinations and voting. “We are thrilled that these opportunities will likely reach those in communities with lower vaccination rates. This decision made by local government officials has the opportunity to increase voter turnout and will benefit not only the health of community members but our overall democracy,” statewide communications manager Blake Summerlin said via email. After she read about vax and vote, Link said she reached out to Dr. Alina Alonso, the state health department director for Palm Beach County. Vax and vote will be offered at four Palm Beach County early voting sites starting the first day of early voting, Oct. 23. Though early voting runs from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Link said vaccinations would be offered starting at noon. Vote and vax will be offered at all six early voting sites in Broward. Consuelo Kelley, senior director of communications &amp; policy at the Elections Office said arrangements are close to final for the state health department in Broward to administer the shots during all hours of early voting, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>

Pumpkin has become quite the social media darling. A recent photo of Pumpkin having a disagreement with a dog passing the elections office garnered 3,000 likes and 300 retweets on Twitter. He even has a Pumpkin fan page on Instagram with over 5,000 followers. On Reddit, his photos regularly circulate in niche groups such as “cats with jobs” and recently received over 40,000 positive interactions on a photo of him with the caption “would you elect him.” Quivey said Pumpkin’s fame is the talk of the office, and his most recent confrontation with the dog was the talk (and source of laughter) among staff. “We can&#8217;t help it, we just think it&#8217;s so funny he’s so popular,” Quivey said.</p>

State Sen. Mike Martucci, R-New Hampton, presented DiBenedetto with an official Senate Certificate. The Ulster County Legislature also awarded her the “Pride of Ulster” award for her design at their Aug. 17. DiBenedetto, who said in a press release she has always considered herself an artist, credited one of her “greatest teachers,” Todd Martin, for teaching students to use Google Draw in the classroom to enter the sticker competition. “Giuliana’s design was unique, creative, and fun,” Martin said in the release. “To me, it has a playful feel to it.” Speaking about her winning design, DiBenedetto said she included a loudspeaker because she wanted to express the idea that voting gives people a voice. “I believe that everyone should exercise their right to vote and express their opinion because in many other countries people don’t get to have a voice or an opinion,” she said. Wanting her design to be “a little quirky,” she decided to draw the letters instead of using a computerized font. The winning design took her roughly 40 minutes to create. More than 50 students submitted designs.</p>

The bill was unanimously approved by the committee today and will next be considered on the Senate floor. S. 2126 would rededicate the federal building located at 308 W 21st Street in Cheyenne, Wyoming in honor of Louisa Swain’s historic vote. In 1869, Wyoming became the first state or territory in the U.S. to continuously recognize women’s voting rights as equal to the voting rights of men, and Louisa Swain was the woman who cast the historic first vote under that law on September 6, 1870. At 70 years old, Swain – a Laramie resident – cast her vote in the general election of 1870, which was 50 years before women’s voting rights were recognized in the rest of the country.</span></p>

In addition to codifying some of the city’s existing election processes, the new legislation also means the City of Kenai is more closely aligned with the Kenai Peninsula Borough regarding the administration of elections. The city already collaborates with the borough to administer municipal elections. The new code — Chapter 6 — contains 11 sections that outline, respectively, general provisions, voter qualifications, filing for office, administration of elections, polling site procedures, absentee voting, ballot counting procedures, canvassing and certification of election results, election recount, contest of election and special elections. The legislation, which Kenai City Clerk Jamie Heinz has described as the city being given a “blank slate,” completely repealed and replaced Kenai’s existing code related to elections. Heinz participated in a work session with the city council earlier this month in which she provided a sectional analysis of the new code and fielded questions from council members about the policy.</p>

Although the amendment was adopted, the city never made the change to ranked-choice ballots — because the necessary technology wasn’t available. This week the Sarasota city commission voted 4 to 1 to partner with Rank My Vote Florida to seek a declaratory judgment that affirms local governments have the authority to use ranked voting for their elections. A majority of the board supported the idea Monday, noting the electorate had codified a change to ranked-choice elections more than a decade ago. But on Tuesday, Commissioner Erik Arroyo expressed a desire to revisit that decision despite his vote in favor of the legal challenge. As a result, the city has not made a final decision on the declaratory judgment, and the commission will discuss the topic again at a future meeting.</p>

Grove began circulating a co-sponsorship memo for his bill, dubbed the Pennsylvania Voting Rights Protection Act, after Wolf told the Philadelphia Inquirer he “pre-judged” a prior version and refused to negotiate on it because he doubted GOP leaders’ sincerity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/this-week-in-pennsylvania/pennsylvania-politics/two-bills-impacting-pennsylvania-election-laws-approved-by-senate-committee/">Two bills</a>, sponsored by Senator Scott Martin (R-13) were approved by the Senate State Government Committee The first of the two bills, Senate Bill 56, will require successful write-in candidates to receive at least the same number of write-in votes as would be required if they had filed signed nomination petitions. The second bill, Senate Bill 551, “amends the Pennsylvania Constitution to eliminate a mandate that requires a separate ballot or a separate column on voting machines when voting for the retention of justices, judges or justices of the peace.”  Both bills will now go to the full Senate for consideration. Since it is a constitutional amendment, Senate Bill 551, must pass both the House and the Senate in two consecutive legislative sessions before being placed on the ballot for voters.  “It is important that we continue to take incremental steps to improve our elections,” Martin said. “We must ensure that we reduce ballot confusion, reduce wasted ballot space and provide the opportunity for qualified interested candidates to hold public office. These bills do just that.”</p>
<p>Sens. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) and Dave Argall (R-Pottsville) have introduced<a href="https://local21news.com/news/local/bipartisan-election-reform-bill-is-designed-to-be-the-things-that-we-can-agree-upon"> bipartisan legislation</a> that would allow counties to begin pre-canvassing ballots three days in advance. New bar codes would track mail-in ballots and certain deadlines would be extended to help the counties. Right now, voters can request a mail-in ballot up to one week before Election Day, leaving a small amount of time to verify the voter, send out the ballot and get it back. The proposal would move that back to two weeks before Election Day if the ballot is being requested by mail and not in-person. The in-person deadline would stay at one week. SB878 was scheduled for a public hearing at press time and according to Argall, if all goes well, plans to call for a committee vote to advance the measure.</p>

Steffen, R-Green Bay, one of eight sponsors for<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/related/proposals/ab511"> Assembly Bill 511</a>, testified before the Committee on Government Accountability and Oversight at a public hearing on Wednesday. “By having (the Elections Commission offices) centrally located in the state, we can guarantee access to all candidates,&#8221; said Steffen. &#8220;It will save the state of Wisconsin taxpayers well over $100,000 every year. And it also provides an opportunity to take that very first step, one that has been attempted for well over a decade, to move our state government a little closer to people.&#8221; The Elections Commission is one of more than 60 state agencies and commissions. Under current state law, all commissions must be located in Madison. The bill&#8217;s sponsors argue that moving the offices to Wausau, where rents are cheaper, would save taxpayers money. In addition to cost saving, Steffen said the move to Wausau would benefit elected officials on both sides of the aisle. Come election season, all elected officials must submit their nomination papers in-person to the Elections Commission. Moving the offices closer to the geographic center of the state would make this easier, said Steffen.</p>

Amero’s request came during a hearing on a lawsuit seeking to inspect about 147,000 absentee ballots cast in Fulton County in an effort to find fraud. “It is important to me that we know whether or not counterfeit ballots have been introduced into the mix,” Amero said in court. The<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-to-decide-fate-of-fulton-absentee-ballot-inspection/WJIHOEAJI5FC7HM3MBRYVMRGWM/"> lawsuit</a> is based on sworn statements by two Republican election auditors who alleged there were “pristine” ballots with perfectly filled-in ovals during an<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/breaking-georgia-manual-recount-confirms-biden-victory/B7LNNHYZOVGKZBUVAT7NZT3VZE/"> audit</a> in November.

The ruling came two days after both parties sparred over HB 2183, which contains a range of provisions related to who can collect and return advance ballots, among other items. That bill is one of two new election laws passed this year under legal challenge from four groups — the League of Women Voters Kansas, Loud Light, Topeka Independent Living Resource Center and Kansas Appleseed — in state court. Their core objection centers on a provision in the bill that criminalizes impersonating an election official, arguing they have been forced to shut down their efforts to register Kansans to vote over fear they could be charged with a felony. They pushed to block that part of the law from being enforced so they can restart their work as the lawsuit moves forward. Watson rejected their core arguments in a 15-page ruling, noting the statute requires an individual &#8220;knowingly&#8221; misrepresent themselves as an election officer in order to break the law. Because the groups clearly identify themselves as non-governmental bodies, Watson wrote they wouldn&#8217;t run afoul of the law — even if an individual misinterpreted their purpose. She said the civic groups &#8220;downplay the word &#8216;knowingly&#8217; &#8230; almost to the point of ignoring it.&#8221; She said this also undercut their claims that the law in question is overly sweeping and vaguely written. &#8220;The scenarios described by Plaintiffs in their affidavits do not help them,&#8221; Watson wrote.</p>

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should overturn most of Mississippi&#8217;s felon disenfranchisement plan, attorney Donald B. Verrilli Jr. argued on behalf of people with felony convictions. The case could affect thousands who have lost voting rights. “Because the 1890 provisions were unconstitutional, they were invalid from the moment that they’re enacted,” Verrilli said. Attorneys representing the state said Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes in 1950 and added murder and rape to the list in 1968. They said in written arguments that those changes “cured any discriminatory taint on the original provision.” The</span><a href="https://www.sos.state.ms.us/ed_pubs/constitution/constitution.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mississippi Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strips voting rights from people convicted of 10 felonies, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The state attorney general issued an opinion in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony-level shoplifting and felony-level bad check writing. In the case heard this week, the plaintiffs did not challenge disenfranchisement of people convicted of murder or rape. Judges asked several questions during the hourlong hearing but did not indicate how or when they might rule.</span></p>

The Montana Federation of Public Employees, Montana AFL-CIO, Montana Association of Centers for Independent Living and ten individual voters from around the state have filed suit in the state’s 8th Judicial District Court in Cascade County. They argue the elimination of same-day voter registration creates a particular burden for working people and those with disabilities. “House Bill 176 should never have been passed and signed into law,” said MFPE President Amanda Curtis in a statement. “The unconstitutional law is a slap in the face to more than 70,000 Montanans of every political stripe who have used election day registration and to the large bipartisan majority of Montanans who voted to maintain election day registration in 2014. Not only that, but HB 176 unfairly targets working Montanans, many of whom do not have the luxury to visit county election offices during regular business hours. We will do everything within our power to oppose this law on behalf of all working Montanans and their families.” The individual plaintiffs have all used same-day registration, and in many cases claim they would not have been able to vote if it had not been in place.</span></p>

It likely will be appealed to the state Supreme Court, and there are two other cases pending – one in state court,<a href="https://www.wral.com/4th-circuit-says-nc-republicans-can-t-defend-voter-id-lawsuit/19715078/"> one in federal</a> – targeting the law. The decision doesn&#8217;t change anything at the ballot box for now, because the court had already forbidden the state from requiring photo ID at the polls while the issue works its way through the courts. Municipal elections scheduled for this fall were set to go without the requirement, despite a majority of North Carolina voters adding a photo ID requirement to the state constitution in a 2018 referendum. The judges, both Democrats, based their decision on much of the same logic used to strike down a previous North Carolina voter ID law, 2013&#8217;s House Bill 589. &#8220;In reaching this conclusion, we do not find that any member of the General Assembly who voted in favor of S.B. 824 harbors any racial animus or hatred towards African American voters,&#8221; the judges wrote. &#8220;But rather, as with H.B. 589, that the Republican majority &#8216;target[ed] voters who, based on race, were unlikely to vote for the majority party. Even if done for partisan ends, that constitute[s] racial discrimination.&#8217;” Superior Court Judge Nathaniel Poovey, a Republican, said in his dissent that &#8220;not one scintilla of evidence was introduced&#8221; during the April trial &#8220;that any legislator acted with racially discriminatory intent,&#8221; and he noted the bill had support from a handful of black lawmakers as it moved through the legislature.</p>

The 53-page lawsuit, filed by all 21 Senate Democrats, contends that the Senate Republican bid to investigate the election illegally treads on the court’s duties, violates state law over election audits and seeks information that is barred from public disclosure. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”</p>

Activist Steven Hotze, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, Houston ISD trustee candidate Gerry Munroe and a group of Harris County voters filed the petition earlier this month in an effort to keep Harris County Elections Administrator Isabel Longoria from sending more applications before the November election. Court documents show scans of applications the voters allegedly received in recent months without requesting them. The petition also asked the court to order Longoria’s office not to count any votes from people who received ballot applications without requesting one. “If the Legislature had wanted to require the clerk to send the application to vote early to all registered voters sixty-five or older, they could have done so,” the petitioners wrote. “Additionally, if they wanted the clerk to have this option, they could have provided it in the language of the statute. Instead, the Legislature limited the mandate to provide the application only to those who request it.”</p>

Each suit seeks a “full forensic audit” conducted in the same manner, and with the same technology, as one carried out in Arizona earlier this year — which has thus far yielded no evidence of widespread fraud. The legal pursuits in this state, expected to expand to more counties this week, are steered by Washington Election Integrity Coalition United, the lead plaintiff in the suits, and whose leader, Tamborine Borrelli of Gig Harbor, has crisscrossed the state in search of residents willing to join the effort.</p>
