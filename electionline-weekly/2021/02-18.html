</strong>Ballot Accounting Audits Best Practices Guide</p>
<p>By Jennifer Morrell</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6625" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AuditReport4-207x300.png" alt="" width="207" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AuditReport4-207x300.png 207w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AuditReport4-708x1024.png 708w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AuditReport4-768x1112.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AuditReport4.png 930w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px" />Today, I’m excited to share the fourth guide in the Knowing It&#8217;s Right series: <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/knowing-its-right-part-four-ballot-accounting-audits-best-practices-guide/">Knowing It’s Right Part Four: Ballot Accounting Audits Best Practices Guide</a>. This guide outlines how to establish ballot accounting, reconciliation, and chain of custody as the foundation of your post-election audit paper trail and build trust in your election.</p>
<p>In 2019, Democracy Fund’s Election Validation Project published the first guide in the Knowing It’s Right series on risk-limiting audits. The first three publications in the series emphasize how to organize, store, and account for ballots—and why these steps should take precedence when designing an RLA process. The primary focus of this guide is how ballots are accounted for, and provides sample documents to illustrate the best practices disclosed throughout. In practice, Knowing It’s Right Part Four is meant to be used as a precursor to the risk-limiting audit implementation guidelines outlined in the first three publications in the series. When I began drafting the first guide on risk-limiting audits, I did not imagine just how important a “documented process for obtaining relevant and verifiable evidence,” would be in the 2020 election cycle.</p>
<p>Ballot accounting is not only an important element of a well-run election, but should be a standard part of every post-election audit process. Similar to post-election tabulation audits, ballot accounting audits are another way to provide proof that an election was conducted accurately.</p>
<p>Routine ballot accounting throughout an election provides election administrators with a consistent and accurate record of the number of ballots in their possession at a given point in time—providing documentation of any changes throughout an election cycle. Ballot accounting or reconciling, when instituted as a required step in the auditing process, reduces the chance of misplaced and uncounted ballots cast in an election. When done correctly, it provides a way to confirm that votes have not been dropped, lost, or added as a result of human error or voting equipment failure. It also ensures the ballot record remains complete and intact from the moment a ballot is printed, and all the way through the audit and certification of the election.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Find in Knowing It’s Right Part Four: Ballot Accounting Audits Best Practices Guide</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/knowing-its-right-part-four-ballot-accounting-audits-best-practices-guide/">Knowing It’s Right Part Four</a>, is a collection of best practices to follow when designing a ballot accounting process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring forms are filled out with complete and correct information;</li>
<li>Completing an accurate reconciliation; and</li>
<li>Conducting an audit of the ballot accounting, reconciliation, and chain-of-custody logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Election officials building a – or reviewing an existing – ballot accounting process can use this step-by-step guide to help determine what needs to be accounted for and reconciled, when in the process accounting occurs, and how to account for and reconcile the resulting data point to further ensure accurate results.</p>
<p>Election administrators have made it clear that guides like the ones in the Knowing It’s Right series are only useful when actionable. <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/knowing-its-right-part-four-ballot-accounting-audits-best-practices-guide/">Knowing It’s Right Part Four</a> includes examples of reconciliation forms for ballots cast in-person, batch control logs, ballot duplication logs for ballots scanned and processed centrally, chain of custody forms, and templates for ballot drop boxes. Each election administrator should use these, and other, samples to determine what combination of documents work best for their office. As a former election administrator, I often started with examples of standard operating procedures, best practices, and lessons learned from other offices when designing a new process, and tweaked them to fit my own organization.</p>
<p>The 2020 election cycle made clear that ballot accounting is essential to election administrator’s ability and duty to prove and confirm election results are accurate and legitimate. In particular, the ballot accounting practice of logging a ballot’s chain-of-custody to provide assurances that ballots are authentic and accounted for throughout their lifecycle received notable attention in this past cycle. Chain-of-custody logs are the story of a ballot’s journey through the voting process to provide evidence to relieve any uncertainty that ballots have been tampered with each time they are moved physically—indicating when and who took possession of them throughout the process. Like other elements outlined in the guide, adequate chain-of-custody documentation begins by having well-documented standard operating procedures and a process map.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of an election audit is to provide feedback to the election official for process improvement. <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/knowing-its-right-part-four-ballot-accounting-audits-best-practices-guide/">Knowing It’s Right Part Four</a> outlines the process of conducting a procedural or compliance audit to verify ballot accounting records were completed accurately. This includes a documented plan for promptly alerting officials when a significant issue or reconciliation problem is detected at any point in the process.</p>
<p>At its core, election administration is a human process and, as such, is subject to human error. Although the goal is always to have a mistake-free election, it would be unrealistic – as it would in any profession – to say that errors will never happen. Implementing a strong culture of ballot accountability – including routine ballot reconciliation and chain-of-custody documentation – can prevent mistakes. When mistakes do occur, ballot accounting ensures there is an established process for detecting and fixing them—providing stronger accountability, transparency, and little room for doubt about what took place when ballots were issued, processed, and counted in an election.</p>

The EAC conducted this study to identify advancements and gaps in accessibility for voters with disabilities. The EAC commissioned Rutgers University to conduct the study. The EAC Commissioners and Professors Lisa Schur and Douglas Kruse of the Rutgers Program for Disability Research discussed the findings on Wednesday during a<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDo22s-2B-2F5nCAu94bTSuCb4W3QI0n9T5XvxdMa-2Bm83DE4fg0JNsOGKBv-2FOciJ-2BIMEWfnqmFPAgJrdNxsu-2BLwRPq8hHKvt-2Br3KoJKLpWZDyfQtBRiHJEx-2F7sRkirXLAd1-2FCtl5BCrIRqq7ZcZ-2BOt1uWk7ZY-3D5eVm_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpxPyXLujuikG8W5FeZ39LtXdt0BhiZTafuZ-2BES62NgUrCE-2BctunRXCR-2FT8vmId-2FGbPM45-2FxopHZNBPMF-2B-2FoSeizsPXmqHF-2BuSCAT7OFqcTUNihavE404rgfooUiydhEuR2BmCLPOFFc42N87rSGUgoIfRhNiLv5OFuETDbhNuLoUc4ivlp7eSeoSdS1Oogw6dodAMK68o0MNCIn8D9LQffarswO6kdCnSuGI5SnRUtjfzMvQFJyijcr-2FHyd-2BpTk5gimWdm9UlEn0ewfevnl0IYg-3D-3D"> public, virtual roundtable on accessibility lessons learned from the 2020 election</a>.</p>
<p>The study focused on polling place access, mail and absentee voting accessibility, election administration challenges, COVID-19 obstacles, and community involvement.

<p>“In an election year with so many obstacles and unknowns, the improvement in accessibility for voters with disabilities is a testament to the hard work and dedication of election officials,” EAC Chairman Ben Hovland said. “We are proud of election officials’ accomplishments during an especially difficult election season. This study provides the EAC with indispensable feedback as we continue our work with election officials and accessibility experts to ensure all Americans can vote privately and independently.”</p>
<p>The EAC spearheaded the study under clearinghouse and research mandates outlined in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). The goal of the study was to analyze the 2020 election experience for voters with disabilities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on a similar 2012 study also conducted by the EAC in conjunction with Professors Schur and Kruse, the project launched immediately after the 2020 general election.</p>
<p>The 2020 study engaged 2,569 respondents including 1,782 voters with disabilities and 787 voters without disabilities. As in 2012, the oversampling of voters with disabilities was designed to produce a sample large enough for more accurate measurements and reliable breakdowns by demographic variables and type of disability.</p>
<p>Compared to 2012, overall results show election officials made great progress serving voters with disabilities and ensuring they could cast a private and independent ballot. Obstacles continue to exist, but improvements were evident.</p>

<ul>
<li>Voting difficulties among people with disabilities declined markedly from 2012 to 2020</li>
<li>About one in nine voters with disabilities encountered difficulties voting in 2020. This is double the rate of people without disabilities, but a sizeable drop from 2012</li>
<li>Among people with disabilities who voted in person, 18% reported difficulties, compared to 10% of people without disabilities. The disability figure is down from 30% in 2012</li>
<li>During a general election that experienced a shift to mail and absentee voting, 5% of voters with disabilities had difficulties using a mail ballot, compared to 2% of voters without disabilities</li>
<li>One in seven (14%) of voters with disabilities using a mail ballot needed assistance or encountered problems in voting, compared to only 3% of those without disabilities.</li>
<li>Five of six (83%) of voters with disabilities voted independently without any difficulty in 2020, compared to over nine of ten (92%) of voters without disabilities</li>
<li>Voting difficulties were most common among people with vision and cognitive impairments.</li>
<li>Close to 75% of voters with disabilities voted with a mail ballot or early in-person in 2020. This represents a significant increase from 2012 and is higher than the two-thirds of non-disabled voters who did so in 2020.</li>
<li>People with disabilities voted at a 7% lower rate than people without disabilities of the same age, pointing toward a continuing disability gap in voter turnout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under HAVA directives, the EAC is tasked with maintaining a clearinghouse of election administration information. To fulfill this mission, the EAC provides best practices recommendations, training materials, and other resources for election officials. By enhancing our work with voters with disabilities and the election officials who serve them, we aim to improve accessibility and to ensure an independent and private vote for all.</p>

I will work with Governor Holcomb to ensure our next Secretary of State is up to the task and has the tools and resources to hit the ground running.” She said she will submit a formal resignation once Gov. Eric Holcomb selects her successor and he or she is ready to serve. Lawson is the longest-serving secretary of state in Indiana history. Lawson was first appointed to office in 2012. Lawson was elected for the first time in 2014 and re-elected in 2018. We hope to bring you an “Exit Interview” with Lawson in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6626" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Census-300x217.png" alt="" width="300" height="217" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Census-300x217.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Census.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />According to reports</strong>, the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/us-census-figures-delay.html"> 2020 Census data</a> needed for redistricting is delayed and is not expected before fall. The Census Bureau announced late last week that it has pushed back its deadline for releasing the population figures needed for drawing new districts for state legislatures and the House of Representatives until Sept. 30. That is six months beyond the usual March 31 deadline and two months beyond the July 31 date that the agency announced last month. Not only does the delay mean there will be less time to create and challenge new district maps, as our reader know, state and local election officials need time after new political maps are approved to redraw voting precincts and overhaul voter rolls to ensure that everyone is directed to the proper place to vote. “States are literally sitting on their hands, asking, ‘When will the data come?’” Jeffrey M. Wice, an adjunct professor at New York Law School and a longtime expert on census and redistricting law told The New York Times.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6628" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RNC-300x282.png" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RNC-300x282.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RNC.png 402w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This week</strong>, both the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) announced plans to<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/539271-rnc-launches-committee-on-election-integrity"> create commissions/committees to look into election integrity</a>. The RNC’s Committee on Election Integrity will be chaired by Florida Republican Party Chairman Joe Gruters and co-chaired by Ashley MacLeay, a national committeewoman from the District of Columbia. The committee overall will consist of 12 men and 12 women from 21 states and the District of Columbia. &#8220;The RNC will play a crucial role in restoring confidence in our elections, promoting election integrity, and recommending best practices to ensure that future elections are free, fair, and transparent,” RNC Chair Rona McDaniel said. The RSLC panel will convene top policymakers to discuss election reform, with the RSLC. “Increasing voter participation in this country will require thoughtful repairs to restore the public’s confidence in our elections, and we need to make the reforms necessary to regain trust in the process,” said Alabama Secretary of State and commission co-chair John Merrill. “While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to anything, every state in the nation should be working to assess and improve their respective election laws.”</p>

Or maybe not.</strong> This week, the<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/confusion-over-firing-fulton-election-head-continues-state-monitor-weighs-in/CLQU3DSLHVBAHPKVRSLV57ES4E/"> Fulton County, Georgia</a> board of elections voted to fire county Elections Director Richard Barron, however, the Fulton County Commission has yet to ratify the decision and according to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, it’s unclear if the full commission even needs to do that. According to the paper, commissioners tried to resolve Barron’s firing. But motions to approve and reject the firing failed along party-line votes, with Democrats voting to save Barron and Republicans voting to sack him. The elections board initially voted to fire Barron in a closed-door executive session on Feb. 11 — an action that appeared to violate the state’s open meetings law. The board reconvened Tuesday and made their decision official with a public vote. Carter Jones who was hired to monitor the county’s elections told the state board of elections said the county’s problems do not lie solely with Barron. “I do not think it is rotten to the core, but I also think that firing Rick is not a magic shortcut to fixing the problems,” said Jones, who has experience observing elections in developing countries for the International Republican Institute. He said a new director would need “a Herculean effort if they have no power to replace some of the people that are our big problems within the system … there needs to be some managerial shake-up.”</p>

At the time Chambers was a senior at Wauwatosa West High School.  She spent more than 20 hours at the polls that day, arriving at the site before 5 a.m. She handed out &#8220;I Voted&#8221; stickers and helped people place ballots in the voting machines.  She didn&#8217;t get home until close to 3 a.m., after she helped clean up when the polls closed. Chambers said it was empowering to see the number of people who showed up to cast their ballots that day. &#8220;It meant everything to me watching the people show up and cast their ballots,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think she kind of embodies, in a lot of ways, what we hope &#8230; who our students will be and how they&#8217;ll behave in the world, and I think Anyiah is a good example for other students around the country as a role model, as someone who is engaged in their community, as someone who is interested in the world around her,&#8221; her high school journalism teacher Chris Lazarski said.

Jeremy Gray, D-Opelika, and co-sponsored by 21 House Democrats, was first read on Feb. 10 and would eliminate<a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2021/02/17/bill-to-eliminate-straight-party-voting-introduced-in-the-house/"> straight political party ticket voting</a>. The bill also includes a provision that would prohibit descriptions of proposed constitutional amendments on election ballots that intentionally misrepresent the content of the proposed amendment. Gray said he believes HB397 will make it easier for candidates to run as independents as well as create a culture in which citizens are voting for “the best candidate, and not along party lines.”  Straight-party voting has steadily increased to over half of all ballots cast since 2012. During the 2016 general election, two-thirds of Alabama voters choose the straight-party vote. According to an analysis from AL.com of the 2020 general election, 67 percent of Alabama voters chose the straight-party option on their November ballot.  HB397 has been referred to the House committee for Constitution, Campaigns and Elections.</p>

Sen. Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, who chairs the panel, made it clear the legislation has one purpose: to force the hand of Maricopa County officials who have so far refused to comply with a subpoena the Senate has issued.</p>
<p>The Arizona Senate<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/bill-to-purge-arizona-permanent-early-voting-list-fails/article_4875e515-8257-5b21-b6a3-a22392cfa2f3.html?block_id=997196"> rejected an effort</a> to purge about 200,000 people from a list of voters who automatically get mail ballots, a bill voting rights advocates criticized as a Republican voter-suppression tactic after Democratic President Joe Biden narrowly won the state. One Republican senator joined all 14 Democrats to kill the measure in a 15-15 tie. But GOP Sen. Paul Boyer of Glendale is facing intense pressure from his fellow Republicans to flip his vote, and the bill could come back at a later date.  Arizonans vote overwhelmingly by mail thanks in large part to the popularity of the Permanent Early Voting List, which allows voters to sign up once and automatically get a ballot by mail for every election. A bill sponsored by Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita of Scottsdale would purge from the list any voters who skip the primary and general election for two cycles in a row.</p>

Gavin Newsom that could take place in the fall. The bill would take effect immediately after it’s signed. Unlike previous advances of vote-by-mail, the bill was uniformly opposed by Republicans. Supporters of vote-by-mail have not concealed their hope that the practice remain the default method even after the pandemic is over — arguing that easier access to a ballot will spur greater voter participation.</p>

Right now, voters’ one-time request for a mail-in ballot applies to every election held within two general election cycles, covering the gubernatorial and presidential elections. They may also choose to receive an absentee ballot for only certain elections within that time frame. The legislation would apply to all elections, including local races. According to WFSU, supervisors of Elections have expressed concern that the proposal would force them to spend a lot of money notifying voters to renew their absentee ballot requests every year. They say it will also place an unnecessary burden on those who typically vote by mail.  Military voters and their families are likely to cast absentee ballots because they’re often not stationed where they’re registered to vote on Election Day.</p>

The locations that must be included in the designated areas are check-in areas, the duplication area, the computer room and any other area the superintendent identifies as places it is essential for poll watchers to be to assure the integrity of an election.  Although SB 74 would give access to all places in the tabulating center, the superintendent would have the ability to restrict the movements of poll watchers in order to &#8220;provide for the security of the ballots and returns and to prevent interference by poll watchers in the tabulating process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bills<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/ga-senators-advance-bills-to-end-at-will-absentee-voting-require-id/2CNBI3PHPFAIRNTOQBYGNN3EVU/"> requiring an excuse and an ID number for absentee voting</a> in Georgia cleared their first committee this week, creating new restrictions after last year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>A Senate subcommittee voted 3-2 along party lines to approve the bills, which now advance to the full Ethics Committee. Georgia law has allowed any registered voter to cast an absentee ballot since 2005, but Senate Bill 71 would limit absentee voting to people who are over 75, have a physical disability or are out of town. The second bill passed by the subcommittee would require voters to submit a photocopy of their ID, a driver’s license number or other state ID number when requesting an absentee ballot. Voters are already required to submit a driver’s license number when requesting an absentee ballot online, but there’s no ID requirement for paper absentee ballot application forms. In-person voters must show photo ID.</p>

Moyle’s bill,<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2021/legislation/H0088.pdf"> HB 88</a>, would have made it a felony to &#8220;collect or convey&#8221; other people’s ballots. A family member could possess up to two, but having three would be a felony. He argued that abuses in other states warranted the new law, citing things he’d seen on Facebook or heard from others.</p>
<p>The Senate State Affairs Committee unanimously approved a measure intended to<a href="https://www.postregister.com/messenger/news/bill-to-make-permanent-absentee-ballot-changes-advances/article_a8535648-daf7-5c85-ade3-3dd556eeb68e.html"> speed absentee vote counting</a>, which was used in the last general election and spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers during an August special session approved a law allowing the opening and scanning of absentee ballots beginning seven days before Election Day. It passed unanimously in both the House and Senate and was signed into law by Republican Gov. Brad Little. But that law expired Dec. 31. The new bill would require that if any absentee ballots are opened before Election Day, they be maintained in an electronically accessed and secured area that is under 24-hour video surveillance livestreamed to the public. The law would require the video to be archived for at least 90 days after the election.</p>

The measure is a reaction to COVID-related elections changes made by the governor and election commission in 2020. Under the bill only the Legislature would be able to make changes such as moving a primary date due to an emergency.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are considering a bill that require Hoosiers to show<a href="https://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/top-stories/indiana-lawmakers-considering-tightening-voter-registration/"> proof of citizenship</a>, including a passport or birth certificate in order to register to vote. The measure would also require an audit to be conducted after each election before results are certified.</p>

Republican lawmakers say the measures would ensure uniform election procedures across Iowa&#8217;s 99 counties, uphold the integrity of Iowa&#8217;s elections and make sure county auditors follow the law. The bills&#8217; opponents say the measures would make it more difficult to vote early and would be hardest on elderly Iowans, those with disabilities or Iowans who have transportation issues. Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, the House State Government Committee chair, told Democrats during the House subcommittee that he&#8217;s open to various technical changes to the bill to fix concerns raised during the meeting. That could include increasing the number of early voting days &#8220;by a couple,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That conversation&#8217;s not closed,&#8221; he said.</p>

The bill is facing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and voting rights advocates who say the legislation would make it harder for many racial minorities, older voters and people with disabilities to cast ballots. Those critics say the move would criminalize nonprofit groups and church volunteers for helping people to vote and would address a problem that doesn’t exist. The League of Women Voters of Kansas and the NAACP’s Kansas chapter say the bill would make it difficult for Kansans who don’t have family living nearby to vote.</p>
<p>Current law says mail-in ballots can be received up until the Friday after the election, but they have to be postmarked on or before election day. However, under a proposal recently discussed by the House Elections Committee, the<a href="https://www.ksnt.com/capitol-bureau/bill-would-shrink-advance-ballot-deadline-in-kansas-by-2-days/"> deadline to receive absentee ballots</a> would move to the day after Election day, shrinking the current arrival window by two days. The bill’s sponsor, Olathe Representative Charlotte Esau, said this would encourage people not to wait until the last second to mail in their ballot. The Kansas Secretary of State’s office said there were approximately 400 ballots that were received after the three-day grace period in 2020. The secretary of state’s office is neutral on the bill but urged caution in making any major changes to Kansas elections.</p>

The legislation has bipartisan support through its cross-filed House bill, HB0222, sponsored by Del. Jheanelle K. Wilkins, D-Montgomery. If passed, this bill would require the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services to provide a voter registration application as well as documentation informing the individual that their voting rights have been restored to incarcerated felons upon their release. The department would also be required to post signage in every parole and probation office, as well as on their website, indicating that incarcerated felons are reinstated their voting rights upon release.</p>

There is a bipartisan plan in the legislature that would<a href="https://www.wilx.com/2021/02/17/push-to-move-michigan-primary-elections-gets-bipartisan-support/"> move the May and August elections</a>. May’s election would be moved to March and the August primary would be moved to June. Moving the August primary to June would give them time to make sure everything is right for the General Election. “I think it makes sense,” said Chris Swope, Lansing City Clerk. “Within about two weeks, we have to put out a ballot with those statewide candidates on it so it would give more time for that process.” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson supports the change. “I am grateful to Senators Nesbitt and Wojno for recognizing the importance of this common-sense reform and look forward to continuing to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to enact reforms that will increase the efficiency, accessibility and security of our elections,” Benson said in a statement to News 10 Wednesday. “Consolidating the May and August elections into one June election will save taxpayer dollars and meet a longtime request of clerks to be allowed to operate more efficiently.”</p>

Some members of the Missouri Legislature have filed bills this session that aim to make the switch. During a Missouri House Budget Committee hearing, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, says he has not taken a position on the idea. However, he says there would be savings if the election was moved from April to November. Representative Peggy McGaugh, R-Carrollton, was the longtime Carroll County Clerk in northwest Missouri. She disagrees that there would be a savings. She goes on to say she is not a fan of making those election changes. “I think there is going to be a lot of talk about how difficult it would be to put all those layers and all the different races on one ballot,” says McGaugh. She says voter fatigue is real.</p>

Rep. Kelly Kortum, a Bozeman Democrat, argued his bill was a commonsense measure to increase voter turnout in Montana at a minimal cost to the state. An amendment to House Bill 287 passed unanimously, clarifying that the change in law applied only to statewide elections, and not local ones. A fiscal analysis of the bill by the governor’s budget office estimated the cost for those elections would amount to more than $640,000 over the next two years. Kortum’s bill would have tapped the state’s general fund to reimburse counties for the added expense. Republicans on the House State Administration, however, argued the voters should be expected to take responsibility for ensuring their ballots are counted. “We continue to say that we want 100% participation, that we need to drive people to the polls, that we need to hold their hands,” Republican Rep. Kenneth Walsh, of Twin Bridges, said. “… At the end of the day, we can’t do everything for everybody just to make sure they vote.”</p>

<p>Two bills – HB 61 and SB 47 – would allow early<a href="https://manchesterinklink.com/should-towns-be-allowed-to-process-absentee-ballots-early/"> processing of absentee ballots</a> as part of larger plans to expand absentee voting. Two other election-related bills, SB 83 and SB 89, would also allow early processing of absentee ballots. Under current state law, the processing of absentee ballots takes place on Election Day at least two hours after the polls open, at a publicly announced time. In 2020 the Legislature temporarily changed the law so that towns and cities could partially process absentee ballots a few days before the election.  This gave town officials a head start counting a record number of absentee votes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first two bills, HB 61 and SB 47, would allow anyone in New Hampshire to vote absentee whether or not they will be physically absent on Election Day.  Both bills also allow early processing absentee ballots.   The other two bills, SB 83 and SB 89, include early processing of absentee ballots in the midst of various other election law changes. Whether or not these bills pass, the debate over early processing will likely continue. The debate first started with a bill back in the 1960s and there have been over a dozen related bills since.</p>

The proposal allows in-person voting to begin 15 days before Election Day and ending on the Sunday before the election.  Polling locations – at least three in each county and up to seven for the state’s largest counties – would be open Mondays through Saturdays from 10 AM to 8 PM and on Sunday from 10 AM to 6 PM. Early voting would apply to primary and general elections, as well as non-partisan municipal, Board of Education and Fire Commissioner contests. Voters could cast their ballots at any early voting location in the county where they reside.</p>

Kristin Corrado. “It will be easier to find willing workers if we can ensure them they won’t have to jump through hoops to protect their unemployment. We want election workers who are dedicated and committed, not preoccupied with how a check from the county board of elections will affect them.”</p>

The legislation has caused concerns for local elections officials because most drop boxes are located at municipal facilities near police stations. In Atlantic County, the board of elections would need to find new locations for about 70% of the drop boxes the county uses. Board Chair Lynn Caterson said election officials will be communicating with the Governor’s Office, letting him know if the bill passes and he signs it into law, the state needs to fund the extra expense.</p>

A bill from Republican state Sen. Mark Moores of Albuquerque and Democratic state Rep. Daymon Ely of Corrales would change the selection process to a district-wide special primary election, followed by the special general election. On Monday, a Senate panel on election policy advanced the bill after its first public hearing. Further vetting lies ahead before a possible Senate floor vote. Moores and Ely say that current primary selection process would effectively disenfranchises voters. “This bill gives power to the electorate to choose their candidates and requires candidates to demonstrate voter support versus mere party support,” Moores said in a statement.</p>

The bill extends the use of provisional ballots to include situations where a mailed ballot was rejected or wasn’t received in time to be counted. The bill does not change who is allowed to vote or otherwise alter voting procedures. “The state of Oklahoma has a safe and secure process, through provisional ballots, to allow voting in situations where a voter’s eligibility to vote is uncertain,” Fugate said in a press release. “The state election board holds provisional ballots and does not count them until the Friday following an election.

House bills 2226 and 2687, heard by the House Rules Committee, are nearly identical, except that HB 2226 by Rep. Marty Wilde, D-Eugene, would allow third-party collection of ballots only on election day itself.  Oregon now requires mail ballots to be in the hands of county elections officials by 8 p.m. election day. Postmarks do not count, unlike the practice in Washington, California, Nevada, 11 other states and Washington, D.C., according to a 2020 report by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Four other states require a postmark the day before the election. Under the proposed change, county officials would have to receive postmarked ballots no later than seven days after the election. States with similar laws have differing deadlines.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are also considering two bills that would<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/02/11/oregon-lawmakers-consider-allowing-prisoners-to-vote/"> allow prisoners to vote</a>. In proposals that would put the state in the vanguard of a renewed debate over enfranchisement and inequity in the criminal justice system, House Bill 2366 and Senate Bill 571 would restore voting rights to the roughly 12,600 prisoners in custody around the state. The bills would also allow inmates to register to vote in their last place of residence prior to being incarcerated. But the proposals — each sponsored by 15 Democratic lawmakers — could prove too great a shift, even in a year when voting accessibility is a focus. Some of the state’s central cheerleaders for expanded voter access have questions. “This is an issue that I think from an expanding voter access standpoint is very important,” Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, who administers Oregon elections, told lawmakers earlier this week when asked about the proposal. “Just being frank with you, I share heartburn as many of you perhaps do at the thought of some of the folks who are incarcerated for some of the most heinous crimes [being allowed to vote] … I would need to hear the public testimony to be persuaded on why it’s important to expand this civil right to everybody.”</p>
<p>A bill being considered by the Legislative Assembly proposes an amendment to the Oregon Constitution allowing state residents to<a href="https://www.bankspost.com/posts/749/legislative-news-brief-bill-would-put-same-day-voter-registration-on-the-ballot"> register to vote the same day</a> as a general election. HJR 11 would allow people 18 years old or older who are state residents to register to vote for candidates for nomination or election for president and vice president of the U.S. as late as 8:00 p.m. the day of the election. Currently, the deadline to register to vote is 21 days before election day. Registrants still would be required to live in the state for six months prior to that election. College students still may register to vote as long as they change their residency to the address where they live while in school and give up voter registration in their home state.</p>

Jack Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls. State law prohibits election results from being broadcast publicly by any county until all polling places in South Dakota close on Election Day. Because South Dakota is intersected by the  mountain and central time zones, the earliest results can be released is 8 p.m. in Sioux Falls. But there&#8217;s disagreement among county auditors across the state when it comes to when they can begin processing and tabulating absentee ballots. Right now, state law says that absentee ballots &#8220;may&#8221; be tabulated as soon as 7 a.m. on Election Day but results can&#8217;t be disseminated until polling places close. Kolbeck&#8217;s measure, aims to remove any uncertainty around the rules and explicitly states that auditors must begin processing absentee ballots when polls open on Election Day. Reporting results before the polls close would continue to be prohibited. The Senate Local Government Committee on Wednesday voted unanimously to move it to the full Senate for a floor vote.</p>

Mike Winder, (R) West Valley City, will require the state registrar to provide the lieutenant governor’s office with information on deceased Utahns to ensure that they are then removed from the official voter registry. Then, according to the bill, the lieutenant governor would then have to contact a county clerk’s office to ensure that the deceased person has been removed from the voter registry.  The bill then states that the lieutenant governor must verify the names of all Utah’s registered voters using their social security numbers 90 days before the primary election and 90 days before the general election. The bill passed through the Utah House of Representatives with a 73-to-2 vote and then through the Utah Senate with a 25-to-4 vote.</p>

However according to the Salt Lake Tribune, lingering upset over the 2020 election leaked onto the Utah House floor this week as Republicans watered down a resolution seeking to recognize the success of the 2020 election, removing a section praising the use of mail-in ballots in Utah. The substitute resolution, which was narrowly approved on the floor, removed all of the references to vote-by-mail, instead offering praise for Utah’s astronomical voter turnout and lauding Utah’s election workers, particularly county clerks. “There are parts of this I struggled with because I know my constituents would struggle with them, but I am looking forward to the chance to honor those clerks who did so well. There’s no question we need to honor the people who did the hard work,” said Rep. Mike Petersen, R-Logan. The substitute resolution was approved by a 43-28 vote and now heads to the Senate.</p>

The bill from Sen. Lionell Spruill, D-Chesapeake, narrowly passed the Senate last month after Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, a Democrat, broke a tie. The House of Delegates approved the bill on Monday on a vote of 55-44 and one abstention. The bill heads to Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk. “This is the people’s bill,” Spruill said. Northam, a Democrat, has not taken a position on the bill.</p>
<p>A House of Delegates subcommittee rejected a bill that would have instructed local registrars to<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/va-house-panel-rejects-bill-to-require-more-precise-absentee-voting-data/"> count absentee ballots by the voter’s home precinct</a> rather than grouping them together in one county-level tally. The bill had passed the state Senate with bipartisan support, but House Democrats said they wanted to take more time on the issue to make sure election officials are equipped to carry out what’s being asked of them. The proposal would have given political parties and nonpartisan data analysts a clearer view of local voting patterns and partisan shifts.</p>

Under the proposed legislation, on its way to the full Senate, Harassing an elections worker in Washington could result in a five-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine. “It’s just not acceptable in a democratic society,” said Sen. David Frockt, a Seattle Democrat. We don’t have to agree on certain things in politics to agree (threatening elections workers) is unacceptable. We need to make it known now so that in the future, we don’t see it happening again.” Secretary of State Kim Wyman said harassment puts “an additional burden on elections workers, some of whom are part-time employees or volunteers. “They didn’t sign up for threats and harassment merely for doing their job and upholding the Constitution,” Wyman said.</p>

GOP lawmakers who run the Legislature&#8217;s audit committee voted to conduct the review. Wisconsin&#8217;s nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau will conduct the study. The audit will look at how the Wisconsin Elections Commission and local clerks comply with election laws. It will also study the use of electronic voting machines, and how complaints about the general election have been handled. Republicans who ordered the audit said they were responding to a deluge of contacts from constituents, who had questions about how the 2020 election was conducted. Democrats said they had faith that the Legislative Audit Bureau would conduct a thorough audit, but they worried about the timing.</p>

State election officials rejected ballots from David Isabel and about 2,000 others who registered on the day after Columbus Day that year, saying they had not met the registration deadline. Isabel sued, but a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday rejected his claim, saying<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2021/02/11/court-holiday-did-not-give-arizona-voter-an-extra-day-to-register/"> Arizona’s law was clear cut</a> and that it did not violate the National Voter Registration Act. The appeals court also noted that its “rigid” ruling will not likely affect other voters, since the state changed the law in 2017 to give voters an extra day to register if the deadline falls on a weekend or holiday.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag.jpg 799w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Steve Jones scaled down a 2018 lawsuit alleging broad problems with Georgia’s elections, ruling Tuesday that he will<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judges-ruling-focuses-georgia-voting-rights-lawsuit-on-purges/MXTHYY3P4BCJDKHWVAVLBQCKLE/"> only consider allegations involving voter registration cancellations, inaccurate voter lists and election worker training</a>. The decision allows the case, filed by allies of Democrat Stacey Abrams in the wake of her 2018 loss in the race for governor, to move toward a trial. Jones threw out claims about voting machines, voter list security, potential hacking vulnerabilities, polling place closures and inadequate resources. Those allegations were no longer relevant either because of changes in state law or the plaintiffs lacked standing, according to Jones’ 72-page ruling on the state’s motion for summary judgment. The lawsuit will now focus on the legality of the state’s “use-it-or-lose-it” law, which cancels the registrations of voters who don’t participate in elections for several years. Jones also allowed the case to address Georgia’s “exact match” policy for registering voters, allegations of voters who were incorrectly told they weren’t registered, and inconsistent handling of absentee and provisional ballots.</p>

Last June, plaintiff Anthony Daunt filed a lawsuit suing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Director of Elections Johnathan Brater. Daunt, a Republican activist, made allegations of inadequate voter registration list maintenance.  The lawsuit attempted to force state and local election officials in 16 counties, including Livingston County Clerk Elizabeth Hundley, to remove ineligible voters from the rolls in 16 Michigan counties with “abnormally high” registration levels. Hundley was named a defendant alongside the clerks from Washtenaw and Oakland counties, along with 13 others from northern Michigan. The suit alleged that Leelanau, outside Traverse City, has a registration rate of 102%, meaning they have more registered voters than eligible voters based on 2014-2018 census data. Livingston County was listed at 93.5%. According to Daunt, the statewide average is 73%. A release from Nessel’s office states that Daunt’s alleged claims rested on old, estimated census data and failed to account for the National Voter Registration Act’s required delays in removing names from voter registration files. The NVRA also prohibits most list maintenance activities within 90 days of a federal election. Michigan held federal elections in March, August and November of 2020, making maintenance activities a virtual impossibility. With those elections behind us, Secretary of State Benson has announced that ongoing voter registration list maintenance is being carried out in accordance with federal law.</p>

The Minnesota chapters of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the League of Women Voters sued Atlas Aegis LLC, alleging voter intimidation. The complaint came two weeks before the election and after the company advertised for security workers in Minnesota. The agreement prohibits Atlas Aegis from deploying armed guards within 250 feet of any polling place or meeting locations of canvassing boards or presidential electors in Minnesota until 2025. The company “shall not otherwise intimidate, threaten, or coerce” voters, people who are helping voters or people who are counting votes, according to a consent decree. The agreement is not an admission of liability by Atlas Aegis, the decree states.</p>

Election commissioners met in an executive session with attorneys about the matter Tuesday, according to a release from the election commission. &#8220;The County Commission has repeatedly denied our requests to fund the ballot marking devices, because they want paper ballots,” Steve Stamson, chairman of the election commissioners, said in a statement.  He said the election commission attempted to put the funding measure back on a county commission agenda for January, but that the request was denied.  Although a filing date was not discussed during the session, the suit is likely to be filed in a local court within the next 30 days, Suzanne Thompson, spokesperson for the election commission, said by phone. The ultimate filing date is up to attorney Allan Wade, she said. Wade, of The Wade Law Firm, will represent the election commission. Election commissioners say the need for funding for the new equipment is urgent.</p>
