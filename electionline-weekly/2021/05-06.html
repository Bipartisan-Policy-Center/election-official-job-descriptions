							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Defending Democrac</strong>y<br />
<em>Guides on providing for the safety of election officials and workers.</em></p>
<p>By Ryan Chew<br />
Elections Group</p>
<p>The events of 2020 brought the threat of violence into the elections arena at a scale not seen in any of our lifetimes.  Online forums focused attention on individual election officials, staff and even temps and contractors.  Personal details were unearthed, people were threatened, their houses approached and picketed, in some cases by people visibly armed.  In other cases, physical confrontations developed at outlying election sites.  The Elections Group has issued two guides on providing for the safety of election officials and workers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6934" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Defending-Demoracy-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Defending-Demoracy-228x300.png 228w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Defending-Demoracy-778x1024.png 778w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Defending-Demoracy-768x1011.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Defending-Demoracy.png 804w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />The first paper, <a href="https://fe905b4f-785c-4a89-a73e-5999b9031591.filesusr.com/ugd/346ddd_9b3b967e26964ccc9ddcb2fbadd216c6.pdf">Defending Democracy:  Protecting Election Officials from Digital Threats</a>, describes the nature of the online threat, and offers suggestions for creating a wall around your personal information and visibility online to make it harder for trolls to find you or your family.</p>
<p>Social media is often the vehicle for gathering information about a target and coordinating and delivering an attack on them. Personal social media profiles reveal a lot about a person and the people who are important to them.  Harassment on social media can occur in replies to a user’s own posts.  Limiting access to social media accounts can help prevent some types of attacks.</p>
<p>However, online mobs looking to ‘dox’ an election official, identifying and publishing their home address, contact information and other private details, can find sources more quickly than they can be taken down during a crisis.  Election officials should consider searching online for their personal identifying information now and making efforts to scrub old accounts and seek to have other sources taken down.  Defending Democracy offers suggestions on services that can assist you in getting this done.</p>
<p>Online threats can function as a sort of mental rehearsal, so any mention of locations or of violence should trigger strong security measures.  What began online in 2020 did at times culminate in real-world confrontation.  Participants in online forums showed up at election warehouses or ballot drop boxes and pursued staff because of misunderstandings and false assumptions about what they saw.</p>
<p>The second paper, <em><strong>Running Elections Without Fear: Ensuring Physical Safety for Election Personnel</strong></em> [Due out early next week], focuses on steps that offices and individuals should be taking both now and if threat levels again rise, to shield election personnel from these actual physical confrontations.</p>
<p>Though doxing was the precursor of some threatening behavior targeting individuals, other attacks were less predictable, the product of suspicion directed at a jurisdiction.  Running Elections Without Fearenvisions a broad security plan encompassing all staff and poll workers.  We suggest building a relationship with law enforcement now, starting by developing a shared understanding of the nature of the threat.  Election officials, like judges, manage a foundational institution.  Intimidation of election officials should be viewed as a special category of crime, like a terroristic threat, more dangerous to our society than other threats and violence, justifying a strong law enforcement response, not only investigative, but also protective.</p>
<p>We recommend channeling most communication with law enforcement through a chosen, consistent liaison, ideally someone who can make site visits periodically through the election cycle to better understand the unique elections environment.  The need for security must be balanced against the election principles of transparency and openness, a complication that it can be important for law enforcement to internalize.  Local law enforcement agencies typically have a protective services unit.  They may be able to provide not only advice about office security, but personal security measures for individual staff.  In the event of a crisis, we believe election personnel do merit direct measures of protection, and we outline some steps in the guide.</p>
<p>We hope our guides will prove unnecessary as future elections take place.  Preparedness can help deter attacks, identify those involved in threatening behavior more effectively, and ensure that election officials, staff and poll workers remain safe.</p>

							<h2>In Their Own Words</h2>
														<p><strong>Overseas and Military Voting Laws Demonstrate that National Norms are Possible<br />
</strong><em>Look to our history of the Soldier Voting Act, the Federal Voting Assistance Act, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act for a model of how federal legislation can respond and evolve to meet the needs of our citizens.</em><strong><br />

<p>By Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, CEO<br />
U.S. Vote Foundation</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6937" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Susan-DS-198x300.png" alt="" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Susan-DS-198x300.png 198w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Susan-DS.png 592w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></p>
<p>For democracy to function, it must include all of us.  It’s the “people,” after all, who give government its legitimacy. When participation hovers at roughly 50 percent – more or less, depending on the election – it makes those of us in the voter-service sector wonder how well we’re doing as a nation. And while 2020 saw the highest turnout since 1900, a 66% rate is still a “barely passing” grade in most American schools. To avoid full-on failure, we clearly need a fix – especially one that most Americans already want, like absentee voting.</p>
<p>Several pieces of legislation have been introduced to federalize at least some facets of elections, including absentee voting. Despite Congress enjoying clear authority to regulate federal elections, pushback against country-wide norms persists. But legislators, at both state and federal levels, should note that predecessors have united at several points in our collective history to nationalize elections matters, with great success – and in the spirit of democratic ingenuity.</p>
<p>In the thick of World War II, when American solidarity was at an all-time high, members of Congress banded together to pass the Soldier Voting Act of 1942. After all, who with a straight face would deny the franchise to four million deployed men (and women) risking their lives in Europe to “gain the inevitable triumph”? Initially, the law guaranteed active-duty, deployed members of the armed forces the opportunity to vote by absentee ballot, a necessity considering few states made specific absentee allowances for servicemen.</p>
<p>Two years later, following low turnout (28,000) from the newly protected population, plus concern over the law’s silence on absentee options for those serving within the country (albeit not in their home-state), Congress amended the act, requiring states to permit any soldier (here or abroad) to either vote by state absentee ballot or use a federal form. As a result, turnout among this population, in just the first year following amendment, increased ninety-fold, including among voters of color. A national norm had produced a country-wide benefit.</p>
<p>Congress didn’t stop there. Roughly a decade later, it passed the Federal Voting Assistance Act, which created a postcard application for both registration and absentee ballot that states were “encouraged” to accept from servicemembers. Since additional requirements were needed to hold the states accountable, the Senate and House of Representatives, during Pres. Reagan’s second term, passed the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) by voice vote (meaning, it was nearly unanimous).</p>
<p>Now, all states were required to offer absentee registration and voting to military employees, their families, and civilians living abroad, as well as provide them with a federal emergency back-up form (FWAB) to be used in any state. The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act, passed in 2009, extended these protections by requiring states to mail absentee ballots to those making timely requests 45 days before an election. The MOVE Act also allowed overseas voters to request their ballots electronically, updating the law to reflect our modern time.</p>
<p>It took several decades to get it right – and additional improvements are still needed to ensure all voters abroad have the information they need to make timely requests – but the string of laws addressing overseas voters demonstrates that national norms are not only possible but preferable.  And they can be accomplished by Congress.</p>
<p>Some might say, Fine, let’s agree on norms for our service men and women who risk their lives to defend our freedom, but not for ordinary Americans here at home. True, most citizens aren’t risking life and limb, wearing fatigues, while stationed in a foreign desert. But that doesn’t make their contributions here at home – whether as a working mom with three teens, a truck driver delivering goods that fuel a thriving economy, or an auto worker making “made in America” a reality – any less essential. And such criticism doesn’t address the very real fact that most Americans lead complex, often harried lives, and desperately need options beyond standing in line on Election Day.</p>
<p>Absentee voting permits access for citizens living abroad, whether in the military, working for a multi-national company, or backpacking through Thailand.  It also ensures that no American need balance the importance of picking up one’s kid from school against civic duty. Indeed, absentee voting was enormously successful in the 2020 election: according to U.S. Vote Foundation’s<a href="https://usvotefoundation-drupal.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/s3fs-public/USVote_2020_Post_Election_Study_02.22.21_ReaderView.pdf"> 2020 research findings</a>, 99.5% of domestic and 92% of overseas survey respondents received their absentee ballot in time to meet the return deadline.  Moreover, according to the Pew Research Center, 65% of Americans want the option of no-excuse absentee voting for all elections, not just during a pandemic. Early voting, whether absentee or in-person, has the additional benefit of letting state administrators process votes before the frenzy of Election Day. There’s really no downside.</p>
<p>Whether we overhaul our elections system all at once, or make key changes piecemeal, our federal government should expand in-person and absentee options for all citizens, whether they’re pursuing the American dream at home or fighting for our chance to live it while abroad.  Only when we give all citizens an equal shot at consistent participation will we truly make good on the promise of making democracy an inclusive reality for all. And the thing is, it’s not a heavy lift.</p>

Increasingly, local election officials also must be experts in many fields: human resources, information technology, direct mail processing, public relations, cybersecurity… the list goes on and on. And in 2020 there was a completely new skill to learn — how to conduct an election during a pandemic. This post, researchers examine responses to the 2020 Democracy Fund/Reed College Survey of Local Election Officials to uncover key ways local officials prepare to do their jobs effectively and respond to a continually changing elections landscape. Researchers found that: Most local election officials report receiving training, but effectiveness varies; Ongoing training is required for most local election officials, but many are motivated to attend for other reasons; Large portions of local election officials performed most of the tasks associated with cybersecurity; Local election officials in smaller jurisdictions were less likely to report that they had complete plans to conduct background checks; Local election officials feel well-guided on election security by state and federal authorities; Local election officials in larger jurisdictions are more likely to belong to a state, national or international association; Amid the pandemic, local election officials were most likely to consult a local or state resource for guidance; and local election officials in large jurisdictions consulted more sources for COVID-19 planning.</p>

According to former Secretary of State Ken Bennett, who has been hired to oversee the audit, about 200,000 ballots have been recounted so far.  On Wednesday, the<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/05/05/u-s-department-of-justice-asks-senate-to-respond-to-concerns-about-arizona-election-audit/4965675001/"> U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s Civil Rights Division</a> sent a letter to Senate President Karen Fann to respond to concerns the department has about the security of ballots and potential voter intimidation. Pamela S. Karlan, principal deputy assistant attorney general in the division, asked for Fann&#8217;s response to its concerns with an explanation of &#8220;the steps that the Arizona Senate will take to ensure that violations of federal law do not occur&#8221; during the audit. In an another letter,<a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/do-it-right-or-dont-do-it-arizonas-top-elections-officer-warns-of-serious-problems-with-ballot-recount/75-5b1f791e-1963-4cdc-89c1-e6a251d4ac34"> Secretary of State Katie Hobbs</a> warned Bennett to bring the Republican election audit he’s overseeing into<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/arizona-recount-observers/2021/05/05/b807c990-adc3-11eb-b476-c3b287e52a01_story.html"> compliance with state laws and regulations</a>. “I’m not sure what compelled you to oversee this audit,” Hobbs writes. “But I’d like to assume you took this role with the best of intentions. It is those intentions I appeal to now: either do it right, or don’t do it at all.” If Bennett doesn’t comply, Hobbs could take him back to court for breach of contract. Bennett is now Senate Republicans&#8217; liaison for the audit. Additionally, the current lease for the Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Arizona State Fairgrounds runs out May 14 and with auditors nowhere near completion, Bennett told reporters the Senate is trying to amend its agreement at the coliseum to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1680818/arizona-senates-auditors-must-vacate-veterans-memorial-coliseum-may-14"> continue working past May 14</a>, a deadline in the contract Bennett previously vowed would be met. The coliseum is booked for upcoming high school graduations and Bennett has since said there’s no deadline for when the audit and recount must be complete. Bennett claimed it’s possible firms could store ballots and equipment at the coliseum, wait out the week’s worth of high school graduation ceremonies, and resume counting the following week. “There’s no use rushing,” Bennett said Monday. &#8220;Accuracy is more important than speed, and whatever it takes to get it done right, that’s what we’ll do, and that’s what the contractors will do.”</p>

The mystery of the missing ballot was solved on Monday, when a voter returned to City Hall with the paper ballot issued by the voting machine.“They left without placing the ballot in the box,” La Vernia City Secretary Brittani Porter advised, saying the individual was unaware they needed to insert the printed ballot into the ballot box to complete the voting process.Elections officials in<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2021/05/02/dallas-county-elections-official-promises-full-review-after-problems-closed-some-polling-places-for-hours-saturday/"> Dallas County, Texas</a> are promising a full review after some polling places were closed for hours during Saturday’s election. Workers at the Dallas County Elections Department confirmed that issues at six polling sites resulted in delays. Mayor Johnson said he has asked Dallas County Elections Administrator Michael Scarpello to conduct a full review.

However, in November 2020 voters approved a constitutional amendment—Amendment 76—which specifies that only U.S. citizens 18 and up can weigh in during elections. Now lawmakers must figure out how to reconcile the two. “Every single 17-year-old that I knew that was eligible for this presidential primary exercised their right to vote during it,” said Spencer Wilcox, a politically active 16-year-old. “This is something that we really want to do. We want to be involved with the political process, and the passage of this amendment put that in jeopardy.” he state now has three options: Repeal the 2019 statute, leave it on the books but still follow the constitutional amendment (the constitution trumps state law), or have a 17-year-old sue for a decision, Denver attorney and DU professor Christopher Jackson said. In the presidential primary in March 2020, 10,063 17-year-olds voted. In the June 2020 state primary, 4,380 17-year-olds voted. Both times, a larger percent of Colorado’s 17-year-old eligible voters turned out than the next age group, 18-34-year-olds. In a statement, Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold said she still supports allowing 17-year-olds to vote in primaries, especially because: “Colorado saw historic turnout for young voters in 2020 and it’s important that we encourage participation at a young age.” However former Secretary of State Scott Gessler (R) who served as attorney for Amendment 76,  said the constitutional amendment sets the minimum requirements for voting and it had overwhelming support. A legislative committee that’s tasked with making sure the state’s laws work with each other or recommend changes has taken up the issue twice this year, and decided to hold off on a position as of late April. Sen. Dominick Moreno (D-Commerce City), who is on the committee, told The Denver Post that while state attorneys believe the statute allowing 17-year-olds to vote is now null and void, it’s not completely clear what should happen. The final decision, he said, lies with the courts.</p>

The<a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Klobuchar%20Substitute%20S1.pdf"> changes to the For the People Act</a> come after the bill<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-elections-voting-pelosi-/2021/03/03/e434df58-7c22-11eb-a976-c028a4215c78_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4"> passed the House</a> on a largely party-line vote in March and ahead of a critical vote Tuesday in the Senate Rules and Administration Committee that could advance the legislation to the floor. What has changed are some of the requirements and timelines related to the bill’s mandates for early voting, voting by mail, automatic voter registration and voting system standards. In several cases, states or local jurisdictions will be given more time or more leeway to follow through on the bill’s mandates. The changes are contained in a package of revisions known as a “manager’s amendment” that was circulated to senators on Wednesday by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who is shepherding the bill through the Senate as Rules Committee chairwoman. Klobuchar’s proposal will provide a new baseline for potential further amendments in the committee or on the Senate floor. A Democratic aide involved in the revisions to the bill said the changes were made in consultation with state and local voting administrators of both parties, including groups such as the National Association of Election Officials and the National Association of Secretaries of State. The aide was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Among the latest changes is a tweak to one of the bill’s key mandates, requiring states to provide at least 15 consecutive days of early voting, with polls open at least 10 hours a day. The revisions now provide limited exemptions for jurisdictions with fewer than 3,000 registered voters, as well as those jurisdictions that mail ballots automatically to all voters. The changes also loosen a requirement that early voting be offered on the Monday before Election Day. After some officials raised concerns about the administrative burdens, Monday voting would now become optional, though jurisdictions would still have to meet the 15-consecutive-day rule. Several tweaks have also been made to vote-by-mail standards. Because of concerns about meeting state certification deadlines, the mandated minimum window for accepting mail ballots has been changed from 10 days after Election Day to seven days. (All late-arriving ballots must have been postmarked by Election Day.) And, while the initial bill required authorities to allow requests as late as five days before Election Day, that window has been extended to seven days.</p>

The poll workers hired would still have to be residents of the county in which they work.  House Bill 312 is sponsored by state Rep. David Wheeler, R-Vestavia. Wheeler asked that the Alabama House of Representatives vote to concur with the changes made to the bill by the Alabama Senate. The local boards of registrars would still have to give priority to hiring applicants from within that precinct. The House voted to concur on a 92 to 0 vote. According to the legislation: “The appointing board, or a majority of them acting as an appointing board, not more than 20 nor less than 15 days before the holding of any election in their county, shall appoint from the qualified electors of the respective precinct county, necessary precinct election officials, which shall include at least one inspector, to act at each voting place in each precinct.  “Precinct election officials shall be registered voters in the county in which they serve, but are not required to be registered at the precinct in which they serve; provided, that first priority. Provided, first priority may be given to the appointment of poll workers and alternate poll workers who are registered voters at their respective precincts, so long as the board determines that the poll worker is qualified for appointment as a poll worker.”</p>

Before 2020, policies for handling missing signatures varied by county.  Voting rights advocates condemned the legislation and urged Gov. Doug Ducey to veto it.  The measure would require county election officials to notify voters who fail to sign their ballots. But critics say those who return them on Election Day or shortly before would not have time to fix the problem. Voters who do sign their ballots but have the signature rejected because it doesn’t closely match the one on file would still get five days after the election to resolve the issue. The measure passed the Senate earlier then year then stalled in the House. It was revived on Thursday and sent to Ducey as all election-related bills remain in limbo in the Senate because of a disagreement among Republicans.</p>

But a host of federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, warned in a report to states ahead of last fall’s election the bill’s provisions would amount to a “high-risk” endeavor that could compromise election integrity by allowing hackers to manipulate ballots and election results “at scale.”<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-188"> Senate Bill 21-188</a> was carried through the Senate by Sen. Jessie Danielson, D-Wheat Ridge, where it passed on a near-party line vote. In the House, the legislation is sponsored Democratic Reps. Monica Duran, D-Wheat Ridge, and David Ortiz, a Littleton Democrat who now uses a wheelchair after a helicopter crash while serving in Afghanistan left him with little muscle control below his waist. The proposal seeks to build on legislation that allows voters with disabilities to access a ballot online, which Danielson championed in 2019. Under Danielson&#8217;s<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-202"> Senate Bill 19-202</a>, a ballot can then be marked, printed and returned, which allows voters with disabilities to cast a ballot privately and independently. After being signed into law in May 2019, Danielson said Secretary of State Jena Griswold quickly implemented the legislation and it has largely been successful, save for one hiccup: few voters with disabilities have a printer.</p>

Relenting on a number of ideas that were strongly opposed by county elections supervisors and Democrats, the bill now heading to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk is far less onerous than what Republicans were proposing over the last month. The bill does not ban drop boxes, an idea DeSantis endorsed earlier this year. It does not require someone show an I.D. when leaving a vote by mail ballot in a drop box, which elections supervisors warned would have created long lines. It also does not include the strict signature-comparison requirements for validating vote by mail ballots that some feared would require millions of Floridians to update their signatures with their county elections office. It does restrict people from possessing more than two vote by mail ballots, reimposing a ban on ballot collection that Republicans did away with 20 years ago. Possessing more than two ballots is already outlawed in Miami-Dade County, a response to a series of scandals involving people illegally obtaining ballots and pressuring voters.<a href="https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/90"> Senate Bill 90</a> also would require ballot drop boxes to be used only during early voting hours, and must be manned during those times. The 150-foot ban on soliciting voters at polling sites would also apply to drop box locations. Most of the bill makes dozens of technical and administrative changes to the state’s vote-by-mail laws. Elections supervisors would be given more time to count vote by mail ballots and be required to regularly report online the number of ballots submitted and counted. They would also have to allow candidates’ observers to closely watch, and easily dispute, the duplicate ballot process. That’s the process where supervisors duplicate ballots that are wet, wrinkled or otherwise too damaged to run through voting machines. They would also be prevented from changing the locations of drop boxes within 30 days of an election. The vote passed the Senate 23-17, and in the House of Representatives 77-40. DeSantis was<a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/politics/state/2021/05/05/desantis-expected-sign-bill-restricting-voting-west-palm-beach/4954451001/"> expected to sign</a> the bill at press time.</p>

Rep. Frederick Jones, D-Monroe, offered his bill after the record voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election. Louisiana saw more than 2.1 million people vote in November, and 986,000 of them voted early in-person. The bill originally extended early voting for every election, but after financial concerns from the registrars of voters, Jones limited the bill to presidential elections. The extension of early voting comes with a price tag of $400,000 to the state, including pay for poll workers. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin noted that while early voting provides a great convenience to voters, extending this period for every election would come with challenges for his office and the registrars. Limiting the bill to presidential elections also allows for more time to adjust election timelines.</p>

Tim Walz and House majority Democrats makes it unlikely to become law this year. The vote for the Republican-backed bill was 34-32 and fell along party lines.  Supporters say the voter ID measure would protect election integrity. Critics argue that it would suppress the vote. The debate has gone on for years, and Minnesotans rejected a voter ID constitutional amendment in 2012. Under the bill, eligible Minnesotans would need to show a photo ID when voting in person or when casting an absentee ballot. A new provisional ballot system would be established for people unable to produce an ID on Election Day. There would also be a new voter identification card established and provided free to those who need it. A companion bill in the House has not received any committee hearings. There are just two weeks left in the session, with budget work expected to occupy nearly all of that time.</p>

If the Legislature isn’t in session at the time, the new law requires the Secretary of State to poll lawmakers on the proposed change in election laws within three days of the governor’s request. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, and was brought as a response to Bullock’s decision to allow all-mail primary and general elections in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic. All but a handful of Montana’s 56 counties opted to hold their elections by mail ballots only.

The proposal is aimed at ensuring ballots are still counted for all the offices or ballot questions they are eligible to vote for, as long as they are in the right polling site in their county. General election data gathered by the group VoteEarlyNY released on Monday found 13,800 ballots were disqualified after voters appeared at the wrong polling site. &#8220;The 2020 data confirms what has been reported anecdotally for years,&#8221; said VoteEarlyNY Co-Founder and Voting Rights Counsel Jarret Berg, &#8220;That each election thousands of legitimate voters have their ballots tossed and their right to vote fully and needlessly frustrated. Against this backdrop, a modern safeguard that counts the eligible votes on ballots cast by registered New Yorkers, rather than entirely discounting them, will improve due process and significantly reduce the disenfranchisement of eligible voters, ensuring more accurate election results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo has<a href="https://www.weny.com/story/43827378/new-york-gov-cuomo-signs-bill-that-automatically-restores-felons-right-to-vote-after-release"> signed legislation into law</a> expanding felon voting rights, according to the state legislature, allowing for people on parole in the state to be eligible to vote as soon as they leave prison. The<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/21/politics/new-york-bill-voting-rights/index.html"> law</a> codifies a 2018 executive order that allowed for Cuomo to individually pardon parolees. According to the bill text, Department of Corrections officials are required to provide a voter registration form as the felon is leaving the facility. Previously, parolees would have to wait a period of four to six weeks to receive a pardon and then must register to vote on their own. The law goes into effect immediately, although some portions are delayed until 120 days after its signing, according to the bill text. The New York legislature passed the bill in April.</p>

Like a similar bill in the Senate, it would eliminate the current three-day grace period in state law for county boards to receive ballot envelopes in the mail that are postmarked by the date of the election. Against the wishes of Republican legislators, that period was extended to nine days for last November&#8217;s election following a lawsuit settlement between the State Board of Elections and a pro-union group addressing the pandemic and mail delays. In contrast to the Senate measure, the House bill also would direct county elections boards to send absentee ballots to applicants starting 63 days before the date of an even-numbered year general election, instead of the current 60 days. The distribution date for primaries also would be 53 days before the election, instead of 50. North Carolina&#8217;s current 60-day window made the state the first in the nation to allow voters to turn in ballots in early September for the Nov. 4 election. Now it would be even longer.</p>

Scott Louser, R-Minot, is 83 pages detailing changes for election administration. It includes language updates and provisions for matching absentee ballot application signatures, helping people with disabilities vote and enabling technology additions, such as QR codes for smartphones. &#8220;We&#8217;re just making the best system in the country a little bit better,&#8221; said Louser, who began working on the bill with the secretary of state&#8217;s office in July 2020. One provision of House Bill 1253 limits voters to 30 minutes &#8220;to mark and cast the ballot after receiving the ballot from the election judge.&#8221; If a voter wanted to take longer than 30 minutes after the last person in line at closing time received a ballot, he or she could submit the ballot as marked or continue to mark it and have it counted at the county canvassing board meeting. Louser said that provision likely wouldn&#8217;t be enforced on most voters, is &#8220;designed for the end of the night&#8221; to speed election work and has no penalty. The bill does not include an amendment Louser proposed that mirrored language from a bill the Senate earlier defeated in imposing a three-hour election results deadline. Opponents said that time limit would exacerbate stress to produce election results. The House adopted a conference committee report and passed the bill unanimously. The Senate on Thursday did the same, 44-3, after initially rejecting the first conference committee report on Monday over concerns about a provision that would indicate on the primary ballot whether state and legislative candidates were endorsed or petition candidates. The provision ultimately was removed. The bill reduces some deadlines for post-election work, such as entering voters into the central voter file, which is a record of who has voted. North Dakota has no voter registration. The bill also extends the time frame for county canvassing boards to meet, from six days after each election to 13 days. The bill imposes a Class A misdemeanor on people who knowingly accept private money for running elections. Louser said lawmakers felt &#8220;no outside, private money, especially big tech, should be allowed to come in and attempt to influence any election in North Dakota.&#8221;</p>

SB 7 would require applicants to affirmatively indicate eligibility when they register to vote and when applying for mail ballots.

The bill will now go to the Committee on Calendars for possible placement on the House floor.</p>

The legislation wouldn’t apply to members of the judiciary, but it would apply to Wisconsin’s Senators and Assembly members. The only exception is if the official is on the ballot. Representative Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said during a press conference today that the proposal will increase transparency in the state’s election processes. “By requiring our non-judicial state elected officials to receive the same training as election officials in their district, we can increase knowledge, understanding and confidence in an election administered fairly and without doubt,” Appleton said.</p>

Without comment the justices refused to consider a request by Pinal County resident Staci Burk that she should be allowed to pursue her claims of evidence of election fraud. She wanted access to the ballots to prove that some were invalid. The justices, however, never actually got to look at those claims. In fact, that wasn’t even part of her petition to the high court. What Burk wanted — and what the justices refused to grant her — is a hearing over the question of whether she was an “elector’’ under Arizona law who had standing to bring such a claim in the first place. It was that lack of standing that allowed state courts, right up through the Arizona Supreme Court, to ignore her claims. In her underlying claims, Burk alleged widespread fraud and improper tallying by voting machines. She also claims that someone had flown a batch of ballots into Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport, some of which Burk said were taken to the Maricopa County ballot tabulation center. Burk never got a hearing on her claims after her case was tossed last year by Pinal County Superior Court Judge Kevin White who concluded she had no legal right to sue because she did not fit the legal definition of “qualified elector.’’ She charged that her registration had been illegally canceled and sought a hearing. But White also found that Burk, who represented herself, waited too long to file suit. The state’s high court reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>The Arizona Democratic Party and other critics of the state Senate’s audit of Maricopa County election results<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/05/05/arizona-audit-settlement-reached-lawsuit-between-democrats-senate/4964988001/"> reached a settlement</a> in a lawsuit with top Republican legislators, guaranteeing certain measures for ballot security and voter privacy as well as access for observers and reporters to witness the process. Though the state Democratic Party and County Supervisor Steve Gallardo initially sought a restraining order to stop the audit, arguing it did not include adequate measures to protect ballots or voter privacy, the settlement allows the audit to continue. Still, the party touted the settlement as a victory. And it adds to orders a judge has already issued requiring that voter privacy is maintained and ballots protected. It also gives force to agreements the Senate has hashed out during the process to allow access. The settlement stipulates that written procedures made public following a judge’s order last week will remain in place throughout the process. That comes after observers raised concerns that officials overseeing the audit were making changes on the fly. The settlement requires, too, that the Senate will ensure voting systems, voter information and ballots are secured to prevent unauthorized access. And under the agreement, images of ballots that the Senate has obtained and images that its contractors are currently making at the coliseum will not be released without a court order.</p>

In March 2020, Newsom declared a state of emergency in the early days of the pandemic and just days after voters headed to the polls during primary election season. Newsom issued an executive order to send vote-by-mail ballots to all registered voters ahead of the November general election. Newsom’s election orders were made under the California Emergency Services Act (CESA). Republican lawmakers argued Newsom completely sidestepped the state Legislature and the governor unconstitutionally changed California’s election laws.

Kemp made the appointment of attorney Jack Sharman, of Birmingham-based Lightfoot, Franklin and White, by executive order. The order noted that Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who would typically represent the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office in any legal matters, &#8220;has declined representation of the Secretary of State in this matter.&#8221; It did not explain why. While Sec. Brad Raffensperger does not appear to be a subject of the investigation, the secretary&#8217;s office has been asked to preserve any records or docments that could be relevant to it. The office&#8217;s legal representation would presumably, at a minimum, be tied to cooperation with such requests.</p>

In July 2019, Linn County Auditor Joel Miller, a Democrat, filed a public-records request with Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican.  After no response from Pate’s office to the<a href="https://www.timesrepublican.com/news/todays-news/2021/04/judge-allows-lawsuit-against-iowa-voter-registration-commission-to-proceed/"> public-records request</a>, Miller filed a complaint with the Iowa Voter Registration Commission. Pate filed a motion asking the commission to dismiss Miller’s complaint, arguing Miller had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The commission heard arguments on Pate’s motion and ultimately decided on a 2-1 vote to dismiss Miller’s complaint without a hearing. Miller appealed that decision to Iowa District Court, arguing that the commission, rather than permitting Miller to present testimony and evidence to support his complaint, simply accepted “the unsubstantiated factual assertions” offered by Pate. In February, the commission, represented by the office of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the case. In his ruling, Rosenberg stated that ordinarily, litigation related to elections becomes moot after the election passes, but both the federal Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and Iowa’s own administrative complaint procedures contemplate filing complaints and providing election-related remedies after an election is over. “HAVA and the Iowa administrative procedures provide Miller with the right to pursue injunctive relief with respect to a past election,” Rosenberg ruled. “If the Court granted Miller’s petition and remanded to IVRC for a contested case hearing on the merits, IVRC would retain the ability to grant injunctive relief related to the 2020 election for violations of HAVA.”</p>

But, with their eyes on future elections, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, and Attorney General Jeff Landry, both Republicans, are pressing on with an appeal. They want a ruling that U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick&#8217;s expansion of voting opportunities last fall was an overreach in which the judge took actions reserved for lawmakers. The plaintiffs, including the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP and the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, say the issue is moot. Their lawsuit dealt only with the November and December Louisiana elections, and they have a right to have it dismissed, they argued Tuesday in a court filing. The two Republican leaders say the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should rule anyway. Otherwise, they say in court briefs, “this case—if not addressed by this Court—could become a roadmap for similarly timed future actions.” The voting rights advocates filed a dismissal motion in Dick&#8217;s court Tuesday. They also have one pending at the 5th Circuit. The 5th Circuit hasn&#8217;t ruled on the motion. It has issued an order scheduling arguments on the appeal for June 7.</p>

The candidates, Aldermen Fred Esco, Rodriquez Brown, and Tim Taylor, each lost their bids for re-election and have brought suits to challenge the results. This is the second time the three have found themselves in court in connection to Canton election issues. All three point to discrepancies to back up their claims the election results should be set aside. Absentee voting started March 27, days before the April 6 primary. Under state statute, absentee ballots are supposed to be made available to voters 45 days before party primaries. However, ballots were not printed on time, in part, because of challenges brought by Esco, Brown, Mayor William Truly and his wife Natwassie Truly. “This failure to provide the statutory 45-day period for absentee voting disenfranchised many Canton Democratic primary voters, including many who would have voted for Esco if given the time and opportunity required by statute,” his suit states.</p>

Now a panel of judges must decide: were Republicans in the legislature motivated at least partially by racial bias? Or were they purely trying to carry out the public&#8217;s desire for secure elections? The three state judges hearing the lawsuit didn’t immediately rule following three weeks of testimony and arguments on the law, which implemented a photo ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution by voters in November 2018. Paul Brachman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said evidence showed Republicans rushed through the law without seeking bipartisanship and protections for voting rights before losing their veto-proof majorities in early 2019. Brachman pointed to a 2016 federal appeals court ruling, which struck down a 2013 photo ID law and other voting restrictions on grounds of racial bias, as proof the 2018 voter ID law suffered from the same flaw. Voter ID under the 2013 law was carried out briefly during the 2016 primary.  David Thompson, an attorney representing House Speaker Tim Moore, Senate leader Phil Berger and other GOP legislators, sought to separate the voter ID laws from what he acknowledged was the state&#8217;s otherwise shameful history on voting rights. And he said the bill received more than just token Democratic support. Key moments in the trial surrounded the role of Democratic Sen. Joel Ford of Charlotte, who is Black and one of the bill&#8217;s cosponsors.  Thompson said there are many changes from the 2013 law designed to improve ballot access while ensuring only legal citizens can vote. Superior Court Judges Nathaniel Poovey, Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier didn’t say when they’d rule, but planned to receive more legal filings in mid-May. Poovey ran for office as a Republican. The other two judges ran most recently as Democrats. Any decision likely will be appealed to the state Supreme Court. There are other voter ID lawsuits pending in state and federal court. The law isn’t currently being enforced.</p>

Days before the state’s voter registration deadline for the 2018 midterm elections, then-Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos issued a press release telling voters online registration is not allowed in Texas, and advising counties applications submitted through a cellphone app created by the advocacy group Vote.org were not complete because they contained digital signatures. Following Pablos’ guidance, county registrars notified 2,400 would-be voters their applications had been rejected as incomplete. After Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed fellow Republican Ruth Hughs as secretary of state, the Texas Democratic Party<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-accuse-texas-of-voter-suppression/"> sued</a> her in San Antonio federal court in January 2020, claiming the state’s “wet-signature rule” requiring a hand signature on a physical document is unconstitutional. Hughs claims she has sovereign immunity because the Texas Democratic Party is taking issue with part of the Texas Election Code that county voter registrars enforce.</p>
