							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Advice for the year to come</strong><br />
<em>Former elections officials give advice to those still in the trenches</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>2021 saw an unprecedented number of elections officials retire early or simply resign. Typically electionline Weekly likes to have some of these folks sit for one of our Exit Interviews, but with so many people moving on, it was almost impossible.</p>
<p>A handful of former elections officials left their local or state-level elections jobs and moved on to other jobs still in the field with places like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, CISA, the EI-IASC and the nonprofit sector. We’ve decided to ask this cohort of former elections officials and ask them what their best advice is for 2022. Here’s what they had to say…</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7863" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andino-260x300.png" alt="" width="158" height="182" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andino-260x300.png 260w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andino.png 714w" sizes="(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px" />Marci Andino</strong>: It’s been a privilege and honor to be part of the election community and to work with so many dedicated professionals from across the country.  In the last few years, election officials have been faced with unprecedented challenges, criticism and threats and 2022 will be no exception.  Just remember, there’s no more important work than registering voters and conducting elections to support our democracy.  Keep doing what you do every day to achieve trust and confidence in the election process:  develop and follow procedures; test and retest; reconcile and audit; improve your cybersecurity posture and resilience; and conduct elections in a fair and impartial manner.  Don’t listen to the “noise”!  Expect the unexpected and know your work is important and you are appreciated!— Marci Andino, was the long-time directo<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article251339668.html">r</a> of the South Carolina State Elections Commission before becoming the Director of the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/">EI-ISAC</a>).</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7864" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aguino-229x300.png" alt="" width="149" height="195" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aguino-229x300.png 229w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aguino.png 606w" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" />Lori Aguino</strong>: Get back to the basics. With the additional work that has inundated us all, don’t forget to use your checklists, proof, proof, and proof again. Use your tried-and-true practices to ensure accuracy in your work and to make sure things don’t fall through the cracks.  Find your true north. Remember why you started in elections administration! Stick to your principles and do the right thing every day. Rely on your network.  Be active in the national, state, and local associations for elections officials. There are so many people within this industry who are rock stars and know exactly what you’re going through. Lean on each other to get through the tough days. Share resources and ideas. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Particularly those of you who are new to this space. Take care of yourself.  Make time for your family and friends. Meditate. Take time for you. Your mental health is so important. Take a break when you feel the pressure overtaking and then get back to it.— Lori Aguino was the director of elections for the State of Washington. She is now the executive director of<a href="https://voteathome.org/"> The National Vote at Home Institute</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3530" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boockvar-251x300.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="164" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boockvar-251x300.jpg 251w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boockvar.jpg 351w" sizes="(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px" />Kathy Boockvar</strong>: More than anything else, I want to thank election officials at every level for all the incredible work you do day in and day out for our democracy, to ensure that every eligible American can exercise their fundamental right to vote.  My advice for 2022 is for you to remember that you are not alone. Know that there are many of us out there who are here for you, who understand how hard you are working, and who are available to support you and advocate for you. Take advantage of the many no-cost resources available, such as the election security protections and guidance available via the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the EI-ISAC.  CIS and the EI-ISAC are here to support you, to help you stay connected to the election community at large, and to help you stand strong against the cyber threats and other challenges facing us today. — Kathy Boockvar is the former Pennsylvania Secretary of State and now serves as the  Vice President of Election Operations at<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/"> CIS</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6728" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SDaitch-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Steve Daitch</strong>: I’ve been fortunate to learn from a lot of great people in the field, and the best lesson that I’ve learned is this: think critically about whom you are serving, and do the work that best meets their needs. As a county election official in Michigan, my direct “customers” were our voters, poll workers, candidates, and local clerks. Each of these groups have different needs, but these needs are interconnected. Voters benefit when poll workers are well trained. Poll workers benefit when voters have access to good information. And sometimes the best way to serve your customers is for you to take a break. Build in time to recover from the stresses of the election cycle – election administration is a marathon, not a sprint, and your voters need you for the long haul. — Steve Daitch is the former elections coordinator of Ottawa County, Michigan. He is now a Senior Subject Matter Expert for the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7865" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Magney-198x300.png" alt="" width="136" height="206" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Magney-198x300.png 198w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Magney.png 572w" sizes="(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px" />Reid Magney</strong>: My advice to those still in the trenches in 2022 is to prepare for election administration to be a significant campaign issue in the midterms. In addition to all the normal campaign issues, candidates are going to be talking about elections like never before. Prepare for that by making sure your website and voter education materials explain not just what the laws require, but how election administrators carry out their duties in your state or locality. Use stories (video, if possible) to illustrate how you do your job. Continue to take advantage of the media&#8217;s newfound interest in the arcane details of election administration. When facts get twisted in the heat of the campaign later next year, you&#8217;ll be ready to point to the factual materials you prepared about how elections actually work. Finally, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help when things get tough in 2022. Take advantage of the public&#8217;s wider recognition of the trouble most election officials went through in 2020 and 2021, and ask your boss for the resources you need, especially at crunch time. And don&#8217;t forget to call your former colleagues for ideas or just to commiserate. You&#8217;re not alone! .— Reid Magney was the public information officer for Wisconsin&#8217;s elections agency for 12 years before becoming communications director in 2021 at<a href="https://www.voteriders.org/"> VoteRiders</a>.</p>

Supporters of Sawant had set up pop-up voting sites throughout the district where voters could printout and cast their ballots. The practice caused some consternation for people who questioned the legality of it, but Wise noted that the practice is completely legal. &#8220;We heard this election from about 100 voters that were concerned and I think frustrated,&#8221; said Wise, in reference to the tents where people were printing ballots for the recall election. &#8220;That&#8217;s a program that we&#8217;ve offered our voters for over a decade now. Since 2010, voters have been able to go online and access their ballots,&#8221; said Wise, who believes the print-at-home option enhances access to voting. Wise told King 5 the online platform allows registered voters to replace their ballots and print them at home, putting the ballot in a postage-paid envelope. She said the ballots are held to the same strict standard and verification as ones mailed out by the elections department. In this particular election, 3% of ballots, or 1,400, were printed. Wise said the normal rate during an election is one-half of one percent. Given the small margin, it is highly likely the ballots printed at pro-Sawant locations were the difference in the race.</p>

Only 120 people, or 10 percent of those casting ballots, voted in favor of the measure to ban the use of Accuvote machines and require all ballots be counted by hand. 1,077, or 90 percent, voted against it. The measure was put on the ballot after a petition was filed with the signatures of 52 registered voters, according to Marguerite Morgan, Greenland’s town clerk and tax collector. “I have been a clerk here for 15 years and we have never had an issue and that was one of the questions I asked the petitioner, to prove to us, tell me where we&#8217;ve had the problem so we could correct it. There was no problem,” Morgan told WMUR. The town had pre-printed 700 ballots for the election, but turnout was so high hundreds more had to be printed Saturday. Morgan had to sign each one of the ballots printed Saturday by hand, which were not machine readable, so they had to be counted by hand.</p>

Assembly members passed a slew of amendments to the ordinance Tuesday night before adjourning when the clock hit midnight and postponing its vote to a meeting next week. The Assembly’s debate on Tuesday night was preceded by extensive public testimony from people in support of and against the changes. The ordinance would require election observers to complete city-provided training and tour of the election center. The changes would also enshrine in code that observers must follow the Election Observer’s Handbook and that the municipal clerk, with “good cause,” can limit the number of observers. Many who criticize the changes say they put too much power in the hands of the municipal clerk and could mean the clerk could limit the public’s ability to observe the election process. Some questioned why the Assembly changed language in city code to restrict election observers from having devices capable of recording images or sound within certain areas of voting and ballot processing locations. “The ordinance does not change the number of observers allowed or the times when observers are authorized to observe election activities. It does not change the reasons why an observer may be asked to leave an election location or the MOA election team’s commitment to ensuring that observers understand the election process and showing them all aspects of that process,” Assembly chair Suzanne LaFrance said.</p>

Bill White (R-Joplin) has filed Senate Bill 670 that calls for the official ballot in Missouri to be a<a href="https://939theeagle.com/missouri-lawmakers-to-tackle-paper-ballot-legislation-in-2022/"> paper ballot hand-marked by the voter</a>. The legislation would also bans the use of touchscreen and electronic vote-counting machines starting in January 2024. It also would prohibit the use of direct-recording voting machines. “Actually, I think it’s great that we are banning direct recording electronic voting machines. Nobody is using them anymore. Everybody has purchased the newest versions of voting equipment,” says Boone County Clerk Brianna Lennon said..</p>

Lisa Reynolds, D-Portland says that she plans to introduce legislation in February  that would<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2021/12/oregon-lawmakers-will-again-try-restoring-prisoners-voting-rights.html"> restore voting rights to thousands of felons while they’re still incarcerated</a>. “There is a segment of our population who have had this fundamental right stripped from them,” she said. “The right to vote is fundamental. It upholds the foundation of our democracy and democracy works better when everyone has a voice.” If passed, roughly 12,000 to 15,000 incarcerated people would have their right to vote restored. The reform would mean that all people incarcerated in the state, whether in state prisons or county jails, could vote while in detention. Oregon has barred inmates from voting since the territory created the disenfranchisement law in an 1857 constitutional convention. Although the proposal never made it out of committee in the 2021 Oregon session, advocates predicted it stands a better chance in February and they expect most Democratic lawmakers to sign on as sponsors. This year, Reynolds said she’s intent on proposing a policy change that shouldn’t trigger any fiscal impact and is talking to the Corrections Department to assuage concerns about needing additional staff.</p>

Bill No. 34-0149, sponsored by Sen. Alma Francis Heyliger, seeks to make<a href="http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/bill-that-aims-for-v-i-election-transparency-held-in-committee/article_5fa6f97f-e24a-53d2-96a6-6afc5fea523b.html"> official election records</a> accessible to the public through cloud-based services, but at a Rules and Judiciary Committee hearing, lawmakers voiced concerns the information could be misused. “We have a responsibility to ensure that we protect the information we gather in public records,” said Sen. Carla Joseph. “We use the states to compare to the Virgin islands, but we have to look at this very carefully and customize it locally.” The bill was held by the committee for further consideration. Elections Supervisor Caroline Fawkes said the Election’s Board and her office did not support the legislation, and argued only registered voters should have access to the information.</p>

The legislation would require election officials to provide accessible voting options — like auditory machines for people who are blind. They would also have to make rules about how to verify signatures for people who can’t sign their name consistently. Weber County Clerk/Auditor Ricky Hatch said this is already common practice in election offices around Utah, but putting it in state law is especially important as more election officials leave their jobs. “Twenty-five percent of our county clerks have retired or resigned in the past 12 months,” Hatch said. “It&#8217;s hard coming in. … Sometimes you&#8217;re going to miss things when you&#8217;re new and having it in code is one way to help ensure these voters are being served properly.”</p>

In the settlement, the postal service agreed to take “extraordinary measures” to deliver ballots for the 2022 midterm elections, such as those used during the November 2020 election. “Consistent with the Postal Service’s steadfast commitment to fulfilling our vital role in the nation’s electoral process, we agreed to continue to prioritize monitoring and timely delivery of Election Mail for future elections,” Thomas Marshall, the USPS general counsel said in a statement. “This will include outreach and coordination with election officials and election stakeholders, including the NAACP.” The agency said it would publicly post mail-in ballot guidance no later than Feb. 1 for federal primary elections, and Oct. 1 for general elections. USPS agreed to post the guidance through 2028. The postal service will also provide weekly reports on service performance starting six weeks before general elections.</p>
<p>Judge Eric Davis of the Delaware Superior Court has found that Fox News&#8217; coverage of election fraud after the 2020 election may have been inaccurate, and is<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/16/media/fox-news-court-dominion/index.html"> allowing a major defamation case against the TV network</a> to move forward. Davis declined to dismiss Dominion Voting System&#8217;s lawsuit against Fox News in a significant ruling last week. The ruling will now allow Dominion to attempt to unearth extensive communications within Fox News as they gather evidence for the case, and the company may be able to interview the network&#8217;s top names under oath. At this stage, the court must assume Dominion&#8217;s claims about Fox News are true. Still, Davis called out, in the 52-page opinion, that Fox News may have slanted its coverage to push election fraud, knowing the accusations were wrong. Dominion alerted the network&#8217;s anchors and executives to information that disproved accusations of widespread vote-switching following Donald Trump&#8217;s re-election loss, the judge noted. &#8220;Nevertheless, Fox and its news personnel continued to report Dominion purported connection to the election fraud claims without also reporting on Dominion&#8217;s emails &#8230; Given that Fox apparently refused to report contrary evidence, including evidence from the Department of Justice, the Complaint&#8217;s allegations support the reasonable inference that Fox intended to keep Dominion&#8217;s side of the story out of the narrative,&#8221; the judge wrote. The court rejected Fox News&#8217; claims that it was able to discuss Trump advisers&#8217; election fraud conspiracies under principles of news reporting.</p>

The suit, filed by Rep. Ron Hanks (R-Canon City) and several local elected officials, contends the office failed to properly test voting equipment before the 2020 election, deleted election files and are obstructing counties’ ability to conduct independent audits of election results. In its motion to dismiss the case, the Secretary of State’s office says the allegations are all based on unfounded election conspiracy theories. “The plaintiffs’ allegations are patently false, and their legal justifications without merit,” Secretary of State Jena Griswold said. “Nationwide, bad actors are abusing the judicial process to spread disinformation, undermine confidence in elections and suppress the right to vote. It is extremely concerning to see elected officials here in Colorado spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.” Griswold’s office says state law requires it to certify, or de-certify, a county’s election equipment; it is the job of county clerks to maintain copies of election files, and not the state; and counties aren’t barred from conducting audits, just not by those who are not qualified.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, they Mesa County Commission filed suit against Clerk Tina Peters because she<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/breaking/county-withdraws-lawsuit-against-peters/article_41c1e9ee-6378-11ec-862f-27a1f1b08a5a.html"> hadn’t attested to a legal action</a> taken by the Mesa County Board of County Commissioners last week to extend a contract with Runbeck Election Services to print ballots and envelopes for the 2022 primary and general elections. As clerk, one of her duties is to supply a clerk to the board, which is to prepare agendas, maintain minutes, preserve and catalog official public records and documents, and to attest to documents signed by the board chair that are approved by the county’s three commissioners. After a week had passed, and when Peters had attested to everything else the board did at its Dec. 13 commissioner meeting except the Runbeck contract, the county sent her a letter warning her that if she didn’t do the job the law requires of her, she would be sued. On Tuesday, a day after the county’s deadline for her to attest to the board’s decision, it filed its lawsuit. According to The Daily Sentinel, the suit was withdrawn on Wednesday after Peters completed the legally required tasks.</p>

Walker said he needed to hear arguments from both sides during a trial next month so he can decide whether the law meets constitutional muster. The court’s “task is to balance defendants’ proffered justifications for the challenged provisions against the burdens, if any, those provisions place on those voters for whom the provisions present an impediment to voting,” Walker wrote in a 21-page order. Walker, who consolidated four challenges in a trial scheduled to start Jan. 31, said the plaintiffs “have come forward with evidence suggesting that the challenged provisions impose at least some burdens on Florida’s electorate.”</p>

In a signed order obtained by the Daily Journal Howorth found that five illegal votes were cast during municipal Democratic primary races in Nettleton held April 6. The judge also found that incumbent Mem Riley only won the race by four votes against challenger Phillip Baulch, and that those five illegal votes were not separated from the legally cast ballots. Howorth vacated the results of the election and ordered that a new one be held. Three ballots deemed illegitimate by Howorth were affidavit ballots that were not signed by a poll worker. In two other cases, Howorth agreed with arguments put forward by Baulch’s attorney, Sam Begley, that votes were cast by two people who are not residents of Nettleton and therefore were not eligible to vote in municipal elections there.</p>

Leavitt gave them until Jan. 10, at the suggestion of a lawyer representing Wolf’s top election official in a separate lawsuit involving Fulton County’s voting machines. In that lawsuit, Fulton County is contesting the state’s decertification of voting machines it used in last year’s presidential election. State lawyers last week discovered that Fulton County commissioners had voted to allow a contractor hired by Senate Republicans to download data and software on the voting systems.</p>

The commission deactivated the registrations for the voters after a two-year legal fight. That lawsuit, filed in 2019 by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty, argued that the commission should have deactivated voters flagged as potentially having moved within 30 days of notice being given. The new lawsuit argues that the 31,854 voters should not have had their registrations deactivated because they weren&#8217;t given notice that it could happen or a deadline to avoid it.</p>

Montana will not launch an election-management system that isn’t ready, and it’s not ready,” she said in a statement Monday morning, after a meeting with her staff, county election officers and the new system’s developer. Jacobsen’s decision means the 2022 elections in Montana will use the state’s current voter database, known as Montana Votes. Jacobsen said her office will be discussing the next steps for the new system with the company developing the software, but gave no indication what those steps may be. Jacobsen told lawmakers last week she wouldn’t launch the new system, called ElectMT, unless local election officials agreed it was ready – and those officials said last Thursday it was not ready, because it still had some unresolved glitches and had not been tested in a live election.</p>
