							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Stewards of Democracy</strong><br />
<em>Focusing on the People in Election Administration</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7284" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stewards-of-Democracy.png" alt="" width="222" height="184" />The Stewards of Democracy Initiative (SDI) is a new research effort from Reed College’s Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC). The SDI was announced to the public on July 27, 2021 with an inaugural<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/events/sdi-webinar-recording/"> webinar</a>, “Stewards of Democracy Initiative: A Conversation.” The event featured<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kdIJNHF8NoE3BszWc3cg43tStuQVXC4E6GKhiElGzg/edit"> local election officials engaging with academic researchers</a>, focusing on the people in election administration and how to support and sustain the elections community.</p>
<p>In addition to the SDI academic researcher track leaders we’ll be discussing shortly, webinar panel participants included the following local election officials: Lance Gough, former Executive Director of the Chicago Board of Elections, Brianna Lennon, County Clerk of Boone County, Missouri, and Remi Garza, Elections Administrator for Cameron County, Texas. Heather Creek of the Democracy Fund, an SDI sponsor, also participated in this event.</p>
<p>Topics discussed at the webinar included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity in Election Administration: Path to the Profession</li>
<li>The Voice of Local Election Officials in Election Reform</li>
<li>Nonprofit Funding &amp; Election Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>The webinar was attended by over 75 participants from state, local and federal election offices, academic research institutions, non-profits, election technology providers, and other stakeholder groups. If you did not get a chance to attend, you can check out the<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/events/sdi-webinar-recording/"> recorded video</a> on EVIC’s website.</p>
<p>Incidentally, members of the elections community might know EVIC as the “Early Voting Information Center” at Reed College. However, the EVIC team recently completed a renaming and rebranding of the Center to reflect its expanding platform of work beyond “early voting” – where it all began over a decade ago – to include such efforts as<a href="https://monitoringtheelection.us/oregon-election-audit-project"> performance auditing of Oregon’s election system</a>, research on the<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2017/06/07/433677/votes-automatic-voter-registration/"> turnout effects of automatic voter registration</a>,<a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/paths-forward-lessons-in-supporting-local-election-administration-and-officials/"> three years of surveys of local election administrators</a> known as the Local Election Official (LEO) surveys in partnership with the Democracy Fund, and now the SDI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7285" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gronke-Quote.png" alt="" width="1012" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gronke-Quote.png 1012w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gronke-Quote-300x84.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gronke-Quote-768x214.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" />The idea for the SDI grew directly out of the LEO surveys with the intent of bringing together a leading group of academic researchers, and pairing them with elections practitioners, in order to focus on understanding and advancing the work of America’s local election officials and how they promote electoral integrity.</p>
<p>The SDI effort is led by Paul Gronke, founder and director of EVIC and a recipient of an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship to support his SDI work. <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/">Gronke and his team at EVIC</a> implement the SDI program thanks to the generous support of the<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, the<a href="https://www.carnegie.org/about/"> Andrew S. Carnegie Corporation</a>, the<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/"> Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab</a>, the<a href="http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/"> University of Southern California Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy</a> and<a href="https://reed.edu/"> Reed College</a>.</p>
<p>The SDI encompasses four tracks of research, each led by leading election science scholars:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The People and Paths to Election Administration</strong> is led by<a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/polisci/directory/professorial-faculty/bridgett-king/"> Bridgett King (Auburn)</a> and<a href="https://www.reed.edu/faculty-profiles/profiles/manson-paul.html"> Paul Manson (Reed College)</a>. The LEO community is overwhelmingly female (75%), white (98%), and over age 50. This research will work to understand the reasons for these patterns and to identify how to begin to move the community to be more representative of a diversifying American electorate.</li>
<li><strong>Amplifying and Elevating the Voice of LEOs in Election Reform</strong> is led by<a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~kimballd/"> David Kimball (University of Missouri, St Louis)</a>,<a href="https://www.pspa.msstate.edu/about/faculty/staff.php?id=tm2292&amp;itk=332f0fcfd84d6521ecf9139864f9994f"> Lia Merivaki (Mississippi State University)</a>, and<a href="https://www.marasuttmannlea.com/"> Mara Suttman-Lea (Connecticut College)</a>. This research focuses on the values, norms, and beliefs of local officials – the “ethos of election administration” – and how these officials think about election administration, electoral integrity, and election reforms.</li>
<li><strong>The 2020 Experience: Elections, Pandemics, and Death Threats</strong> led by<a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1032675"> Christian Grose (University of Southern California)</a> and Paul Gronke examine the 2020 election experience in depth, focusing on two areas. The first is the role of non-profit and philanthropic support of elections. Grose is the academic leader of the<a href="https://priceschool.usc.edu/democracy-grants-for-voting-access-and-election-administration/"> USC Schwarzenegger Institute</a> which provided millions of dollars in support of local officials in 2020. They will examine what impact those grants had and what the future holds for non-profit support in the elections space. Second, this group will look at how LEOs managed death threats, massive disruptions to their work, and other challenges in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Forward: Repairing the Damage, Expanding the Pipeline, and Protecting Our Democracy</strong> is a collaboration by all of the track leaders and focuses on lessons learned and how to move forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>The EVIC team has been implementing the structure of the SDI behind the scenes for the past six months by talking with election administration and election science scholars, state and local election officials, thought leaders in the nonprofit sector, and other stakeholders quickly finding widespread agreement that a vital part of what made the 2020 election the safest and most secure in American history was the leadership and staff in thousands of local election offices around the country. At the same time, many of the efforts to identify “lessons learned” after the 2020 election cycle are ignoring these same people – to their peril, according to Gronke.</p>
<p>Currently, EVIC is forming a practitioner advisory board for the SDI to provide feedback and mentoring, and to keep the track leader researchers focused on the real-world, practical impact of their research. Next up for the SDI is additional webinars, production of a set of materials directed at the elections community outlining lessons learned and paths moving forward, an in-person convening later this fall, and publishing a book.</p>
<p>“Policy changes can be well-meaning but can fail if they ignore the people who have to implement these policies,” says Gronke.

The announcement comes after the DOJ last month indicated that criminal law enforcement would play a key role in the Biden administration’s push to protect voting rights and safeguard elections. “A threat to any election official, worker, or volunteer is a threat to democracy,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who will lead the effort. “We will promptly and vigorously prosecute offenders to protect the rights of American voters, to punish those who engage in this criminal behavior, and to send the unmistakable message that such conduct will not be tolerated.” In a statement, DOJ said its new task force would combine efforts from multiple entities within the department, including its criminal, civil rights and national security divisions, as well as the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In <a href="https://www.lakenewsonline.com/story/news/2021/08/03/no-damages-were-made-election-equipment/5475822001/">Camden County, Missouri</a>, one man was under arrest after creating a disturbance in an Autumn Village polling location. In <a href="https://www.newstribune.com/news/news/story/2021/aug/04/low-turnout-leads-to-long-election-day/882195/">Jefferson City, Missouri</a> it was slow going for poll workers in a special election.  In <a href="https://www.9and10news.com/2021/08/03/voters-show-up-to-canceled-election-in-whitewater-township/">Whitewater Township, Michigan</a>, a marijuana ballot initiative election was canceled following a late-Monday court order, but that did stop voters from turning up at the polls anyway. In <a href="https://www.thenewsherald.com/2021/08/03/taylors-election-results-could-be-delayed-two-weeks/">Taylor Township, Michigan</a>, it may take up to two weeks for results to be announced due to write-in campaigns for mayor and city council. It was slow going, but smooth sailing for voters and poll workers in <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article253227833.html">Sedgwick</a> and <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/08/03/shawnee-county-got-new-electronic-poll-books-topeka-election/5463455001/">Shawnee</a> counties in Kansas. In <a href="https://www.wkar.org/election-2021/2021-08-04/what-lansings-election-turnout-could-reveal-about-changing-voting-habits">Lansing, Michigan</a>, 76% of those who cast a ballot in Tuesday’s election did so via mail/absentee ballot. Four years ago that number was 44%. Overall turnout in Lansing remained relatively low though at just about 15%.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7227" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.11.19-AM.png" alt="" width="206" height="164" />Sí, pero en español:</strong> The League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa (LULAC) is asking Secretary of State Paul Pate to<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2021/08/03/lulac-asks-secretary-of-state-to-allow-non-english-voting-materials/"> allow voting materials to be published and completed in languages other than English</a>. Pate has 60 days to respond to the petition, which asks for clarification about the law and requests that Pate allow non-English voting materials statewide. LULAC may bring legal action if Pate does not respond in that time. The issue stems from a 2002 law that declared English as the official language of Iowa — and therefore the language of official documents, meetings, publications and other state business. The state had continued to provide voter registration forms in Spanish until it was sued by Rep. Steve King (R) in 2007. A state court ruled in 2008 that voter registration forms must be in English only. LULAC is requesting Pate issue guidance for 97 counties—two are covered by Sec. 203 of the Voting Rights Act—about whether it is legal to translate and distribute voting information in other languages. In an emailed statement, Pate said that he had reached out to Spanish-speaking voters in past elections and would continue to do so. “My office has conducted numerous outreach efforts with the Spanish speaking community to help them understand Iowa’s election laws and deadlines,” Pate said. “That includes ads on TV, radio and print, as well was working with the Iowa Office of Latino Affairs.”</p>

Entitled<a href="https://whnt.com/news/state-archives-announces-new-exhibit-on-womens-suffrage/"> “Justice Not Favor: Alabama Women &amp; the Vote,”</a> the new exhibit, presented by the Alabama Department of Archives and History (ADAH), will focus on two of Alabama’s leading advocates for voting rights: Pattie Ruffner Jacobs and Amelia Boynton Robinson. The exhibition will explore the story of voting rights for Alabama women, including the long fight for the 19th Amendment, which was ratified in 1920, and the modern Civil Rights era. Jacobs, a Birmingham native, who became one of the state’s leading suffragettes in the early 20th century, and Selma’s Robinson will both have new bronze busts added to the ADAH’s Statuary Hall. They will be the first statues of women in the hall. Both works of art were sculpted by Alabama artist Clydetta Fulmer and forged at Fairhope Foundry. “These additions to our statuary collection and the opening of Justice Not Favor represent a step forward in the Archives’ commitment to deliver an inclusive presentation of Alabama’s history,” said Steve Murray, director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History. ““Alabama women have organized, petitioned, lobbied, and voted to have influence on public life and policy. Examining their motivations, their achievements, and their setbacks helps us to better understand the Alabama experience.” The exhibit is on display through May 31, 2022.</p>

Jon Ossoff (D) has introduced the<a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-senator-says-new-bill-would-establish-statutory-federal-right-to-vote"> &#8220;Right to Vote Act,&#8221;</a> which he said would create the first-ever affirmative Federal voting rights guarantee for all U.S. citizens. The bill&#8217;s intent, Ossoff said in a statement, would establish a statutory right to vote in federal elections. Americans would be able to challenge, in court, any policy that restricts ballot access. The bill raises the bar for states to justify policies that might make it harder for citizens to vote in federal elections. It also provides measures to aid Americans with registering to vote, obtaining an ID required to vote, casting a ballot and ensuring that ballot is counted. &#8220;The Right to Vote Act will for the first time enshrine the right to vote in Federal statute and allow U.S. citizens to challenge in court any policy that makes it harder for them to participate in elections,&#8221; Ossoff said.</p>
<p>Sens. Gary Peters (D-Michigan) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) have introduced legislation that would would create a new task force at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to combat deepfake technologies. <a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/bipartisan-bill-eyes-dhs-task-force-to-combat-deepfakes/">The Deepfake Task Force Act </a>would charge the DHS task force with creating a coordinated plan to explore how a “‘digital content provenance’ standard could assist with reducing the spread of deepfakes, develop tools for content creators to authenticate their content and its origin, and increase the ability of civil society and industry leaders to relay trust and information about the source of the deepfakes to consumers.” The senators said the task force would include experts from academia and the public and private sectors. “Deepfakes represent a unique threat to our national security and our democracy,” said Sen. Portman. “For most of human history seeing meant believing, but now that is becoming less and less true thanks to deepfakes. Combined with the network effects created by social media, fake videos or pictures can travel around the world in an instant, tricking citizens. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation because establishing a deepfake task force at the Department of Homeland Security will help solve this problem by making progress to develop standards so that companies, tech platforms, journalists, and all Americans can track and authenticate content so we can better separate the truth from the lies.”</p>

City Councilors voted unanimously Monday to put the measure on the ballot. Council President Gary Rairdon, who previously spoke against it, and Councilor Elliot Storey were absent. No members of the public spoke on the topic at the meeting. If approved by voters, ranked-choice voting would be used in the mayor’s race and to elect city councilors and other applicable local seats when there are three or more candidates and no candidate has won by more than 50% of the votes. The change would cost about an additional $30,000 per election. City Clerk Angela Holmes said ranked choice voting would have been applicable in four elections between 2013 and 2019, including two mayoral races.</p>

Chris Sununu has<a href="https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/sununu-signs-election-related-bills-into-law/article_7fb76365-10a9-5a98-853b-525ffa67f54c.html"> signed a handful of elections-related bills into law</a>. House Bill 77, a measure requiring town and city clerks to provide daily notifications to the Secretary of State’s Office of any filings for elected office. Rep. Ralph Boehm, a Litchfield Republican, was the prime sponsor. House Bill 223, which was also signed into law, authorizes political parties to subscribe to a list of absentee ballot requests, which will be provided by the secretary of state. Sponsors of the bill include Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, and Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican. Previously, candidates who were running for statewide office could request the list. The bill also adds the date the absentee ballot was returned to the information that will be provided by the secretary of state. House Bill 285 modifies how voter checklists are verified. Current law requires the secretary of state to submit a list of every city or town that has a registered voter matching a given death record. The new law adds the requirement that the secretary of state provide information to municipalities where the name on the death certificate is a partial match to their voter checklist. House Bill 476 loosens the requirement that election officials live in the same voting district as the additional polling place where they are working. Instead, it requires election officials to live in the same town they are serving. For cities, the law requires election officials to live in the same city ward where they are working.</p>
<p>Sununu has vetoed House Bill 98 which would have<a href="https://www.conwaydailysun.com/news/local/sununu-vetoes-early-voting-for-state-primary/article_e6f5fc56-f3b2-11eb-9f24-8fef0a090a09.html"> moved the state’s primary</a> from the second Tuesday in September to the first Tuesday in August. In his veto message, the governor said the change would move the election and campaign season into the middle of summer. This is a time when many Granite Staters are enjoying their vacations and are far less likely to be involved in the electoral process,” Sununu wrote in his veto message. “This change could lead to depressed voter engagement in the election and reduced turnout.” The bill had bipartisan support in the House and Senate and supporters said it would help level the playing field for challengers with little time to mend party fences, raise money or get their message out, while incumbents have name recognition and an existing fund-raising apparatus.</p>

The Alaskan Independence Party, a Libertarian politician and a Republican attorney had sued to stop the state from implementing Ballot Measure 2, which voters approved last year. Alaskans for Better Elections, the group that backed the measure, joined the state in defense. Attorney Ken Jacobus represented the plaintiffs argued that the new law forces candidates to run together and violates their freedom of association. Miller rejected that argument, saying candidates can pick and choose who they want to run with. “No candidate is being ‘forced’ to team up with another candidate; rather, they choose, early on,’” Miller wrote. Plaintiffs also argued that a four-person open primary violates political parties’ freedom of association by allowing a candidate to identify with a political party that did not nominate them. Miller rejected that argument, saying in part that the Alaska Constitution’s freedom-of-speech section “says nothing about political parties’ right to mandate what words appear on a ballot.”</p>

Neureiter ordered the two lawyers, Gary D. Fielder and Ernest John Walker, to pay the legal fees incurred by people and entities they sued, including Facebook Inc and voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems Inc. The amount of money the two will need to pay has not yet been determined by Neureiter, who has asked Dominion and Facebook to provide documentation about how much they spent. In the order, the judge said the lawyers sowed doubt over President Joe Biden’s victory with no evidence. “Albeit disorganized and fantastical, the Complaint’s allegations are extraordinarily serious and, if accepted as true by large numbers of people, are the stuff of which violent insurrections are made,” the judge said.</p>

For the first time, election results for each contest will include the total number of registered voters, poll book totals, turnout percentage and the number of votes cast by absentee ballot and at the polls on Election Day for each precinct. Kalamazoo County Clerk and Register of Deeds Meredith Place announced the new website in advance of this week’s election. “My goal when I ran for clerk in 2020 was to establish trust and public confidence in our election process by increasing transparency in election administration,” Place said. “If our system allows for more timely election results distribution and for more information to be reported, then we need to make it public for all.” During the November 2020 election, unofficial results did not come until more than 24 hours after polls closed. Starting with this week’s special election, even if ballot tabulation may not be complete on election night, this new website will show the public exactly which precincts have been counted and those precincts that are still outstanding, including ballots cast at the polls on Election Day.</p>

According to Carolina Public Press, all 100 counties in the Tarheel State will be<a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/47404/sending-data-to-the-cloud-nc-makes-long-awaited-election-system-updates/"> transitioning their voter registration data to a Cloud-based operating system</a>. According to CPP, This is an early step in what will be a yearslong and nearly $3 million process to upgrade state and county election systems to improve security, usability and efficiency. Originally designed in 1998 and put in place statewide in 2006, North Carolina’s current election information management system is made up of a network of data servers in the state office and every county, woven together by a network of computer programs. Updates planned over the next three years will make cybersecurity practices more consistent across all 100 county boards of elections, streamline updates to the back-end systems, write new software for use at the county and state levels, and replace the state servers with new hardware, according to Brian Neesby, chief information officer for the State Board of Elections. Moving voter registration data from county servers to the cloud lays the foundation for all the other changes.  “This is a big step toward the implementation of modernization as opposed to talking about modernization,” said Derek Bowens, Durham County’s election director.</p>
