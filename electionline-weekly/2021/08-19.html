The EAVS collects election administration data from local election jurisdictions in all 50 states, the territories, and the District of Columbia. The EAVS report includes voter registration, military and overseas voting, vote by mail, early and Election Day polling operations, voter participation, and election technology. The EAC submitted the 2020 EAVS to the 117th Congress on August 16, 2021 and it is <a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDow2BvR2CXg7N9-2B-2FWHWfllWSdO1ilcqelbo7MrawDSBtuiFxxAMq-2B0wsJaXK5JGiOnVJTTxvfVJ94dHslhhoyEkTCWr4w-2FB6Bzc0uYDs96OZSIsjUtEh5m-2BqVziFfPAZ4rw-3D-3DslSV_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJp6XVslCYzuyeoHqFjcTFWc4MwS0jaNc5O07Wrn6-2BBkvJOGHcLIh6XrG2INVFPPqJbCpH2LvfS7k05qAbmtMb-2FSIamidjOm4VSENG1CO8DEc79nkt5kSARN6HOgoxfDq3IuHiHID86sY3bbV0YlROvnIeBwdmB05LME7GqUtK57ben0avPkKFcgsGbcoiyBX-2Ftlr-2Bi3DoPoP83Tgl1msB7V5kOA-2Fd0itF0CDAnkyP-2BYadNooC-2BD8qnEoi72ot1OUOiHucKMuskFhF-2FdxroZRHy6w-3D-3D">now available on the EAC’s website</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the 2020 EAVS:</p>
<ul>
<li>This election saw the highest turnout of any federal general election recorded by EAVS to date with 67.7% of the citizen voting age population casting ballots that were counted.</li>
<li>More than 209 million people were active registered voters for the 2020 general election and more than 161 million voters cast ballots that were counted for this election.</li>
<li>30.5% of voters cast their ballots in-person on Election Day, and 43.1% of the electorate cast their ballots utilizing vote by mail.</li>
<li>States reported a total of 132,556 polling places where 775,101 poll workers assisted voters with in-person early and Election Day voting.</li>
<li>The percentage of poll workers ages 18 to 25 and 26 to 40 increased to 6.2% and 15.0%, respectively.</li>
<li>The percentage of poll workers ages 61 to 70 and 71 and older decreased to 27.3% and 20.1%, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The data from the 2020 EAVS report gives us important insight on an unprecedented election during a pandemic. As election officials, academics, and the Congress continue to study and learn from the 2020 elections, the EAVS data will serve as a foundation for analyzing best practices and informing the future of election administration,” said EAC Chairman Donald Palmer.</p>

<p>The 2020 EAVS data and the accompanying Election Administration Policy Survey (Policy Survey) are used to provide an overview of each aspect of the elections process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnout, voting methods, polling places and poll workers, and election technology are covered in Chapter 1, “Overview of Election Administration and Voting in the 2020 General Election,”</li>
<li>Key laws, rules, policies, and procedures that govern U.S. elections are covered in Chapter 2, “Election Law and Procedure: The Policy Survey,”</li>
<li>Voter registration and list maintenance are covered in Chapter 3, “Voter Registration: NVRA and Beyond,”</li>
<li>Voting by individuals covered under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) is described in Chapter 4, “Military and Overseas Voting in 2020: UOCAVA,”, and</li>
<li>Finally, the methodology of EAVS and the survey instruments are discussed in Chapter 5, “Survey Methodology and Procedures.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2020 EAVS marks the ninth iteration of the biennial survey.</p>
<p>In 2008, the EAC began administering the Statutory Overview which asks states a series of open-ended questions about their specific election laws, definitions, and procedures. Beginning in 2014 the data complied for the EAVS is combined into one report per survey. Prior to 2014, the EAVS consisted of three reports: the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) Report, the Uniformed and Overseas citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) Report, and the Election Day Survey. Additional information about the EAVS and previous reports are available on the <a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDowluKjkw4g-2FT1YiJ7iSvCTQCj62ArXIcX1gxDCltzpDzHMQQIeU70AqBRn5WbnZpqE0PmaPs3vOfuLPr0RRVp4c-3DSZy4_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJp6XVslCYzuyeoHqFjcTFWc4MwS0jaNc5O07Wrn6-2BBkvJOGHcLIh6XrG2INVFPPqJbCpH2LvfS7k05qAbmtMb-2FSIamidjOm4VSENG1CO8DEc7L1ZGV6PJbxgyPgC8MtCjQJyTeRFsrtdVVINzHyotrYSVFlVPwbKr-2FSldSqSCNp7V152AfjwfbDR752hVWvHGIoSW-2F4STtLKStWynBNXwj1P5KJzTMQCE16xH3Gl2QpmdL7j3dLuQdd07pxlltGMiX0eCxdg5M8qSPgzIM6LxDwA-3D-3D">EAC’s website</a>.</p>

The bipartisan group developed<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/election-officials-call-for-audit-guidelines-after-trump-fueled-surge-505562"> six recommendations</a> for states to consider, which can be found<a href="https://www.nass.org/member-resources/nass-task-force-vote-verification-recommendations"> here</a>. These recommendations were approved by the full NASS membership on August 16 during the 2021 NASS Summer Conference. NASS President and Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, and NASS Immediate-past President and New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver co-chaired the task force. “With many NASS members serving as their state’s Chief Election Official, we know firsthand the im­portance of expertly conducting and overseeing credible, transparent and accurate post-election audits. We are proud of the bipartisan work the task force was able to accomplish by developing nonpartisan recom­mendations for states to take into consideration when evaluating their post-election audit processes and procedures. It is our hope this will make a positive impact within the election community and beyond,” Ar­doin and Toulouse Oliver stated jointly. The other members of the task force included: Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, Min­nesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, and Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan.</p>

Fulton is the first county to undergo a performance review created by Georgia’s new<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/how-georgias-new-voting-law-works/GF6PLR44PNESPKR5FXCBE7VEOY/"> voting law</a>, passed by the state’s GOP majority in the Legislature. After the review is completed, the State Election Board will have the power to replace Fulton’s election board with a temporary superintendent who would have authority over vote counting, polling places and staffing. State Election Board members said they hope the performance review will compel Fulton to fix problems with absentee ballot processing and vote-counting procedures. The board voted unanimously to approve the appointees to the panel. “I encourage folks to keep trying to improve and not just throw up their hands,” said Matt Mashburn, a Republican appointee to the state board. Sara Tindall Ghazal, a Democratic appointee, said the performance review panel should resist “tremendous political pressure on both sides to come to preordained conclusions.” The performance review panel’s members are Republican Rickey Kittle, chairman of the Catoosa County elections board; Democrat Stephen Day, a member of the Gwinnett County elections board; and Ryan Germany, general counsel for Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.</p>

In<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/08/alabama-no-longer-allows-covid-concerns-as-reason-for-absentee-ballot.html"> Alabama</a>, COVID-19 is no longer a permitted excuse to request an absentee ballot Birmingham and Mobile city officials asked Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill to reinstate last year’s emergency rules and allow COVID-19 to be a valid excuse for absentee voting. Merrill, in a July 28 letter to Mobile city officials &#8212; which was also forwarded to Birmingham &#8212; said there were no plans to re-instate 2020 rules that allowed concerns about the pandemic as a valid excuse. Merrill, in his letter, said the previous emergency rules expired on May 17. He said the expiration of Alabama’s “State of Emergency” on July 6, also played a role in not re-instating them. “Based on these and other considerations, such as our better understanding of COVID-19 and ways to protect against it, we currently have no plans to re-institute the emergency rules,” Merrill said. In<a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-broward-elections-supervisor-vaccine-mandate-20210814-wnsj2l2xqbatdofgcq7hacrzxe-story.html"> Broward County, Florida</a>, Supervisor of Elections Joe Scott has told poll workers that they must be vaccinated for COVID-19 if they wish to work during the upcoming special primary and general elections to fill a congressional vacancy. He said his directive, which he vetted with the office’s legal counsel, is designed to enhance public safety. “Our poll workers have to engage in close quarters, personal contact with potentially hundreds of voters. So it’s not just for the safety of the public, but for the safety of the individuals who are poll workers as well. We want to keep everybody safe,” Scott said in a telephone interview. “Considering the circumstances and looking at the statistics as to how this Delta variant is spreading, it is important that we do everything we can to keep the public and to keep our employees safe.”</p>

High schools across the state that register 100 percent of the eligible students, who are 18 or older by the next election, to vote will earn the<a href="http://www.chattanoogapulse.com/local-news/schools-education/tennessee-launches-high-school-voter-registration-award/"> Anne Dallas Dudley Gold Level Award</a>. High schools that register at least 85 percent of the eligible students, 18 or older by the next election, will earn the Anne Dallas Dudley Silver Level Award. Tennessee law allows students who will be 18 or older on or before the next election to register to vote. “Our state and our nation are stronger when every eligible Tennessean is registered to vote and casts a ballot on Election Day,” said Secretary of State Tre Hargett. “We are working with county election commissions across our great state to make sure students know that it has it has never been easier to register to vote in Tennessee and to encourage them to make their voices heard by going to the polls on Election Day.” The Secretary of State’s office will present high schools that earn the Gold Level Award with a commemorative plaque and recognize students who led the registration efforts with certificates. For Anne Dallas Dudley Silver Level Award schools, the Secretary of State’s office will mail certificates recognizing the students who led the registration efforts. Anne Dallas Dudley helped lead the successful effort to get the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ratified nationwide and in her home state, Tennessee. On Aug. 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state needed to pass the amendment giving women the right to vote.</p>

The effort still faces significant Republican opposition, however, and the prospects of a filibuster in the Senate. The bill comes after a series of House committee hearings over the past several months to establish a legislative record for modern efforts to suppress minority groups’ voting power.  The bill is designed to respond to several Supreme Court decisions, including the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision that invalidated the mechanism for the Justice Department to preclear election law changes and the Brnovich v. DNC decision from July that restricts when an election change that causes a disproportionate impact to minority communities violates the law. The new language would provide a rolling review of preclearance — meaning the Justice Department could review election law changes in a state if it meets a certain threshold of violations. If a state accumulates 15 violations in 25 years, or 10 with one statewide violation, it would be subject to preclearance for a decade, according to the language introduced Tuesday. The bill would also add another category of “practice-based” preclearance, which would give the Justice Department oversight when a jurisdiction takes certain actions like switching from district-based to at-large elections. Sewell said that such practices have been used in the past to dilute minority votes and should be subject to extra scrutiny. Other new provisions in the bill would create a new test for violations after the fact, which Sewell said comes as a response to the Brnovich decision. The language introduced Tuesday includes two new tests: one for vote dilution cases, such as during redistricting, and another for vote denial claims, such as for a voter ID case. Another provision would allow for the Justice Department or other plaintiffs to sue over a law that has been passed but not yet implemented. That comes in response to testimony during hearings where advocates complained that litigation over a law found to be discriminatory could take years to overturn — with multiple elections occurring in the interim.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, led his colleagues in introducing the<a href="https://www.krwg.org/post/luj-n-leads-introduction-native-american-voting-rights-act-2021"> Frank Harrison, Elizabeth Peratrovich, and Miguel Trujillo Native American Voting Rights Act of 2021</a> (NAVRA) – landmark voting rights legislation that will protect the sacred right to vote and ensure equal access to the electoral process for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and voters living on Tribal lands. NAVRA would enact key measures, such as allowing Tribes to specify the number and locations of requested voter registration sites, drop boxes and polling locations on Tribal lands, and authorizing Tribal ID cards for voting purposes. The bill would also help establish state-level Native American voting task forces to address the unique voting issues faced by voters on Tribal lands by authorizing a $10 million Native American Voting Rights Task Force grant program. It would also require prior Tribal notice and consent before States and precincts could remove, consolidate, or otherwise reduce access to voting locations on Tribal lands. “The Native American Voting Rights Act is a key piece of legislation in the ongoing work to protect and expand native voting rights throughout the country,” said New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. “The Act highlights challenges faced by voters on tribal lands and empowers sovereign tribal governments to find appropriate solutions for their communities. I’m happy to endorse this legislation and I appreciate Senator Ben Ray Luján’s work in bringing it forward and seeking input from my office. I’m especially encouraged that many of the proposals in the Act track current New Mexico law which has some of the most protective voting rights laws in the country.”</p>

One bill introduced by Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, would change state election law to limit access to the qualified voter file to the Secretary of State&#8217;s office and credentialed election officials; county, city and township clerks; and those tasked with maintaining or securing the file.  It would remove &#8220;designated voter registration agency&#8221; from the list of individuals able to access the file. The bill passed 75-33.  Another bill introduced by Rep. Phil Green, R-Millington, would prohibit the electronic poll book at precincts or absent voter counting boards from being connected to the internet until all results have been tabulated. The practice already is in place in precincts throughout the state, prompting some opponents to allege the new law would only serve to confuse. The bill passed 77-31. A third bill introduced by Rep. Ken Borton, R-Gaylord, changes election law to extend retention requirements for ballots from 30 days to 22 months for ballots used in a state or federal primary or election. The retention of election returns &#8212; such as tally sheets, absent voter records or poll lists &#8212; would be reduced from two years to 22 months.</p>
<p>State Rep. Kara Hope (D-Holt) introduce House Bill 5282 which aims to<a href="https://www.wlns.com/news/michigan-state-rep-introduces-bill-to-protect-election-workers-from-harassment/"> protect election workers</a> from harassment. The bill, if passed, will make it illegal to harass, intimidate or prevent election workers from performing their duties. Those found guilty of doing so will be charged with a misdemeanor and up to 90 days in jail or a $500 fine. “This isn’t a partisan issue; it’s an issue of taking care of those who step up to do this vital but underpaid, temporary “Republican and Democratic election officials alike are being terrorized by conspiracy theorists insisting that the election was stolen despite all evidence to the contrary. This is dangerous to our democracy and to those who work hard to ensure we can exercise our right to vote.”</p>

Harckham introduced a new bill that will categorize all members, officers, and employees of the boards of elections statewide as public employees. This will ensure that all hirings of board of elections employees are based on their performance on a civil service exam instead of the current arrangement, which he said encourages patronage, nepotism and ultra-partisanship. Another bill (<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S6220">S. 6220</a>) Harckham introduced earlier this year requires all board of election employees to adhere to the state’s code of ethics for public employees. The code stipulates employees cannot have any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in any business or transaction or professional activity or incur any obligation of any nature that is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of their duties in the public interest.</p>

The legislation, if passed, would require voters to present state issued photo identification to vote, eliminate no-excuse absentee voting, prohibit the use of ballot drop boxes and more. Some of the key changes under<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-documents?id=GA134-HB-387"> House Bill 387</a>, sponsored by Rep. Bill Dean, R-Xenia: Absentee voting: Current law allows any Ohio voter to obtain an absentee ballot to mail in for any reason. HB 387 would only allow this if a voter is disabled, ill or meets other narrow exceptions. It also blocks the Secretary of State from its practice of mailing absentee ballot applications to all voters. Voter identification: Current law allows Ohioans to use either a driver’s license, utility bill, bank statement, military ID or paycheck as voter identification at the polls. HB 387 would only allow state-issued photo identification, with exemptions for people with religious objections to being photographed. Drop boxes: Prohibits boards of elections from processing and counting any ballots returned to a drop box, usually sited outside a county board of elections. Some voters used them in the 2020 election to avoid crowded precincts amid a COVID-19 surge occurring at the time. Voter machines: Blocks elections officials from approving or certifying voting machines unless they’re made in the U.S.; open up their “object code” and “source code” to public inspection; use blockchain technology along with paper ballots; and are not connected to the internet.</p>

The final vote was taken fewer than 20 minutes after a 15-hour filibuster of the bill from state Sen. Carol Alvarado concluded. The bill will next head to the House, where Democrats have delayed its passage by vacating the Capitol, though its eventual passage in the Republican-led legislature is virtually assured.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/politics/texas-voting-restrictions-whats-in-the-bills/index.html"> SB1 includes</a> broad new protection and access for partisan poll watchers, mail-in ballot restrictions, a drive-thru voting ban, restrictions to the early voting timeframe, video surveillance and assistance restrictions. While the bill does add one extra required hour per day of early voting, it sets a specific timeframe in which voting must be done &#8212; banning extended hours and 24-hour voting, a measure used during the pandemic in Harris County that local officials testified was especially popular with voters of color. SB1 also further restricts local election officials, for example, adding criminal penalties for sending unsolicited ballot request forms. Some Democratic amendments, like a cure process for mail-in ballot mistakes, were accepted in the final version of the bill.</p>

According to the settlement that was signed Thursday, for every statewide primary and general election from now till the end of 2024, the tribe will have an early voting site within its reservation. A deadline to keep them on track is in February 2022 — that&#8217;s when the tribe and recorder must agree upon a location. When Gabriella Cázares-Kelly won the election for recorder last year, she promised the community that an early voting site for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe would be one of her top priorities.  “The closure of the Pascua Yaqui early voting site is a clear, modern day example of how Native American voting rights continue to remain under threat,&#8221; Cázares-Kelly said. &#8220;It reminds us that we do not all start from the same starting line and some communities have to work harder to exercise our most basic and fundamental right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mi Familia Vota, Arizona Coalition for Change, Living United for Change in Arizona and Chispa Arizona filed suit in the U.S. District in Arizona this week<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1709167/federal-lawsuit-challenges-two-new-arizona-gop-voting-laws"> challenging two new state election laws</a> claims the policies are unnecessary and designed to make it harder for Arizonans to vote. Those new laws, adopted earlier this year by Republican lawmakers, would remove an estimated 150,000 voters who don’t vote frequently from Arizona’s early ballot mailing list and give voters who forget to sign their early ballot envelopes less time to fix the issue and ensure their vote is counted. They’re asking a judge to prohibit state election officials from enforcing the law on the grounds that they violate the U.S. Constitution and parts of the Voting Rights Act because of the policies’ “discriminatory intent” and, they argue, a lack of a legitimate state interest to change the way the elections are run.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp ordered the Arizona Senate<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/08/18/arizona-audit-maricopa-county-judge-gives-senate-2-weeks-to-release-records/8184325002/"> to turn over thousands of outstanding documents</a> related to the Maricopa County election review by Aug. 31, even as the legal battle over some records held by the private contractor running the effort lingers. The Senate&#8217;s attorney, Kory Langhofer, said the Senate is preparing about 10,000 documents, including emails about the audit, to release in an online reading room where records from the audit are posted. Kemp ordered their release in two weeks. A nonprofit group called American Oversight sued the Senate for records from the audit, as did The Arizona Republic. Both cases are ongoing. The Senate has said it will produce records that are in its possession, but not records held by its contractor, Cyber Ninjas.</p>

Beckloff denied the Long Beach Reform Coalition’s request for the court to order county election officials to pick up the tab for collecting the roughly 100,000 ballots cast in the March 2020 election so they could be counted at a “reasonable” cost, which the coalition contended was outlined in the county’s estimated recount fee schedule. A final ruling is expected soon. In his tentative ruling, Beckloff said that while some voting laws, like those that restrict access to voting, are subject to strict scrutiny, the cost of a recount is not one of those rules. “The right to vote is separate and distinct from the right to request and obtain a recount,” Beckloff wrote in his tentative ruling. “Similarly, a right to obtain a vote recount is separate and distinct from the right to ensure one’s vote is properly counted in the first instance.” Beckloff added that the county did not deny the group’s statutory rights to conduct a recount, instead it was the cost that led the coalition to end its recount efforts.  Beckloff said that state law allows for election officials to pass on the cost of a recount to the requesters and added that the coalition failed to draw a clear line in which the cost of a recount becomes unconstitutional.</p>

According to the News &amp; Observer, lawyers for both the Republican-led Legislature and for a group of challengers argued that the state’s law stripping voting rights from convicted felons has shameful roots in racial discrimination. However, two sides disagree strongly on the motivations behind the current version of the law — and specifically as it applies to people who have already finished serving their time in prison, and have rejoined society, but nevertheless remain forbidden from voting. Felons in North Carolina aren’t forever banned from voting, but they are banned as long as they remain on probation or parole. And that post-prison prohibition is the focus of a lawsuit whose trial began this week.</p>

The all-Republican court sided with Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dade Phelan — and ordered a Travis County district judge to revoke his temporary restraining order blocking the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers whose absences have denied the chamber the number of present members needed to move any legislation. “The legal question before this Court concerns only whether the Texas Constitution gives the House of Representatives the authority to physically compel the attendance of absent members,” Justice Jimmy Blacklock wrote in the court’s opinion. “We conclude that it does, and we therefore direct the district court to withdraw the TRO.”</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/how-veterans-can-protect-american-democracy/">How Veterans Can Protect American Democracy</a>: Democracies around the world are under attack and authoritarianism is on the march in nations like Turkey, Venezuela, Hungary, and Poland, resulting in an unprecedented loss of public faith in our institutions and troubling hyper partisanship here at home. Many Americans understand that democratic values must be protected and passed from one generation to the next, and few take this obligation more seriously than the men and women who have sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and placed their bodies in harm’s way in the defense of the nation. This spirit of service to the country does not end when one leaves the military, and most veterans believe it is their duty to continue to protect American democracy as engaged citizens. Brookings will host a two-part panel discussion on the state of American democracy and the role veterans can play to protect American democracy. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> August 24, 10am Eastern.</p>
<p><a href="https://marchonforvotingrights.org/">March On For Voting Rights</a>: On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King led 250,000 people on a historic March On Washington. There, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, he delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, calling on the nation to rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. At the time, Black Americans were living under the tyranny of laws—called “Jim Crow” laws— that legalized racial discrimination. His speech that day has become one of the defining moments in American history. Today, state legislatures are pushing America back to the Jim Crow era with laws that reinstate systemic discrimination at the ballot box. That is why, on August 28, 2021—58 years to the day after his father’s march—Martin Luther King III will help to lead Americans on another march to demand federal voting rights protection. <strong>When:</strong> August 28. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC and cities throughout the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://nsgic.mclms.net/en/2021ac">NISGIC Annual Conference</a>: The 2021 NSGIC Annual Conference will be held September 20 &#8211; 24 as a hybrid event at the Renaissance Dallas Addison Hotel and leveraging technology to provide for virtual participation, as well.
