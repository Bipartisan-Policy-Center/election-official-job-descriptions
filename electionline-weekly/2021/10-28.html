							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>What to Watch 2021</strong><br />
<em>Odd-year elections bring plenty of headlines, things to watch</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4575" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Although many Americans are already focused on the 2022 mid-term elections, voters head to the polls in numerous states next week to cast their ballots in state and local elections.</p>
<p>While November 2, 2021 may not have the “star power” that November 8, 2022 will have, there will still be plenty of storylines to watch. Many of those storylines are things we watch every Election Day, however in the post-2020 world many of those storylines have taken on new/different meaning.</p>
<p>Electionline won’t be doing<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/11-03/"> dispatches</a> throughout the day like we do during the mid-term and presidential years, but we will be keeping a close eye on things and will report back here next week If you see something we need to know about, ping us on Twitter (@electionline) or drop us an email (mmoretti@electionline.org).</p>
<p><strong>Staffing</strong><br />
With just a few days to go, jurisdictions are still looking for poll workers. While this is a recurring problem (a known known) efforts to recruit poll workers in odd-year elections are often more difficult. In<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/n-j-poll-workers-get-a-pay-raise-in-hopes-of-getting-more-people-to-sign-up/"> New Jersey</a>, the governor issued an executive order increasing pay for poll workers. In<a href="https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/larose-says-ohios-poll-workers-shortage-is-easing-4545879"> Ohio</a>, at least 7,000 poll workers responded to a call by Secretary of State Frank LaRose to sign up to be poll workers and while that’s still helped, some counties are still short. Fortunately in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/27/poll-workers-return-virginia-governor/"> Virginia</a>, many regular poll workers took last year off, have come back and state officials and outreach organizations are confident staffing <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6312" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />needs are met. In addition to securing enough poll workers, several elections offices, especially in Pennsylvania, are either without a current permanent leader or under new leadership. There’s a learning curve for every job, but what impacts could new/interim leadership have on Election Day and Night?</p>
<p><strong>New laws</strong><br />
Voters in several states will be casting ballots under new laws this November. While the typically lower turnout odd-year elections can help officials ease into new voting laws. In<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/new-georgia-voting-rules-bring-changes-to-2021-elections/2IFA5EZ5VBAARIP22PHQKQNMFA/"> Georgia</a>, there are a host of new laws that voters and local officials will be dealing with for the first time.  Voters and local elections officials in<a href="https://dailyiowan.com/2021/10/26/new-voting-rules-cause-absentee-ballot-headaches-for-auditors/"> Iowa</a> have already run into some issues with that state’s new voting laws. Johnson County Elections Technician John Deeth told the Daily Iowan that a new, shorter early voting window and new<a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/state-government-news/2021-10-26/election-officials-say-iowa-voters-should-return-their-ballots-quickly-to-meet-a-new-deadline"> deadlines</a> leave little time to correct problems like a mail delivery issue or a forgotten signature on a ballot. The new law also requires absentee ballots to be in a county auditor’s office by 8pm on Election Day. A special election in portions of<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/467774-early-voting-cd-20/"> Florida</a> will be a first test of that state’s new voting laws. In<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-machines-new-times-to-vote-major-changes-for-new-jersey-voters-this-november/"> New Jersey</a>, the state’s new early voting law means new elections equipment that has required training for elections staff, poll workers and voters. While the new voting laws in Florida, Georgia and Iowa are more restrictive than in years past, <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5781" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />new laws in<a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/10/27/after-historic-voting-reforms-virginians-have-unprecedented-access-to-the-polls/"> Virginia</a> have created unprecedented access to the polls in the commonwealth.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting results</strong><br />
Will losing candidates and voters whose candidates didn’t win accept the results? While the 2020 election was the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/top-officials-elections-most-secure-66f9361084ccbc461e3bbf42861057a5"> most secure in history</a>, a narrative pushed by the former president and his supporters has led many Americans to question the results of the election. Will that persist in 2021? State and local elections officials have<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/10/27/election-disinformation-has-colorado-clerks-trying-new-tactics-to-assure-voters/"> worked tirelessly</a> to dispel the disinformation campaign. In<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/28/virginia-vote-count-governors-race-517401"> Virginia</a>, some counties have shifted their reporting procedures in order to head off conspiracy theorists. Scott Konopasek, the new general registrar of Fairfax County, told Politico “it’s going to look like a wildly different night” in his county this year than in years past. “Right at seven o’clock, or right shortly after seven o’clock, I’ll be reporting the absentee portion,” Konopasek told Politico, noting that those numbers have historically been one of the last things in the evening. He said he anticipates early in-person voting results to come in within an hour of polls closing, and numbers from Election Day precincts should start rolling in around 8 p.m. “The big giant bite of ballots that has, in the past, mysteriously shown up at the end is going to start out at the kickoff this time,” Konopasek said. He noted it was a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction decision, and others will not have the same reporting timeframe that he does. Despite the efforts of state and local officials, some candidates have continued to push the big little lie and have refused to say whether or not they will accept the results if they don’t go their way. If 2020 is any indicator, surely there will be some lawsuits over results but just how many remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Vote by mail vs. Voting in person</strong><br />
Due to the pandemic, voting by mail saw unprecedented numbers in 2020. Although more and more Americans are <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3427" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />vaccinated, will that trend continue or will voters return to in-person voting? If voters do choose to vote by mail, will issues with postage and the<a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/2021/10/27/petersburg-registrar-battles-local-post-office-over-absentee-ballots/8555613002/"> U.S. Postal Service</a> delay the delivery of their ballots? If voters choose to vote in-person will newly trained poll workers be ready? Will voters face issues with<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/27/virginia-poll-watchers-election/"> poll watchers</a> or candidates and campaign volunteers as we’ve<a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/politics/elections/erie-county-district-attorneys-office-investigating-voter-intimidation-fraud-allegations-at-polling-location/71-c9c597b4-0350-4869-9cf2-e65ea8905495"> seen in early voting</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Ballot measures</strong><br />
Elections-related initiatives are on the ballot in several places. In<a href="https://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/2021/10/10/broomfield-ballot-question-2a-ranked-choice-voting/"> Broomfield, Colorado</a> and<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2021/08/ann-arbor-voters-to-decide-election-reform-proposal-in-november.html"> Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, voters will be deciding whether or not to move to a ranked choice voting system for local elections. In<a href="https://denverite.com/2021/10/07/denver-ballot-measures-vg-2021/"> Denver</a>, voters will be voting on whether or not to move the city’s municipal elections from May to April. In<a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2021/10/21/ny-ballot-proposals-2021-redistricting-clean-air-water-voter-registration-absentee-ballots/8523977002/"> New York</a>, there are two statewide voting centric initiatives on the ballot this year. Ballot Proposal 3 would eliminate the 10-day advance voter registration <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3308" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin-300x176.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="176" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin-300x176.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />requirement and essentially allow for same day voter registration. Ballot Proposal 4 would allow for no-excuse absentee voting. The two proposals in New York have<a href="https://www.wamc.org/news/2021-10-26/ny-ballot-propositions-that-would-expand-voting-access-face-gop-backlash"> drawn opposition</a> from the state’s GOP.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Unknowns</strong><br />
And finally, the unknown, unknowns. Nearly 20 years ago (February 2002), late Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was quoted as saying during a Department of Defense briefing: “Reports that say that something hasn&#8217;t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don&#8217;t know we don&#8217;t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.” While this quote was about alleged weapons of mass destruction, there’s probably not a better quote for the administration of elections, especially on Election Day.</p>

Nobody else is coming to our rescue.”</p>

Fremont County Clerk Justin Grantham, who has become frustrated with disinformation being spread by candidates recently poke at a forum hosted by the local Republican party, going over the checks and balances in Colorado’s voting system, including the use of bipartisan election teams, paper ballots, and risk-limiting audits to ensure accuracy.  “A lot of people came up to me afterwards and said, ‘thank you for doing this and we feel better about what&#8217;s going on here in Fremont,’” Grantham told CPR. Efforts to reassure doubting voters go beyond outreach; in many counties, clerks are adding new procedures to back up the accuracy of their results. El Paso county has created a citizen audit tool and put images of all its ballots online, a huge extra task. Over the summer, the county re-ran all of the ballots for the presidential race through Clear Ballot machines, and plans to do that again after this election. Republican Clerk and Recorder Chuck Broerman. Broerman said he’s talked to over a thousand people about the election, but notes that claims of election fraud aren’t new. “There&#8217;s been that undercurrent, but not to the level that it&#8217;s been this year. It&#8217;s just caused us here as election administrators and officials to redouble our efforts, because we&#8217;re confident in our process.”</p>

Antrim County’s results have come under particular scrutiny because initial results briefly showed Joe Biden had won the race in the county and later results showed Donald Trump had won in the county. Though officials attributed the mistake to human error and an audit was performed, Antrim County has been used to push false claims of election fraud. The Michigan Association of County Clerks (MACC) on Monday said Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy nor her office “did anything to purposefully generate incorrect results initially reported for the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election.” Both Democratic and Republican members of the association affirm the issue was not caused by equipment but instead by “innocent human error.” “In the end, the system worked in Antrim County,” St. Joseph County Clerk Lindsay Oswald said. “Clerk Guy caught the mistake and corrected it.” “Because of the many checks and balances we have in place, mistakes like the one in Antrim County are caught and fixed,” Muskegon County Clerk Nancy Waters said. “MACC echoes the findings of the Michigan State Senate Oversight Committee which, after months of testimony and research, found ‘no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud occurred’ during the November 2020 election.”</p>

CNN first reported the news Monday night with Wyman making an<a href="https://twitter.com/KimWyman12/status/1453051472791302146?s=20"> official announcement</a> on Tuesday. Former CISA director Chris Krebs told CNN that he was &#8220;really impressed&#8221; by the choice of Wyman to lead the agency&#8217;s election security efforts. &#8220;Kim doesn&#8217;t see R or D, red or blue,&#8221; Krebs said. &#8220;She&#8217;s committed to delivering democracy for the nation. Everyone wins here.&#8221; In her announcement to supporters, Wyman said, in part: “I am leaving office with a heavy heart, as I love this job and appreciate all you have to help me succeed as secretary of state. The opportunity to serve our country as a guardian of our election system and to be part of an agency that is the tip of the spear defending our country is a high honor.” In a<a href="https://twitter.com/CISAJen/status/1453048601274462220?s=20"> Twitter thread</a>, current CISA Director Jen Easterly said, “Kim &amp; I share a common view that the security of our elections must be a non-partisan effort. As someone who served in R &amp; D administrations, I was looking for the BEST PERSON to lead our Election Security mission. Kim Wyman IS that person. I can&#8217;t wait for her to join the team!”</p>

In Worcester, the ramp was installed at the American Legion East Side Post with the help of Worcester City Councilor Candy Mero-Carlson, as well as Worcester firefighters and volunteers from the Central Massachusetts AFL-CIO. The ramp will permanently be part of the building. Mero-Carlson says it was difficult for many to get up the previous ramp. A group called the &#8216;Ramp Gang,&#8217; which is made up of retired firefighters, decided to help and redirect it towards the parking lot in hopes of making it more convenient. &#8220;This is one of the greatest, you know,&#8221; said Election Commission Vice Chair Winnie Octave. &#8220;I never thought that would be such a big job. This is a real big job and I&#8217;m so proud of all the people who organized it.&#8221; In Madison County, Georgia, the Madison County Rotary Club constructed an access ramp for the Madison County board of elections building. The ramp, which consists of a 16-foot ramp and a six-foot ramp joined by two landings, will make it possible to transport the large and bulky voting machines into the board of election building. “The Rotary Club of Madison County was happy to assist the County Commission in this community service,” Rotary members said.</p>

Alaska’s high court has accepted the appeal under an accelerated timeline that will have justices hear arguments Jan. 18. The justices are expected to issue a summary decision shortly afterward, and that decision will determine how Alaska will conduct its statewide elections in 2022. Last year, 50.6% of participating Alaska voters approved Ballot Measure 2, which significantly changes how Alaska conducts state elections. Attorney Ken Jacobus, a Republican, is representing himself, the Alaskan Independence Party and Libertarian candidate Scott Kohlhaas in a legal effort to overturn that result, arguing that it is impossible to implement the measure in a way that follows the Alaska Constitution and U.S. Constitution. “We’re trying to set aside the whole thing,” he said. Defending against the suit are the state of Alaska, which is in charge of implementing the measure, and Alaskans for Better Elections, successor to the organization that campaigned in favor of the measure.</p>

Robison officially removed Peters as the county’s DEO on Wednesday, October 13. Peters and her attorney Scott Gessler sought to overturn that decision. Mesa Co. resident Heidi Heiss, one of the plaintiffs in the case, shared her thoughts on the matter. She says she got involved after becoming concerned about the Mesa Co. Clerk and Recorder’s Office. Heiss explained that, “I had concerns about what I was seeing in the news&#8230; And hearing from our clerk&#8230; In the media about what had happened and what she was admitting to.” The Supreme Court’s decision not to take up the matter leaves standing the findings of the district court’s ruling in this civil case. The district court found that Clerk Peters neglected her duty and committed “wrongful acts.” Wayne Williams remains the county’s DEO, and Mesa Co. Treasurer Sheila Refiner stays the Election Supervisor.</p>

A 2002 state law mandates all official political documents from the state be written in English, with the exception of voting materials in two counties. Only Buena Vista and Tama counties are allowed to translate election materials, due to their high populations of Hispanic and Indigenous Peoples, respectfully. &#8220;(B)ut Spanish speakers outside Buena Vista County — and other language minorities with limited English-language proficiency — face unnecessary barriers to voting due to an erroneous interpretation and implementation of the English-Only Law,&#8221; according to the lawsuit filed by Washington, D.C.-based election law firm Elias Law Group and Des Moines law firm McCormally &amp; Cosgrove.

Attorney General Josh Shapiro filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Department of State against the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee, Senator Cris Dush and Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman. In court, the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania said the subpoena is an invasion of personal information, which could expose voters to identify theft, financial fraud and is a form of voter suppression. In court, those testifying called the subpoena an invasion of private information. The defense maintained the stance personal information is already shared by state entities. The subpoena requests names, dates of birth, home addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial social security numbers. Voters inside the court expressed the most concern for driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their society security number to be shared. No decision was made as to whether or not voters and organizations can join the lawsuit, but both sides expect a decision to come soon. If they’re told they cannot join the effort to keep their information private, the voters and organizations plan to start their own lawsuit.

Section 24.2-701 states that an applicant must provide this information, unless the person is filling out the application in person. “This requirement is designed to protect the right to vote by ensuring that only the eligible voter may obtain an absentee ballot in his or her name,” the lawsuit states. The affidavit alleges Fairfax County Electoral Electoral Board Chairman Stephen Hunt wrote an email to Brim, in which he confirmed the county was approving absentee ballot applications that did not include the last four digits of the applicant’s social security number, but had been approved. According to the lawsuit, the county does not have the authority to suspend these requirements and the lawsuit requests the court prevent them from approving any more applications that do not include the information and prevent them from enrolling applicants who submitted such applications. The lawsuit also requests the court order the county to collect the social security numbers of any person who was issued an absentee or mail-in ballot without providing his or her social security number.</p>

Even if these voters do eventually receive their ballots before Election Day, the slowdowns promise that they will not have sufficient time to send them back with assurance that they will arrive in time to be counted,&#8221; the lawsuit filed in US District Court says. &#8220;And even if a ballot reaches the appropriate election official before the receipt deadline, if the official identifies any issues with it that require remediation before it may be counted, the voter will have run out of time to rectify the problem.&#8221;</p>

He also wants the judge to issue an order barring Gableman from enforcing the subpoenas or penalizing those who do not comply. Kaul argued the subpoenas are improper because Gableman wants to interview Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator Meagan Wolfe privately, rather than in public in front of a legislative committee. &#8220;The Special Counsel and his staff, however, have been charged with assisting the Committee, but they are not themselves a house of the Legislature or a legislative committee. The Subpoenas also command the witnesses to appear not in the state capitol or any other location in which a legislative committee would ordinarily meet, but rather in a non-public office &#8216;at 200 South Executive Drive, Suite 101, Brookfield, WI 53005,'&#8221; Kaul wrote.</p>

Social media has become a battle ground where misinformation and authoritative information compete for users’ trust and clicks. One year out from the 2022 midterms, join the Bipartisan Policy Center for a conversation between social media and election experts about what is being done to promote authoritative election information, what additional actions need to be taken, and how it could impact the midterms. Panel discussion with: Maurice Turner, Cybersecurity Fellow, Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States; C. Murphy Hebert, Director of Communications, Arizona Secretary of State; Katie Harbath, Tech and Democracy Fellow, BPC.

<p><a href="https://www.acslaw.org/event/foxes-and-henhouses-restoring-oversight-and-accountability-a-year-after-the-2020-election/">Foxes and Henhouses: Restoring Oversight and Accountability A Year After the 2020 Election</a>: As we approach the one-year anniversary of the 2020 election, advocates and lawmakers are still debating how best to protect our democratic institutions and promote accountability for executive branch transgressions. Some are particularly concerned about the role that the Department of Justice and its Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) played in undermining congressional oversight during the Trump years, when it issued opinions that arguably distorted the separation of powers by brooking no recognition for Congress&#8217;s prerogatives as a co-equal branch. Others are focused on the need to protect and strengthen the roles of Inspectors General after former President Trump fired four IGs in the span of six weeks in what some called a &#8220;dangerous pattern of retaliation&#8221; against federal watchdogs. Recognizing that transparency and oversight is key to democratic survival, what are the best ways to achieve accountability for executive branch transgressions? What role should the Office of Legal Counsel play in reigning in executive branch illegality? And what reforms to the Inspector General system are needed so that these watchdogs can provide the independent nonpartisan oversight they are legislatively required to deliver? Moderated by Josh Gerstein, senior legal affairs reporter with Politico and featuring welcoming remarks from former Sen. Russ Feingold. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 18, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
