							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election directors and technology</strong><br />
<em>Finding funding and support for election modernization</em></p>
<p>By Jamie Chesser, director of programs<br />
National States Geographic Information Council</p>
<p>While election directors face numerous challenges – increased polarization, voter distrust, even the threat of violence – having access to technology that makes their work more accurate and efficient shouldn’t be one of them. Yet, in research <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7228" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-300x87.png" alt="" width="300" height="87" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-300x87.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-768x222.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM.png 974w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />conducted by<a href="https://www.nsgic.org/"> National States Geographic Information Council</a> (NSGIC), that is the picture painted by representatives from 53% of state election offices across the United States. Twenty-seven state election directors, along with two from U.S. territories, reported on the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in elections. They also shared information on voter registration systems and whether these support efforts to audit voters’ location compared to precinct and district assignments. Lastly, they provided insight on relationships and funding to support election modernization.</p>
<p>The results: not great. In 76% of the surveyed jurisdictions, voter registration systems do not support GIS data, meaning that ensuring that voters have been placed in the right precincts and voting districts is needlessly difficult. Only one in five election directors work with a geographic information officer (GIO) to get needed support for voter audits and other tasks that can ensure accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in elections. Two-thirds of respondents reported not having access to, or not knowing if they had access to, a universal address list, such as data from 911 address databases or the National Address Database (NAD).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At least the last couple of challenges are easily fixable. Many states have GIOs, and NSGIC’s Geo-Enabled Elections project has worked hard to build relationships between election offices and GIOs in the past few years. It has also developed<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/"> leading-edge insight and resources</a> to support states on the path to election modernization. State GIOs are geospatial information experts and can support election directors in identifying resources like address databases and in creating audit processes to uncover errors. Geocoding software can be bought off the shelf and can be deployed to automatically compare voter locations to voting district boundaries, in order to identify discrepancies in election data.</p>
<p>NSGIC also offers<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/"> tools to help election offices</a> with more long-term election modernization efforts: if a voter registration system is outdated and doesn’t support geo-enabling, or GIS integration, the organization shares sample requests for proposals that could assist in procuring a new one. If funding or support from a state’s legislature is needed to enshrine important processes in law or to provide funding for needed investments, NSGIC in 2021 developed sample statutory language as a starting point for the work to create state statute.</p>
<p>Some encouraging news was uncovered in the survey: two-thirds of responding election offices use GIS for some election-related activities, most commonly for redistricting (59%), followed by election data management and creating and maintaining point locations for registered voters (35% each) and spatial data audits to verify districts or precincts (31%).</p>
<p>The work to geo-enable elections is progressing in states and counties across the nation. Some of that progress has been spurred by and documented in the Geo-Enabled Elections project’s many pilot projects, available for download on<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/"> elections.NSGIC.org</a>. An additional pilot project report, involving a number of states and counties across the United States working on election modernization during 2021, is currently wrapping up and is scheduled to be published in December.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3788" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg 261w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-768x884.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups.jpg 869w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" />Perhaps the thorniest challenge in election modernization is voter registration systems. Among the 29 jurisdictions that provided input, over half appeared to be using bespoke systems, developed more or less uniquely for them. And even among the remainder, significant fragmentation could be seen in the technology they were using. This means it would be tricky to develop an off-the-shelf modular solution that can integrate GIS into the many commercial VRS solutions, not to mention the vast number of bespoke systems at both the county and state levels. This is a very challenging situation, and one with a variety of solutions including individual software development approaches, technological band-aids, or even upgrading to an entirely new voter registration system.</p>
<p>That, of course, would involve significant financial investments &#8211; another area where the 2021 election director survey offers good news: 28% of respondents report that they have used, or plan to use, HAVA funding to geo-enable elections. Similarly, 10% have considered using funds from the American Rescue Plan Act 2021 or the American Jobs Plan to invest in geo-enabling their elections. Since the survey was conducted in the summer of 2021, items from the American Jobs Plan may have been incorporated into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</p>
<p>In part to reflect on the Election Director survey findings, and also to look ahead to further election modernization, NSGIC will be convening its third Elections GeoSummit on December 9, 2021, from 1-5 pm ET. The keynote speaker, Neal Kelley, registrar of voters for Orange County, California, is a long-time proponent of election modernization, and the overall theme of Technology, Elections, Relationships should provide a stimulating stepping-off point for panel discussions, group discussions, and a tech forum of interest to anyone involved in elections.

A collection of suitcases once used to transport the Woonsocket, Rhode Island’s list of eligible voters to polling places on Election Day have a new home and a new purpose. According to the Valley Breeze, last week, employees with the Board of Canvassers and other city departments<a href="https://www.valleybreeze.com/townnews/politics/one-time-elections-suitcases-find-new-home-at-mens-shelter/article_ddc0f368-4653-11ec-848e-2325d3d0c976.html"> donated 18 suitcases filled with personal care supplies to the men’s shelter at Harvest Community Church</a>. The suitcases will be offered to men who stay in the seasonal homeless shelter during the winter months. “Most of these guys live out of plastic bags,” said Pastor Steve Bacon of Harvest Community Church. “Most of the time, it’s the clothes on his back and a trash bag.” The donation is the result of a recent cleaning effort at the Board of Canvassers office. For years, the city used rolling luggage to transport thousands of pages of registered voter lists to precincts around the city on Election Day. Poll workers would use three-ring binders to look up residents’ information when they came to vote. With the advent of electronic poll books, however, the paper voter lists—and the suitcases that carried them—are now obsolete. Board of Canvassers Manager Michael Narducci said the office kept only about a dozen suitcases to use as back-ups on Election Day. The suitcases contain personal care items including hand sanitizer, toothbrushes, toothpaste, socks, soap and wipes. Most of the items were donated to the city by private companies throughout the pandemic for distribution to residents and employees. As for the Board of Canvassers office, Narducci said he and Elections Clerk Gianna Savastano are relieved to reclaim the space taken up by the suitcases and an outdated filing system. The two spent the past several months clearing equipment out of the office, a process that began after the 2020 election.</p>

The newly published &#8220;West Virginia Voter Guide&#8221; is targeted for voters with visual impairments who may otherwise have difficulty receiving voting information. A copy of the Guide has been mailed to all 55 county clerks who will make them available to loan to any citizen requesting them. Additionally, a limited amount of copies are available to distribute to voters as needed. Braille voter guides will also be distributed to citizens by Disability Rights of West Virginia, a non-profit organization that provide services and advocacy for people with disabilities in the mountain state. &#8220;We are continuing our effort to eliminate barriers to the ballot box for all registered West Virginia voters,&#8221; Secretary of State Mac Warner said. &#8220;This new Voter Guide in braille will assist a special group of West Virginians and make it easier for them to receive information on our election process.&#8221; The West Virginia Voter Guide includes information on some of the most frequently asked questions on the topics of voting options, how to find your polling place, or to check if your registration is up to date.  This voter guide now comes in two forms &#8211; an easy-to-distribute rack card and a booklet with braille embossing for the braille-reading community. “The best way to empower voters is to educate them on the entire voting process from start to finish” said Warner. “We want to ensure that every eligible voter has the information they need to be an active and informed voter.&#8221;</p>

In <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/11/29/new-group-targets-nevada-with-election-reform-initiative/">Nevada</a> a proposed initiative petition was filed with the Secretary of State’s office on Nov. 12 by a newly formed political action committee called Nevada Voters First. The proposal would reform how congressional, statewide and state legislative races are decided. Under the proposed voting system, Nevada primaries would be open, rather than split into Democratic and Republican. All registered voters could cast a ballot, including the more than 30% of the Nevada electorate now registered as a nonpartisan or third-party voters. The top five finishers move onto the general election. On that November general election ballot, voters would rank the five candidates, To qualify for the ballot, Nevada Voters First will have to gather signatures that equal at least 10% of the total number of voters who cast ballots during the last general election — roughly 142,500 registered voters, evenly divided between the state’s four congressional districts. It is a proposed constitutional amendment, meaning it would have to be approved by voters in 2022 and 2024 before going into effect. In <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article256199297.html">Missouri</a>, A group called Better Elections is pushing an initiative petition that would amend Missouri’s constitution to allow all voters to vote for any candidate in a combined primary. The four candidates in the primary with the most votes would advance to the general election, regardless of party. Then in the general election, voters would be allowed to rank those four candidates from first choice to last — or just vote for their first choice. The change would apply to elections for statewide office, the Missouri General Assembly and U.S. Congress. Two versions of the initiative petition have been approved by the Secretary of State’s Office to begin collecting signatures. And in <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2021/11/12/deep-dive-what-to-know-about-secure-mi-vote-petition-drive/">Michigan</a> an initiative called Secure MI Vote is collecting petition signatures in support of altering Michigan’s election code in an effort to tighten voter and election laws. Organizers argue that in order to ensure a fair election, it is necessary to require Michigan voters to present a photo ID, to limit how absent voter ballots are distributed, how funds are used during elections and more.</p>

Brian Kemp officially signed the new<a href="https://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/kemp-signs-new-floyd-county-elections-board-legislation-into-law/article_b424ac5e-497b-11ec-8f1c-3bc8cd8440d5.html"> Floyd County Elections board bills</a> into law, dissolving the current three-member board and replacing it with a new five-member board. Bill sponsors Rep. Katie Dempsey, R-Rome; Rep. Eddie Lumsden, R-Armuchee; and Rep. Mitchell Scoggins, R-Cartersville, as well as State Senator Chuck Hufstetler, R-Rome, released the following joint statement: “Over the last year, Floyd County residents have made it clear that they want to feel confident that our elections are being run with integrity and efficiency, and revamping our elections board reflects these desires. This legislation will usher in a more robust elections board ahead of the next election cycle. We also recognized the need for increased staff support for the board, so we are grateful that the county will now have a full-time elections supervisor position, who will specialize in carrying out secure and efficient elections.” House Bills 8EX and 9EX passed the House 150-7 and it passed the Senate 38-1. The five members would be appointed by the Floyd County Commission. Commissioners would choose four of the members from lists submitted by county executive committees of the two local political parties whose candidates for Georgia governor received the most votes in the previous election. At this point, that means two members from the Floyd County Republican Party and two from the Floyd County Democratic Party. The fifth member would be selected by the Floyd County commissioners and would serve as chairperson of the board. This legislation also provides greater staff support to the elections board. Under HB 8EX, commissioners will appoint an election supervisor. The election supervisor will serve as staff support for the board, attend meetings of the board, assist the board in fulfilling its duties of voter registration and the conduct of elections and provide daily supervision of other county employees who assist the board. The election supervisor will be considered a full-time county employee and cannot be a member of the elections board.</p>

County Auditor Melissa Wellhausen says the resolution would make security plans and other sensitive information about how elections are run confidential. &#8220;At some trainings that we attended, they advised that this is a good idea to put this forward,&#8221; said Wellhausen. &#8220;We do have a policy in place &#8212; a security policy in place &#8212; that we set up a while ago. This just protects that information and makes it confidential.&#8221; Wellhausen says the security policy in place for elections in the county contains information that hackers or other bad actors could use to hijack voting equipment. Under Iowa Code, most information regarding elections and election administration falls under Iowa Code Chapter 22, which dictates which documents are public record and available for public inspection. Wellhausen says an administrative rule allows county governments in Iowa to hold back certain sensitive information.</p>

The<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Announcement_-_Secure_MI_Pet_Sum_734507_7.pdf"> Secure MI Vote petition</a>, if successful, would toughen in-person voter ID laws, require ID information for absentee ballot applications, restrict the ability of election officials to send out absentee ballot applications and prohibit private election funding. Lansing&#8217;s resolution opposing the petition was suggested by the Clerk&#8217;s Office and put forward jointly by the entire council. Council members approved the resolution in a 6-0 vote during Monday night&#8217;s meeting. &#8220;Lansing City Council supports equitable and easier access to the ballot box through federal and state standards around early voting, absentee voting, and voter registration,&#8221; the resolution states.</p>

The bill would affect more than 800,000 New Yorkers. According to The New York Times, the legislation, first introduced almost two years ago, is the culmination of more than a decade of work to gain local voting rights for some legal permanent residents. It also extends the right to those with work authorization, such as the so-called dreamers, recipients of a program known as DACA that shields young immigrants brought into the country illegally from deportation and allows them to live and work here. Those eligible must be residents of New York City for 30 days and otherwise eligible to vote under state law. In spite of having a veto-proof majority of 34 out of 51 City Council members and the public advocate co-sponsoring the bill, the legislation has not moved forward until now partly because of concerns about its legality. A vote is<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/council-schedules-vote-expand-voting-rights-noncitizen-new-yorkers"> scheduled for December</a>.</p>

A temporary measure allowing voters in New York to cite the pandemic as a reason to vote absentee will expire Jan. 1, 2022. The bill passed July 22-23, 2020, and was sponsored by Dinowitz, a Democrat, in the Assembly and Progressive state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi in the Senate. The expanded pandemic-related eligibility was set to expire and align with no-excuse voting being implemented following the general election proposition, according to Dinowitz’s office. But now that the measure failed, “leaving voters who would prefer to cast their ballots from the safety of their own homes to weigh the importance of their health and their vote,” the state lawmaker is introducing a bill that would extend the expanded eligibility through Feb. 1, 2024. “My new legislation is a critical measure so that no New Yorker is forced to put their own health at risk simply to cast a ballot, and I urge my colleagues to support this important measure when we return to Albany in January,” Dinowitz said. A statement from Dinowitz’s office said that if the legislation passes then lawmakers and voters, from 2022-2024, can decide whether to revisit a constitutional amendment about absentee voting. The proposed legislation, which has been filed in Assembly, doesn’t have a bill number or Senate co-sponsor yet.</p>

That change and a measure that would prohibit elections officials across North Carolina from accepting donations from private groups are headed to Gov. Roy Cooper, where one or both are likely to be vetoed. The Democratic governor has repeatedly clashed with the Republican-controlled legislature on elections policy and procedures. Senate Bill 326, dubbed the Election Day Integrity Act, which set the night of Election Day as a firm deadline to accept mailed ballots. Only ballots received from deployed military would be accepted after that. Another bill, titled the Election Integrity Act, would require that all new voting equipment and software be made in the U.S. and that courts officials send the names of people who get out of jury duty by claiming that they aren&#8217;t citizens to the State Board of Elections so they can be removed from voter rolls. It still needs Senate approval.</p>
<p>The  General Assembly voted to<a href="https://www.wral.com/nc-legislature-no-private-money-to-run-elections/20008167/"> keep private donors from covering election costs</a>, cutting out a revenue stream that generated millions of dollars last year for boards of election around the state. Senate Bill 725 passed the House earlier this month on a party-line vote, with Republicans voting for it and Democrats against. It cleared the state Senate Monday by a similar vote and heads to Gov. Roy Cooper, who can sign it into law or block it with a veto. Cooper&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

Deak Kersey, general counsel with the secretary of state’s office proposed a bill to mandate counties send their post-election audit results to the state, the that the data can be posted online. Kersey said the 2020 election also showed ways officials need to be more stringent in ensuring safety which includes updating existing state law that prevents any electronic voting machines from being connected to the Internet. Other proposed legislation includes: clarifying the voter registration deadline; extending the number of days a county clerk has to mail an absentee ballot; changing the appeals process for challenges to municipal and county election results; extending opportunities for electronic voting; syncing municipal and levy elections; requiring non-public funding sources for public elections be approved by the West Virginia Election Commission; repealing a 50-cent DMV fee that supports automatic voter registration; and establishing a ban on “harassing” voters within 100 feed of polling places.</p>

He continued: &#8220;I believe that rather than a legitimate use of the legal system to seek redress for redressable grievances, this lawsuit has been used to manipulate gullible members of the public and foment public unrest. To that extent, this lawsuit has been an abuse of the legal system and an interference with the machinery of government. For all these reasons, I feel that a significant sanctions award is merited.&#8221;</p>

Holness alleges Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick’s support of a proposal that would pay most U.S. adults $1,000 a month was an attempt to illegally bribe voters. His lawsuit also wants 18 mail ballots counted that were received from military members and family members that were rejected by elections officials because they arrived after Election Day.

It will be the first voting rights case to go to trial in Atlanta’s federal court in at least a decade. The lawsuit initially alleged far-reaching voter suppression, but a series of court rulings<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-rules-against-much-of-georgia-voting-lawsuit-over-2018-election/NNHKWOBWFZGYTF7N6JTH5SUUBA/"> eliminated</a> many of the claims made by Fair Fight, which Abrams founded. The trial will focus on “exact match” voter registration policies, allegations of voter roll inaccuracies and inconsistent absentee ballot cancellation practices. “My first goal is to ensure both sides have a fair trial,” Jones said. “We need to bring this case to closure.” The plaintiffs will attempt to prove that the state’s voting practices infringe on fundamental rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. If they’re successful, Jones could order changes to voting in Georgia before the 2022 general election.</p>

Raffensperger said his lawsuit seeks to compel the government to turn over any communications, if they exist, between the Department of Justice and dozens of his political and legal opponents. Raffensperger had filed a Freedom of Information Act request in August for communications between the Justice Department and 62 individuals and organizations. The Justice Department acknowledged the records request but said it needed more time to respond given its scope and the need to consult with various government offices.</p>

HB 2332, which took effect in July, also barred advance ballot applications from being sent if information is already filled out on them. Both provisions were the subject of a lawsuit from national voting rights groups, which argued it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The groups, Vote America and the Voter Participation Center, said in the lawsuit that the newly enacted law effectively halts their work in Kansas and keeps them from &#8220;employing their most effective means of persuading voters to engage in the democratic process.&#8221; Vratil denied a request from the state to dismiss the case and instead blocked the law from being enforced. The ruling merely halts the law&#8217;s enforcement until the case is resolved, with the judge saying &#8220;delayed implementation is not likely to cause material harm, even if it is eventually found to be constitutional and enforceable.&#8221; In her opinion, Vratil said the law &#8220;will have the inevitable effect of reducing the total quantum of speech on an important public issue&#8221; and agreed with the voting rights group that a more demanding level of legal review was required.</p>

The challenge involves a constitutional clause and its interaction with a 1963 law that requires felons to complete time in custody, on supervised release or on probation before they can vote again. The people and groups behind the lawsuit argue the system disproportionately hurts communities of color because their punishments tend to trail them longer. They want voting eligibility to automatically be restored upon release from incarceration. Plaintiffs argue that it’s the court’s role to fix the problem since lawmakers haven’t. Attorneys for Secretary of State Steve Simon argue that it is the role of the Legislature to change the law. Whether rights should be restored earlier is certainly up for debate,” Angela Behrens, an attorney for the states aid. “And if this were a hearing in front of a legislative committee, the parties would likely be aligned.” According to Minnesota Public Radio,  the justices were heavily engaged in the hearing, lobbing question after question at the attorneys. Six of the seven justices spoke at some point. A decision from the court is expected sometime next year.</p>

North Carolina Senate Bill 824 requires a photo ID to vote. It was immediately challenged by the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, which argues that the law disproportionately impacts African American and Latino voters. The Supreme Court is not planning to take up the issue of N.C.’s voter ID law. The question is whether lawmakers have the right to defend the laws they make, independent of the executive-branch attorney general. The dispute raises questions about who can act as an agent of the state to defend a law in a divided government. Under the state constitution, the attorney general represents the state in court. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein is a Democrat. Republican politicians Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the state Senate, and Tim Moore, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, seek the right to intervene to defend the law. They argued in court papers that the case raises issues that are of &#8220;particular importance in the context of divided government and litigation involving controversial matters.&#8221;</p>

The ballots in question arrived on time, but either didn&#8217;t have dates or had dates in the wrong places. The Lehigh County election board ruled the ballots should be counted. That decision was challenged by Republican David Ritter, who held a narrow lead in a judge race. Reibman ruled that the board had the authority to make the decision on the votes. In his ruling, he said the law should be interpreted as though it &#8220;favors the fundamental right to vote, and enfranchises, rather than disenfranchises, the electorate.&#8221; Reibman has<a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/judge-denies-appeal-of-candidate-in-lehigh-county-judge-race-regarding-counting-of-undated-mail/article_c8933fd8-52dc-11ec-adc4-cfd803a0f6dd.html"> denied an appeal</a> and plaintiffs have appealed to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
