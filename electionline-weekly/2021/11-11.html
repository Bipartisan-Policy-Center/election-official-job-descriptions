														<p><strong>Military &amp; Overseas Citizen Voting Rates Remained Steady in 2020</strong><br />
<em>State of Military Voter and State of Overseas Voter Updated</em></p>
<p>An estimated 47% of active duty military and 8% of U.S. citizens abroad voted in 2020, compared to 46% and 8% in 2016 respectively.</p>

<p>Since 1986, military members on active duty stationed away from their voting residence have been covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which requires that states allow these military members, their eligible family, and overseas citizens to vote absentee in federal elections. In 2009, UOCAVA was amended requiring states to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transmit ballots at least 45 days before federal elections</li>
<li>Offer at least one method of electronic transmission (email, fax, online portal, etc.) of voting information and blank ballots</li>
<li>Transmit ballots automatically within the calendar year of the ballot request</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7687" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP2-300x193.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP2-300x193.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP2-1024x658.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP2-768x493.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP2-1536x987.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP2.png 1940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Part of the U.S. Department of Defense, FVAP administers the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which requires states to allow active duty military members, their eligible family, and overseas citizens to vote absentee in federal elections.</p>
<p>UOCAVA voters face unique challenges compared to local voters. FVAP again found the ability to receive and submit an absentee ballot on time can be an obstacle, made more complex in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Our research shows the pandemic most notably affected UOCAVA voters&#8217; ability to receive direct voting assistance and use international mail,” FVAP director David Beirne said. “We worked closely with partners at the Military Postal Service Agency, the U.S. Postal Service, and the State Department to monitor the situation as it evolved and to share the latest guidance to help make voting for military and overseas citizens as smooth as possible.”</p>
<p>Turnout among the civilian population was the highest since 1900. Among civilian voters with similar characteristics, turnout was 74%, resulting in a 27-percentage-point difference between military and civilian voters in 2020. Military turnout in 2020 was comparable to 2016&#8217;s 46%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7688" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP3-300x195.png" alt="" width="300" height="195" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP3-300x195.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP3-1024x666.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP3-768x499.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP3-1536x999.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FVAP3.png 1910w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In 2020, two-thirds of military members expressed an interest in voting, with 17% explicitly uninterested and 16% neither interested nor uninterested.</p>
<p>In 2020, a fifth of military members tried or wanted to vote but did not or could not complete the process. Service members often encounter problems early in the voting process, such as being unsure which address they should use, having difficulty registering to vote or requesting an absentee ballot, or having an absentee ballot fail to arrive.</p>
<p>Younger military members are less likely to vote — and more likely to need help doing so. As a group, Service members who are 18-24 years old are less experienced with voting, less confident in their knowledge of each step of the absentee voting process, and less likely to take voting-related actions. The good news: when they seek help from a DoD resource, they&#8217;re more likely to return their ballot successfully.</p>

							<h2>Bipartisan Principles For Election Audits</h2>
														<p><strong>Bipartisan Principles for Election Audits</strong></p>
<p>Rachel Orey, Christopher Thomas, Matthew Weil<br />
The Bipartisan Policy Center</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5432 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The function of audits is not to appease a losing candidate. Rather, audits provide a continual means of verifying the integrity of U.S. elections.  Election officials have been conducting audits in a bipartisan manner with broad institutional trust for decades. “Audits” meeting certain basic, bipartisan standards are the primary means of increasing confidence in an election’s legitimacy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7033" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/audit-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/audit-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/audit.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When expanded audits are considered in tandem with the nearly universal use of paper ballots and bolstered cybersecurity, 2020 was the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election"> most secure election in U.S. history</a>. Even still, this year an increasing number of states have considered additional extralegal, unofficial election reviews examining the presidential election.</p>
<p>Politics and potential motives aside, the rise of unofficial election reviews prompts a need for a reckoning—begging the questions: What is the purpose of audits? How should audits be conducted? What makes an audit deserving of public trust?</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center’s<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"> Task Force on Elections</a> is uniquely suited to answer these questions. Comprised of politically and geographically diverse state and local election administrators, the task force inserts balance and objectivity into some of the most difficult questions facing the American electorate today. The perspective of election officials is unparalleled in its impartiality, fair-mindedness, and precision (after all, it’s those running elections who know best how they work).</p>
<p>BPC’s task force includes 28 state and local election officials from 20 states devoted to making meaningful improvements to U.S. elections. This report builds on the task force’s recommendations made in<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/logical-election-policy/"> Logical Election Policy</a> and<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/voting-experience-2020/"> Improving the Voting Experience After 2020</a>.</p>
<p>American democracy relies on a functional and trusted election ecosystem; a functional and trusted election ecosystem relies on audits. They should be performed with the respect, candor, and transparency that they deserve.</p>
<p>The BPC Task Force on Elections unanimously endorses the following<a href="https://bit.ly/bpcauditreport"> eight principles for effective and trustworthy election audits</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Audits should occur after every election and be explicitly authorized in state law.</li>
<li>Audits should have a thorough, pre-established methodology.</li>
<li>Audits should follow established security best practices and be conducted with trusted technology and tools.</li>
<li>Election officials must maintain custody of ballots and other election peripherals in accordance with federal and state law and judicial standards for admissible evidence.</li>
<li>Audits should be fully funded by state or local public resources.</li>
<li>Audits should be transparent and open to the public for observation.</li>
<li>Audit results should be clearly communicated to the public after their completion.</li>
<li>Audits should take place before results are certified.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a clear appetite to expand election audits for future cycles among voters and elected officials. American elections are secure and legitimate, and yet public distrust of the voting process is itself a threat to democracy and should be addressed with the seriousness it deserves.</p>
<p>Elected officials truly seeking to improve election performance will ensure that any proposed audits meet each of the eight principles contained herein as unanimously endorsed by the Bipartisan Policy Center Task Force on Elections.</p>

<p><strong>Recounting 2021</strong>: Acting<a href="https://www.yourerie.com/news/local-news/your-local-election-hq/acting-secretary-of-state-gives-notice-of-statewide-recount-in-commonwealth-court-race/"> Pennsylvania</a> Secretary of State Veronica Degraffenreid issued notice that she will order a statutorily required statewide recount in the November 2nd race for two open seats on the Commonwealth Court. The department estimates that the recount will cost at least $1.3 million of taxpayer funds. Since the automatic recount provision was enacted under Act 97 of 2004, the provision has been triggered five times, with two recounts carried out. In<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2021-11-10/after-recount-portland-council-seat-goes-to-candidate-who-lost-random-draw-in-tied-race"> Portland, Maine</a>, after a recount, Roberto Rodriguez has won the race for a Portland city council seat. Rodriguez and challenger Brandon Mazer initially finished in a tie for the seat following two rounds of ranked-choice instant runoff voting last week. On Friday, Mazer was declared the winner after his name was drawn from a bowl by the Portland city clerk. Rodriguez then asked for a hand recount, which was held on Tuesday. Mazer officially conceded the race to Rodriguez.<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/11/onondaga-county-will-recount-early-votes-after-discovering-human-error.html"> Onondaga County, New York</a> recount all votes cast during the nine-day early voting period in October after finding that 802 ballots were not counted in the final results. The uncounted ballots could affect about a dozen close races in Manlius and other eastern suburbs of Syracuse, said Dustin Czarny, an Onondaga County elections commissioner. In<a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2021/11/guy-odonnell-files-for-recount-in-holyoke-ward-5-city-council-race.html"> Holyoke, Massachusetts</a>, Challenger Guy O’Donnell filed papers with the city clerk’s office requesting a recount of the Ward 5 City Council race that declared incumbent Linda Vacon the winner. For now, 17 votes separate Vacon and O’Donnell, a first-time candidate. O’Donnell gathered 15 signatures over the weekend, more than the requirement to trigger a recount.

She stressed her concerns around this being a top threat for CISA, which is charged with securing critical infrastructure, to confront.  “One could argue we’re in the business of critical infrastructure, and the most critical infrastructure is our cognitive infrastructure, so building that resilience to misinformation and disinformation, I think, is incredibly important,” Easterly said.  “We are going to work with our partners in the private sector and throughout the rest of the government and at the department to continue to ensure that the American people have the facts that they need to help protect our critical infrastructure,” she added.</p>

Jay Inslee has appointed Democratic state Sen.<a href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-hobbs-jay-inslee-olympia-washington-europe-753e19fbeb9c5ba58a5390e6b0add012"> Steve Hobbs</a> as the state’s 16th secretary of state, marking the first time a Democrat will hold the office since the mid-1960s. He will replace Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman, who will leave office Nov. 19. “Steve has demonstrated through his career as a senator the ability to act independently, to not to be swayed by any party,” Inslee said in a video statement.  Wyman echoed those statements, saying in a written statement that Hobbs “has a demonstrated record of seeking bipartisan solutions to complex problems, which is essential to the position of secretary of state.”  “It is imperative the secretary of state — the state’s chief elections official — serve as a neutral arbiter in order to inspire confidence across the political spectrum in our election processes and results,” Wyman wrote.  Hobbs, 51, is considered a centrist in his caucus, which holds a 28-21 majority in the Senate. He had previously sought a statewide office, briefly running for lieutenant governor last year before withdrawing from the race, citing his COVID-19 response work with the National Guard. “This is a tremendous honor and responsibility,” Hobbs said in a written statement. “There is nothing more sacred than the right to vote. I’ve fought for that right overseas and will do everything in my power to protect that right here in Washington.” Hobbs grew up in Snohomish County and has represented the 44th legislative district in the Senate since 2007. He served for decades in the U.S. Army, serving in Iraq and Kosovo, and currently serves as a lieutenant colonel in the Washington State National Guard. Inslee said that Hobbs’ service in the National Guard, saying it will be “an asset in dealing with the best cybersecurity effort in the United States. Inslee’s office said he spoke to a number of candidates, including current county auditors. Wyman and her predecessor, Sam Reed, both were Thurston County auditors before being elected to statewide office. Hobbs said that while he doesn’t have the county auditor experience that Wyman and Reed had, he pointed to his management and leadership experience in the National Guard and said that he plans to keep most of Wyman’s staff. He also plans to meet with county auditors to hear their ideas and concerns. “This is a partnership,” he said. “We work together.”</p>

She was 82. Huneycutt, who served as director since 1983, was remembered for her even-handed approach to candidates and voters of all political backgrounds. She was one of the longest-serving election directors for a single county in North Carolina modern-day politics. &#8220;Our condolences go out to Ruth&#8217;s family, friends and coworkers during this difficult time,&#8221; State Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell said. &#8220;Elections work is difficult work, and Ruth succeeded in it and loved it.&#8221; Huneycutt joined the Davidson County Board of Elections in 1973 before becoming director 10 years later. Huneycutt oversaw elections from a time when ballots and candidate filings were processed by hand — long before digital devices — to a period today when the nuts-and-bolts of holding elections rely on computers and electronic voting tabulators. She died three days after overseeing municipal elections in cities and towns across Davidson County on Nov. 2. Former state legislator and Democratic House Majority Leader Hugh Holliman, who served Davidson County, remembered Huneycutt as a fair elections director who helped candidates of diverse political stripes negotiate the candidate filing process. &#8220;I always had a really good relationship with Ruth,&#8221; Holliman told The High Point Enterprise. &#8220;She oversaw a lot of changes during her time there and was very knowledgeable.&#8221;</p>

Kusler is the only Democrat to have ever served in that role. Kusler was elected secretary of state in 1988, at the height of Democratic-NPL control of state politics. He served through 1992, losing reelection to Republican Al Jaeger, who has served since. Before becoming North Dakota&#8217;s top election official, Kusler was a research and information assistant to Gov. Art Link from 1978-81, a special assistant to Tax Commissioner Kent Conrad from 1981-82, and a state senator for District 33 from 1983-87. Conrad, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1987-2013, said Kusler &#8220;was a dear friend and a dedicated public servant. He loved North Dakota’s people and our history. May he rest in peace.” Gary Holm, who worked with Kusler in the Link administration, credited Kusler with modernizing the secretary of state&#8217;s office. Former state Sen. Aaron Krauter said Kusler &#8220;worked hard to bring the secretary of state’s office into the 21st century.” After leaving office, Kusler moved to his family farm and began an organic food venture and hosted a weekly radio show.</p>

The legislation, co-sponsored by six of Allen’s colleagues, would give every registered voter access to mail-in voting, distribute more ballot drop boxes citywide, bring back the vote centers used during the 2020 election cycle, and make Election Day a holiday for D.C. public schools. The bill would also create a new election data portal on the D.C. Board of Elections’ website and require the board to provide more support to Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners who are currently incarcerated (as one currently is, representing the residents of the D.C. Jail), among other measures. The Elections Modernization Amendment Act will be assigned to a committee and receive a hearing at a date to be announced. “There are times when necessity is the mother of invention, and that’s exactly what we saw when a pandemic and a general election collided,” Allen<a href="https://www.charlesallenward6.com/councilmember_allen_introduces_elections_modernization_bill_includes_vote_by_mail_dcps_election_day_holiday_and_vote_centers"> wrote in a statement</a>. “D.C. held a safe, secure, and accessible election by making it easier to vote and safe to vote from home. These are common sense and popular changes we need to make a permanent part of our elections moving forward.”</p>

Billy Hickman told constituents that the provisions laid out under<a href="https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/hickman-new-election-law-may-need-tweaking-on-early-voting/"> Senate Bill 202 may need some “tweaking”</a> in 2022. While praising the controversial new law as “a very tight election bill,” that has served as a model for a couple of other states, Hickman said there should be some changes made during the Georgia General Assembly’s regular January-March session. He referred particularly to the requirement that counties and cities host 17 days of early voting, including two Saturdays, for all elections, even for council member elections in small towns. “Then we go right back in January for a long January through March session, and that’s probably when we’ll make some tweaking on the election bill,” Hickman said.</p>

Under<a href="http://legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2021&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=2044&amp;pn=2352"> the measure</a>, the Department of State and individual counties would have to refuse any “private donations” that would be used for “operating elections, employing staff or selecting and equipping a polling place or for use in voter education or outreach.” State Rep. Jim Struzzi (R-Indiana) is among those sponsoring the ban on private election grants. He said he took issue with how the money was handed down, and argued it’s unfair that places like Philadelphia got $10 million in grant money while Lancaster got just under $500,000. Rep. Seth Grove (R-York), who chairs the State Government committee, said the practice opens the door for well-resourced counties to have unfair election operation advantages over those that aren’t.</p>
<p>The House State Government Committee approved House Bill 1482 that would create a<a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/content/republicans-renew-attempts-require-post-election-audits"> Bureau of Election Audits</a> within the Pennsylvania Auditor General’s office, tasked with conducting “result-confirming” audits of every election in the state. “This will continue on our efforts that we&#8217;ve made for the past several years to ensure that our processes are consistent, and every legal vote is counted, and every voter can have faith in our election processes,” said House Speaker Bryan Cutler, the prime sponsor of <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2021&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1482&amp;pn=1600">House Bill 1482</a>. Cutler’s legislation would require the new election audit bureau to complete “result-confirming” audits of every election in the state by the third Friday after the election. The bureau would be tasked with conducting risk-limiting audits of each uncontested election, as well as audits of election machine logs and of returned mail-in and absentee ballots in each county. The proposal would also require the Bureau of Election Audits to conduct performance audits of election machines and processes – including reviews of county election offices, the state’s voter registration system and the Department of State’s certification process for election machines – once every five years. The new bureau would also be authorized to conduct “any other audit deemed necessary … to ensure the public trust” in both elections and election administration, according to the legislation. This is Cutler’s second attempt to advance similar legislation.</p>

The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Section 273 of the Mississippi Constitution, which is the part that outlines the way ballot initiatives work, “cannot work in a world where Mississippi has fewer than five representatives in Congress.” When voters adopted the process in 273, the state had five congressional districts, but lost one due to slow population growth after the 2000 Census. Now, a group of plaintiffs has filed suit in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi in Jackson seeking to have the ballot initiative process reinstated. The suit says “the initiative petition rights of the people of Mississippi have been wrested from them.” The federal court, the motion says, inadvertently made that possible years ago when it redrew Mississippi’s congressional districts after the Legislature failed to propose a four-district map that complied with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. “Left to a state legislature unable to adopt a constitutionally compliant redistricting plan for the last thirty years …, the initiative petition rights of the people of Mississippi have been sideswiped and killed,” the motion says.</p>

The poll books, which are new technology for the state as of this election, are meant to be secured and transported in designated carrying cases, but Mack-Pollock said the vendor supplying the cases to Passaic County could not deliver them in time for the election.  Thus, Mack-Pollock made the decision to store the electronic poll books in the back of the voting machines themselves. But state law requires that voting machines be locked for a period of 15 days after the election unless ordered opened by a Superior Court judge, prompting Mack-Pollock’s request for a court order to open them earlier.</p>

Republican county council candidates Frank Agovino and Joseph Lombardo filed suit Oct. 29 after being notified of irregularities in the mail-in ballots, something they contended impacted the integrity of the Nov. 2 election as they requested thousands of votes to be sequestered and counted by court-appointed individuals. County staff had testified that impacted ballots were being sequestered and that observers from both parties are present and watch the counting of the votes. The judge ruled that was adequate. After the decision, county Solicitor William F.  Martin issued remarks. “As anticipated by the county, Judge Eckel confirmed that the petition filed by the Republican candidates was moot, as the matters complained of had been appropriately remedied by the county Board of Elections,” he stated. “The judge confirmed the role of ‘watchers’ to monitor the count of ballots the county had already agreed to sequester. Finally, the judge extended to 8 p.m. on Nov. 5, 2021, the period where the county can tabulate ballots, only as the deadline relates to the small number of ballots that had been re-mailed, or mailed late, as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day. As to the petitioners’ proposal to take the election out of control of the Board of Elections, and rest such control in the courts, the judge recognized such request as unneeded, since the county was already following the law.”</p>

The suit, filed in San Antonio federal court, argues that both provisions &#8220;will curtail fundamental voting rights without advancing any legitimate state interest.&#8221; &#8220;These vulnerable voters already confront barriers to the ballot box, and SB 1 will exacerbate the challenges they face in exercising their fundamental right to vote,&#8221; the suit argues, saying that the law would negatively impact voters with disabilities, elderly voters, members of the military who are deployed, voters with limited English proficiency and voters residing outside of the country. &#8220;There is a history of discrimination against voters with disabilities in Texas,&#8221; the lawsuit claims, noting estimates that 28% of Texans have conditions impairing their mobility, cognition or vision. The suit also takes aim at SB 1&#8217;s new rules for mail-in voting. Texas traditionally has placed more limits on mail-in voting than other states. The legitimacy of mail-in ballots was largely determined by comparing signatures on applications and ballots.</p>

Bailey-Rihn ruled the Rochester Republican and Assembly Chief Clerk Ted Blazel were required to release calendars, e-mails, internal reports and other documents maintained by the team conducting the election review. Bailey-Rihn accused Vos of trying to hide records by conducting a &#8220;shell game&#8221; that changed who was technically responsible for the records. She ordered Vos to turn over records that were created between May and late August. She suggested he’d given up his opportunity to argue he could withhold a subset of the documents because of attorney-client privilege or other reasons. She said he&#8217;d likely waited too long to make such arguments. &#8220;These need to be produced unless there is a darn good reason why not and I don’t see one at this point,&#8221; Bailey-Rihn said. The team reviewing the election has a taxpayer funded budget of $676,000 and is headed by former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who claimed without evidence last year that the presidential election was stolen.</p>

With the addition of this new envelope converting machinery, Runbeck will be able to oversee each step in the process of producing vote-by-mail packets for their customers.  “Envelopes are a critical part of the vote-by-mail process, whether we are mailing a ballot to a voter, or a voter is mailing their completed ballot for tabulation. We are pleased to be able to bring this final piece of the process under our control for the first time in our company’s history,” said Bryan Dandurand, Vice President of Operations at Runbeck.  Runbeck expects the new W+D 410’s to be fully installed by the end of 2021 and ready for the 2022 midterm election cycle. Until the Envelopers are installed, Runbeck will continue to fulfill 2021 customer orders for vote-by-mail packets using third-party envelope vendors.  “We work with so many jurisdictions across the country, and they each have their own specifications for envelope and ballot design. Purchasing these converting machines will allow us the technology to provide the highest level of customization and chain of custody compliance for their requirements. This can include envelope sizing and now, the integration of mechanisms giving voters the ability to fully track their return envelope as it travels through the USPS system to its final destination,” added Dandurand.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.acslaw.org/event/foxes-and-henhouses-restoring-oversight-and-accountability-a-year-after-the-2020-election/">Foxes and Henhouses: Restoring Oversight and Accountability A Year After the 2020 Election</a>: As we approach the one-year anniversary of the 2020 election, advocates and lawmakers are still debating how best to protect our democratic institutions and promote accountability for executive branch transgressions. Some are particularly concerned about the role that the Department of Justice and its Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) played in undermining congressional oversight during the Trump years, when it issued opinions that arguably distorted the separation of powers by brooking no recognition for Congress&#8217;s prerogatives as a co-equal branch. Others are focused on the need to protect and strengthen the roles of Inspectors General after former President Trump fired four IGs in the span of six weeks in what some called a &#8220;dangerous pattern of retaliation&#8221; against federal watchdogs. Recognizing that transparency and oversight is key to democratic survival, what are the best ways to achieve accountability for executive branch transgressions? What role should the Office of Legal Counsel play in reigning in executive branch illegality? And what reforms to the Inspector General system are needed so that these watchdogs can provide the independent nonpartisan oversight they are legislatively required to deliver? Moderated by Josh Gerstein, senior legal affairs reporter with Politico and featuring welcoming remarks from former Sen. Russ Feingold. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 18, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
