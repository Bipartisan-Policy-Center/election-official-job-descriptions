														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Georgia’s Chris Harvey</strong><br />
<em>Harvey hangs up election hat to return to his roots</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7050" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-300x291.png" alt="" width="300" height="291" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-300x291.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-1024x993.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-768x745.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey.png 1114w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Most people in the elections world don’t necessarily start out working in the elections field. They work in a variety of industries before the siren song of election administration comes calling.</p>
<p>For Chris Harvey, it was a career in law enforcement, including working in both the DeKalb County and Fulton County, Georgia District Attorneys’ offices that lead him to work in the secretary of state’s office, first as an investigator and since 2015 as the director of elections.</p>
<p>Now, after the implementation of a new voting system, a global pandemic and, well, 2020, Harvey is leaving the secretary of state’s office to return to his roots in law enforcement.</p>
<p>“Chris Harvey has been a pillar of the Elections Division since day one, and has been there in the trenches as we defended the integrity of our elections, first from baseless accusations of voter suppression, then baseless accusations of voter fraud,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a<a href="https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/secretary_of_state_brad_raffensperger_thanks_elections_director_for_years_of_service_and_announces_search_to_fill_position"> statement</a>. “Harvey helped Georgia get a new elections system with a paper-ballot backup for the first time in nearly 20 years, was key to helping the counties successfully transition into COVID-19 era election administration, and ushered in 2 minute election lines statewide on Election Day. His hard work and dedication to this office and the people of Georgia will be missed.”</p>
<p>As director of elections Harvey worked with the counties constantly to prepare them for Georgia’s new printed paper-ballot system, the first update to Georgia’s election equipment in nearly 20 years. Together with the election team, Harvey worked to ensure county elections officials had the information available to work with the new system and execute effective elections. As COVID-19 spread through Georgia, Harvey was instrumental in working with GEMA/HS to provide personal protective equipment to elections officials across the state so they could safely open the polls.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just Georgia where Harvey made his mark in the elections world. He was an active participant in national organizations like the<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Election Directors</a>.</p>
<p>“NASED has been fortunate to call Chris one of our own over the last six years.  We’re grateful for his willingness to share his knowledge and perspective with his colleagues across the country and will especially miss his dry sense of humor.  NASED is incredibly proud of Chris’s integrity and commitment to service in the face of so many challenges, and Georgia’s voters should be, too,” said Michelle Tassinari, NASED President and Director &amp; Legal Counsel, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</p>
<p>We’d like to wish Chris the best of luck in all his future endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>Why have you decided to leave at this time?</strong><br />
I was offered the opportunity to return to my previous long-term career in public safety as the deputy director of the Georgia Peace Officer’s Standards and Training Council where I will have the opportunity to further the professional standards and support the dedicated men and women who serve their communities as police officers, sheriff deputies, and similar roles. While the job of elections director has been extremely challenging and satisfying, it’s the only job I never sought, applied for, asked to have or ever thought I would do. I wouldn’t take anything for the experiences I’ve had in the years I’ve had the privilege to work in elections, but I’m excited to get back into service closer to my professional roots.</p>
<p><strong>What are you most proud of during your time in the secretary of state&#8217;s office?</strong><br />
I am unquestionably most proud of the way the 159 county election offices handled everything that was thrown at them for the last six years and worked with our office. Our previous DRE voting system faced intense legal and public opinion challenges, and everyone handled those challenges and necessary changes like the professionals they are. Then, in 2019, they adopted a new BMD paper system that got put in place in very short order, right before COVID 19 slammed our state. These local officials stayed at their posts when most others were working from home, and became experts at “on the fly” poll worker recruiting, polling place hunting, and keeping their voters safe and updated on necessary changes. I cannot say enough about the heroism of Georgia’s county election officials. I am also very proud of the resolve that everyone in the Secretary of State’s Office showed, starting with Sec. Raffensperger, as Georgia was put under the spotlights in late 2020 and early 2021.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most difficult challenge you faced while working in elections?</strong><br />
Besides the easy answer, “COVID 19”, I think it was the incredibly complex everyday challenge of balancing of the sometimes competing concepts of election security and voter access. Not having spent years in elections work prior to this, I was not expecting the legal and public relations challenges that  went into almost every decision we had to make. Decisions we made seemed to be immediately branded from the outside with a political motive in pretty cynical and disingenuous ways. In the course of the time I was in this role, I managed to be labeled a suppressor from one side, and a fraud-enabler from another, seemingly depending on the outcome of different elections.</p>
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about how elections in this country are run what would it be?</strong><br />
I think elections are run pretty well for the most part. I was recently asked, “Are elections in Georgia secure?” I responded that they are secure, but that they are not perfect because none of us are perfect. I would like to see citizens get more involved as poll workers and election professionals. I told our local election officials that when they get calls and complaints from concerned citizens about what they see and hear about the election, that they should ask those people to serve as poll workers and see for themselves how the systems work and what safeguards are already in place to keep errors of ill-intent from happening. In Georgia, we have taken a lot of very positive steps such as automatic voter registration and have seen record breaking voter registration and turnout. We have added audits and all of our processes are open to public inspection and scrutiny.</p>
<p>I would like to see government officials who say things like, “Voting is our most sacred right,” back that up by devoting the resources needed to recruit and retain the best workers and allow their local election officials to do their jobs with enough staff, material, and support.</p>
<p><strong>There are some people who refuse to believe that the 2020 election was conducted freely and fairly, what would you say to them to hopefully change their minds?<br />
</strong>I would say to find and stick to the facts for yourself and get involved in the process. Sadly, I don’t know that many people care about much except their side winning. Many people see “scorched earth” as a reasonable response to any loss.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to someone considering getting a start in the elections field today?</strong><br />
I would say that unless your integrity and determination are securely formed, go do something else. For me, it’s all about service. Unless you are willing to serve everyone as fairly as possible, you’re not going to be successful or satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>What will you miss most about working in elections?</strong><br />
I’ll mostly miss the many relationships I established with people across so many different contexts (local election officials, other state election directors, and many interested and concerned individuals.)</p>

Biden (D) promised to<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ahead-of-tulsa-trip-biden-to-unveil-new-plans-to-reduce-black-white-wealth-gap/2021/05/31/b80c9c4e-c269-11eb-8c18-fd53a628b992_story.html"> “fight like heck”</a> against Republican efforts to restrict voting. Biden announced that he was tapping Vice President Kamala Harris to marshal an effort against the increasing array of Republican-led state laws that restrict voting in various ways, a campaign Biden condemned as “un-American.” “This sacred right is under assault with incredible intensity like I’ve never seen,” Biden said, adding that June should be a “month of action” on Capitol Hill. In a<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/statement-from-vice-president-kamala-harris-on-administrations-voting-rights-efforts/"> statement released from The White House</a>, Harris said, “President Joe Biden asked me to help lead our Administration’s effort to protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans. In the days and weeks ahead, I will engage the American people, and I will work with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide. And we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.” On the same day, a group of<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/556284-scholars-warn-democracy-is-threatened-call-for-voting-rights-protections"> university professors and scholars signed onto a statement</a> calling for increased federal voting protections, warning that U.S. democracy is “now at risk” with the wave of recent GOP-led legislative proposals across the country seeking to implement sweeping voting overhauls. The dozens of academics, which included political science and government professors at schools like Stanford, Harvard and Cornell, in the letter called themselves “scholars of democracy who have watched the recent deterioration of U.S. elections and liberal democracy with growing alarm.”</p>

Hursti said the exhaustive investigation revealed no indication of malfeasance or manipulation of the voting machines in Windham. &#8220;Nothing today is showing evidence of fraud. Nothing today is showing evidence of digital manipulation of the machines,&#8221; Hursti said according to WMUR. &#8220;Right now, this seems to be a case of a perfect storm where so many things happened in order to have this discrepancy.&#8221; Hursti added that he is amazed by the influx of doctored videos that have been generated around the work of the auditors. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing how much disinformation and dishonest reporting has been spreading, especially last night,&#8221; Hursti said. &#8220;I need to have a second beer when watching those.&#8221; The auditors did find fixable problems, but  no fraud. In addition to problems caused by folds in ballots, auditors also found that paper dust buildup in the machines made it much easier for the optical scanners to misread the fold as a vote. Hursti recommended the machines be cleaned regularly.</p>

Doug Ducey has signed into law a measure that prevents government officials from <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/06/01/ducey-signs-bill-to-prohibit-changes-to-election-deadlines/">changing election deadlines</a> established by statutes. HB2794, sponsored by Rep. Jake Hoffman, R-Gilbert, was created to address changes in voter registration deadlines that occurred during the November 2020 general election. “This is something that we saw in an unprecedented election,” Hoffman said. “We saw all across the country, including here in Arizona, the attempt to change statutorily prescribed deadlines. This is a bill that says that in Arizona, the legislature as granted by the Constitution of the United States, has the authority for the management and administration of elections; that those deadlines should not be changed, and that if they are there is a penalty for doing so.”  Hoffman’s bill, which passed both the House and Senate by narrow margins of two and three votes respectively, received unanimous support from Republicans but was largely shunned by Democrats, who claimed that it violates separation of powers and gratuitously punishes election officials. Sen. Christine Marsh, D-Phoenix, was the only member of her party who did not vote against the bill, instead opting to refrain from voting altogether.</p>

The amendment passed the House of Representatives on May 6 and was approved in 2019 by a majority in both chambers of the Connecticut General Assembly. Secretary of the State Denise Merrill released a statement following the joint resolution passing the Senate, praising the state for working to expand voting laws in Connecticut.  &#8220;On Election Day 2022, Connecticut voters will get to decide if they want the option of voting in person before Election day – just like the voters in 44 other states,&#8221; said Merrill. &#8220;As Florida, Texas, Georgia, and other states are moving to restrict voting rights, I’m proud that Connecticut is doing the opposite, addressing our burdensome and restrictive laws, and making voting more accessible to every eligible Connecticut citizen. The question that voters will see on the 2022 ballot will be:  “Shall the Constitution of the State be amended to permit the General Assembly to provide for early voting?”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5487" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Illinois:</strong> Lawmakers passed an<a href="https://www.capitolnewsillinois.com/NEWS/updated-both-houses-pass-election-bill-postponing-2022-primary-to-june"> omnibus elections bill</a> that would push back the date of the 2022 primary elections amid other major changes to the state’s election code. The 156-page omnibus bill,<a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/102/SB/10200SB0825ham001.htm"> an amendment</a> to Senate Bill 825 filed by Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, would also strengthen the state’s cybersecurity surrounding elections and make Election Day a holiday among other provisions. The bill was filed Sunday night, passed the House 72-46 at about 6 p.m. Monday, then passed on a partisan 41-18 split in the Senate at about 10 p.m. It will need only a signature from the governor to become law. Under the legislation, in 2022, early voting for primary elections would start May 19 and Election Day would be moved to June 28. State primaries are typically held in March. The dates for nominating petitions for primaries would also change, with those seeking office being able to circulate petitions starting Jan. 13. Congressional and judicial candidates must have petitions filed by March 14. The provision changing these dates is set to expire at the start of 2023. The bill would also make the date of the general election, November 8, a state holiday in 2022. It will be considered a legal school holiday, and any schools closing due to the holiday would “be made available to an election authority as a polling place for 2022 General Election Day.” This provision would also expire at the start of 2023. The legislation would have voters who apply to be on the list remain on it until they request to be removed, change their registration or register to vote in another county. A witness representing the Kane County Clerk told the committee that county clerks receive death certificates and notice of address changes and would remove voters from the rolls in those instances as well. The bill also tasks the Illinois State Board of Elections with looking into the possibility of electronic vote-by-mail for voters with disabilities. By the end of 2021, ISBE must submit legislation to the General Assembly creating a method for disabled voters to independently and privately mark a ballot using assistive technology. Before submitting the legislation, ISBE must hold at least two public hearings on the subject. he bill would also require election authorities to beef up cybersecurity measures including monthly vulnerability scans, risk assessment every two years and use protection from the Department of Innovation and Technology or a third-party vendor within one year of its passage. The bill also allows election authorities to create temporary polling places in the jails of smaller counties. Under current law, a county with 3 million or more residents – which applies exclusively to Cook County – is required to make a temporary branch polling place in the county jail, allowing residents of that county who are in custody but have not been convicted of the arresting offense to vote. The election omnibus allows sheriffs in all other Illinois counties the option of establishing a temporary polling place in their county jail.</p>

If a voter fails to leave a voting machine after a commissioner notifies him that six minutes have elapsed, the commissioners shall order the voter to complete voting and leave the voting machine. Even so, if a ballot is lengthy or if it contains complex propositions or constitutional amendments, the commissioners may allocate additional time in an equitable manner, the act states. Previously, voters were given three minutes to remain in voting machines.</p>

They also could show their ID to their local clerk or send a photocopy of their license or ID card. Michigan voters already are asked to present a photo ID at the polls, but anyone who doesn’t have one can fill out an affidavit instead and cast their ballot as normal.<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ehebk0x4sdu1h4zbjbyabuwk))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2021-SB-0303"> Senate Bill 303</a> would require voters to present a valid ID at the polls and<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ehebk0x4sdu1h4zbjbyabuwk))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2021-SB-0304"> Senate Bill 304</a> would set up a process of casting a provisional ballot if they don’t have ID. All three bills now go to the full Senate for consideration. They would have to pass there and in the House before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer would decide whether to sign them into law.</p>

AB 321 moved out of both chambers on a strict party-line vote, with all Republicans opposed. Gov. Steve Sisolak has now<a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/politics/nevada-gov-sisolak-signs-permanent-mail-in-voting-system-into-law/"> signed the bill into law</a>. “At a time when state legislatures across the country are attempting to roll back access to the polls, I am so proud that Nevada continues to push forward with proven strategies that make voting more accessible and secure,” Sisolak said in a statement. “Nevada has always been widely recognized as a leader in election administration and with this legislation, we will continue to build on that legacy.”</p>

Under an amended House Bill 291, “The attorney general shall analyze the requests for absentee ballot information for state general elections and presidential primary elections contained in the statewide centralized voter registration database for evidence of misuse.” The bill requires the attorney general to analyze and report absentee ballots mailed to a common address and “significant differences in the number of ballots that were requested from a city or town.” The attorney general would be required to report the results of the analysis and any additional actions that were taken to the Senate Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee and the House Election Law Committee.  The bill was passed on a 14-10 roll call vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed. The bill has the same goal as the version that passed the House earlier in the session, but with different details and wording. The differences between the two versions will presumably eventually be addressed by a committee of conference.</p>

The online system would track applications for absentee ballots, when it has been received by elections officials, whether it has been approved and when the ballot has been mailed to the voter as well as whether the ballot, once cast, has been accepted or rejected. It would also provide a reason to the voter as to why the ballot was rejected. “We have continued to take steps to make it as easy as possible for New Yorkers to vote in our elections, and in a few short months voters will have the opportunity to enshrine permanent no-excuse absentee balloting in our state constitution,&#8221; said Democratic Assemblyman Jeff Dinowitz. &#8220;It is imperative that we make sure voters maintain confidence in our electoral systems, regardless of the method by which they choose to vote.&#8221;</p>

The bureau would be required to conduct result-confirming audits of each election in the Commonwealth by the third Friday following the election. The audits would examine processes and results, including equipment, absentee and mail-in ballots, performance audits of election systems at least every five years, and any other audit deemed necessary by the bureau to ensure public trust in election outcomes. Previous elections would not be reviewed by the bureau. Approximately $3.1 million of the state’s budget would be appropriated to fund the bureau, according to a news release from Cutler&#8217;s office.</p>

It would create new limitations to early voting hours, ratchet up voting-by-mail restrictions and curb local voting options like drive-thru voting. Democrats had argued the bill would make it harder for people of color to vote in Texas. Republicans called the bill an “election integrity” measure — necessary to safeguard Texas elections from fraudulent votes, even though there is virtually no evidence of widespread fraud. SB 7 was one step away from the governor’s desk. It was negotiated behind closed doors over the last week after the House and Senate passed significantly different versions of the legislation and pulled from each chamber’s version of the bill. The bill also came back with a series of additional voting rule changes that weren’t part of previous debates on the bill, including new ID requirements for voting by mail, restrictions on Sunday early voting hours and a higher threshold for who can qualify to vote by mail based on a disability.</p>

He urged the legislature to develop a statewide policy or &#8220;uniform template&#8221; for municipalities seeking to expand voting rights.  &#8220;I understand these charter changes are well-intentioned,&#8221; Scott wrote in a letter to lawmakers Tuesday evening. &#8220;But I ask the Legislature to revisit the issue of non-citizen voting in a more comprehensive manner.&#8221;  The decision will come as a blow to the two cities, where voters overwhelmingly supported the proposals.</p>

Lee last week filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed in May by the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, Disability Rights Florida and Common Cause, one of three challenges to the elections law, which has drawn national attention. The motion describes the lawsuit as a “shotgun” complaint that does not properly spell out allegations and contends that Lee should not be a defendant. Unlike the other two challenges, Lee is the only defendant in the first lawsuit. “Because enmity and hyperbole are no substitute for well-pled facts, this court should dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint,” said the motion, filed Friday in federal court in Tallahassee. The lawsuit was filed May 6, shortly after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the elections law during an appearance on Fox News. The measure was one of the most controversial issues of the 2021 legislative session, with Republicans saying it was needed to ensure secure election security and Democrats contending it was aimed at voter suppression. In the motion to dismiss, Lee’s attorneys cited a ruling last year by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that concluded the secretary of state was not a proper defendant in a case involving the order in which candidates are placed on Florida ballots. Lee’s attorneys said the 2020 ruling requires the plaintiffs in the challenge to the new elections law to “link the secretary to the injuries they allege and the relief they seek. This the plaintiffs do not do in their complaint.”</p>

The suit, filed in Shawnee County district court  argues that provisions of two bills altering election laws violate the state and U.S. constitution by suppressing speech and disenfranchising voters. The groups further contend that the changes were made in the absence of any evidence that the state’s elections are insecure. “In most instances, the Legislature relied on little more than vague references to concerns about elections integrity or fraud that was rumored to have occurred in other states,” the lawsuit said. “Yet, no legislator pointed to even a single instance of fraud precipitating the need for these drastic changes.” The two bills were approved over Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto. They were part of a nationwide push by Republican state legislators to use unfounded claims of voter fraud during the 2020 election as grounds for revising election rules. Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a defendant in the suit, who has said that Kansas had “free and fair” elections in 2020, declined to comment on pending litigation before his office had been formally served.</p>

The flaw is a wording error from when the state had five U.S. Congressional districts instead of its current four. The Mississippi Constitution requires a certain percentage of signatures petitioning for an initiative to be on the ballot come from all five congressional districts. The error means the ballot initiative process “cannot work in a world where Mississippi has fewer than five congressional districts,”<a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/161468.P.pdf"> according to the majority opinion</a> authored by Justice Josiah Coleman. Matt Steffey, a constitutional law professor at the Mississippi College School of Law told the Clarion Ledger the ruling represents a rigid, textual reading of the state’s constitution. It has<a href="https://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/news/2021/06/01/mississippi-supreme-court-voter-id/7494608002/"> set the state up for a potential challenge to its voter ID law</a> of which was passed by voters as part of the ballot initiative process. Mississippi voters approved a voter ID law in 2011, with 62% of voters that cycle voting in favor of it. Secretary of State Michael Watson has called Gov. Tate Reeves to order a special session of the legislature to prevent any possible challenges to the state’s voter ID and eminent domain laws. Watson previously said his office will not challenge the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling. Most of the voter ID law is codified into state law, and not just the Constitution, Watson said, protecting it from legal challenge. However, the portion of it requiring Mississippi to provide free identification cards to voters has not been codified by the legislature and could be made null if challenged in a court of law.</p>

The lawsuit filed by the Lewis and Clark County attorney, a criminal defense association and several private lawyers seeks an injunction against Senate Bill 319, one of several bills re-engineered in the final phases of the legislative process in a conference committee without public comment. The filing in Lewis and Clark County District Court alleges the bill is unconstitutional because it violates the single-subject provision, as well as the article of the state Constitution that says no bill shall be amended so heavily that its original purpose has been changed. The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Greg Hertz, initially dealt with joint fundraising committees. In a<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/legislature-passes-new-recusal-requirements-for-judges/article_22233bcb-daeb-56f3-9ecc-34900dcc34e7.html"> late-session conference committee</a>, however, lawmakers tacked on two other measures including that banned voter registration, signature collection, voter turnout and other activities by political groups in certain areas of university campuses.</p>

In a 2019 law, the state required adequate and equitable access to poll sites. James’ complaint says Rensselear fails to do that. “Two years and several election cycles after the legislation’s enactment, the BOE in Rensselaer County, New York has continually violated this law, failing to designate early voting poll sites at locations that ensure adequate and equitable access for voters in Troy as it is legally required to do,” the 41-page complaint states. James says Rensselaer completely missed the point of the law in first selecting a pair of early-vote locations that “are wealthier, less diverse, less accessible by public transportation, and already enjoy higher rates of voter turnout.” “It is the government’s responsibility to ensure that every person with the right to vote is able to do so without hardship, and I will do everything in my power to ensure every New Yorker has fair access to the polls,” James said in a statement announcing the lawsuit filed Thursday in the Rensselaer County Supreme Court. The suit names Commissioners Jason Schofield, a Republican, and Edward McDonough, a Democrat, as co-defendants for failing to provide equal access required under the state’s early voting law.</p>

Two days after losing the Republican nominations to three write-in candidates, Richard Martin and Richard Fidler amended an earlier lawsuit that claimed they could be denied fulfilling their original terms in office after the township’s voters decided last November to downsize the board from five supervisors to three. An earlier lawsuit Martin, Fidler and Iams filed against the two other supervisors, along with the municipality and Washington County Board of Elections, demanded the Donegal Township supervisors race be removed from the May 18 primary, or the results not be counted. Washington County Judge Michael Lucas denied their request, and the Commonwealth Court upheld his ruling five days before the election. The new lawsuit asks that Filder, Martin and Shingle be permitted to continue in their roles as supervisors until their terms expire, which is slated to happen in 2024 for Martin and Shingle and 2026 for Fidler. The terms for Iams and Croft are scheduled to end this coming January.</p>

Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair. We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment. About the Job: Your goal is to make election administrators successful when running Arlo, VotingWorks’ risk-limiting audit software, to conduct risk-limiting election audits. You succeed when these election administrators succeed in delighting audit board members, voters, and the public. You’ll need to become very skilled with the Arlo software, the VotingWorks voting machines and general risk-limiting audit procedures. You’ll support election administrators and audit board members with tier 1 support (basic software and procedure questions) that includes light training and troubleshooting in preparation for and during audit conduct remotely. Occasionally, you’ll be asked to provide the same support in-person. Your enthusiasm for the product, the process, the mission, and the team should be infectious, surpassed only by your organizational skills and ability to multitask. You know that no matter how robust a technology, at the end of the day it’s people who make other people successful and you feel personally responsible for ensuring that everyone who uses Arlo feels successful. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257"> click here</a>.</p>
