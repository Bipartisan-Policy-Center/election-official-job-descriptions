							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Combating Disinformation</strong><br />
<em>Local election officials are uniquely qualified to effectively, inexpensively combat disinformation</em></p>
<p>By Spenser Mestel<br />
For electionlineWeekly</p>
<p><em>This story has been updates 9:45 a.m. Friday April 9.</em></p>
<p>There is no off-season when it comes to elections, but now, when the public spotlight is a little less intense, is a good time to start preparing for the next rounds of disinformation and misinformation.</p>
<p>As both a poll worker in New York City and a<a href="https://www.spensermestel.com/"> voting rights journalist</a>, I know how difficult it is to communicate with the public, especially about technical details. I also know that, on top of running elections, you’ve probably got a thousand other responsibilities, from issuing liquor licenses to handling death records.</p>
<p>However, you are uniquely well qualified to combat election disinformation. As a local election admin, the public<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/09/19/why-americans-dont-fully-trust-many-who-hold-positions-of-power-and-responsibility/"> trusts</a> you more than they trust the media, politicians, or federal officials. So how can you do it quickly and effectively? Let’s use the Election Integrity Partnership’s recent<a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/"> report</a>, which offers three recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6706" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmedia-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmedia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmedia.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Recommendation #1:</strong> Flag misinformation on social media platforms.</p>
<p>This is relatively easy. There are dedicated email addresses, portals, and means of communicating directly with the social media companies set up exclusively for state and local elections officials to report disinformation. Non-elections officials reading this can help out by reporting it directly to the social media outlets (here’s how on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/2442045389198631"> Instagram</a>,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/572838089565953"> Facebook</a>, and<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-report-violation"> Twitter</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation #2:</strong> Establish trusted channels of communication with voters using a .gov website, traditional media, and social media.</p>
<p>For now, let’s just talk about traditional media (we’ll get to social media next). [Ed. Note: electionlineWeekly will be covering the .gov issue next week.]</p>
<p>As a reporter, I can tell you this: outlets are always looking for stories, so don’t wait for them to contact you. If there’s a local reporter who covers elections, email them and introduce yourself (see template below). If you aren’t sure who has that beat, look at the masthead and email a few of the editors.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a specific story (breaking: everything going as planned), remind them of upcoming elections and key information: how to register, where to find your polling place location, what’s on the ballot, etc. Every article also needs art, so offer to provide high-resolution images, which you should keep in an easily-accessible and shareable folder, and indicate when you’re available for interviews.</p>
<p>Feel free to use this template:</p>
<p>“Hey Spenser,</p>
<p>I’m the [job title] for [whatever jurisdiction], and I wanted to reach out, introduce myself, and remind you of the upcoming primary on June 22nd. On the ballot will be the races for mayor, city council, public advocate, and comptroller, and we’ll be using ranked choice voting for the first time.</p>
<p>There’s a great explainer of RCV on our<a href="https://vote.nyc/"> website</a>, along with information on registering, requesting an absentee, and becoming a poll worker (we currently need about 200 more). I’m also free to speak with reporters on Thursday afternoons, and we can provide high-res images as well.</p>
<p>Follow us on Instagram<a href="https://www.instagram.com/boenyc/?hl=en"> here</a>.</p>
<p>Great to meet you,”</p>
<p>When it comes to television, invite the local news channel to come film B-roll (is anything more hypnotic than high-speed ballot processing machines?), and also reach out to publications that cater to under-served voters, like high school newspapers and nursing home newsletters. These groups are likely covering the elections already and would love a helping hand.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation #3</strong>: Tell a start-to-finish story for each voter’s ballot, including how to register to vote; ensuring one’s registration is up to date; where, when, and how to vote; and how votes will be counted and reported, including the timing of that process.</p>
<p>Social media is probably the best way to distribute this kind of information. Ideally, you’d have a full-time staffer to handle your digital communications (*laughs hysterically*), but since that’s probably not the case, it’s better to do one platform well than all of them poorly. So, here’s a breakdown of each one from least to most labor intensive (and if you want more guidance, I recommend this episode of “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/social-media-and-king-county-with-halei-watkins/id1546061812?i=1000510890150">High Turnout, Wide Margins</a>” with King County’s social media guru Halei Watkins).</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5715" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-02-at-10.06.02-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="70" height="70" />Facebook allows you to post text, images, and video and mostly caters to voters 40 years and older. The slowest and least personality-driven of the platforms, you should aim to post here once or twice a day, but be ready to respond to comments.</p>
<p>Who to follow:<br />

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5908" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-150x150.png" alt="" width="75" height="75" />Twitter also accommodates text, images, and video but limits each post to 280 characters, though you can link posts together (called a thread). The platform of choice for journalists, Twitter is a great way to see the local and national conversation about voting, but it moves quickly and therefore requires a lot of time and vigilance. Aim to post at least eight times a day.</p>

Aim to post once or twice a day.</p>

Unless you’re extremely motivated or have a dedicated social media person, I’d stick with the other channels, though some election admins are doing it well (see below).</p>
<p>Who to follow:<br />
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tok.the.vote?source=h5_m">Tok The Vote</a> is, unsurprisingly, a TikTok-native account created to register younger voters.<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@voteboonemo?u_code=dd30aljebd8ffh&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;_d=dd30b0jgd5dgl9&amp;share_item_id=6840514734882573573&amp;timestamp=1592681454&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;app=musically&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;user_id=6840240974960116742&amp;tt_from=sms&amp;utm_source=sms&amp;source=h5_m"> Boone County</a> is relatively new to the platform but does a great job of capturing its fun, irreverent energy.</p>

Think of it like radio for your phone, but more casual. [Editor&#8217;s Note: Elections officials should be aware that there are some<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clubhouse-privacy-security-growth/"> security concerns</a> about Clubhouse and the Shanghai-based company that runs the site&#8217;s infrastructure.]</p>

<p><strong>A few other recommendations:<br />
</strong>Make non-news events news. Don’t be shy about explaining behind-the-scenes processes, like how a risk-limiting audit works and what the results were.</p>
<p>Pictures sell. Even for text-heavy platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, it helps to include graphics. Just make sure they’re formatted correctly (here’s a<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-image-sizes-guide/"> size guide</a>).</p>
<p>Details matter. Instead of saying that ballots are collected from drop boxes once a day, tell voters that a bipartisan team of election officials, each wearing neon yellow “BOE” vests, checks the drop boxes around 5pm every day (including weekends!). When voters can picture the process, they’re more likely to remember it.</p>
<p>Assume you’re always being recorded. Last December, a poll worker in Georgia was filmed<a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/politics/election-worker-forced-into-hiding-speaks-out-video-that-falsely-claimed-he-destroyed-ballot/NF7VRBTRY5CCBH4HAARGX5SHDA/"> throwing away</a> a piece of paper. Whoever posted the video on social media claimed it was a ballot (it was actually the instructions for filling out the absentee), and once that cat is out of the bag, it’s impossible to set the record straight.</p>
<p>At the very least, have an email (and respond to it). The best way to stop disinformation is before it starts, so make sure your voters have a way to communicate with you — or they’ll fill the void with less reliable sources.</p>

Sandvoss, who has led the state agency since 2015 and worked for the board in various capacities for 33 years, reported being a victim of an online extortion attempt last week. He informed the Illinois State Police, which has begun an investigation. Sandvoss, 55, was at the helm of the election board, an independent state agency governed by a board of four Democrats and four Republicans, during an alleged Russian cyberattack on 20 state election systems in June 2016. A news release from the SBOE didn’t give any indication whether another attempted Russian hack was involved in the attempted extortion scheme. But the release said that based on Sandvoss’ description, the scheme “appeared typical of many such online scams.” Because the attempt involved a top official at the agency, the board took the “cautionary step” of placing Sandvoss on paid leave.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6823" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VoteLocal-297x300.png" alt="" width="297" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VoteLocal-297x300.png 297w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VoteLocal.png 394w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" />Vote Local:</strong> A handful of states held local elections this week and overall things went relatively smoothly. While all locations offered in-person voting, vote-by-mail once again proved to be popular amongst those who turned out. Severa counties in Illinois experienced issues on Tuesday. In<a href="https://www.wcia.com/news/your-local-election-hq/champaign-county-clerks-website-unofficial-election-results-back-online/"> Champaign County</a>, the county clerk’s website went down around 7pm on election night was restored about 12 hours later. Clerk Aaron Ammons said he’ll be talking to the office’s cyber-security team and website developer to find out why there was a problem with the website. Officials in<a href="https://patch.com/illinois/crystallake/mchenry-county-clerk-reports-anomalies-election-results"> McHenry County</a> said they are working to resolve what they called anomalies found in the results. According to a notice posted on the county&#8217;s election results page, the county clerk&#8217;s office, along with election hardware and software vendors, worked &#8220;late into the night and earlier into the morning&#8221; to determine the cause of tabulation issues. The clerk&#8217;s office expects to count votes again on Thursday, according to the notice. Thirty polling locations in<a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20210406/30-polls-staying-open-late-in-suburban-cook-county"> Cook County</a> were forced to stay open late to make up for opening late when election judges failed to show up. In<a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2021/04/08/far-fewer-ballots-were-counted-on-election-night-than-during-previous-anchorage-mail-in-elections-heres-why/"> Anchorage, Alaska</a> a flood of last-minute voters over the weekend and on Tuesday were among several reasons that Anchorage election officials fell behind in a key part of the ballot-counting process on election day, which slowed the overall ballot tabulation, officials said Wednesday. A large number of ballots with corrections and stray marks also contributed to the issue, elections officials said in a news release late Wednesday. Officials in<a href="https://www.vicksburgpost.com/2021/04/07/city-election-officials-say-jacksons-claim-of-voting-issues-is-wrong/"> Jackson, Mississippi</a> say a post by a mayoral candidate that claims 200 people were denied the right to vote isn’t true. The social media post alleges that voters were “denied the right to vote at precincts they voted at in November.” But city and county election commissioners said the precincts used in November were county precincts and they don’t always coincide with municipal election precincts.</p>

Love, III announced a pilot program that will put<a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/montgomery-county-sec-of-state-merrill-partner-on-program-to-put-voter-registration-kiosks-on-college-campuses/"> voter registration kiosks on college campuses</a> in the county. The kiosks will link directly to AlabamaVote.gov and will be located in high traffic areas on the campuses. “We are excited to offer this new option for Montgomery County voters to participate in the electoral process, and we hope this model will serve as an example for other Alabama counties to follow,” Love said in a press release. The pilot program is set to be in place for three years, which will see Alabamians through the 2022 election cycle. “The Office of the Secretary of State is thrilled to support Judge Love in his pursuit of registering more of our state’s college students to vote. Shortly after taking office, Judge Love made a concerted effort to extend his outreach into the community, and we commend him and his office for their innovation and eagerness to promote voter registration,” Merrill said.

Bartling has been working with the Hall County Election Office for a while and also recently training to be a deputy registrar. “I’ve not had a chance to vote in an election yet,” he said after receiving the recognition. “In the absence of that I have just dedicated myself to make sure others are able to exercise that.” Bartling registered more than 50 new voters just in the last five weeks. “Even if you don’t register voters at events or if you just have conversations with people, it’s better to do something then to do nothing,” Bartling said. “Even just my conversations with people got four or five people to register outside of events.” “On behalf of the state of Nebraska and its citizens, I commend you for your<a href="https://theindependent.com/news/watch-now-grand-island-senior-high-student-s-voter-efforts-earn-high-praise-from-state/article_d62d485c-974b-11eb-bc86-1ff1db862d97.html"> extraordinary service</a> to strengthening the American democracy,” Evnen said, “and for your high personal values and dedication.”</p>

Raphael Warnock, and U.S. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn and Congresswoman Nikema Williams announced the reintroduction of the bicameral<a href="https://oswegocountytoday.com/politics/gillibrand/gillibrand-colleagues-announce-reintroduction-of-voter-empowerment-act/"> Voter Empowerment Act</a>, legislation originally authored in the House by civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, who passed away last year. This legislation would help protect the voting rights of people across the country by ensuring equal access to the ballot for every eligible voter, modernizing voter registration, and helping to eliminate deceptive practices that deter people from voting. The Voter Empowerment Act is a cornerstone of the For the People Act, a transformational voting rights, anti-corruption and clean elections reform package. The Voter Empowerment Act takes a comprehensive approach to close the gaps in voting access and ensure that every American can participate in the electoral process. Specifically, it would do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires states to make available online voter registration, correction, cancellation and designation of party affiliation.</li>
<li>Requires states to automatically register to vote any eligible unregistered citizens.</li>
<li>Establishes same-day voter registration, including during early voting.</li>
<li>Prohibits purging of voter rolls by limiting the authority of states to remove registrants from the official list of eligible voters in elections for federal office in the state based on interstate voter registration crosschecks.</li>
<li>Makes it unlawful to hinder, interfere or prevent an individual from registering to vote, and requires the Election Assistance Commission to develop best practices for states to deter and prevent such violations.</li>
<li>Requires states to promote access to voter registration and voting for persons with disabilities and older individuals. Funds grants to improve voting accessibility for persons with disabilities and creates a pilot program to allow persons with disabilities to register and vote from home.</li>
<li>Prohibits Voter Caging</li>
<li>Prohibits the use of returned non-forwardable mail as the basis for removing registered voters from the rolls. Prohibits challenges to eligibility from individuals who are not election officials without an oath of good faith factual basis.</li>
<li>Requires at least 15 consecutive days of early voting for federal elections. Requires that early voting locations be near public transportation, in rural areas and open for at least 10 hours per day.</li>
<li>Prohibits a state from imposing restrictions on vote by mail, requires the state to implement a program to track and confirm receipt of mail ballots, and requires the prepayment of postage and return envelopes.</li>
<li>Prohibiting Deceptive Practices and Preventing Voter Intimidation</li>
<li>Makes it unlawful to provide false information about elections in order to hinder or discourage voting.</li>
<li>Increases penalties for voter intimidation and prescribes sentencing guidelines for those individuals found guilty of such deceptive practices.</li>
<li>Restores federal voting rights to individuals with a criminal record, so long as they are not serving a felony sentence in a correctional facility. Requires states and the federal government to notify individuals convicted of state or federal felonies, respectively, of their re-enfranchisement.</li>
<li>Reauthorizes Election Assistance Commission</li>
<li>Requires each state to comply with any EAC request for post-election survey following any regularly scheduled general election for federal office</li>
<li>Directs the Election Assistance Commission to assess the security, cybersecurity and effectiveness of the Commission’s information technology systems</li>
</ul>

Eight different ideas — two from Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration, three from legislative Democrats and three from legislative Republicans are under consideration.  Three of the bills would increase or decrease Alaskans’ ability to vote by mail in state elections, while others would require more financial disclosure from political campaigns or address the powers of the Division of Elections. Asked whether it supports or opposes any of the legislation, the division said it intends to remain neutral.</p>
<p>One<a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=HB%2066"> a multi-part bill</a> that would allow Alaskans to register to vote right up until Election Day and give mail-in voters a chance to fix mistakes with their ballots. The bill would also raise poll workers’ pay, permanently waive the witnessing requirement for absentee votes and instruct the Division of Elections to count mail-in votes starting before Election Day, delivering results quicker.</p>
<p>Another bill would allow someone as young as 16 to<a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=HB%20%2039"> preregister to vote</a>. At age 18, the Division of Elections will send them a voter card, and they will be allowed to vote.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=SB%2039">Senate Bill 39</a>, which was proposed before the 2020 election but has gained momentum since then. The bill proposes new security measures, including the tracking of absentee ballots, but more controversially would roll back a program that automatically registers Permanent Fund dividend recipients to vote. That program was approved by voters in<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2016/11/09/alaskans-favor-ballot-measure-to-make-voting-easier-rejecting-another-on-student-loans/"> a 2016 ballot measure</a>. As written, the bill would also prohibit some communities from holding elections by mail and prevent the state from holding elections by mail. Municipal elections in some larger cities, such as Anchorage and Juneau, would not be affected.</p>
<p>Sen. Shelley Hughes (R-Palmer) has proposed<a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=SB%20%2043"> a bill</a> that would require additional financial disclosure by the funders of ballot measures.</p>
<p>Rep. Sara Rasmussen (R-Anchorage) has proposed a<a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=HB%20157#tab5_4"> bill</a> that would require earlier disclosure from ballot measure backers and supporters of recall campaigns. In part, the bill is intended to address the fact that no one involved in the recall campaign against Gov. Mike Dunleavy has been required to disclose their contributions.</p>
<p>The governor’s office has proposed<a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=SB%20%2082"> a bill</a> that would expand the ability of the Department of Law to investigate elections issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/32?Root=SB%20%2083#tab5_4">Another bill</a> would allow the state to conduct statewide elections entirely by mail in towns and villages with fewer than 750 people. That measure is intended to solve the problem of recruiting poll workers in small towns and villages. Other parts of the bill would allow the Division of Elections more power to audit results and put into law the requirements for an acceptable absentee ballot.</p>

About 75% of Arizona voters are on the list. Affected voters would get a postcard asking if they want to remain on the list, and would be removed if they don’t respond. Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers did not explain his decision to abruptly cut off debate, but it suggests at least one Republican was not going to support the bill. With a slim 31-29 majority, the GOP must be united to pass legislation without Democratic support. A spokesman for Bowers, said there will be discussions about amending the bill, and he expects it to come back to the House floor in the future.</p>
<p>The Senate has approved a bill that would<a href="https://yourvalley.net/stories/arizona-legislature-votes-to-outlaw-private-election-grants,224967"> ban private funding</a> for elections. The measure was sent to Gov. Doug Ducey following a party-line vote. Democrats warned the measure could starve election offices of the funds needed to run secure and efficient elections. Democrats say the measure is one of several voter suppression bills that could get votes in the Legislature in the coming days weeks. Democrats say the grants wouldn&#8217;t be necessary if the Legislature provided enough money to county election officials to run elections. However Republicans argued if the Legislature doesn&#8217;t stop it, election funding will become the newest way for corporations and wealthy donors to wield influence, said Sen. J.D. Mesnard, (R-Chandler). “This makes dark money look like a bright day,” Mesnard said. &#8220;We should be proactively stopping that before it becomes embedded in America’s election system.&#8221; Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs used $4.8 million from the Center for Election Innovation and Research for an advertising campaign telling voters when and how to vote, encourage signup for the permanent early voting list, recruit poll workers and combat misinformation before and after the election. Nine counties — Apache, Coconino, Graham, La Paz, Maricopa, Navajo, Pima, Pinal and Yuma — also received grants from the Center for Tech and Civic Life</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5404" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arkansas:</strong> House Bill 1715 by Rep. Mark Lowery, R-Maumelle, would ban the distribution of unsolicited<a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/apr/02/bills-to-modify-laws-pertaining-to-elections-pass/?news"> absentee ballot applications</a> to voters by designated election officials and would make the possession of more than four absentee ballots by one person a rebuttable presumption of intent to defraud. The legislation would also require that signatures on absentee ballots be compared with signatures on voters&#8217; original registration certificates. The chamber sent HB1715 to the state Senate on a 74-22 vote that was largely along party lines.</p>
<p>House Bill 1803, also sponsored by Lowery, would give the state Board of Election Commissioners the<a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/apr/02/bills-to-modify-laws-pertaining-to-elections-pass/?news"> authority to institute corrective actions</a> in response to complaints and would expand the types of violations about which county election boards can make complaints. Lowery noted that it would give the state board enforcement power for a subpoena and would allow commissioners to call in the Arkansas State Police to conduct investigations. The House approved HB1803 78-18, again mostly along party lines.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3843" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CO-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Colorado:</strong> The Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee advanced a bill that would allow voters with disabilities to return voted ballots online, a provision that pitted disability advocates against election security experts.<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-188"> Senate Bill 21-188</a> from Sen. Jessie Danielson seeks to build on legislation the Wheat Ridge Democrat championed in 2019 that allows voters with disabilities to access a ballot online. Under Danielson&#8217;s<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-202"> Senate Bill 19-202</a>, a ballot can then be marked, printed and returned, which allows voters with disabilities to cast a ballot privately and independently. After being signed into law in May 2019, Danielson said Secretary of State Jena Griswold quickly implemented the legislation and it has largely been successful save for one hiccup: few voters with disabilities have a printer. Scott LaBarre, president of the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado, said while testifying to the Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee in support of the bill that less than 7% of Denver voters who attempted to the utilize provision in Danielson’s previous bill were successful in doing so in last fall’s election. Danielson’s latest bill attempts to address that problem by moving the ballot return process online in a similar fashion to ballots returned by Colorado’s military and overseas voters and in cases of emergency. The bill received pushback from election security experts such as C. Jay Coles, the senior policy associate with Verified Voting, who told lawmakers “multiple cybersecurity experts have concluded that internet voting currently is unsafe.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB00005&amp;which_year=2021">Senate Bill 5</a>, a priority of the Senate Democratic majority, would authorize the secretary of the state to expand the successful “motor voter” program that registered voters at the Department of Motor Vehicles to other agencies, including the Department of Social Services. It also would end Connecticut’s status as one of the few states outside the Deep South that bars parolees from voting until they pay all fines owed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2021/TOB/S/PDF/2021SB-00820-R01-SB.PDF">Senate Bill 820</a> would create a state voting rights act, giving people the right to sue municipal legislative districts that are drawn in ways that undercut the influence of racial minorities. If the bill comes to a vote in the Senate, one question will be whether the same standard suggested for municipalities also should apply to the General Assembly, whose districts will be redrawn this year in response to population shifts found by the 2020 Census.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2021/TOB/H/PDF/2021HB-06205-R01-HB.PDF">House Bill 6205</a> would slightly expand the use of absentee ballots, capitalizing on a Supreme Court decision during the COVID-19 pandemic that interpreted a constitutional reference to sickness more broadly than a voter’s illness.</p>
<p>Gov. Ned Lamont signed an<a href="https://www.theday.com/article/20210406/NWS12/210409603"> executive order</a> that will allow people to use the continuing COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to vote by absentee in any election, primary or referendum held before May 20. Lamont’s latest order related to the public health and civil preparedness emergencies is similar to the order that allowed voters to use absentee ballots during the elections in 2020. Lamont&#8217;s new order also provides municipalities and regional school boards with additional flexibility in scheduling budget hearings, meetings, and votes to account for logistical challenges posed by the pandemic.</p>

Pritzker signed a bill yesterday<a href="https://wlds.com/pritzker-signs-host-of-bills-expanding-voting-rights-cocktails-to-go-and-on-trains-ctu-collective-bargaining-rights/"> permanently expanding measures</a> implemented during last November’s General election. Pritzker signed House Bill 1871 into law yesterday that will make ballot drop boxes permanent and expand curbside voting in the state. Under this legislation, election officials can install ballot drop boxes where Illinois voters can submit mail-in ballots without proper postage. Voters can turn in vote-by-mail ballots at any collection site through the close of polls on Election Day. The drop boxes will be secured by locks and can only be opened by election authority personnel. The Illinois State Board of Elections has also been given leeway to also implement further security measures. Election officials are required to collect and process all ballots at the close of each business day. In addition, the law lets local election authorities establish curbside voting for Illinoisans to cast their ballot during early voting or on Election Day. Prior to this law, it was only available to those with a temporary or permanent disability who may have issues entering a polling place. It also allows the Illinois State Board of Elections to distribute any funds left over from the Help America Vote Act to help local election authorities maintain ballot drop boxes. The law takes effect immediately.</p>

The bill — authored by Sen. Erin Houchins, R-Salem, Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, and Sen. Jon Ford, R-Terre Haute — does not allow a county election office employee to write in the driver’s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number associated with a voter’s registration onto an absentee ballot application. Instead, the bill requires the voter to write in their driver’s license number or last four numbers of their Social Security number on their absentee ballot application that is on file with their election board office. The bill also doesn’t allow the Indiana election commission to expand vote by mail options, and prevents the commission or the governor from changing the election date during emergencies.</p>

Andy Beshear (D) has signed into law<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/article250493029.html"> bipartisan legislation</a> that would formalize some of the emergency election rulemaking that took place in 2020. The bill takes some of the elements of the pandemic election plan put in place by Beshear and Secretary of State Michael Adams and makes them permanent. Things like voting supercenters — where a voter from any precinct in the county can vote — and the online absentee ballot request portal will now become permanent fixtures in Kentucky elections. As will absentee ballot drop boxes and three days of early in-person voting for all registered voters. At the same time, the bill accomplishes a major priority for Republicans — cleaning the state’s voter rolls. Kentucky was under a federal consent decree to remove people from the voting rolls who had died or moved away.  Adams, who played a large role in crafting the bill alongside the Kentucky County Clerks Association and the State Board of Elections, touted the fact that the bill added security measures. “While other states are caught up in partisan division, here in Kentucky we lead the nation in both making it easier to vote and harder to cheat,” Adams said.</p>

Teresa Pierce, D-Falmouth, would require Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows to establish a system that allows<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2021/04/05/bill-would-allow-online-voter-registration-in-maine-by-2023/"> online voter registration</a> by January 2023. Maine currently allows any eligible voters to request registration materials online, by phone or in person but doesn’t allow voters to submit or have their application to vote approved electronically. Pierce’s bill would allow voters to register, change their address and update or change their party affiliation all online. Lawmakers who support online registration bill,<a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0804&amp;item=1&amp;snum=130"> L.D. 1126</a>, say it is long overdue and will remove cumbersome barriers that now exist for many voters. Rep. Vicki Doudera, D-Camden, among the supporters of the bill, says the shift will save voters time but will also save the state and local governments money. “Processing electronic applications is a fraction of the cost of processing paper applications,” Doudera said in written testimony. “Arizona, the innovator in paperless voter registration, experienced a reduction in per-registration costs from 83 cents per paper registration to 3 cents per online registration.”</p>
<p>The Legislatures Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee approved a bill that would require the state to conduct<a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2021/04/05/bill-would-audit-maine-election-results/"> post-election audits</a>. “At its heart, this bill is about promoting ongoing election integrity and public confidence in our elections,” Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in testimony supporting the legislation. “It’s not about what we’re not doing. Maine elections are well run. It’s about what we can do in the future to prevent problems before they occur.” Bill sponsor Rep. Nicole Grohoski (D-Ellsworth) said she has worked with local officials and has confidence Maine’s system is secure and accurate, with important protections like paper ballots and a “robust chain of custody” in place. Although the cost of the program has not been determined, Grohoski said it would likely involve additional staff for Bellows’ office. No one testified against the measure.</p>
<p>The Legislature is once again being asked to pass<a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/politics/voter-id-requirement-back-on-maine-lawmakers-agenda/97-e265203b-4b8d-437b-b2d8-b44944638d36"> voter ID</a> as a way to increase confidence in elections- this time following all the controversies of 2020. Maine already requires people to show proof of who they are and where they live when they register to vote. But when those voters actually go to the polls they just have to state their name and address, with no requirement to show an ID. Now four bills are being proposed that would mandate voter photo ID at the polls.</p>

Sponsors of the non-binding resolution — Councilors George Bitzas, Cecilia Calabrese and Mario Tedeschi — said universal mail-in voting is an invitation to fraud, and an unfunded state mandate, placing a burden on the local town clerk and election workers to process the ballots and vouch for their accuracy by comparing signatures.</p>

Senate Republicans have included a<a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/proposed-same-day-voter-registration-changes-minnesota/89-70fc44c2-933c-4838-b772-f3615da2b799"> provisional ballot system</a> in their State Government Operations omnibus bill. How it works, essentially, is that ballots cast by people who register on the day of the election wouldn&#8217;t be counted and added to that day&#8217;s totals. Their ballots would be placed in limbo as provisional ballots, and their votes could be added to the total later if local election administrators can verify their addresses and other eligibility criteria. Republicans would prefer to end same-day registration altogether but they offer this as the middle ground between the current system and imposing a hard deadline to register weeks before an election. Minnesota&#8217;s same-day system allows voting-age adults the opportunity to make a last-minute decision to participate. Or it lets people re-register if they&#8217;ve changed addresses since the last time they voted. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, opposes the idea of switching to a provisional ballot system.</p>

Fry also said the state will give an ID to anyone who is unable to get one.</p>

Rep. Tarra Simmons was convicted of assault in 2001 and of drug and theft charges in 2011 was the chief sponsor of the legislation. Simmons and other supporters said the measure would help encourage former prisoners to reintegrate into society and that it was a matter of racial justice, as those on parole in Washington are disproportionately people of color. More than 20,000 people stand to regain their voting rights when the law takes effect next year.</p>

The bill has been approved by the House of Delegates and is now under consideration by the Senate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wvlegislature.gov/bill_status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=SB565%20SUB1.htm&amp;yr=2021&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=565">Senate Bill 565</a> is under consideration by the House Judiciary Committee. — The bill alters the start and end dates for early in-person voting by 4 days. There are still the same number of days early in-person voting, but it will end six days prior to the election. Currently, early in-person voting ends two days prior to elections. The shift would end early in-person voting the Friday and Saturday before elections, two popular days. There would still be two weekends available for in-person early voting. The bill narrows the cycle from the current four years to two years to identify voters who may have moved without a forwarding address, have another name, died in another state or might otherwise have become ineligible. That starts the process earlier to give clerks time to reach out and clarify a voter’s situation. It takes six years from the start of the process for the purge. No voter’s eligibility is canceled for “failure to vote” alone. The bill clarifies that voters have the option to accept or decline to register to vote while at the DMV. The current law assumes opting in, giving people the option of declining.</p>

The list includes forms of ID that can be used to register to vote in Wyoming: a driver&#8217;s license, state or tribal ID, passport, military ID, or a Wyoming public school, university or community college ID. The bill, though, also includes a Medicare card as an accepted form, an option that&#8217;s been pushed by Wyoming AARP to maintain voting access for older Wyomingites. The Senate amended the bill to include Medicaid cards as well, though that still needs approval from the House before sending the bill to the governor&#8217;s desk. Despite the very few cases of voter fraud in the past two decades in Wyoming, supporters of the bill say it&#8217;s a way to make voters feel confident in the voting system, and prevent future fraud. Gillette Sen. Jeff Wasserburger said he supports the bill, but hopes the state will be able to educate residents on the potential new law before the next elections.

The Wisconsin-based foundation filed suit on behalf of four atheists who argued the oath was a religious requirement that violated their constitutional rights. One of the plaintiffs, Randall Cragun, said he had refused to register to vote in the state because of the oath but could do so now. “It is disappointing that the state prevented me from voting in the 2020 elections, but I am looking forward to participating in the future, and I now have a better appreciation of the value my voice and other individual voices contribute to shaping the state,” Cragun said in a statement.</p>

The suit was filed by Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta and alleges that the new law will disenfranchise Asian American voters by reducing access to absentee voting. he case takes issue with limits on ballot drop boxes, new ID requirements, restrictions on absentee ballot application mailings and a shorter deadline to request absentee ballots. Asian American voters in Georgia will suffer a disproportionate impact since they cast absentee ballots at higher rates than other racial groups in 2020, according to the lawsuit. “This bill is not only an attack on Asian Americans, it’s an attack on all Americans who cherish democracy and freedom,” said Stephanie Cho, executive director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. “This reactionary, racist and backward bill is a stain on Georgia, the beating heart of the civil rights movement.”</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/lawsuit-targets-georgia-limits-on-mass-mailing-ballot-applications/VC34FM5JTZFMRCHPVSBOARQFIQ/"> fifth lawsuit</a> filed against Georgia’s new elections law, organizations that mailed millions of absentee ballot request forms to Georgia voters last year are alleging it illegally curtails their voter outreach. Under the law, groups are only allowed to send absentee ballot applications to Georgians who haven’t already requested a ballot or voted. The restriction on mailings arose after voters complained that they received multiple letters asking them to request absentee ballots, even after they had already done so. Organizations would have to check public election records to make sure they aren’t sending repeated ballot request forms to voters. They face a $100 fine for each duplicate absentee ballot application that’s processed by county election offices, according to the law. “This law makes it virtually impossible to run vote-by-mail application programs that help Georgians cast their ballots,” said Tom Lopach, president of the Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information, two of the plaintiffs in the suit. “That’s why we’re fighting back today against this assault on democracy and will keep working to ensure every American can make their voice heard.” The lawsuit seeks to block the law based on the First Amendment’s free speech protections.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Steve Jones<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-rules-against-much-of-georgia-voting-lawsuit-over-2018-election/NNHKWOBWFZGYTF7N6JTH5SUUBA/"> threw out many of Fair Fight’s claims in a 2018 lawsuit</a>, ruling against challenges to registration cancellations, too few voting machines, inadequate poll worker training and ballots rejections.

Jones’ latest ruling covered the merits of the case. When the case goes to trial, Fair Fight will continue opposing election procedures that make it difficult to vote in Georgia, said Lauren Groh-Wargo, the organization’s CEO. Part of Jones’ ruling rejected Fair Fight’s challenge to Georgia’s “use it or lose it” law, which cancels voter registrations if potential voters don’t participate in elections for several years. Jones wrote that canceled voters aren’t significantly burdened because they can re-register to vote. “The court finds plaintiffs have not shown that the process is applied differently to any class of voters,” Jones wrote. The lawsuit was<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/federal-lawsuit-challenges-fairness-georgia-elections/ZAfqZVmxHmXbAdfgc85TzL/"> filed</a> three weeks after Election Day in 2018.</p>

The Maine Constitution guarantees voters the right to ballot secrecy, so selectmen are asking a Superior Court justice to determine the validity of disputed ballots in its recent close election for Board of Selectmen. The request for judicial intervention comes after candidates could not agree on voters’ intent in a March 31 recount. Hudson is a town of about 1,600. Questions are swirling around absentee ballots that Town Clerk Laurie Saunders numbered and for which she kept a corresponding listing showing which voter received each ballot. That system violates the guarantee that how a person votes is secret. Also, the absentee ballots the town distributed were different from those given to residents who voted in person, another violation of election laws, according to former Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap.</p>

Nessel says their lawsuit was “frivolous” and was an “effort to disenfranchise Michigan’s voters and undermine public trust” in the election’s outcome, according to a news release. The new filing seeks to bring forward relevant statements made by Texas attorney Sidney Powell in a motion she filed. Powell later said “no reasonable person would conclude that the statements were truly statements of fact.” In January, Nessel filed a motion for sanctions against Powell and Michigan attorneys Greg Rohl, Scott Hagerstrom and Stefanie Junttila. The motion, filed with federal Judge Linda Parker of the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, seeks to recover attorneys fees totaling about $11,000. “These attorneys seemingly made statements they knew were misleading in an effort to further their false and destructive narrative,” Nessel said. “As lawyers, fidelity to the law is paramount. These individuals worked to further conspiracy theories in an effort to erode public trust in government and dismantle our systems of democracy. Their actions are inexcusable.”</p>

According to the<em> Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>, The central legal issue to be determined: Whether the election between the two candidates in November was “prevented,” as defined under a state statute because there were many more discrepancies than the slim margin of victory.  If the Supreme Court decides that the discrepancies did prevent the election, it would overturn a ruling by Clark County District Court. Miller won the seat by 15 votes in a race where 139 voting discrepancies were identified. Discrepancies occur when the number of votes counted at a precinct do not match the number of voters who signed in to cast a ballot. It is a normal error during elections and unrelated to fraud, officials say, and typically happens when a voter checks in but does not vote, or vice versa. The discrepancies do not generally cause concern, but they inserted a degree of uncertainty about the outcome in the race for the commission District C seat because the number of discrepancies was far greater than the margin of victory.</p>

The elections board filed the 69-page complaint Friday in the Ohio Supreme Court, and a motion Monday to expedite the case due to a &#8220;fast approaching election-related deadline of June 15, 2021.&#8221; The board is seeking an order from the Supreme Court directing county commissioners to acquire Dominion Voting Systems Image Cast X machines. The bipartisan elections board unanimously voted to adopt the machines for use in Stark County&#8217;s elections nearly four months ago. The machines, according to the complaint, are similar to the voting machines that the county has used since 2005 and competitive in price. The county has hired competing Columbus law firms to represent the elections board and commissioners in the dispute. The elections board had planned to have the new voting machines available for the May 4 primary election, the complaint says. However, the new machines now won&#8217;t be in place for the primary or Aug. 3 special election. It is feared that without an order from the Ohio Supreme Court, the machines will not be in place for the Nov. 2 general election as well, according to the lawsuit. The Board of Elections maintains that &#8220;without new voting machines, the BOE will have to continue to use its old machines that break down more often and are becoming increasingly expensive to fix as replacement parts are harder to obtain,&#8221; the complaint states. The Board of Elections reported in the lawsuit that it made repeated efforts to avoid litigation, but claim the commissioners will not perform their legal duty to purchase the voting machines unless under court order.</p>
<p>The Ohio Supreme Court rejected<a href="https://chroniclet.com/news/257303/ohio-supreme-court-upholds-secretary-of-states-rejection-to-lorain-county-board-of-elections/"> Lorain County</a> Democrats&#8217; plea to overturn Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s veto of Sharon Sweda’s appointment to the Board of Elections. In a 6-1 decision, with Justice Michael Donnelly the sole dissenter, the high court upheld LaRose’s rejection of the former county commissioner’s appointment to the elections board Monday. County Democratic Party Chairman Anthony Giardini, who serves on the elections board, said he now plans to submit Inez James&#8217;s name to LaRose for consideration. Giardini said, as he was disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision against Sweda’s appointment.  “It tells me that in their view a secretary of state has a very wide latitude in making these decisions,” he said. “But as I told the executive committee, I believed that our chances of success were about 50/50. I do believe the effort was worthwhile. I think it’s a battle we had to fight. So I’m not sorry we did, but it is what it is.”</p>
