							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>How We Voted in 2020</strong><br />
<em>A look at the Survey of the Performance of American Elections</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6793" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png" alt="" width="300" height="51" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The MIT Election Lab team has been hard at work at a number of data puzzle pieces since the 2020 election — our ongoing<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/data"> precinct data project</a>, for example. The piece we launched this week, though, is something we’ve been particularly excited about: the latest iteration of the<a href="https://bit.ly/SPAE2020"> Survey of the Performance of American Elections</a> (SPAE).</p>
<p>The SPAE provides information about how Americans experience voting during a federal election. It is the only national survey of election administration that focuses on the process of voting, and provides insights into election performance in the individual states. It’s been conducted in every presidential election since 2008, giving us over a decade of data to draw from.</p>
<p>In 2020, 18,200 registered voters responded to the survey. Two hundred respondents each were interviewed in 40 states plus the District of Columbia, and 1000 interviews were conducted in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. We’re grateful to many folks for making this year’s survey possible, including the Democracy Fund, which supported the 2020 SPAE in part.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6211" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Voting-Line-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Voting-Line-300x182.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Voting-Line.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />On Monday, March 29th, we released a report summarizing our findings from the survey, as well as the SPAE questionnaire and data. We encourage you to read the report and examine the data yourself, if you’re so inclined! You can find everything linked through<a href="https://bit.ly/SPAE2020"> this portal page on our website</a> (which also links back to previous years’ data and findings).</p>
<p>To start you off – or for those of you who we know are pressed for time – we’ve summarized some of the top findings from our report below.</p>
<p><strong>Voting by mail vs. in person</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The percentage of voters casting ballots by mail grew to 46 percent, more than doubling the fraction from 2016. On the other hand, the share of voters casting ballots on Election Day fell to 28 percent, from 60 percent in 2016. Sixty percent of Democrats, compared to 32 percent of Republicans, reported voting by mail.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Voters who cast ballots in person and by mail continued to express high levels of satisfaction with the process, as in past years. Average wait times to vote increased for all modes of in-person voting, and in most states.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Only about half of the ballots that were mailed to voters were returned by mail. Twenty-two percent of mail ballots were returned to drop boxes. In the long-standing vote-by-mail states of Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, 60 percent were returned to drop boxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5823" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>Voting in a pandemic</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Worry about COVID was the top reason cited for voting by mail. But 59 percent of in-person voters were “very confident” that the public health measures in their polling place would protect against catching COVID.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Eighty-seven percent of in-person voters report seeing poll workers wearing masks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voter confidence and perceptions of fraud</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Measured across all voters, confidence that votes were counted as intended remained similar to past years. However, significant partisan gaps opened up.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Among Republicans, lack of confidence in whether votes were counted as intended at the state level was strongly correlated with whether Donald Trump won the respondent’s state and with the fraction of votes cast by mail in the state.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6255" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-768x512.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Partisan attitudes about the prevalence of several types of vote fraud became more polarized in 2020, particularly attitudes about absentee ballot fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attitudes toward election reform</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Voters’ attitudes around reform — both overall support and partisan divisions — remained similar to past years. However, partisan divisions opened up further for voting by mail.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Requiring electronic voting machines to have paper backups, automatically changing registrations when voters move, requiring election officials to be nonpartisan, declaring Election Day a holiday, and requiring voters to show a photo ID to vote were supported by majorities of both Democrats and Republicans.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Adopting automatic voter registration, election-day registration, and moving elections to weekends are supported by a majority of voters, but not by a majority of Republicans.</li>
</ul>

Wake Technology Services, CyFIR, Digital Discovery and Cyber Ninjas are expected to issue their report in about 60 days. “The scope of work will include, but is not limited to, scanning all the ballots, a full manual recount, auditing the registration and votes cast, the vote counts, and the electronic voting system,” a press release says. The<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/03/31/cyber-ninjas-founder-doug-logan-pushed-election-fraud-theories/4825258001/"> company leading the audit</a> Florida-based Cyber Ninjas is drawing scrutiny because of past Tweets from the company’s founder Doug Logan that show his support of the “Stop the Steal” campaign. &#8220;I’m tired of hearing people say there was no fraud. It happened, it’s real, and people better get wise fast,&#8221; said one post he shared from another Twitter user around the end of 2020. He also appears to have shared posts by Sidney Powell, an attorney who supported former President Donald Trump&#8217;s efforts to overturn the election results, and U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., a prominent proponent of conspiracy theories about the last election. Neither Logan nor the company immediately responded to requests for comment from The Arizona Republic on Wednesday. Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers said in a statement on Wednesday that he was &#8220;not familiar with any of the firms&#8221; the Senate has hired. &#8220;Elections are complicated and highly regulated operations,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Maricopa County hired certified experts to conduct its audits and examinations of equipment. I hope the auditors hired by the Senate will take great care with your ballots and the election equipment leased with your tax dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6790" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CIRCLE-300x102.png" alt="" width="300" height="102" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CIRCLE-300x102.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CIRCLE.png 518w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The kids are alright:</strong> According to<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/2020-election-center"> early data from CIRCLE</a>, estimates of youth voter turnout in 21 states shows that, although young people&#8217;s electoral participation increased from 2016 in nearly every state — in many cases by double-digit margins — there were big differences between states, with some nearly doubling the youth turnout rate of others. Shortly after the 2020 presidential election, CIRCLE used the immediately available exit poll and Census population data to estimate youth voter turnout nationally, and our analysis showed a major increase from 2016 and a likely historic level of youth or voter participation. Now that the states are updating their voter rolls, CIRCLE is  able to get a more granular, state-by-state view of youth turnout based on official election data. To date, CIRCLE has released estimates states in the<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/state-state-2020-youth-voter-turnout-west-and-southwest"> West, Southwest</a>, and<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/state-state-2020-youth-voter-turnout-south"> Southern</a> United States. Data on additional states will follow in the coming weeks! Some of their findings so far:  As in every election cycle, youth turnout varied widely across states, from 63% in Colorado to 34% in Oklahoma. On average, turnout was higher in Western states—many of which have stronger facilitative election laws and vote by mail policies—than in the South, where fewer states have automatic voter registration or automatically sent ballots to registered voters. Youth voter turnout was above 50% in competitive 2020 battleground states like North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida.</p>

She moved to Orland Park in 1998 and began work as a judge at Century Junior High School, where she still works. “I just truly enjoy my work as an election judge. I just love meeting and getting to know so many people. I guess you could say it’s in my blood,” said Tietz.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6450" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Legislation</strong>: House Democrats have introduced legislation that would allow residents of federally subsidized housing to register to vote when they fill out their lease and verify their income. The bill, dubbed<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/545480-democrats-introduce-bill-seeking-to-protect-voting-rights-of-people-in"> Our Homes Our Votes Act</a>, was introduced by Democratic Reps. Jesús García (Ill.), Mary Gay Scanlon (Pa.) and Nikema Williams (Ga.) on Monday. It currently has 26 cosponsors.  If passed, the bill would allow eligible voters that reside in housing administered by a Public Housing Agency (PHA) to register to vote when they sign their lease and verify their income. The agencies would be required under the legislation to then transmit the registration forms to the proper local election officials. The bill also designates private landlords for subsidized housing as “voter registration agents” and would make them “responsible for distributing voter registration forms and helping tenants fill them out if needed,” an announcement detailing the bill stated.</p>

Senate Bill 486, by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, would bar people from entering or remaining in an area within 100 feet of the entrance to a voting site while voting is taking place, except for a person entering or leaving the building for &#8220;lawful purposes.&#8221; Proponents of the bill said it aims to prevent voter intimidation, electioneering activities and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, while objectors said it was overly broad and could prevent nonprofits from distributing food and water. A divided voice vote sent SB486 to the state Senate for further consideration.</p>
<p>The committee also recommended<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/mar/31/committee-moves-voting-site-bill-to-full-senate/"> Senate Bill 487</a>, which would make establishing polling sites solely the duty of county election commissioners, and Senate Bill 488, which would amend the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act to exempt ballots from records that can be disclosed to the public.</p>

The votes on both SB485 and SB556 were expunged. The bills can be brought before the committee again at a later date.</p>

Mark Lowery, R-Maumelle, would ban the distribution of unsolicited absentee ballot applications to voters by designated elected officials and would make the possession of more than four absentee ballots by one person a rebuttable presumption of intent to defraud. The committee also advanced House Bill 1803, also by Lowery, would give the state Board of Election Commissioners the authority to institute corrective actions in response to complaints and would expand the types of violations about which county election boards can make complaints.</p>

<p><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb21-1088">House Bill 21-1088</a> from Rep. Andy Pico, R-Colorado Springs, a bill that sought to require the state auditor to conduct an annual audit of the statewide voter registration system.

<p><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb21-1170">House Bill 21-1170</a> from Rep. Tim Geitner, R-Falcon, which would have created a bipartisan commission made up of outside experts to evaluate the security of electronic election systems and make recommendations to the secretary of State.</p>
<p><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb21-1176">House Bill 21-1176</a> from Rep. Richard Holtorf, R-Akron, which sought to create a bipartisan commission to advise the state auditor on standards for a comprehensive audit of the state&#8217;s election processes.</p>

Brian Kemp has signed<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/bill-changing-georgia-voting-rules-passes-state-house/EY2MATS6SRA77HTOBVEMTJLIT4/"> Senate Bill 202</a> which will usher in<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/key-details-of-the-election-bill-approved-thursday-in-georgia/A6XGJAWPLZG47L3GXJGFZFQMIM/"> sweeping changes</a> to how people vote in Georgia. Here are some of the key provisions of the legislation, now law. Absentee ballots would be verified based on driver’s license numbers or other documentation instead of voter signatures. Ballot drop boxes would only be allowed inside early voting locations and available strictly during business hours. Weekend voting would be expanded for general elections, with two mandatory Saturdays offered statewide. Counties could also choose to offer early voting on two optional Sundays. Early voting for runoffs would be reduced to a minimum of one week because runoffs would occur four weeks after general elections. The deadline to request an absentee ballot would be set 11 days before election day. Members of the public would be prohibited from distributing food or water to voters waiting in line. The State Election Board could remove county election boards and replace them with an interim elections manager. A hotline to report illegal election activities would be set up in the attorney general’s office. Counties would be required to certify election results within six days, instead of the 10 days currently allowed. Election workers would also be required to count ballots without stopping until they’re finished.</p>
<p>A Georgia state senator has filed legislation she hopes will make it easier for voters to vote on election day. According to a statement from Senator Sally Harrell (D – Atlanta), her office filed Senate Bill 314, which will give county election supervisors and local elections boards the option to allow<a href="https://www.cbs46.com/news/state-sen-files-legislation-to-address-concerns-in-georgia-s-new-voting-law/article_83e086c0-909a-11eb-8c9e-3f27d97b2be8.html?block_id=994626"> out of precinct voting</a> on election day. Harrell said her proposal will make voting easier and more accessible in those counties. “Every Election Day, thousands of voters go to the wrong precinct because of confusion with early voting sites, changes in polling locations, or poll books that have incorrect data,” said. Harrell. “We can eliminate this problem completely by making it as easy as possible to get to a voting location.”</p>
<p>A bill that would have reformed the<a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/georgia-house-of-representatives-rejects-gwinnett-bills-dealing-with-elections-board-chairwomans-salary/article_283b3932-9176-11eb-8dcc-eb0f984dbc24.html"> Gwinnett County Board of Registrations and Elections</a> was defeated by the House this week. The rejection of the bill to reconstitute the elections board, to give local elected officials a say in who sits on the board, means the board&#8217;s format will likely remain as is until at least the 2023 legislative session, said state Rep. Sam Park, who authored the bill and is the Gwinnett Legislative Delegation&#8217;s chairman. The rejection, on a 97-70 party line vote on March 22, is significant because it came during a legislative session where the GOP-controlled Georgia General Assembly passed elections board reconstitution bills in several Republican-leaning counties.</p>

House Bill 1871, which passed the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 48-7 and the House 70-41, allows for curbside voting before and on Election Day. It also allows ballot drop boxes to continue. Ballots that are received with no or insufficient postage must also be accepted. The bill now heads to Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk for his signature. The bill will take effect as soon as he signs it, which could mean some of these changes will be used in the April 6 consolidated election if Pritzker signs the measure before then.</p>

For the third year in a row, a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to people with past felony convictions apparently will not move forward in the Iowa Legislature. While the Iowa House passed the proposal unanimously last week, the Iowa Senate did not schedule a subcommittee hearing on it and the Senate Judiciary Committee adjourned its only scheduled meeting of the week Wednesday without considering it. The amendment, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HJR%2011&amp;ga=89">House Joint Resolution 11</a>, would have had to advance through a full committee in the Senate this week in order to survive Friday&#8217;s second &#8220;funnel&#8221; deadline, although legislative leaders have ways of bringing bills back if they choose. Proposals to amend the Iowa Constitution must pass two consecutive general assemblies and win majority approval in a statewide vote. If the Legislature passed the measure next year, it would have to pass the same language in 2023 or 2024 before the proposal could be put before Iowans for a vote.</p>

It also limits the Secretary of State’s power to regulate elections by actions such as entering into consent decrees with a court without legislative approval. The bill also creates disclosure requirements for organizations distributing information about mail in voting and mandates the Secretary of State to maintain residential addresses in addition to mail addresses of voters. It also creates new election tampering crimes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article250349886.html">House Bill 2183</a> focuses largely on mail-in voting. It limits who is permitted to return a mail-in ballot for another person and makes it a felony for one person to return more than five mail-in ballots. The measure also requires the signature on a mail ballot to match the signature election officials have on file, creating a potential for votes to be discarded, and bans the Secretary of State from extending mail-in vote deadlines. The bill also makes it illegal to backdate a postmark on a ballot and bars election offices from accepting money from any entity other than the state for administering elections.</p>

This resolution would amend the Constitution of Maine to require candidates for the offices of Governor, State Senator and State Representative to be elected by a majority of the votes cast for that office. Currently, those offices are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. In 2016, Maine voters adopted ranked-choice voting, including for the offices of governor and state legislature, by referendum. This voter-approved law was repealed by lawmakers in 2017. That repeal then was overturned by Maine’s voters in a second referendum in 2018. In 2019, the legislature expanded the ranked-choice system to include presidential primary and general elections. Currently, ranked-choice voting is used in Maine for all elections to federal office and for presidential primaries. LD 202 now faces votes in the Senate and the House. As a Constitutional Amendment, LD 202 would require two-thirds approval in both chambers of the Legislature, and would need to be approved by a majority of voters at the next general election.’</p>
<p>A petition drive to force a statewide referendum on whether<a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2021/03/29/proposed-ballot-initiative-to-block-non-citizens-from-voting-falls-short/"> non-citizens should be allowed to vote in local elections</a> has failed to garner enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, according to state elections officials. After failing to win legislative support for a constitutional amendment in 2019, a Republican lawmaker from Hancock County had proposed a ballot initiative seeking to prohibit non-citizens from participating in municipal elections. The campaign was inspired by a<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/08/13/portland-council-considers-allowing-non-citizens-to-vote-in-municipal-elections/?rel=related&amp;rel=related"> debate in Portland in 2018</a> about whether legal non-citizens should be allowed to vote in City Council, school board or other city elections. But proponents of the ballot initiative fell well short of the number of valid signatures need to trigger a statewide vote this November, despite receiving more than $350,000 from an out-of-state political group, the Liberty Initiative Fund. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Monday that “An Act to Clarify the Eligibility of Voters” submitted 41,075 valid signatures, which was 21,992 fewer than the 63,067 signatures of registered Maine voters needed to qualify for the ballot. Bellows’ office said that during the petition-certification process, the elections division found that 25,323 signatures were not valid.</p>

The bill also requires local election boards to consider, when determining the location of early voting centers, such factors as accessibility to historically disenfranchised communities and ensuring that voting centers are distributed in an “equitable” way throughout the county. The<a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2021/03/senate-gives-final-approval-to-early-voting-center-expansion/"> full Senate</a> has approved the bill.</p>

And it bars election law changes within six months of a presidential election, which would have prevented the kinds of changes that were made to voting procedures last year when the pandemic hit. The measure was sent to the Senate on a 109-48 vote. Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, cast the lone “no” vote among Republicans. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.</p>
<p>The Senate is considering a bill that would change how the<a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-house-republicans-push-through-legislation-imposing-photo-id-requirement-for-voting-among-other-restrictions/article_0ba2973c-ef3e-5831-bc2f-f3c668551593.html"> referendum process</a> works. The proposed law would enact a $500 filing fee for groups to file a proposed petition in a bid to cut down on the scores of proposals that the secretary of state must process. It also would standardize the paperwork used to collect signatures and expand the number of words allowed on the official summary statement of the petition.</p>

The bill aims to reduce travel time for tribal members to access voting services by requiring at least one satellite elections office to be available on each reservation in the state – with the same services as county elections offices – at least 30 days before election day. The measure was advanced with a preliminary vote in a 53-47 split, with several Republicans joining Democrats in voting in favor of the measure. The House is expected to vote on the bill for a third and final time this week. Opponents of the measure said it wouldn’t allow enough state oversight over the satellite election offices, which could be placed on federal land, outside the jurisdiction of county election officials. But supporters of the measure said it cements in state law practices that are already in place, following a 2014 settlement in a voting rights lawsuit and guidance issued by the secretary of state’s office for counties and tribes to comply with the settlement. However on Wednesday on a follow up vote, the House<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/montana-house-shoots-down-bill-to-expand-native-american-voting-access/article_ab0107cf-94f9-5de3-bec2-881a10487cad.html"> voted down House Bill 613</a>.</p>

Phil Murphy’s desk, where<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/a-big-day-for-democracy-murphy-signs-n-j-in-person-early-voting-into-law/"> he signed it</a> this week. The measure, which cleared the chamber in a 28-8 vote, would provide three days of early voting for most primaries, five days of early voting for presidential primaries and nine days of early general election voting. The periods provided by that bill, sponsored by State Sen. Nia Gill (D-Montclair) and Assemblyman Andrew Zwicker (D-South Brunswick), represent significant reductions from previous versions, which provided for a two-week early voting period but limited the practice to general elections and municipal elections in towns that passed an ordinance to approve early voting. Murphy, long a proponent of early voting, has signaled he would support the bill, even if it fell short of the 30-day period he proposed in July.</p>
<p>Both chambers of the legislature approved a bill allowing county election boards to decide<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/measure-allowing-election-boards-to-determine-drop-box-placement-heads-to-murphys-desk/"> where ballot drop boxes are installed</a>. The measure allows county election boards to decide by simple majority vote the placement of secure ballot drop boxes in their county. In the case of a tie, the county clerk casts the deciding vote. It requires each county erect at least 10 ballot drop boxes, with at least one box in each municipality with average per capita or median family incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty line. The bill is a bid to prevent drop box clusters seen in some towns in last year’s elections. The rules used for those races required drop boxes be placed at specific sites, including county and municipal government buildings, community colleges and state universities.</p>
<p>The Assembly advanced a measure<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/bill-barring-police-from-polling-places-clears-assembly-stalls-in-senate/"> barring police officers from loitering</a> within 100 feet of a polling place or drop box Thursday, but the bill stalled in the Senate despite a past version clearing the chamber in a narrow vote last month. The bill is a bid to prevent the resurgence of actions undertaken by the infamous National Ballot Security Task Force, a group of off-duty police and sheriff’s officers who intimidated voters, largely non-white ones, away from the polls in 1981 at the behest of the Republican National Committee. The bill has met<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/concerns-over-senior-housing-stalled-bill-barring-police-from-polling-places/"> opposition in the Senate</a> and according to the New Jersey Globe is being amended.</p>

Other measures would combat voter intimidation, make online registration more accessible and keep in place a nine-day window in which absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day could be received by counties and still count. Current law limits to three days the time in which absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day or a primary elections must be received to be counted. But a legal agreement in September between the State Board of Elections and a union-affiliated group extended the receipt date for the fall election from Nov. 6 to Nov. 12.</p>
<p>North Carolina’s constitution still includes an unenforceable relic of the Jim Crow era — a<a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-north-carolina-voting-rights-70cb834ea006bf5e67262ca2b85ac625"> voter literacy test</a>. Some state lawmakers are trying, again, to do away with it.  A House judiciary committee scheduled debate on a bipartisan measure that would allow voters to decide next year whether to eliminate that section of the constitution. The section says anyone attempting to register to vote must “be able to read and write any section of the Constitution in the English language.”  This requirement was added to the constitution in 1900 and used to keep many Black citizens from casting ballots. The federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 made literacy tests and similar barriers to voting unlawful nationwide. But in 1970, North Carolina voters weren’t willing to give up the language — they defeated an amendment to remove the section. House members have pushed again for its repeal in recent years. Three-fifths of the House and the Senate members must agree to such a referendum.</p>

The two chambers will now need to decide which of the two bills should make it to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk or whether they can reach a compromise. In a 37-7 vote, the Senate passed <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess124_2021-2022/prever/499_20210331.htm">S.499</a>, which would add confirmation votes for each of the five members of the state Election Commission, as well as the agency’s executive director. Under current law, the governor appoints the commissioners without any confirmation vote. The commission’s partisan makeup would be left in tact: Up to four of the commissioners could come from the majority party in the Statehouse, and at least one would need to come from the minority party. Republicans currently hold sizable majorities in both the House and Senate. Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg, sought to change that by making it a 3-2 breakdown rather than 4-1. But state Sen. Chip Campsen, who authored the bill, noted that Democrats established the 4-1 composition decades ago when they had control in the Statehouse and Republicans should get the same benefit.</p>

The bill would expedite the process by which<a href="https://www.kltv.com/2021/03/29/rep-bells-bill-purging-dead-voter-rolls-passes-committee/"> dead Texans are purged from voter registration rolls</a>. “It is my belief that election integrity is essential,” Rep. Keith Bell (R-Forney_ said in a January interview. “Upon someone’s death, the county registrar will be notified to remove that individual from the roll. That process being done quickly will prevent someone from taking on that individual’s identity possibly to commit voter fraud.” Bell said there is currently no specified amount of time between a person’s death and when a registrar is required to remove their name from voter rolls. The bill will now be taken to a calendars committee for possible placement on the House floor.</p>
<p>In an overnight vote after more than seven hours of debate, the Texas Senate signed off on<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=SB7"> Senate Bill 7</a>, which would<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/01/texas-voting-restrictions-legislature/"> limit extended early voting hours, prohibit drive-thru voting and make it illegal for local election officials to proactively send applications to vote by mail</a> to voters, even if they qualify. The bill originally limited early voting hours from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., curtailing the extended hours offered last year in Harris County and other large counties where voting ran until 10 p.m. for several days to accommodate people like shift workers for whom regular hours don’t work. The bill was rewritten before it reached the Senate floor to allow for voting only between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Those hours will still prohibit the day of 24-hour voting Harris County offered last November. The legislation would also outlaw the drive-thru voting set up at 10 polling places in the county for the general election. If passed into law, the legislation would broaden poll watchers’ access at polling places, even giving them power to video record voters receiving assistance in filling out their ballots if the poll watcher “reasonably believes” the help is unlawful. That provision has drawn particular concerns about possible intimidation of voters who speak languages other than English as well as voters with intellectual or developmental disabilities who may require assistance through prompting or questioning which could be misconstrued as coercion.</p>

Ralph Northam signed<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1810"> HB 1810</a> last week, which allows a Virginia governor to<a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2021/03/31/new-virginia-law-allows-governor-extend-voter-registration-deadline-if-online-system-is-down/"> extend the voter registration deadline</a> in the event that an online voter registration system is down. The extension would last for however long the system was offline. Mark Finks, the director of elections and general registrar in Harrisonburg, said this will be helpful to local registrars by allowing quicker actions to be taken in emergency situations. “It makes it a little bit clearer where the power is vested and what the process to get this extended is. I think hopefully this will give voters a little peace of mind that certain aspects of this won’t be up in the air,” Finks said.</p>
<p>Northam has also signed the<a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/03/31/virginia-governor-northam-signs-voting-rights-act/"> Voting Rights Act of Virginia</a> measure into law. The bill prohibits any state or local policies from denying or restricting voting rights based on race, color, or native language. The bill passed out of both chambers along party lines. Virginia’s voting rights act requires local election officials to get feedback or pre-approval from the state’s attorney general before making changes to their voting system. It also allows residents to sue in cases of voter suppression. The act also requires local election officials to provide all voting materials in other languages as needed.</p>

Washington would become the 21st state, along with Washington, D.C., to adopt such a policy. The bill is sponsored in the House by Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton, who is likely the first formerly incarcerated legislator in the country. This is Simmons’ first bill as a newly elected member of the House to be approved by the Legislature, and one that is particularly close to her. “When an individual does come home after incarceration, they will face many barriers. The punishment never seems to end, and I can tell you that firsthand,” Simmons said at a hearing in January. “This makes the law easier to administer, and it restores some sense of dignity to our neighbors when we welcome them home.”</p>

The measure also moves the deadline for absentee ballots to be mailed from six days prior to the election to 11.

<p>The House of Delegates passed House Bill 3307 on Wednesday afternoon, creating the<a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2021/04/house-bill-dealing-with-social-media-elections-becomes-contentious/"> Social Media Integrity and Anti-Corruption in Elections Act</a>. The bill passed 72-28, with five Republicans voting with the Democratic caucus against the bill. The bill now heads to the state Senate. The Social Media Integrity and Anti-Corruption in Elections Act would provide requirements for social media companies to prevent corruption and provide transparency of election-related content made available on social media websites. Social media companies would need to seek approval from the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office before publishing election information, though that rule doesn’t apply to users of social media accounts. The bill would prohibit censorship of West Virginia political candidates on social media platforms by the companies that control those platforms, requiring the companies to provide timely service requests. It would limit social media companies from freezing or removing social media accounts of candidates.  The bill sets out a number of penalties for non-compliance, including a $100,000 fine per day if the State Election Commission finds a social media company in violation with provisions of HB 3307.</p>

Their case remains open in Hillsborough Circuit Court, but the named defendant, Hillsborough Supervisor of Elections Craig Latimer, has not been served with the complaint, his spokeswoman Gerri Kramer said this week. The 120-day window to serve Latimer with the lawsuit and a subpoena demanding a legal response within 20 days expired Thursday. The Hillsborough Circuit Court Clerk’s Office issued the subpoena to the plaintiff’s attorney, Terri Gaffney, Nov. 25. The losing candidates  filed suit Nov. 17, four days after Latimer certified the final results of the Nov. 3 election. The legal challenge contended the vote totals warranted additional scrutiny because voters were confused over required signatures on both the mail ballot and envelope. Some ballots may have needed to be rejected over signature issues, the suit stated, and it contended Latimer’s office sent ballots to people who were deceased.</p>

The 35-page <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20532706-sb-202-ngp-vs-raffensperger">New Georgia Project v. Raffensperger</a> was filed shortly after Gov. Brian Kemp signed the &#8220;Election Integrity Act of 2021&#8221; Thursday, and the 56-page <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20532707-sb-202-ga-naacp-vs-raffensperger">Georgia NAACP v. Raffensperger</a> was filed Sunday. Both argue that many of the sweeping changes made to Georgia&#8217;s election administration disproportionately negatively affect Black voters. The New Georgia Project suit argues sections of the omnibus voting law violates both the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment by placing an undue burden on the right to vote, citing increased absentee ID requirements, restrictions on secure drop boxes and a ban on local governments mailing unsolicited absentee applications. Other changes that are allegedly unconstitutional include a ban on mobile polling places (used only by Fulton County), a virtual ban on out-of-precinct provisional ballots and a prohibition on handing out food or water to voters within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of voters in line.  The New Georgia Project suit also says Georgia violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because many changes would affect Black voters more In the challenge filed by the Georgia NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People&#8217;s Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe, lawyers argue more explicitly that elements of SB 202 is &#8220;the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color.&#8221; Similarly to the first suit, this case focuses on new absentee ID requirements that use a driver&#8217;s license or state ID number or photocopy of voter ID as the way to verify identity, as well as opposition to the new rule on drop boxes. While drop boxes did not exist before the 2020 election cycle, the new voting law limits when and where Georgians can use them, including a cap on available boxes per county that are only available in early voting sites during early voting hours. A<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-voting-restrictions-challenged-again-in-third-federal-lawsuit/JQPFYCXVTJDMZFJPR6KJKBMN4Y/"> third suit</a> over the new voting law was filed by the African Methodist Episcopal Church and other plaintiffs. This suit is aimed at many parts of the voting law, including absentee ID requirements, drop box restrictions, absentee ballot request deadlines and a ban on volunteers handing out food and water to voters waiting in line. “Simply put, this new law not only seeks to suppress the votes of Black and brown people, but it is also racist and seeks to return us to the days of Jim Crow,” Bishop Reginald Jackson of the<a href="https://www.ame6.church/about-us"> AME Church’s Sixth District</a>, which includes Georgia, wrote in a letter to parishioners. “For some Georgians, this inconvenience may be manageable. But for voters of color and other historically disenfranchised communities — who already suffer through disproportionately longer lines than white voters — it could be dramatic,” the 91-page lawsuit states. “This burden is not an accident. Nor is it legal.”</p>

Attorneys for Livingston County Clerk Elizabeth Hundley, Grand Traverse County Clerk Bonnie Scheele, Barry County Clerk Pamela A. Palmer and Macomb County Clerk Anthony Forlini last week filed motions to have presiding Antrim County Circuit Judge Kevin A. Elsenheimer block the subpoenas. They call it an overly burdensome and irrelevant “fishing expedition” that is “designed to harass” public election officials. Similar subpoenas were also served to county clerks in Wayne, Kent, Charlevoix and Oakland counties. The subpoenas arise out of a lawsuit filed by William Bailey, a Central Lake Township resident who raised accusations of tampering and fraud related to election software and machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems that are used in Antrim County and across the state. The subpoenas to county clerks request election tapes, paper ballots, system logs, tally servers, computer storage devices, reports, canvasser paperwork and notes created during the election certification process. An April 12 hearing will determine if the clerks have to comply.</p>

Tostrud’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mn-signature.pdf"> ruling</a> — the latest in a monthslong fight over a rule that requires Minnesota voters to get their mail-in ballot signed by a notary public or another voter — let the as-applied challenge survive a motion to dismiss from the Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Minnesota, who<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/republicans-intervene-in-minnesota-absentee-ballot-provision/"> intervened</a> in the matter last summer. In his decision issued Monday, Tostrud found that “plaintiffs plausibly allege a certainly impending threat that an ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and Minnesota’s absentee-ballot witness requirements will combine to burden the right to vote,” namely for voters like plaintiff Isabel Bethke and others who do not live with someone qualified to serve as a witness for upcoming elections this fall.</p>

Lopez’s suit, alleges longtime GOP activist Hotze approved of, paid for and directed a private investigator&#8217;s allegedly violent actions in a &#8220;bizarre and unfounded&#8221; voter fraud investigation. Lopez&#8217;s attorney, Dicky Grigg, said the civil suit was filed to hold Hotze accountable for his alleged role in the incident that resulted in the arrest of former Houston Police Department Captain Mark Aguirre.</p>
<p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has agreed to review the<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/31/crystal-mason-texas-voting-ruling/"> illegal voting conviction of Crystal Mason</a>, a Tarrant County woman facing a five-year prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election while she was on supervised release for a federal conviction. The state’s court of last resort for criminal matters granted Mason’s petition on this week, elevating the profile of a case that could test the extent to which provisional ballots provide a safe harbor for voters amid questions about their eligibility. Her 2016 vote was never counted. The Court of Criminal Appeals isn’t required to review non-death penalty convictions, and it rarely grants requests to do so. However, the court indicated it won&#8217;t hear oral arguments in the case and instead rely on legal briefs. In her petition to the court, Mason’s lawyers argued the appeals court erred in upholding her conviction because the state’s definition of voting illegally requires a person to know they are ineligible to vote and Mason did not. In its ruling, the three-judge appeals panel wrote that the fact Mason did not know she was ineligible was “irrelevant to her prosecution.”</p>

The<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8310/draft"> framework</a> takes NIST&#8217;s pre-existing cybersecurity best practices and applies them to election infrastructure such as polling places, voter registration databases and voting machines.  &#8220;The guide can help these officials reduce the risk of disruptions to the major tasks they must perform in the process of an election,&#8221; according to NIST. &#8220;These range from the immediate concerns of an election day, such as vote processing or communicating the details of a problem or crisis, to longer-term efforts, like maintaining election and voter registration systems.&#8221; According to FCW, the new draft framework is the first time NIST has combined election security and cybersecurity in one of its playbooks, according to one of the authors. NIST will accept comments on the draft through May 14.</p>

The program will feature virtual briefings, on-demand workshops and other materials addressing not only good online safety measures, but also an overview of the many different cyberthreats state and local government face. “Cybersecurity is more important than ever with businesses, government, and private individuals falling victim to digital attacks everyday,” Forrest Senti the director of business and government initiatives at the Colorado Springs, Colorado, think tank said in a press release. The training series is backed in part by Google, which recently expanded its election-security products — such as physical multi-factor authentication keys — to state and local election administrators, after offering them to campaigns and candidates last year. Senti told StateScoop in an interview last year the point of the training will be to provide state legislators, who are responsible for funding IT and cybersecurity policies, with information from industry experts from Senti’s organization as well as its industry partners, such as Google and Microsoft. The initial lessons will focus on the basics, like the importance of multi-factor authentication, strong passwords and regular software patching, but the training series will also aim to teach lawmakers about different types of threats, from ransomware and phishing to more recent supply-chain attacks like the compromises of SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>

The delay, discussed at a recent meeting of state elections commissioners, is the result of funding stops issued from Governor Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s office, according to the elections commissioners on the call. A claim that is disputed by the Cuomo administration. &#8220;There is no way that we are going to comply with the statutory deadline because we&#8217;ve lost more than a year because of the delay in funding the project,&#8221; said State Board of Elections Co-Chair Doug Kellner at the March 15 meeting, which was held virtually. &#8220;We&#8217;re now talking about many months perhaps even more than a year after the deadline before the system will be ready.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not that we dragged our feet, it&#8217;s that the [state] didn&#8217;t give us adequate funds to do it. But nonetheless, the reality is we have a statutory date and we have to try to meet it,&#8221; Co-Chair Peter Kosinski said, reminding everyone that the April deadline is set by the law creating online voter registration in New York. Freeman Klopott, a spokesperson for the state Division of the Budget, disputed the claim. “The FY 2021 Budget provided $16 million in funding for this project, it has been available, and the Board hasn’t drawn down any of it,” he wrote in an email to Gotham Gazette. The State Board of Elections had received a $16 million allocation &#8220;only to have it frozen by Division of Budget on April 28, 2020,&#8221; wrote Cheryl Couser, a board spokesperson, in an email responding to Klopott.</p>
