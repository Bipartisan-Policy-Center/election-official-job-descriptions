<em>New election security policy recommendations from D3P</em></p>

This report captures the challenges and opportunities facing our election security ecosystem based on D3P’s analysis from our time spent working nationally with decision-makers in the field, including election administrators, national security and cybersecurity experts, and civic thought leaders from across federal, state, and local governments.</p>
<p>Though the election security ecosystem survived the triple threat of cybersecurity, physical security, and mis- and disinformation in 2020, this success will prove to be untenable without proper investment and reinforcement ahead of future election cycles. This report highlights D3P’s key recommendations for how these challenges can be addressed by policymakers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Strengthen statewide cybersecurity coordination and funding by consolidating IT infrastructure and regularizing local election appropriations;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Streamline federal government support by carving out clear roles and responsibilities for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to defend election infrastructure and support election administrators, and expanding proactive funding avenues for state and local election infrastructure modernization;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Increase trust in election integrity by expanding proactive state communications efforts and civil society partnerships, improving federal cross-sector coordination for responding to mis- and disinformation, and increasing transparency and accountability of those who traffic election-related disinformation;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Invest in election security talent through academic partnerships and intergovernmental fellowships to develop pipeline programs that supply talented personnel to election offices.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5644" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D3P-300x154.png" alt="" width="300" height="154" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D3P-300x154.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D3P.png 398w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />These recommendations are meant to shed light for state and federal lawmakers on some of the most pressing challenges and opportunities facing the U.S. election system today. The U.S. election system continues to encounter innumerable, existential challenges that threaten one of the most defining features of democracy. Without swift, sufficient action from state and federal government leadership, widespread distrust in the 2020 election process and outcome will further deteriorate and destabilize the only institutions that can address this problem. If D3P’s nationwide work with committed public servants is any indication, we are confident America&#8217;s election officials and elected leaders who play a role in upholding and defending democracy can meet the challenge.</p>
<p>Since July 2017, the Belfer Center’s bipartisan Defending Digital Democracy Project has worked alongside election administrators, national security and cybersecurity experts, political and civic thought leaders to develop and deliver practical strategies, tools, and recommendations to protect democratic processes and systems from cyber and information attacks. These efforts have taken the form of incident <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/election-cyber-incident-communications-coordination-guide">communication response plans</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=171Bxa3lMQ4">tabletop exercises</a>, <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/project/defending-digital-democracy#!playbooks">playbooks</a> for countering and responding to cybersecurity attacks and information operations, <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/project/defending-digital-democracy#!election-data-set">data analysis</a> and national training events in person and <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/project/defending-digital-democracy#!2020-training-tour">online</a>.</p>
<p>The project has also provided recommendations through <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/index.php/publication/defending-digital-democracy-four-corners-election-security">congressional testimony</a> and reports.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of our work, D3P has engaged over a thousand election officials across more than 40 states and the District of Columbia. We’ve been honored to work with public servants in defending democracy and hope this report contributes to the work ahead.</p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC adopts new voluntary voting system guidelines 2.0</strong><br />
<em>Updated guidelines pave way for next generation of voting systems across the country</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) announced the adoption of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0, a major step toward improving the manufacturing and testing of voting machines. The four EAC Commissioners unanimously approved the VVSG 2.0 documents including the Principles and Guidelines and Requirements, as well as approving the Testing and Certification Program Manual, and Voting System Test Laboratories (VSTL) Manual during a public meeting this morning.</p>
<p>The VVSG 2.0 represents a significant advancement in defining standards that will serve as the cornerstone of the next generation of voting systems. It lays the groundwork for 21st century voting systems that are desperately needed with improved cybersecurity, accessibility, and usability requirements. The VVSG 2.0 also supports various audit methods supporting software independence to confirm the accuracy of the vote and increase voter confidence. With its adoption, manufacturers are empowered to begin designing and building voting machines according to these new guidelines.</p>
<p>“The VVSG 2.0 was formulated through a painstaking, meticulous process by a diverse body of stakeholders. This standard shows that a robust and credible framework is achievable with the right level of urgency, resources, commitment, and collaboration,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland.</p>
<p>As elections are decentralized throughout the country, the VVSG are the only set of uniform specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the voting systems meet required standards. Some factors examined under these tests include basic functionality, accessibility, accuracy, reliability, and security capabilities.</p>
<p>“The VVSG 2.0 represents a significant leap forward in states’ ability to modernize their own standards and voting systems to ensure the most secure, transparent, and accurate elections possible,” remarked EAC Vice Chair Don Palmer.</p>
<p>HAVA mandates that the EAC develop and maintain these requirements. Despite the requirements being voluntary, at least 38 states use the standards in some way making today&#8217;s vote on advancing of the next version of VVSG very important. This is the most significant update of the federal standards for voting technology since VVSG 1.0 was adopted in 2005.</p>
<p>The major updates included in the VVSG 2.0 are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Improved cybersecurity requirements to secure voting and election management systems associated with the administration of elections.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Software independence</li>
<li>Requires systems to be air-gapped from other networks and disallows the use of wireless technologies</li>
<li>Physical security</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>
<li>System integrity</li>
<li>Data protection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensures devices are capable of importing and exporting data in common data formats</li>
<li>Requires manufacturers to provide complete specifications of how the format is implemented</li>
<li>Requires that encoded data uses a publicly available method</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved accessibility requirements to enhance the voting experience for voters with disabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VVSG 2.0 allows for systems where all voters can vote privately and independently throughout the voting process: Marking; Verifying; Casting</li>
<li>Language access throughout the process</li>
<li>Improved documentation requirements for accessibility testing</li>
<li>Voter privacy features</li>
<li>Accessibility requirements derived from federal laws</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ballot secrecy</li>
<li>Improved auditability</li>
<li>User-centered design</li>
<li>Reorganized to simplify usage and focus on functional requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manuals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Penetration testing</li>
<li>Component testing pilot program</li>
</ul>
<p>The EAC employed numerous parallel processes to get to the finish line with Executive Director, Mona Harrington, providing a recommendation of adoption of the VVSG 2.0 today. “Our work is not completed. The EAC will continue to work with NIST’s National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) to make updates for VVSG 2.0 to provide accreditation of labs, develop a VVSG Lifecycle Policy, and implement an end-to-end cryptographic protocol evaluation plan. We are very excited about today’s vote and what that means for the future of voting systems.”</p>
<p>The EAC Commissioners, Chairman Ben Hovland, Vice Chair Don Palmer, Commissioner Thomas Hicks, and Commissioner Christy McCormick, issued this joint statement, “It was a pleasure to work with such a knowledgeable and diverse team of experts to define a new standard. We are proud of the work accomplished. An exciting future awaits but there is a lot of hard work yet to be done. We look forward to those next steps and to see these standards implemented.”</p>
<p>A recording of today’s meeting is available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpN6i0g2rlF4ITWhwvBwwZw/videos">EAC’s YouTube channel</a>. Additional information on the VVSG 2.0 is available <a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines">on the EAC&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente Jr. has sent a letter to Cuomo seeking the election commissioners removal. According to the <em>Observer-Dispatch</em>, In his letter, Picente pointed to state Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte’s findings that the county board of elections failed to comply with state and federal election law.  “Most disturbingly, Justice DelConte found that the failures of the Election Commissioners resulted in the failure to cast as many as 1,100 legitimate ballots and the rejection of an unknown number of voters who went to polling places and were turned away,” Picente said in the letter. “The denial of this most fundamental and sacred right of citizenship requires immediate action,” he said. “We have an obligation to act when the rights of our citizens are denied.” According to <em>Politico</em>, at a</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/02/10/support-grows-for-cuomo-to-remove-election-officials-over-tenney-brindisi-snafu-1362662"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> State Board of Elections meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday, it emerged that the future of the Oneida officials came up during an executive session on Monday, when state commissioners decided to give their county counterparts “one week to make a decision regarding their status.”  If nothing changes by next Monday, Democratic board chair Doug Kellner said the state board will consider asking the governor &#8220;to formally remove the commissioners.”</span></p>

They&#8217;re the turn-of-the-century, they&#8217;re gold, gilded, and they shone really bright and I was like &#8216;Oh my God,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;I lowered myself and said &#8216;I think we just found the &#8216;Goonies&#8217; treasure.'&#8221; While not the Goonies treasure, Whitcomb’s discovery is still pretty cool.</span></p>

According to <em>The Eagle</em>, James’ death comes two weeks after he alerted authorities to an outbreak of coronavirus in the board of elections Queens’ office. James, a former aide to ex-State Sen. Shirley Huntley and a past board member at the Guy R. Brewer Democratic Club, died on February 6 after working in the Queens warehouse that stores voting machines. At least five employees there tested positive for COVID-19 in late January. At least four BOE staff have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. “While we are essential workers, we transmute into frontline workers during the height of election season,” said CWA Local 1183 President Donna Ellaby, who represents BOE workers. “We are overcrowded in our offices.” In addition to his work with the BOE, James founded an education nonprofit and manned the barbecue at community events. Southern Queens Park Association Executive Director Jacqueline Boyce said she was heartbroken to learn of James’ death and called him a “terrific community servant.” “He worked for the city but he was a community servant,” Boyce said. “He was a special man.” </span></p>

<p>Election officials and technology providers have identified the need for guidance on managing supply chain risk to address the large proportion of election technology that is outsourced. This document was compiled with input from the broader elections community to include election tech providers and CISA; it introduces methodology via threat model to thwart the most significant attacks, breaking down each major component of the election infrastructure while addressing risks and mitigations.</p>
<p>Managing Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risks in Election Technology is non-technical in nature, and describes a 5-step process for identifying and managing suppliers based on a prioritization of risk to an election technology provider’s products and services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and document supply chain, including asset identification</li>
<li>Assess risks to prioritize critical components and services as those facing the most significant threats</li>
<li>Assess your relationships with suppliers relative to criticality of products and services</li>
<li>Align and manage supplier relationships to manage risk</li>
<li>Conduct ongoing assessment and monitoring of key dependencies associated with critical components</li>
</ul>
<p>The guide ONLY addresses risks involving hardware, firmware, and software sourced externally for use in election equipment.</p>

Since 16- and 17-year-olds are legally permitted to work, drive, and pay federal income taxes, Meng says they should also be able to have their voices heard at the ballot box. In 2018, Meng introduced the measure (H.J. Res. 138) to replace the 26th amendment to the United States Constitution with a new amendment that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. The last time the voting age was changed was when it was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971. If enacted, the voting age would be lowered for federal, state and local elections. Meng’s legislation includes 17 original co-sponsors. “Our young people, including 16- and 17-year-olds, continue to fight and advocate for so many issues that they are passionate about from gun safety to the climate crisis,” Meng said. “They have been tremendously engaged on policies affecting their lives and their futures. Their activism, determination, and efforts to demand change are inspirational and have truly impacted our nation. It’s time to give them a voice in our democracy by permitting them to be heard at the ballot box. “I believe that it is right and fair to also allow them to vote. Let’s let them be heard and make their voices count. Let’s give them a say in choosing who they want their government representatives to be. I’m proud to stand with our young people in introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues in the House to support it.” </span></p>

The vote was expected to pass with a Republican majority, but GOP Rep. Paul Boyer voted against the resolution, evening the tallies at 15 each and killing the resolution. If the vote would have passed, the five-member board consisting of just one Democrat could have been subject to immediate arrest. “Ultimately, today’s vote to reject the resolution provides more time for us to work together for the sole purpose of gaining more clarity,” Boyer said in a statement. “It is NOT a final determination, nor is it the end of the process. “My vote is about patience. It’s about resolving disagreements civilly, and these are things that I believe all Senators can agree upon regardless of our respective votes today.” The Senate has been trying since mid-December to get access to ballots and other materials so they can do their own audit of the election results. They are prompted in part by the many Republicans who subscribe to unfounded claims that President Joe Biden won Arizona because of problems with vote counting. GOP senators say they’re just trying to boost voter confidence in elections.</span></p>

Rep. Thomas Maney, R-Fort Walton Beach, filed an identical bill,</span><a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70985&amp;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB635</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the House. During the early voting period, voters can cast a ballot at any early voting site in their county. On Election Day, they must go to a particular voting precinct. This often causes voter confusion on Election Day, Andersen said. The proposed super voting sites would allow voters to cast their ballot in person at any super voting site in their county, even on Election Day.  Voters’ ballots are recorded to prevent anyone from trying to vote a second time. To qualify as a super voting site, it must provide the same opportunity to all voters to cast a ballot and needs sufficient parking. These are already requirements for early voting sites, suggesting most counties that shift toward super voting will just use their early voting sites.  </span></p>

The legislation would also require county election officials to get absentee ballots in the mail within three business days after receipt. Currently, voters can request absentee ballots until the Friday before election day, but that doesn’t leave much time to receive and return ballots. State law requires absentee ballots to be returned to county election offices before polls close on election day. “It’s almost misleading the way our current law works,” said state Rep. Barry Fleming, a Republican from Harlem and chairman of the House Special Committee on Election Integrity. “You could request a ballot properly, and there would be almost no way you’d get it back in time.” The measure,</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/270"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 270</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, doesn’t make exceptions for last-minute absentee ballot requests from voters with emergencies, such as COVID-19 quarantine, illness or military duty. The committee had approved a previous version of the bill last week, but the lawmakers reconsidered it Tuesday in response to concerns. Initially, the legislation would have prohibited election officials from mailing absentee ballots in the last 10 days before election day, and voters would have had to request ballots beforehand. The bill will now be considered by the House Rules Committee before reaching a full vote of the Georgia House of Representatives.</span></p>

The Senate State Affairs Committee has voted to introduce multiple bills on the topic. The most significant was presented Monday by Ada County Clerk Phil McGrane. It would make the temporary voting changes passed during the August special legislative session permanent. The methods used in Idaho during the 2020 election expired on Dec. 31, 2020. During the special session, lawmakers approved a law allowing the opening and scanning of ballots beginning seven days before Election Day that November. A new addition to the bill would change the requirement for absentee ballots to be sent out to voters from 45 days prior to the election to 30 days prior to the election. Military voters or voters living overseas would still be required to have it sent 45 days prior. Two additional bills on the topic were printed on Monday and referred to the Senate State Affairs committee. Senate Bill 1064 would no longer allow absentee voters to request a new mail-in ballot for a different party. Now, voters “can only request the issuance of a new ballot of the same type they originally requested.” Senate Bill 1069 would require all issues with absentee ballots to be resolved by 8 p.m. on the day of the election. The clerk must attempt to contact the voter “to ensure the issue is not related to any form of fraud” and give the voter “the opportunity to remedy the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House State Affairs Committee gave a do-pass recommendation toa  new bill that would make it a felony to collect and return ballots on behalf of others. Under the proposed law, voters would only be allowed to handle two ballots at one time unless a person was authorized to hold more. Authorized persons would include postal workers. The bill, said sponsor Rep. Mike Moyle, R-Star, is intended to prevent</span><a href="https://www.postregister.com/news/local/ballot-harvesting-bill-would-make-it-a-felony-to-carry-more-than-two-ballots/article_7f453906-eb25-5ad6-a087-c640581b1bf4.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot harvesting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  “It may not be a problem in Idaho today. I think we need to fix it before it does become a problem,” Moyle said. Phil McGrane, Ada County Clerk, testified in favor of the bill, though he would have preferred a voter be allowed to drop off up to six ballots, rather than just two.</span></p>

State Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute, proposed the no-excuse mail-in ballot amendment to House Bill 1365, which addresses a variety of election issues. Pfaff said Hoosiers clearly are interested in voting by mail since turnout was up in the 2020 primary election when all voters were allowed to request and submit a mail-in ballot due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Indiana showed that we could conduct an election with no-excuse absentee voting without any incidents of fraud,” Pfaff said. The House ultimately voted 66-28 to reject Pfaff’s call for no-excuse absentee voting in Indiana. Data show Indiana ranked in the lowest fifth of states for voter turnout during the 2020 general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House voted unanimously on this week in support of legislation co-authored by state Rep. Zach Payne, R-Charlestown,</span><a href="https://www.newsandtribune.com/news/indiana-house-advances-bill-expanding-early-in-person-voting-access/article_84d30ff4-6aec-11eb-bfef-cbca7bf53e8c.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunities for Hoosiers. In Indiana, all registered voters are eligible to vote early in-person starting 28 days before an election. Dates, times and locations vary by county. Currently, every county must have early voting open for seven hours on the two Saturdays ahead of Election Day. Payne said with this legislation, the circuit court clerk would have the option of opening for at least four hours the third Saturday before Election Day. House Bill 1479 now moves to the Senate for further consideration.</span></p>

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows supports the bill as a way to make voting easier and more accessible. “Fifteen states have in place some form of ongoing absentee voting and have done so with appropriate security measures in place,” she says. The measure was opposed by a group representing municipal clerks and by the Maine Municipal Association because of the additional mailing costs.</span></p>

Ready (R-Carroll), Jason C. Gallion (R-Cecil and Harford) and Minority Leader Bryan W. Simonaire (R-Anne Arundel) proposed</span><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/02/04/senate-republicans-announce-voter-id-signature-verification-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a slew of election reforms, citing “major deficiencies” in the 2020 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Simonaire said the measures, which include requiring signature verification on mail-in ballots, are meant to build public trust in the state’s election system. Some of those proposals include ensuring that party affiliation is hidden on mail-in ballots, and requiring signature verification for those ballots. Ready is sponsoring a bill that would require voters to show a form of identification before casting their ballot to verify their name and address. Voters could use a government-issued photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, “any other recent government document that shows the voter’s name and address,” a voter notification card or a sample ballot.</span></p>

The bill would let registered voters apply to vote by mail in any primary or general election. That process was allowed for the 2020 state primaries and November election, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Galvin’s bill would allow same-day registration, a change from current law, which requires residents to be registered at least 20 days before an election to vote. Galvin plans to file his bill this month, according to the statement.</span></p>

The bill establishes a new voter identification card free-of-charge to individuals who lack proper identification and cannot afford it.  The bill was previously approved by the state government committee, and it will next be heard in the finance committee. The legislation would require voters to produce valid, government-issued photo identification when voting in person, by absentee or mail-in ballot. Individuals unable to provide valid proof of identity or residence would be able to cast a provisional ballot, affording the voter a period of time in which they could obtain valid identification. Same-day voter registration would also remain intact. </span></p>

It requires they have a certification by the United States Election Assistance Commission. “Make sure your machine operates, can’t be hacked. As you know, we’re not attached to the internet on our machines… all those things come into play,” said Lt. Gov. Hosemann. “We’ve just got to do whatever we can to provide confidence for people to vote,” noted Sen. Angela Hill.</span></p>

The bill says local election commissioners would send a postcard to registered voters who do not cast a ballot in any local, state or federal election during a two-year period that includes two federal elections — a presidential election and a midterm congressional election. If voters fail to confirm their address within four years of receiving the postcard, or if they fail to vote during that time, the county would remove their name from the rolls. Voters’ names could not be removed within 90 days of an election, and the county would have to maintain records for at least two years showing a purged name. The bill passed 36-16 on a party line vote.</span></p>

The House voted 61-39 for House Bill 176, which would end voter registration at noon on the Monday before Election Day. Some Republicans tried to amend the bill on the floor to set the voter-registration deadline on the Friday before Election Day – which is what the original bill said before it was amended in committee. That attempt failed on a 44-56 vote – and, as members prepared to vote on the bill itself, Rep. Derek Skees, R-Kalispell, promised fellow conservatives he would attempt to amend the bill back to the Friday deadline in the Senate. He urged them not to kill the bill on the floor, because they didn’t like the Monday deadline. Six Republicans voted with all 33 House Democrats against the measure.</span></p>

It also was a record breaking year for voter turnout.  A bill in the House State Administration Committee would keep it that way.</span><a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/HB0287.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 287</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, would make the Secretary of State’s office pay for ballot return postage. The bill’s five proponents, including Sam Forstag of the American Civil Liberties Union, said having paid postage on ballots would make it easier for low-income and minority Montanans to vote. </span></p>

She championed a similar bill in 2019, though that bill also sought to allow felons to vote while incarcerated. It did not pass. Chasey&#8217;s bill, House Bill 74, passed the House Judiciary Committee last week on a 6-4 vote. It awaits a vote on the House floor. If H.B. 74 is signed into law, an inmate would be offered the opportunity to register to vote or update their registration as they prepare for release from a state correctional facility. </span></p>

If passed by the State Senate and signed into law by the governor, the bills would reduce the amount of signatures needed in 2021 to get on the ballot. Other measures include eliminating the need to hold primaries in races where there is only one candidate, as well as allowing some steps of the process to be completed virtually. These bills are separate from the series of election reform bills passed by the state senate in January. Those bills focused more on absentee ballots, as well as expanding options for people to vote.</span></p>

It would extend the in-person absentee period for casting ballots to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday immediately preceding the election. It also keeps the 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday option. Current law allows in-person absentee voting from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursday and Friday and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. Pugh said he waited in line for four hours to cast his ballot in November. He said precincts all across his district had waiting lines. Oklahoma has the shortest period for early voting, he said. “We are the worst state in the country for voter turnout,” Pugh said. He said the measure is an incremental change.</span></p>

Kirsten Harris-Talley (D-Seattle) and 26 co-sponsors have introduced House Bill 1156 that would allow</span><a href="http://seattlemedium.com/harris-talley-introduces-bill-for-ranked-choice-voting-in-local-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in some local elections. The bill would allow counties, cities, towns, school districts, fire districts and port districts to implement ranked choice voting in elections where more than two candidates are competing. Up to five candidates can appear on the general election ballot, and voters are not limited by party preference. Additionally, the legislation would strengthen the Voting Rights Act, providing for reimbursement of costs associated with bringing forward a notice of systemic disenfranchisement of underrepresented communities.</span></p>

The suit names Fox stars Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, as well as Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. The defamation and disparagement lawsuit seeks more than $2.7 billion, citing damage from what Smartmatic calls a &#8220;disinformation campaign&#8221; that was waged by people who were unhappy with President Biden&#8217;s victory – but who also hoped to profit from former President Donald Trump&#8217;s persistent and erroneous claims that the election was fraudulent. &#8220;They knew the election was not stolen,&#8221; the company says it in a court filing. &#8220;They knew the election was not rigged or fixed. They knew these truths just as they knew the Earth is round and two plus two equals four.&#8221;</span></p>

Arkansas United, a Springdale-based immigrant rights group, filed the suit on behalf of</span><a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/feb/10/trial-date-set-for-challenge-to-a-state-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters who aren&#8217;t proficient in English</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A 2009 state law forbids any one person who isn&#8217;t an election official from helping more than six people vote at the polls in each election. The lawsuit argues the limit violates federal law. The federal Voter Rights Act allows eligible voters who need assistance to get it from the person of their choice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit names Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston and state election officials as well as local election officials in Benton, Washington and Sebastian counties. Arkansas United is likely to prevail, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks said in a November court order allowing the suit to proceed. Another court order Friday denied multiple arguments to dismiss the case. That order also asserted Arkansas United&#8217;s likely success in the matter. A record number of people who aren&#8217;t fluent in English voted in the general election ending Nov. 3, the Nov. 2 lawsuit by Arkansas United said.  The limit of six people, in some cases, meant even a family member couldn&#8217;t render assistance to all close relatives who needed it, according to the lawsuit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit asked for an immediate injunction to lift the limit.</span></p>

The investigation centers on a Jan. 2 phone call to Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which former President Donald J. Trump pleaded with him to “find” enough votes to overturn his narrow defeat in the state. “This letter is notice that the Fulton County District Attorney has opened an investigation into attempts to influence the administration of the 2020 Georgia General Election,” Willis wrote in correspondences delivered Wednesday morning to Raffensperger, Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and Attorney General Chris Carr. Willis told <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> on Wednesday that her office was best suited to handle the investigation since all other relevant state investigative agencies have conflicts. In her letter, Willis said her office “is the one agency with jurisdiction that is not a witness to the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.” “I don’t have any predetermined opinions” about whether a prosecution will even occur, she said. Willis would not say whether anyone else besides the former president is under investigation.</span></p>

Overall there were more than 30 lawsuits that contested some aspects of the November presidential election or the January U.S. Senate runoff in Georgia. Most were tossed out by judges in short order. But others live on, and new lawsuits are still being filed. At least 13 lawsuits related to the November and January elections in Georgia are pending in various courts.</span></p>

The Iowa Voter Alliance and three voters argued the counties did not have the authority to use $500,000 in grants from the nonprofit Center for Tech and Civic Life. The plaintiffs claimed CTCL was pursuing a progressive agenda by providing funds to promote absentee voting in urban districts. The court declined to bar use of the money ahead of the election, and last week Strand sided with the counties, dismissing and closing the case. Strand ruled that Iowa Voter Alliance failed to show it was harmed by the counties’ actions.</span></p>

The ruling represents the most definitive answer to who won in an election saga with many twists and turns, though it’s not entirely over yet. Democrat Anthony Brindisi has promised to appeal at the state court, and he could seek to contest the election results at the House of Representatives itself. DelConte ruled that counties and the state elections board are to certify the election, rejecting an effort by Democrat Anthony Brindisi, who occupied the seat until early January, to keep the election unofficial until his appeal to a higher court concludes. In ruling against Brindisi, DelConte argued that the Democrat did not provide enough evidence that certifying Tenney would cause “irreparable harm,” given that he still had a remedy at the federal level. DelConte criticized local elections boards for what he said amounted to “systemic violations of state and federal election law” that affected both candidates. In particular, he singled out Oneida County’s failure to process more than 2,400 applications from voters who registered via the DMV, which rendered them unable to vote on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York state is within its rights to</span><a href="https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2021/02/10/2nd-circuit-upholds-ny-state-rules-restricting-ballot-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keep its election ballots decluttered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prevent voter confusion with rules limiting how a political party gets on ballots the  2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this week. The Appellate Court rejected a challenge to the state’s new election ballot rules by the SAM Party of New York. It said the party, whose full name is Serve America Movement, was unlikely to succeed with claims that ballot rules violate the First and 14th amendments. But a three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit in Manhattan in a ruling written by Circuit Judge Michael H. Park noted that the U.S. Constitution gives states broad rights over its elections. “While some voters would surely like to see the SAM Party automatically included on their ballot in the next cycle, the interest of those voters does not outweigh the broader public interest in administrable elections, ensuring that parties enjoy a modicum of electoral support, and the conservation of taxpayer dollars,” the appeals court said.</span></p>

Just a few weeks ago, a similar suit was settled between two Virginia Democrats eyeing statewide office this year, Paul Goldman and Del. Lee Carter (D-Manassas), and the state’s election officials. Richmond Circuit Court Judge David Eugene Cheek Sr. approved the finalized settlement requiring the Department of Elections to develop a non-contact method — either by mail or online — for statewide candidates by Friday.  Del. Carter and six prospective House candidates filed another suit Tuesday in an effort to have the department provide the same process to those trying to make the primary ballot for the state legislature.  The latest suit against the Department of Elections cites the health and safety concerns that come with the traditional in-person gathering method and claims, as the first complaint from Carter and Goldman did, of a violation of the candidates’ First Amendment rights.</span></p>
