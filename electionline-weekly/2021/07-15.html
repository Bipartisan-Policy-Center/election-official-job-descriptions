							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>What’s on the Horizon for Remote Voter Identity Verification?</strong><br />
<em>New report from Bipartisan Policy Center looks at voter verification</em></p>
<p>It is an axiom of election administration that it should be easy to vote and hard to cheat.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Applying that framework to the modern American voting experience indicates that a perfect remote identity verification policy meets two key goals: 1) accuracy, ensuring that the verification method filters out all ineligible ballots without disqualifying any valid votes; and 2) accessibility, guaranteeing that the verification process doesn’t establish requirements that restrict access to the ballot box.</p>
<p>U.S elections take place in the context of a stratified society, wherein race, class, and ability can all impact an individual’s access to voting and likelihood of having their vote accepted and tabulated. Verification policies need to actively counter contextual disparities, rather than passively perpetuate or exacerbate them. Additionally, given that under-resourcing for state and local elections infrastructure is a chronic, national issue, verification measures must be feasible for elections jurisdictions to implement and administer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-large wp-image-7206" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Signature-Verification-White-Paper-1-1024x576.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Signature-Verification-White-Paper-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Signature-Verification-White-Paper-1-300x169.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Signature-Verification-White-Paper-1-768x432.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Signature-Verification-White-Paper-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Signature-Verification-White-Paper-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />Outside of the elections field, a variety of industries have leveraged technological innovation to accurately and efficiently discern identity remotely through tools like data verification and two-factor authentication. The private sector may offer lessons to be learned on how to improve and modernize remote voter identity verification.</p>
<p>As the nation trends towards a wider reliance on convenience voting methods, this report explores how states and localities can ensure that their voter verification policies achieve the nexus of accuracy, accessibility, equity, and practical feasibility. This paper is not intended to provide specific recommendations about how election officials should be conducting identity verification. Rather, it provides a survey of the major benefits and drawbacks of the policy alternatives in use today, as well as the methods that might gain traction down the road.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/remote-voter-id/"> report</a> provides a survey of the major policy alternatives in use today, as well as those with potential for the future.</p>

This is a test of our time,” he said to a crowd of 300 civil rights advocates, top advisers, and local officials. “Hear me clearly,” he added. “There’s an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote and fair and free elections. An assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are.” He urged Americans to channel their concern into action. He also called for a “new coalition” of activists, students and leaders from the faith, labor and business communities to help bolster voter education and eventual turnout at the polls.</p>

After they were returned, the ballots were fed into a counting machine. Because the folds on some ballots went through a Democrats name, the ballot was either not counted or a vote was wrongly given to the Democrat. Auditors said the problem was most likely limited to Windham, a claim echoed by by Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Ballots are sent to towns and cities with score marks to facilitate folding and the state ensures those marks don&#8217;t go through the ovals where votes are marked. &#8220;It is not impossible that folds affected the outcome of some contest in the 400-seat New Hampshire House of Representatives, but we can conclude that Windham was not the tip of a massive miscount iceberg,&#8221; the auditors wrote. &#8220;Nonetheless, people&#8217;s votes must be counted accurately, so procedural reforms are warranted.&#8221;</p>

Sean Roberts (R-Hominy). &#8220;There is no controversy surrounding the 2020 General Election in Oklahoma,&#8221; Ziriax wrote. Because of the strong protections our state has in place for the security and integrity of elections, there is no credible suspicion or evidence of pervasive fraud here. In fact, our state successfully defended a lawsuit against our election integrity laws in 2020. Furthermore, evidence suggests that voter suppression is virtually non-existent in our state.&#8221; Ziriax said such an audit would be unnecessarily time-consuming and expensive, as well as potentially unlawful. In<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2021/07/14/pennsylvania-2020-presidential-election-audit-voting-machines-tioga-county-pa-mastriano-gop/stories/202107140126"> Pennsylvania</a>, Tiago County, one of three counties targeted by a state lawmaker for a ballot review of the 2020 election will not provide its voting machines for review. The three commissioners in rural Republican-controlled Tioga County announced the decision Tuesday, six days after receiving a sweeping, five-page request for access to documents, information and equipment. &#8220;We can&#8217;t be in a position where we don&#8217;t have the election machines, because we have to run the next election, these are extremely expensive machines and our position is we need to follow the direction that the secretary has given us,&#8221; county solicitor Christopher Gabriel said. And in Maricopa County,<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/07/14/arizona-audit-maricopa-county-spend-2-8-m-replace-voting-machines/7965882002/"> Arizona</a>, the board of supervisors voted unanimously to spend nearly $3 million to replace the county’s voting equipment that had been reviewed by outside groups during the Senate-mandated ballot review.</p>

Raul Martinez, an elections office specialist since August, expressed interest in running for Yakima City Council earlier this year, County Auditor Charles Ross told the Yakima Herald. While elections manager Kathy Fisher had not experienced the candidacy of an election official in her more than 20 years in the office, Ross said she turned to several other counties of similar size in the state for help. Based on what she learned from other counties, Fisher wrote a county-specific policy and oath. “Yakima County Elections employees do not give up their constitutional rights when they accept a position with the division,” the county’s new Preserving Election Integrity When an Employee is a Candidate policy states. “These rights include the right to vote, the right to sign petitions, the right to participate in political activity, or the right to run for office as a candidate.” Employees are allowed to conduct these activities outside of their workplace time and role. They are prohibited under the new policy from handling any ballots until the election is complete if they are a candidate, related to a candidate, managing a campaign, serving on a committee for a ballot measure or are published as an endorser of a candidate in the Voters’ Guide, it says.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Federal Legislation:</strong> A bipartisan group of lawmakers is seeking to increase the number of U.S. service members who exercise their right to vote &#8212; especially those stationed in combat zones or deployed overseas. Sens. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced a bill that would establish a<a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/07/13/lawmakers-pitch-new-voting-system-us-troops-stationed-overseas.html"> secure electronic voting system for those assigned to hazardous duty stations or on a rotational deployment</a>. According to the senators, the fully auditable system would track votes from the time they are marked through the counting process. In a release, Duckworth said a new system is needed as part of an overall effort to &#8220;strengthen voting rights across the country.&#8221; &#8220;Service members face numerous barriers to voting that make it more difficult for them to participate in our democracy by exercising their right to vote,&#8221; she said. &#8220;[The bill] would increase access to the ballot box for troops.&#8221; The proposal follows an executive order signed March 7 by President Joe Biden that required the Defense Department to establish an &#8220;end-to-end tracking system&#8221; for all absentee ballots cast by military personnel and Americans living overseas. Duckworth and Cornyn&#8217;s legislation would specifically target troops who face the most challenges in voting &#8212; those at remote or dangerous locales. Similar legislation<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3646?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22reducing+barriers+for+military+voters%22%5D%7D&amp;s=2&amp;r=1"> was introduced in the House earlier this year</a> by Reps. Andy Kim, D-N.J., and Joe Wilson, R-S.C.</p>

In a news release announcing their proposal, Henderson said the benefits of ranked choice voting “are just as diverse as the candidates who are empowered to run under this system” Henderson also believes it will encourage those running for office to campaign more broadly to supporters of other candidates. The VOICE Amendment Act would also create a voter-education campaign ran by the DC Board of Elections to improve outreach to seniors and low-turnout precincts.</p>

Rep. Ann Bollin, who chairs the House Elections and Ethics Committee, told The Associated Press that she and many other House Republicans oppose a Senate-passed bill that would require absentee ballot applicants to include a copy of their photo ID, their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number.

The budget language in question says: “No public official that is responsible for administering or conducting an election in this state shall collaborate with or accept or expend any money from a nongovernmental person or entity for any costs or activities related to voter registration, voter education, voter identification, get-out-the-vote, absent voting, election official recruitment or training or any other election-relation purpose…” The Ohio League of Women Voters and other voting rights group had asked Gov. Mike DeWine (R) to repeal the controversial language. He later told reporters he doesn&#8217;t think it will prevent voter education or voter registration efforts. Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) says he was told that the measure is meant to keep large companies from injecting money into elections through boards of election.</p>

Republicans have already dulled some of the edges of the legislation, dropping controversial provisions to restrict Sunday voting hours and to make it easier for judges to overturn elections. But the bills’ authors are still moving to ban drive-thru and 24-hour voting options, enhance access for partisan poll watchers and prohibit local election officials from proactively distributing applications to request mail-in ballots. Both bills also include language to further restrict the state’s voting-by-mail rules, including new ID requirements for absentee voters. Significant portions of both bills focus on shutting down local expansion of voting options meant to make it easier to vote. Senate Bill 1 was<a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/politics/texas-legislature/texas-election-voting-bill-senate/269-435ee6eb-7f44-424a-912a-adfe54c0f0c9"> approved by a vote of 18-4</a>.

Named for Barbara Jordan, the state’s first Black female senator,<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=871&amp;Bill=SB61"> the Democrats’ bill</a> would usher in online and same-day voter registration, allow all voters to request mail-in ballots, expand the early voting period, permit additional documents to be used as voter ID and make Election Day a state holiday and require employers to let employees vote. All 13 Democratic senators back the legislation. “This bill is designed to make voting and the election process more safe and more secure and more accessible,” said the chief author, Sen.

The vote took place during a meeting of the council’s Committee of the Whole, on which all nine members sit.  The proposal was introduced by Councilmember Girmay Zahilay last month. Zahilay, along with Councilmembers Jeanne Kohl-Welles, Dave Upthegrove, Claudia Balducci, Pete von Reichbauer and Joe McDermott voted to advance the measure for consideration at the July 13th meeting. Councilmembers Rod Dembowski, Kathy Lambert and Reagan Dunn voted in opposition.  If the proposal passes in a full council vote, voters in King County will decide whether they want to use ranked-choice voting to elect county officials. Those positions include the King County executive, assessor, director of elections, prosecuting attorney and members of the county council. The council <a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3032551/delaying-ranked-choice-voting-king-county-right-decision-fair-vote-wa/">ultimately decided to delay moving forward</a> with the proposal at this time.</p>

The lawsuit against the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., claims those meetings should have been open and that changes to the draft standards should have been shared with the commission’s advisory and standards boards. The lawsuit seeks to have those changes set aside. The standards, approved in February, did not include draft language that would have banned wireless technology from voting equipment under federal certification guidelines. Voting security experts say the machines will be vulnerable to hacking without such a ban. Federal law requires the agency to develop its guidelines for voting systems in public, said Susan Greenhalgh of the nonprofit Free Speech for People, the group that brought the lawsuit along with University of California, Berkeley computer scientist Philip Stark, who sits on the commission’s advisory board.</p>

Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved.  In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties.  They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle,” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. They allege in court documents that ranked-choice voting imposes “an unconstitutional burden on the voter’s right to make a knowledgeable choice,” saying voters will make choices not knowing which candidates might be eliminated.</p>

All 14 members of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission voted in favor of the proposal Tuesday night, setting the stage for the state’s high court to intervene for the second time in the past year to adjust the process of drawing new legislative, congressional and Board of Equalization districts. Last summer, the justices agreed to add four months to what would otherwise have been an Aug. 15 deadline to finalize the state’s maps. That decision, given current expectations that state officials will receive census data next month, would require maps to be completed by the end of December. The commission wants the state’s highest court to grant an additional two weeks, seeking to finalize its work no later than Jan. 14.</p>

Hammet won a lawsuit last year over whether details about provisional ballots are a public record, and District Judge Teresa Watson ordered Secretary of State Scott Schwab to turn the information over. The Republican secretary of state, whose agency oversees elections and manages a statewide voter database, instead ordered software engineers to remove the database function that allows the agency to produce the records. The secretary then denied Hammet’s request on the grounds that the records no longer exist. Schwab’s office told Hammet he could still get access to the data, but only if he paid $522 for the database vendor, Election Systems &amp; Software, to retrieve it. Hammet sued again, with support from the ACLU. Pierson and Garrett Roe, an attorney for Schwab’s agency, are asking Watson to issue summary judgment in the case. Roe argued that the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA) only requires agencies to turn over existing records, and says nothing of software management.</p>

Parker heard arguments from lawyers for Detroit and Michigan for sanctioning Powell and her team, but spent most of the hearing scrutinizing the baseless allegations of fraud and misconduct leveled in the lawsuit, which involved several attorneys, including three from Michigan: Scott Hagerstrom, Stefanie Lambert Junttila and Greg Rohl. Parker repeatedly questioned whether the attorneys properly investigated the claims of fraud and misconduct presented in affidavits included in the lawsuit before submitting them to the court. &#8220;My concern is that counsel here has submitted affidavits to suggest and make the public believe that there was something wrong with the election. And that is what this is all about.

However, he backed off that stance on Tuesday, after city and county officials agreed to hammer out how the upcoming elections would be handled. “We all are here to see, ultimately, that the election gets (done properly),” he said.</p>

The 3rd district commissioner seat has been vacant since January after Marczyk invalidated the November 2020 election that was botched by County Clerk Ed McGettigan, a Democrat. Ed McGettigan goofed by mailing the incorrect ballots to 544 votes in a race where Democrat Thelma Witherspoon defeated Republican Andrew Parker by 286 votes. “The court’s goal is to interpret statutes consistent with the intent of the Legislature,” Marczyk said.  “When the language is clear and unambiguous and susceptible to only to one interpretation, the courts assume the legislature meant what it said … the court’s role is not to question legislative action, but to enforce them, so long as they are not contrary to constitutional principles.” Marczyk had previously denied a bid by Democrats to temporarily fill the seat.  It had previously been held by Democrat Ashley Bennett, who did not seek re-election to a second term. He also had ordered an April special election, which was cancelled as a result of Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order.</p>

The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People&#8217;s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.</p>

The Vote Center Hubs were manufactured to help jurisdictions assemble and disassemble their in-person voting centers for each election. Also, costly voting equipment used at voting locations must be stored and protected. The Vote Center Hubs fulfill both crucial needs. The Hubs are designed with two security features to lockdown and protect the equipment when not in use. When elections are completed, the jurisdictions move the mobile, self-contained Hubs to their storage locations. Jeff Ellington, President and CEO of Runbeck, explains, “This collaboration allows us to solve logistical and security problems that counties encounter with their voting spaces and equipment, which is a major undertaking every election. The Hub is simple and smart—counties can use it, lock it and store it.”</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/events/2021/06/23/180368/democracy-work-states-frontline-protect-right-vote/">Democracy at Work: How States Are on the Front Line of Protecting the Right to Vote</a>: States truly served as laboratories for democracy during the past year, expanding access to voting during the COVID-19 pandemic and leading the highest turnout election in a hundred years. Election and pro-voter reforms—such as mail voting, same-day registration, and early voting—have never mattered more. And yet, there are coordinated campaigns in some states to eliminate or curtail commonsense policies that helped Americans vote last year and in every election cycle. Throughout the country, voting rights are under assault. Already, more than 360 anti-voter bills have been introduced in state legislatures to block Americans from voting. These anti-democratic efforts are based on “the big lie” and represent a nefarious response to high turnout among voters of color in 2020. Please join the Center for American Progress Action Fund and State Innovation Exchange Action for a discussion on what is it like to be on the front lines of these attacks and what state leaders are doing to combat them. CAP Action Founder John Podesta will moderate a discussion with Stacey Abrams, followed by a panel of state legislators moderated by voting rights reporter Ari Berman. <strong>When:</strong> July 20, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

The Census Bureau is responsible for making the Section 203 determinations based on American Community Survey.  Join us to review the previous determinations to assess which jurisdictions just missed coverage in 2016, and which may be covered during the next determinations, and hear from our guest election officials and voting rights advocates what can be done in preparation for the next set of determinations. <strong>When:</strong> July 22, 3:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257">Election Audit Specialist</a>, VotingWorks— VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair. We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment. About the Job: Your goal is to make election administrators successful when running Arlo, VotingWorks’ risk-limiting audit software, to conduct risk-limiting election audits. You succeed when these election administrators succeed in delighting audit board members, voters, and the public. You’ll need to become very skilled with the Arlo software, the VotingWorks voting machines and general risk-limiting audit procedures. You’ll support election administrators and audit board members with tier 1 support (basic software and procedure questions) that includes light training and troubleshooting in preparation for and during audit conduct remotely. Occasionally, you’ll be asked to provide the same support in-person. Your enthusiasm for the product, the process, the mission, and the team should be infectious, surpassed only by your organizational skills and ability to multitask. You know that no matter how robust a technology, at the end of the day it’s people who make other people successful and you feel personally responsible for ensuring that everyone who uses Arlo feels successful. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/votingworks/1a2810e1-e87b-4674-ac59-11ca28c15257"> click here</a>.</p>
