							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crowdsourcing election data — a success story<br /> </strong><em>60 percent of local election officials involved in updates of data</em></p>
<p>U.S. Vote Foundation’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm">Election Official Directory</a> (EOD) is a crowd-sourced database with 7,825 extensive records. The&nbsp;“crowd” comprises Local Election Officials (LEOs) across the US who regularly update their jurisdiction contact data.</p>
<p>In 2010, the foundation began tracking response rates to update requests that go to LEOs. In the last five years since, the response rate to the update requests <em>doubled from 30 percent to 60 percent.</em> This is a story of dedication in pursuit of an idea and its implementation.</p>
<p>Standout states in 2015 were Rhode Island and Michigan.</p>
<p>Rhode Island’s Deputy Directory of Elections, Rob Rock, contacted US Vote to ask how his state could reach a 100 percent participation rate for all 39 of its jurisdictions. They teamed on the timing and messaging to the LEOs and the goal was achieved.</p>
<p>Michigan has a dramatically larger number of jurisdictions – 1,601. Working with Tim Hanson of Michigan’s Department of State to contact the LEOs in multiple ways brought their response rate to a whopping 65 percent!</p>
<p>The EOD effort began 12 years ago with Overseas Vote Foundation, now <a href="http://www.overseasvote.org">Overseas Vote</a>, an initiative of <a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/">U.S. Vote Foundation</a> (US Vote). Over time, the backend system for managing the data evolved considerably and the amount of data maintained in each record increased.</p>
<p>The EOD database contains the most extensive records per jurisdiction of any such data resource in the nation. Jurisdictions can list unlimited contacts, customize titles and add jurisdiction-specific information. LEOs can also update their data pro-actively at any time by visiting either foundation website, looking up their record in the EOD and clicking their specific <em>Update</em> link.</p>
<p>The EOD data is edited. All data update submissions are reviewed before being posted live. Any records not updated by election officials are reviewed and updated by foundation staff.</p>
<p>The foundation believes that the consistent growth of LEO engagement can be attributed to: 1) election officials know and trust US Vote; 2) the organization has been in direct communication with LEOs over considerable time, and the consistent work has brought rewards.</p>
<p>Jane Scheiring, the EOD data manager, states, “In 2015, we passed the tipping point. Election officials have gotten to know us and they are very responsive to our update requests. There is a lot of teamwork, and I really enjoy working with them.”</p>
<p><strong>The Future Looks Bright<br /> </strong>The EOD data has become the basis of US Vote’s Civic Data API (Application Programming Interface). The data is licensed and used by other major voting organizations, such as Rock the Vote and Long Distance Voter to bring local election contact data and addresses to the voters they serve.</p>
<p>It is also integrated into US Vote’s network of hosted overseas and military voter websites serving organizations like the League of Women Voters, Vote From Abroad, iVoteIsrael and many more. NASS provides a prominent link to the EOD through <a href="http://canivote.org/"><span style="color: #0000e9;">canivote.org</span></a>.</p>
<p><em></em>To support improved voter services across the nation, the foundation offers states use of the EOD data and the Civic Data API at no charge.</p>
<p>In 2016, with grant support from The Democracy Fund, US Vote will expand the database and Civic Data API to include state voting requirements. Rock the Vote will team with US Vote to showcase an implementation of the Civic Data API using the new state data.</p>
<p>With support from the Knight Foundation Prototype Fund, an additional expansion of the Civic Data API is currently undergoing an R&amp;D phase to determine whether these same crowdsourcing methods can be used to develop and maintain a nationwide data source for local/municipal election dates and deadlines. With approximately 90,000 municipalities across the US, this will take the concepts to a new level.</p>
<p>US Vote looks forward to more voter organizations, data projects, states and voting agencies using the Civic Data API over the coming election year. Collaboration will consolidate efforts and improve the data, which in turn, serves voters and the greater election community.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last week during the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2016/1771-electionlineweekly-january-7-2016">roundtable on election preparations,</a> sever swing state election administrators noted that they are not seeing the interest in the 2016 election by young people they way they did in 2012/2008. A new poll by <em>USAToday</em> and Rock the Vote seems to contradict that a bit. The poll found that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/01/11/poll-millennials-agenda-president-rock-the-vote-republican-trump-sanders-democrat/78556154/">60 percent of the Millennials surveyed plan to vote in 2016</a>, but that 55 percent agree “there are better ways to make a difference than voting.” At the same time three of four say voting is way to change things their communities and a majority believe their vote could decide an election. &#8220;These poll numbers should put to rest the notion that Millennials are unaware of the value of their vote,&#8221; said Ashley Spillane, president of Rock the Vote. &#8220;But the numbers also underscore how critical the work we do to engage young people in the entire civic process — from demystifying registration and voting to providing key information about candidates and issues. It&#8217;s on all of us to make sure new voter to know how much critical they are to the future of our democracy.&#8221;
</li>
<li>County officials in Fairfax County, Virginia want the county’s schools, 167 of which serve as polling places, to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/fairfax-considers-closing-schools-on-contentious-super-tuesday-elections/2016/01/12/bbfcc564-b94a-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html">closed for the primary election out of fear that supporters of Donald Trump, angry with the state’s loyalty oath</a>, could cause mayhem at the polls. Electoral Board Secretary Katherine K. Hanley told the board of supervisors she believes the risk of arguments or fights over the pledge is significant enough to justify canceling classes for more than 180,000 students. The school system is already planning on opening two hours late that day and according to <em>The Washington Post</em>, Superintendent Karen Garza said she would consider the supervisors’ request.

<li>The Texas secretary of state’s office has approved Smith County to become a <a href="http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/229482/texas-oks-smith-county-vote-centers">permanent vote center county</a> after a successful pilot in November 2015. “We are very excited to be able to give convenience and flexibility to voters by giving them the decision on where they cast their vote on Election Day,” Smith County Elections Administrator Karen Nelson said in a news release. <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/neighborhood/fortbend/news/article/Fort-Bend-moves-to-lock-in-county-wide-voting-6754575.php">Fort Bend</a> Count is still waiting to hear from the state, but is hopeful. &#8220;

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida: </strong>State Sen. Aaron Bean filed legislation pressing Congress to reform voter registration by allowing states to identify noncitizens who may be voting by <a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/198092-aaron-bean-seeks-a-crackdown-on-non-citizen-voters">allowing states to verify citizenship</a> during the voter application process.</p>
<p>Rep. Danny Burgess (R-Zephyrhills) has introduced a bill that would add <a href="http://news.wfsu.org/post/new-voter-identification-consideration">two new forms of ID</a> to the acceptable forms of ID the state requires to vote. The types of ID are the VA health ID cards and concealed carry permits.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong>: Lake County officials are pushing for a change in state election law that <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160108/news/160109154/">gives military and overseas voters 24 less hours</a> to cast a ballot than their domestic counterparts. Under current law, military and overseas voters must have their ballots postmarked by midnight on the day before the election but those mailing their ballots domestically have until midnight on Election Day.</p>
<p>Sen. Andy Manar (D-Bunker Hill) is sponsoring Senate Bill 2134 which would allow for <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/article/20160113/NEWS/160119825">automatic voter registration</a>. The bill would impact those who apply for or renew a driver’s license.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: A bill that would allow Kentuckians to clear class D felonies from their criminal records has been approved by a House committee and Speaker Greg Stumbo (D-Peterson) said he expects the full House to approve it. If approved, thousands of <a href="http://wfpl.org/51070-2/">ex-felons would regain their right to vote</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: The Hyattsville city council recently introduced a motion directing the city attorney to draw up a charter amendment that would allow <a href="http://hyattsvillelife.com/non-u-s-citizens-likely-to-vote-in-city-elections/">non-U.S. citizens</a> — even those without proper documentation — to vote in municipal elections.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, the Baltimore City Council approved a resolution calling the General Assembly to override Gov. Larry Hogan’s veto of a bill that would have restored <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-veto-override-20160111-story.html">ex-felons right to vote</a> sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: A photo <a href="http://themissouritimes.com/25997/photo-voter-id-moves-out-of-first-committee/">voter ID</a> measure passed out the House Elections Committee even though not one person testified in favor of it during a committee hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska: </strong>Sen. Adam Morfeld (Lincoln) has introduced legislation that would allow voters to <a href="http://www.1011now.com/home/headlines/Nebraska-Senator-Wants-To-Make-Ballot-Selfies-Legal-364552871.html">take a ballot selfie at the polls</a>. Current law prohibits voters from showing anyone their marked ballot and in 2015 Secretary of State John Gale said that includes taking a picture of the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: Legislation is pending that would allow Ohio residents who have been victims of domestic violence, stalking and other crimes to <a href="http://www.fox19.com/story/30941276/ohio-bill-provides-confidential-address-for-violence-victims">shield their addresses</a> including on voter registration information.</p>
<p>Also in Ohio legislators are making progress on allowing voters to <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/12/ohio-online-voting.html">register online to vote</a>. The bill was approved 31-1 by the Senate in June 2015 and is championed by Secretary of State Jon Husted. Husted urged the House to move the bill by the end of February to give his office time get the system up and running and allow voters to use it before the November election.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming</strong>: The Legislature’s Management Council voted to sponsor a bill that requires groups to submit <a href="http://www.wyomingnews.com/news/article_a73679be-b773-11e5-bcef-436643000647.html">proposed initiatives in proper bill format</a> before the secretary of state decides whether it meets the requirements to be certified.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>More than two years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Shelby County in <em>Shelby v. Holder</em>, the county is still <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/alabama/2016/01/07/shelby-county-seeks-legal-fees-voting-rights-victory/78318124/">fighting to be reimbursed $2 million</a> in legal fees it says the U.S. Department of Justices owes it. Two lower courts disagree with the county’s interpretation of the Voting Rights Act in reimbursement of fees and now the county wants the Supreme Court to once again take up its case.</p>
<p>Also in Alabama, a fourth person has been sentenced for voter fraud in connection with a 2013 election in Dothan. Daniel W. Reynolds III was sentenced to two years of probation after pleading guilty to three counts of <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/alabama-man-pleads-guilty-to-absentee-ballot-fraud-charges/article_f7e4a6f6-40ce-591c-b958-d61bb4aeccb5.html">absentee ballot fraud</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: Without comment, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to disturb lower court rulings upholding a 2011 Arizona law that only the two parties with the highest number of members get to be listed on <a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/local/voter-registration-forms-still-list-just-two-parties/article_ee9d6ab5-2686-588d-8d21-f59a023cda36.html">voter registration forms</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: Ba County Clerk Cynthia A. Luczak has filed suit against county officials alleging that the approximate 50 percent <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/01/bay_county_clerk_cynthia_lucza_2.html">reduction in her staff makes it difficult for her to do her job</a>. In her suit, Luczak alleges that she has made repeated requests to address her limited staffing, but that she’s been subjected to unreasonable demands from county officials.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The North Carolina NAACP has filed papers requesting that the court postpone the upcoming <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/naacp-postpone-nc-voter-id-trial-until-after-primaries/article_df2fdf54-9b64-513e-a418-12dd6f3fb64d.html">voter ID trial</a> until after the March primaries. The hearing is set to start Jan. 25. The group argues that the state has not done enough to educate voters about the law and thinks the trial and law should be delayed until after the primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: A federal judge has set an April trial in a dispute involving the accessibility of <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20160113/trial-set-in-lawsuit-over-ohio-blind-voters-ballot-access">paper absentee ballots</a> to blind Ohio voters. Plaintiffs have dropped a request for the court to provide relief before the primary.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>: Three former Philadelphia elections officials pleaded guilty Wednesday in Common Pleas Court to misdemeanor charges of <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20160114_Three_former_Philly_elections_officials_plead_guilty.html">violating the state&#8217;s election code</a> and were each sentenced to one year of probation. Under a plea deal, felony fraud charges were dropped against Robin Trainor, 56; Laura Murtaugh, 57; and Cheryl Ali, also 57.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: The Augusta County board of supervisors has approved a resolution to settle a civil lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice over <a href="http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2016/01/13/augusta-ada-resolution/78768832/">inaccessible polling places</a>.</p>
<p>Ten current and former Republican members of Congress asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to stop a new, <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/lawmakers_ask_supreme_court_to_stop_virginia_redistricting_plan-245441-1.html">judge-selected redistricting</a> plan in Virginia or risk the state having to postpone congressional elections.</p></p>

<p><strong>National Tech: </strong>This week Clear Ballot launched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0xjVhyecys">ClearCast precinct voting unit</a>. ClearCast is comprised entirely of commercial off-the-shelf components. The voting unit allows ballots to be case and processed via the Intel NUC mini PC and ballots are then deposited in a durable ballot box that is both detachable and collapsible.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong>: Quietly, in the waning hours of 2015, the state of Alaska became one of a growing number of states to offer <a href="https://www.adn.com/article/20160111/new-online-alaska-voter-registration-place-pfd-initiative-backers-want-more">online voter registration</a>. The state launched the system in late November and since then 592 voter registrations have been completed.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong>: In an effort to save money, Clark County is offering voters the option of receiving their <a href="http://www.ktnv.com/news/local-news/clark-county-pushes-electronic-sample-ballots">sample ballots electronically</a>.
