														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>2016 Summer Reading List</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Summer of 2016 officially kicks off this weekend.</p>
<p>There will be backyard barbeques, days at the pool and beach, political conventions, mosquito bites, fireworks, sunburns, summer loves and the inevitable <a href="https://youtu.be/ru0K8uYEZWw">song of the summer</a> (we’re already calling this one).</p>
<p>The summer also presents many people with an opportunity to slow down (albeit just a little bit in this hectic election year) and pick up a good book or two to read.</p>
<p>And there are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html">plenty of options</a> from the likes James Patterson, David Baldacci, Danielle Steel, Louis Erdrich, Curtis Sittenfeld and so many more to choose from, we thought our readership might be interested in a few books that are a bit closer to their hearts.</p>
<p>What follows are reviews of four election-related books that we thought you may enjoy this summer. And unlike assigned reading in school, we will not expect a book report in September! Happy Reading!</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p>II. Primary Updates</p>
<p><strong>Georgia<br /></strong>Voters in The Peach State went to the polls this week for state and local primaries and while Georgia may have had record-breaking turnout for the March 1 presidential preference primary, the same <a href="http://www.tribuneledgernews.com/local_news/officials-deem-voter-turnout-unbelievably-light/article_dd3f8aae-21d2-11e6-a53f-03a835cda43c.html">could not be said this week</a>. That being said, <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/big-jump-in-early-voting-this-year-in-georgia/nrRr8/">early voting numbers</a> were up from this time two years ago.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively low turnout, there were some issues. Voters were encouraged to report problems to the secretary of state’s office via <a href="http://news.wabe.org/post/georgia-voters-encouraged-voice-concerns-social-media">social media</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ksla.com/story/32049837/vehicle-crashes-through-church-fence-hanging-over-ledge">DeKalb County</a>, a couple visiting a voting site drove their car through a playground fence at the polling place church and had to be rescued from their car when it dangled over a ledge at a 45 degree angle. Neither person in the car suffered serious injuries.</p>
<p>A voter in <a href="http://www.11alive.com/news/politics/elections/voter-claims-poll-worker-intimidated-her-over-notes/213930066">Atlanta</a> said that a poll worker yelled at her when she brought notes into the polling place. Voter Jennifer Summer told 11Alive that she always does research on the candidates before an election and brings those notes with her. The secretary of state’s office is investigating.</p>
<p>Although the lights blinked, voting was not affected at a <a href="http://www.forsythnews.com/section/1/article/30211/">Forsyth County</a> polling place when a transformer outside the site caught fire early Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/judge-orders-norcross-precinct-to-stay-open-late/nrSY3/">Gwinnett County</a>, one polling place in Norcross was ordered to stay open late because it opened late Tuesday. Superior Judge Tom Davis ordered the polls to remain open until 7:42 p.m. because the site opened late after a poll manager locked herself out.</p>
<p>The results in <a href="http://www.cbs46.com/story/32062447/election-results-yet-to-be-posted-in-douglas-county">Douglas County</a> were delayed till late Wednesday because the county was forced to do a manual count after a candidate dropped out of the race. Absentee and early ballots featured the candidate, election day ballots did not so they had to be counted separately.</p>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/voting-glitch-was-found-in-february-but-no-one-tol/nrTKN/">Fulton County</a>, at least 100 voters voted in the wrong Congressional race after a data glitch provided them with an incorrect ballot. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the secretary of state’s office and Democratic party knew of the data glitch, but failed to notify elections officials in Fulton who produce the ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong><br />Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has asked for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/24/bernie-sanders-asks-for-recanvass-of-kentucky-primary-vote/">recanvass of the Kentucky primary vote</a>. Currently Hillary Clinton leads Sanders by about two thousand votes in Kentucky. According to The Washington Post, the Sanders campaign has offered no examples of questionable vote-counting or electioneering and went with a recanvass instead of recount because the state covers the costs of the recanvass.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong><br />The Maryland State Board of Elections has determined that <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/politics/bs-md-ci-election-report-20160523-story.html">about 1,650 ballots cast in Baltimore were handled improperly</a>. Of those 1, 188 provisional ballots were improperly scanned in primary day vote totals and 465 other provisional ballots were not considered.</p>
<p>According to The Baltimore Sun, there were problems at precincts throughout the city, the review found. At only 75 of the city&#8217;s 296 precincts did the number of voters who checked into the polls and the number of ballots cast match. At 11 precincts, there were at least 30 more ballots cast than voters who checked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what it is,&#8221; Armstead B.C. Jones Sr., Baltimore’s election director told The Sun. &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t have happened, but Baltimore City is not the only place where it happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong><br />Voters in Washington mailed it in this week and there were no reports of any problems. <a href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/elections/more-than-million-presidential-primary-ballots-already-returned/article_2294bcb4-21c9-11e6-a123-7f6d7a28ac31.html">Turnout</a> was mixed.</p>
<p>The primary cost the state <a href="http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20160524/NEWS/305249993/states-presidential-primary-ends-today-high-turnout-continues-for">$11.5 million</a> to conduct and once again ignited discussions about <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/article79954202.html">changing the process</a>.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fifty members of Congress have joined together to form the <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/voting-rights-caucus-act-1965-election-restrictions-supreme-court-voter-id-law">Voting Rights Caucus</a>. According to <em>Roll Call</em>, the caucus will work to educate the public about voting restrictions enacted since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key section of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. &#8220;It is a shame that in 2016 we still need a caucus,&#8221; said Alabama Rep. Terri A. Sewell, who will co-chair the new&nbsp;caucus. &nbsp;
</li>
<li>This week, the South Dakota State Board of Elections adopted <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/state-trying-to-improve-electoral-processes/article_ebf68ed2-5ef1-5225-bcef-8e29449af081.html">45 pages of rules changes</a>. According to the <em>Rapid City Journal</em>, some of the proposals covered establishing governments for new cities, adopting armed sentinel programs in school districts, filling vacancies and how ballot petitions are reviewed. Nearly all of the proposals were unanimously approved by the board.
</li>
<li>Since their voting rights were restored in April, <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_caaf2adc-8850-5894-8416-29f72b74865b.html">almost 5,000 ex-felons have registered to vote</a> in Virginia. Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés said that 4,935 ex-offenders had registered since McAuliffe signed the restoration order on April 22. The total represents an increase of about 1,000 voters registered since last week. The deadline to apply for June’s primary was Monday but those who applied and still have to be verified will be included in the rolls for June 14.
</li>
<li>By a 2 to 1, the Vigo County Board of Elections once again voted down including a <a href="http://www.mywabashvalley.com/news/isu-voting-center-voted-down">voting center on the campus of Indiana State University</a>. Although the state had approved the location, the county board had to unanimously agree. Republican Kara Anderson voted against it.&nbsp; Democrats Michael Slagle and Dave Crockett voted in favor. At a packed meeting Anderson said it would be unfair to take voting machines from other locations, but the University and county said they would pay for additional machines. This is the second time in 2016 the board had denied a voting center at ISU.
</li>
<li>That sound you hear is this Gen-X writer grumbling while writing that apparently a new analysis of Census data shows that <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/study-millennials-match-boomers-in-eligible-voter-share/article_d52a22fd-b98c-5a69-ba13-2b9833ebf871.html">Millennials are now tied with Baby Boomers for the largest percentage share of eligible voters</a>. Each age group comprises about 31 percent of the electorate. That being said, the Boomers turn out in a higher percentage — 69 percent — than the Millennials do — 46 percent.
</li>
<li>Speaking of Millennials, while voter registration numbers for Millennials are up in California, whether or not they cast a ballot remains to be seen. In Sacramento County, where 65 percent of the new voter registrations were voters under 35, so far only 9 percent of the returned mail-in ballots are from voters under 35. &#8220;A lot of younger voters, <a href="http://www.kcra.com/news/expert-millennials-cant-find-stamps-dont-mail-in-ballots/39728604">they might not even know where they keep their stamps</a>,&#8221; Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data who is tracking registration and voting numbers told KCRA.
</li>
<li>In other young voter news, Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Murray said this week that he was <a href="http://kgab.com/wyoming-secretary-of-state-shocked-by-lack-of-youth-vote/">“appalled and shocked” that only about 10 percent of the people aged 18-24 bothered to vote</a> in the Cowboy State. According to KGAB Murray is calling for a return to civics courses at state schools. He also plans to hold a statewide summit later this year to discuss the problem.
</li>
<li>Oof…The New York City Board of Elections recently sent letters to some voters whose ballots were not counted during the April primary. The letters read, in part: “Dear Voter: We have received your Absentee Ballot for the <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/05/25/the-board-of-elections-has-no-idea-when-elections-take-place/">Primary Election held September 13, 2016</a>. We could not count your vote because it was not in compliance with Election Laws,” the notices read.

<li><strong>Personnel News:</strong> Members of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s <strong><a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/EAC.Advisory.Boards.Select.Officers.2016.pdf">Standards Board and Board of Advisors</a></strong> recently selected officers for new terms at their annual meetings.

She was 64. Lathrop was first elected to office in 1994 and was serving her sixth term as county clerk.</p>
<p>“There was nobody, as far as I’m concerned, in the state of Wyoming or the nation who was a better county clerk than she was,” County Commission Chairman Buck Holmes told the <em>Wyoming Tribune Eagle</em>. “She knew the statutes, how to get ready for the audits we go through. She was just so knowledgeable.”</p>
<p>According to the <em>Tribune Eagle</em>, Lathrop was a vocal proponent of the county’s current vote center election model.</p>
<p>“She was always looking forward. While we would get kind of comfortable with one kind of voting machine, something better would come along,” former Commissioner Diane Humphrey told the paper. “And thanks to her, we were always ahead of the curve. Laramie County was where we would try all the new stuff out, and Debbye had a lot to do with that.”</p>
<p>Lathrop’s husband of 31 years, Steve, passed away in April. She is survived by several children and grandchildren.</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> By a 42-16 vote, the Senate has approved legislation that could make Illinois the sixth state to adopt <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/article/20160519/NEWS/160519390">automatic voter registration</a>. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Gov. Mark Dayton has signed legislation into law that will move Minnesota to a <a href="http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/05/22/dayton-bill-presidential-primary/">presidential primary system</a> beginning in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Bill A-3591 that would allow <a href="http://njtoday.net/2016/05/24/zwicker-voting-rights-legislation-clears-committee/">17-year-olds who turn 18</a> by the general election vote in the primary has been approved by the Assembly Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> By a 90-2 vote, the Ohio House has finally approved <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/05/24/online_voter_registration.html">online voter registration</a>. The vote capped years of back-and-forth and will become law in 2017, something that disappointed Secretary of State Jon Husted. “There are absolutely no good reasons why this should be delayed until 2017 from an administrative point of view,” Husted said.</p>
<p>Also in Ohio, the Senate is fast-tracking legislation that would require petitioners to put up <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/24/lawmakers-fast-track-bill-requiring-cash-longer-voting-hours/84843498/">bond money if they seek to keep the polls open</a> later than the designated closing time.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Activists supporting Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders filed suit late last week to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/SF-city-attorney-slams-Sanders-backers-7943508.php">extend California’s voter registration</a> up until primary day. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrer called the suit a “political stunt” that “cynically aims to undermine the legitimacy of our, and to further a political narrative that has zero basis in reality.” The judge has set an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/August-date-set-in-suit-over-California-primary-7943140.php">August 18</a> hearing date—more than two months after the primary election.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> The state’s highest court heard arguments last week in a suit filed by the Green Party of Hawaii and <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/2016/05/ian-lind-justices-arent-buying-that-voting-rights-werent-violated/">stemming from ballot issues in 2012</a>. The plaintiffs argue that the methods and procedures for printing and handling ballot should have been adopted in accordance with the state’s Administrative Procedures Act.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson denied a request to put on hold a pending appeal of her order requiring the state to <a href="http://cjonline.com/news/2016-05-25/judge-gives-kansas-secretary-state-kris-kobach-bit-more-time-register-voters">begin registering “suspended” voters</a>. Instead, she extended her temporary stay on her ruling for an additional two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Judge Michael H. Watson of the U.S. District Court in Columbus has ruled that the state <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/05/24/ohio-golden-week-ruling.html">violated the voting rights of Ohioans by eliminating the “golden week.”</a> In 2014 that Legislature reduced the state’s early voting period from 35 to 28 days and it eliminated the one week when voters to register and vote on the same day. &#8220;Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the reduction in overall time to vote will burden the right to vote of African Americans, who use (early in-person) voting significantly more than other voters,&#8221; Watson said in a 120-page opinion.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The Democratic Party is suing the Joint Board of Elections in an effort to have the Joint Board conduct a primary. The party argues that the Joint Board is violating the law by forcing the Democrats to <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/news/local-news/2016/05/20/vi-democratic-party-goes-court-funding-primaries">pay for their own primary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The full panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit heard oral arguments on Tuesday about the state’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/strict-texas-voter-id-law-faces-federal-court-test-ahead-of-presidential-contest/2016/05/24/c17b8838-2130-11e6-aa84-42391ba52c91_story.html">voter ID law</a>. Several of the 15 judges questioned by Texas did not have more fallback provisions for voters who lack the kinds of ID the state requires. The Appeals Court is under pressure from the Supreme Court to make a decision by July.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_fb14253d-0f3b-5e95-bed3-e37b9eac0bb1.html">upheld Virginia’s voter ID law</a>, which had been challenged by Democrats who alleged that the Republican-controlled legislature did so to curb the number of young and minority voters. “Mindful that the court’s mission is to judge not the wisdom of the Virginia voter ID law, but rather its constitutionality, this court cannot say that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof in showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Virginia voter ID law &#8230; contravenes the Voting Rights Act, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, or the Twenty-Sixth Amendment,” Hudson wrote.</p>
<p>Also this week, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-23/republicans-lose-at-u-s-supreme-court-on-virginia-voting-map">threw out a challenge to a judge-drawn voting map</a>. According to Bloomberg, the unanimous ruling Monday said the state’s Republican congressional delegation couldn’t press an appeal seeking to reinstate an earlier map drawn by the state legislature. That map helped Republicans capture eight of Virginia’s 11 U.S. congressional districts in the 2012 and 2014 elections.</p>
<p>In other legal news in Virginia, the state’s GOP filed suit in order to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gop-sues-to-strip-209k-felons-from-va-voter-rolls/2016/05/23/ef2587a8-20e4-11e6-aa84-42391ba52c91_story.html">stop more than 206,000 ex-felons from having their voting rights restored</a> under an executive order by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). The leaders of the House and Senate filed their suit with the state Supreme Court and argued that McAuliffe had exceeded his authority with the executive order.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The federal trial over <a href="http://www.wpr.org/federal-trial-wisconsins-voter-id-law-continues-week">Wisconsin’s voter ID</a> law entered its second week on Monday. Testimony was expected to last through Thursday.</p></p>
