							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>And then there were 10: Field Guides to Ensuring Voter Intent</strong></p>
<p>By Whitney Quesenbery and Dana Chisnell<br /><a href="http://civicdesign.org/">Center for Civic Design</a></p>
<p>We’ve always believed that democracy is a design problem — that design can help solve the biggest problems in elections.</p>
<p>The trouble is that even though there is a lot of good research evidence for the power of good design principles applied to an election challenge, it’s hard to make the leap from the research to its practical application.</p>
<p>And so, the <a href="http://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/">Field Guides for Ensuring Voter Intent</a> were born.</p>
<p>The Field Guides tackle critical topics in election design from ballot design to signage in polling places. Instead of pages and pages of reports, each one has 10 tips and a checklist, with examples pulled from the real world of elections.</p>
<p>They are designed to fit into the busy world of election administration: Short enough to use in a meeting. Small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>Last year, we put them online, so they are available any time and anywhere, in a responsive, accessible website. Always at your finger tips, on your mobile phone.</p>
<p>The real test was whether election officials could use the Field Guide to improve election materials. You can see a before-and-after example in the redesign of the <a href="http://civicdesign.org/showcase/an-updated-provisional-ballot-form-for-ohio/">provisional ballot form in Ohio</a> or a non-elections example of a tax bill in <a href="http://civicdesign.org/showcase/a-better-designed-tax-bill/">Grand County, Utah</a>.</p>
<p>This year, we rounded out the series with two new guides:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Vol_9.png" alt="Vol 9" width="218" height="240" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Vol_10.png" alt="Vol 10" width="218" height="240" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/creating-accessible-online-information/">Volume 9 &#8211; Creating accessible online information</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/creating-forms-that-help-voters-take-action/">Volume 10 &#8211; Creating forms that help voters take action</a></p>
<p>With these new Field Guides, we follow our goal of keeping up with the hot issues in elections with useful tools to help meet those challenges.</p>
<p>Accessibility was an obvious choice. With the expansion of election systems into online voter registration, electronic poll books, and many more ways to communicate with voters electronically, the options for accessible elections expand. But only if we take the time up front to build accessibility in from the start.</p>
<p>Most election offices don’t build software applications, but these days, they are on the web and social media, so this Field Guide focuses on the basics to make the voter experience accessible.</p>
<p>When we reviewed our tips with accessibility experts, one of the pointed out that although each tip may seem small, they add up to something big. Just like the tips for ballot design, writing instructions, and creating election websites.</p>
<p>A Field Guide on election forms was the next logical step. Elections are full of forms, starting with voter registration and going right through to signing a vote-by-mail return envelope.</p>
<p>One of our favorite tips is also one of the easiest:</p>
<p><strong>Make the signature fields stand out.<br /></strong>Using an X to mark the location of a signature helps people get it right</p>
<p>We’ve seen the power of that X in our usability testing. As Tammy Patrick, from the PCEA and Bipartisan Policy Committee says, it’s important on almost every election form because without a valid signature, the form just doesn’t count. That’s bad for voters and makes extra work for election officials.</p>
<p>We hope the Field Guides can help every election official make all of their election materials easy for voters and good for election administration.</p>
<p>The Field Guides are available online: <a href="http://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/">civicdesign.org/fieldguides/</a></p>
<p>Subscribe to our (infrequent) mailing list for more practical tips: <a href="http://tinyletter.com/civicdesigning">tinyletter.com/civicdesigning</a></p>
<p>The Field Guides are free to election officials thanks to the generous support of the MacArthur Foundation. Look for them at your favorite elections conference or write to <a href="mailto:hello@civicdesign.org">hello@civicdesign.org</a></p>

<p><strong>A new approach to reversing the downward spiral of low turnout</strong></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:dbecker@pewtrusts.org">David Becker<br /></a>The Pew Charitable Trusts</p>
<p>Thanks to technological advances, it’s never been easier for the majority of US voters to get election information and cast their ballots. Most Americans can now <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/05/online-voter-registration">go online to register to vote</a>, choose to vote early, and vote by mail—millions have ballots automatically mailed to their homes for each election—and, thanks to the <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/">Voting Information Project</a>, Google, and other partners, receive polling place and ballot information with a simple swipe on their smartphones.</p>
<p>Although critical work remains to be done to extend the reach of these advances, they represent dramatic steps toward modernizing the field of election administration.&nbsp;But we cannot stop here.&nbsp;In spite of this progress, voter turnout across the United States declined last year to levels not seen since World War II.</p>
<p>Data from the United States Election Project indicate that national turnout in November 2014 was less than 37 percent. That means that nearly 2 in 3 eligible voters, or approximately 144 million American citizens—more than the population of Russia—chose to sit out that election. Put another way, more than 47 million Americans who navigated the system and cared enough to cast ballots in November 2012 decided not to vote two years later. The nation hasn’t recorded turnout this low in a federal general election since 1942.</p>

<p>Voters headed to the polls in Wisconsin this week for state and local primaries. This was the first statewide election with <a href="http://www.leadertelegram.com/News/Front-Page/2016/02/17/lt-div-class-libPageBodyLinebreak-gt-Voters-adapt-lt-br-gt-to-amp-nbsp-photo-ID-law-lt-div-gt.html">voter ID</a> in place as well as new voting machines. There were very few problems reported with the roll out of the state’s <a href="http://www.news8000.com/news/politics/Wis-voter-ID-law-no-big-deal-for-Spring-primary/38033254">voter ID law</a>, although needless to say, <a href="http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Voter-ID-requirement-gets-mixed-reviews-in-spring-election-369063161.html">not everyone was happy</a> about the law. And there was a report from <a href="http://www.cbs58.com/story/31238198/veterans-id-no-good-at-the-polls">Milwaukee</a> that one veteran was turned away from the polls because his ID card issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs was not a valid ID. Statewide <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/low-turnout-seen-as-wisconsin-voters-head-to-polls-show-ids-b99671393z1-368985221.html">turnout</a> was fairly low for a non-presidential primary, but there were ballot shortages in <a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/15/voting-tuesdays-primaries-have-id-ready/80409646/?from=global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=">Brown County</a> and <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/ballot-shortages-reported-throughout-waukesha-county-b99671766z1-369038811.html">Waukesha County</a> where the voter turnout was higher than expected. Polls had to stay open till 9 p.m. at two polling places in <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/polling-hours-extended-for-madison-wards-and-until-p-m/article_8c49fad7-4270-53fa-8b28-2c72aa53f444.html">Madison</a> after the polling sites were locked down earlier in the day due reports of a suspicious person in the area. Officials in <a href="http://wsau.com/news/articles/2016/feb/17/new-vote-counting-system-improves-efficiency-and-speed-in-marathon-county/">Marathon County</a> extoled the virtues of the county’s new ballot counting system. The town of <a href="http://www.kenoshanews.com/news/somers_experiences_election_snafu_486634351.php">Somers</a> experienced some issues when two wards were left out of the poll books.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bipartisan Policy Center has launched an effort to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/02/16/marriott-starbucks-back-bipartisan-effort-boost-employee-voting/80423938/">organize large companies and nonprofits to mobilize their employees to register, vote and possibly even volunteer at polling places</a>. Two charter members of the effort are Marriott and Starbucks with at least 200,000 U.S.-based employees. &#8220;Businesses and business people can do more. We can do more,” said Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO. “We should be voting, we should be discussing this in our sphere of influence —&nbsp;family, friends —&nbsp;and make sure we are participating. Because the entire country for 200-plus years has been built on participation.&#8221;
</li>
<li>The Anson County, South Carolina board of elections had a lengthy discussion last week about bathrooms. Some board members worried that <a href="http://ansonrecord.com/news/2022/anson-elections-board-restrooms-are-for-voters-use-only">voters may not have access to bathrooms during long waits</a> to cast a ballot. Board chair Rochelle Williams said that polling places have run into problems in the past when the restrooms were open to the voting public. According to the <em>Anson Record</em>, after some discussion, the board compromised and agreed to designate one of the restrooms for voters who need it, though it will not technically be a public restroom, as only those who vote will be able to use it. Others, whether joggers going by the office or campaigners out front, will not be allowed in since the restroom is in the voting enclosure and only voters will be admitted.
</li>
<li>With early voting under way in the Lone Star State, Lubbock County Elections Administrator Dorothy Kennedy took the time this week to remind Texas voters that <a href="http://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/klbk-news/officials-reminding-guns-not-allowed-at-voting-locations">guns are not permitted inside voting locations</a>. &#8220;So if you can imagine any of our buildings, whether they be our retail outlets or any of our county buildings, our elections office, when voting is going on, during hours of voting, a bubble kind of goes over the entire building. &nbsp; And no guns are allowed, or weapons, concealed or open carry on the guns, unless you are a licensed peace officers,&#8221; Kennedy told KLBK.
</li>
<li>The Davidson County, Tennessee election commission recently <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/02/16/youth-voter-registration-drive-breaks-nashville-record/80470092/">registered 2,865 teens to vote</a> in the city of Nashville. That bests last year’s number by almost 1,300. In-school&nbsp;registrations were conducted over a four-day period at 34 individual schools. They included speaking engagements from several Metro officeholders to energize voting among young people.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>The Alabama Association of County Commissions has proposed legislation that would <a href="http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20160216/news/160219880">change the way county boards of registrars are chosen</a>. Under current law, which is more than 100 years old, the governor, state auditor and commissioner of agriculture and industries appoint the registrars. The proposed legislation would make registrars county employees and supervised at the local level.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona: </strong>Lawmakers are debating legislation that would, if approved, make Arizona the first Republican-leaning state to be a part of the <a href="http://knau.org/post/lawmakers-debate-electing-us-president-popular-vote#stream/0">National Popular Vote</a> Compact. The bill has been approved by the House and is now up for debate in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: The Senate has given preliminary approval to legislation that would <a href="http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/bill-restricts-number-of-vote-sites">reduce the number of voting sites available during the first week of early voting</a>. Under current law, clerks must provide a vote center for every 30,000 voters, but under the proposed legislation, that number would be 75,000.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut: </strong>Under legislation proposed by Secretary of State Denise Merrill, Connecticut would move to an <a href="http://www.berlincitizen.com/news/allnews/8429997-129/story.html.html">automatic voter registration</a> system. During a press conference to announce the legislation, Merrill said if approved, as many as 400,000 people could be added to the Nutmeg State’s voter rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Florida: </strong>Sen. Audrey Gibson (D-Jacksonville) has introduced legislation that would give voters who cast <a href="http://news.wfsu.org/post/lawmaker-looks-ensure-provisional-ballots-are-counted">provisional ballots</a> and forget to sign them time to get them signed and be counted.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Legislation allowing <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/legislature/bill-expanding-primary-voting-rights-to-some--year-olds/article_4b79a50c-e751-5b03-b49f-b61da4d24efd.html">17-year-olds to vote in the primary</a> if they will be 18 by the time of the general election is on the way to Gov. Susana Martinez’s desk. Senators approved the bill 24-16 and the House approved it 41-26.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Following a 25-minute hearing, bills that would have eased <a href="http://pilotonline.com/news/government/virginia/democratic-bills-to-expand-voting-options-for-seniors-killed-in/article_c3585046-71dc-5f31-bfac-fd6243eecd20.html">absentee voting restrictions</a> died in the House of Delegates elections subcommittee. Senate Bill SB106 calling for no excuse absentee voting was tabled and another bill that would have allowed those 65 and older to cast an absentee ballot without an excuse was also tabled.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: On a 55-42 vote Monday, the chamber passed House Bill 2682, which would <a href="http://www.king5.com/story/news/politics/2016/02/15/house-oks-partial-automatic-voter-registration-bill/80428286/">automatically register people</a> who aren&#8217;t on the voter rolls but already have or apply for an enhanced driver&#8217;s license or commercial driver&#8217;s licenses, both of which require citizenship verification. Those who receive social services that verify citizenship or get health insurance through the state health exchange also would be automatically registered.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: This week, the Assembly gave final approval to legislation that would provide for <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/assembly-oks-online-voter-registration-eliminates-special-registration-deputies/article_0b76ecfb-3ae5-5e21-b85c-f562a9746ed7.html">online voter registration</a> in the Badger State. However, unlike OVR legislation in other states, this legislation also eliminated popular Special Registration Deputies program. SRDs worked with civic groups to conduct voter registration drives.</p>
<p>Final approval was also given to legislation that would limit the <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/assembly-kicks-off-final-week-with-epic-session-b99670555z1-368934231.html">types of ID accepted</a> in order to cast a ballot. No longer would voters be allowed to show ID cards issued by local governments. The Senate approved the bill 19-13 and the Assembly 62-35. Gov. Scott Walker is expected to sign the bill.</p></p>

<p><strong>Federal Litigation</strong>: A <a href="http://wkrg.com/2016/02/13/alabama-and-other-state-named-in-voter-id-lawsuit/">coalition of voting rights groups has sued U.S. Election Assistance Commission Executive Director Brian Newby</a> who required residents of Kansas, Alabama and Georgia to show proof-of-citizenship in order to register to vote. The suit also names the entire Commission as a defendant. The complaint, filed by the League of Women Voters, Project Vote, and the Georgia State Conference of the NAACP contends that Newby’s decision will hurt voter registration drives and deprive eligible voters of the right to vote.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia: </strong>A D.C. Superior Court judge has ruled <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/12/judge-reverses-ruling-dc-minimum-wage-vote/">that D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine may intervene</a> in a case that will determine whether the D.C. Board of Elections was properly constituted when it approved a ballot initiative. “The residents of our city have a clear interest in ensuring not only that they are allowed to vote on this ballot measure, but also that other actions of the Board of Elections are not called into question,” Racine said in a statement according to The Washington Times.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia: </strong>The NAACP and Common Cause have filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Brian Kemp arguing that his office is <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgia-secretary-of-state-brian-kemp-sued-over-vo/nqNk6/">violating the National Voter Registration Act</a> and improperly removing voters from the state’s voting rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois: </strong>The federal government is asking an Illinois federal judge to throw out a case challenging how <a href="http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2016/02/11/feds-ask-judge-dismiss-voting-case/80219224/">voter rights are extended to the territories</a>, saying the plaintiffs’ issue should be with the state, not the feds. In their filing, the feds said it’s not the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act that prevents the plaintiffs from voting, but specifically Illinois’ law.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky: </strong>The Kentucky Supreme Court has agreed to review a lower-court decision in which a challenger alleged <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article59865081.html">voter fraud</a> after the incumbent received more absentee votes, but the challenger received more in-person votes.</p></p>

<p><strong>California</strong>: Imperial County is the latest California county to complete the transition to California’s new <a href="http://www.ivpressonline.com/news/local/imperial-county-election-s-office-completes-transition-to-new-voter/article_d3f91b1c-d601-11e5-8ecd-7357ddb5e3a7.html">statewide voter registration database</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-West Boca) has written a letter to Secretary of State Ken Detzner urging Detzner to sign the Sunshine State up <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-voting-fraud-prevention-20160216-story.html">to participate in ERIC</a>. &#8220;We have a record when it comes to our elections that is obviously not one we are terribly proud of,&#8221; Deutch told the <em>Sun-Sentinel</em>. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why we wouldn&#8217;t join an effort with a nationwide database that can combat problems of people being registered to vote in two states.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>: Maine is preparing to launch a new <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/new-maine-voting-machines-will-debut-in-june-primary/article_949b902c-92f5-5016-9990-7ffd3ea3bae8.html">ballot-marking system</a> for voters with disabilities during the state primaries in June. Officials say the new system is a single unit with a video screen and a built-in ballot printer with a controller attached. It will offer voters an audio and a visual ballot. That will allow voters to make their choices by touching the screen or using the controller, which has shaped and colored buttons with Braille labels.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>: Six months after launching <strong>online voter registration</strong> Pennsylvania is getting ready to hit the 100,000 mark. Late last week the online system had seen 91,000 users and officials in the Department of State expected to hit the 100K milestone some time this week.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: The South Carolina Election Commission is seeking $41.5 million to <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article60284976.html">replace the state’s 12-year-old voting system</a>. “We’re still confident in our current voting system,” Election Commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told <em>The State</em>.</p>
<p>But, Whitmire added, the voting machines are kind of like a family car — it’s not a good idea to wait until it breaks down to start the search for a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The Capital Journal has an article about a Pierre couple who founded BPro, a company that produces <a href="http://www.capjournal.com/news/pierre-company-making-splash-on-election-nights-throughout-country/article_04238950-d600-11e5-8334-5737122fb7c6.html">TotalVote</a> a software that takes raw elections results and reports them on websites and to the media. The software is at work in South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Hawaii, New Mexico and Oregon as well as Sacramento County, California and 11 Minnesota counties.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong>: Smith County has launched the <a href="http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Elections/231355/smith-county-electionsoffers-new-online-tool-for-voters">Interactive ExpressPass Sample Ballots</a> program on its website that allows voters to input their information and pull up the exact sample ballot they will see at the voting booth. This is the second time the county has used the program. “We thought it would be important to use this feature for the primary,” Karen Nelson, Smith County elections administrator told the <em>Tyler Morning Telegraph</em>. “So many voters are using online forums more and more, and it’s a good way for the voter to be a part of the ballot before they cast their vote.”</p></p>

							<h2>Availble Funding/Partnerships</h2>
														<p><strong>IX. Available Funding/Partnerships</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for Proposals for Guest Posts on Youth &amp; Political Engagement<br /></strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/">The Monkey Cage</a>, a blog of <em>The Washington Post</em> that uses social science theory and evidence to “make some sense of the circus that is politics” is partnering with <a href="http://civicyouth.org/">CIRCLE</a> to publish 10 articles on youth voting and political engagement. The partnership is funded by a grant from the Democracy Fund.</p>
<p>We are looking for articles on youth and political engagement accessible to a broad audience. We seek contributions from political scientists and scholars in other relevant fields at all stages in their careers. The majority of selected articles will be posted before the end of the 2016 calendar year; however, we are open to proposals that use data collected in 2016 for posting in the first half of 2017.</p>
<p>A proposal&nbsp;should be a short explanation of the topic, the argument, the main evidence, and the audience for the proposed article. In keeping with the mission of The Monkey Cage, the article should focus on the research and evidence and not engage in policy or partisan advocacy — as one might in a traditional op-ed.</p>
<p>We will invite some people who submitted proposals to draft full articles. The Monkey Cage and CIRCLE will make a final decision about publication based on the full drafts, considering these criteria:</p>
<p>Focus on young people under 30 years of age in the U.S. (required);</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses research question related to elections, public policy, or governance at any level;</li>
<li>Clear explanation of the quantitative or qualitative data used;</li>
<li>Evidence of rigorous research/analysis;</li>
<li>Accessibility, i.e. potential for the content to be effective as journalism;</li>
<li>Timeliness, i.e. at least some relevance to current public conversations about politics;</li>
<li>Discussion of possible implications for practice and/or policy; and</li>
<li>Diversity among the proposals selected to contribute</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals are due by midnight ET on March 2, 2016. To propose an article, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-AlntqEoNkisa3kWwpSUdp0YlY5zmBo-HV0DOWcs8CM/viewform">use this form</a>.</p>
