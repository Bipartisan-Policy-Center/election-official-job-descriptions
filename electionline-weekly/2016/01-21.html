							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Increasing voter turnout is not simple<br /></strong><em>CACEO panel discussion looks at what California can do</em></p>
<p>By Ed Coghlan<br /><a href="http://www.cafwd.org/">California Forward</a></p>
<p>There is no silver bullet to solve California’s voter turnout woes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://caceo.memberclicks.net/login?servId=1461">California Association of Clerks and Election Officials</a> (CACEO) and UCLA sponsored a discussion on the topic &#8212; <a href="https://caceo.memberclicks.net/caceo-panel-discussion-video">Voting in California Reimagining What’s Possible</a>, which was held at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs.</p>
<p>Utilizing technology better would help, but there’s more to the turnout issue.</p>
<p>“Voter alienation won’t be eliminated by using technology,” said Dave Bryan, KCBS/KCAL political reporter who moderated the panel.</p>
<p>UCLA Political Science Chair Jeffrey Lewis, PhD agreed.</p>
<p>“More people will vote in the GOP Presidential Primary, and it won’t be because of technology,” Lewis said, referring to the impact that Donald Trump has had on voter interest in the 2016 Presidential election.</p>
<p>There was also mention of desultory voting turnout among young people. In 2014, a year when only <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/02/11/california-2014-voter-turnout-was-even-worse-than-you-thought/">42 percent of California registered voters actually cast ballots</a>, the numbers among young people were much worse. Only 8.2 percent of Californians 18-24 voted in the election.</p>
<p>KNBC Political Reporter Conan Nolan drew a laugh when he mentioned that voter turnout among young people will be significantly higher in California in 2016 because a marijuana legalization initiative will be on the ballot.</p>
<p>Nolan’s observation made some sense. &nbsp;Voters need to care.</p>
<p>Orange County Registrar of Voters (and CACEO President) <a href="https://www.ocvote.com/about/about-neal/">Neal Kelley</a> pointed out that California turnout is higher when there’s something that inspires them to vote.</p>
<p>He mentioned <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_187,_Illegal_Aliens_Ineligible_for_Public_Benefits_%281994%29">California Proposition 187</a>, a 1994 initiative which was designed to prohibit undocumented citizens from using health care, education and other services, as well as the 2008 <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_8,_the_%22Eliminates_Right_of_Same-Sex_Couples_to_Marry%22_Initiative_%282008%29">Proposition 8</a> which addressed same-sex marriage, as years when turnout was more brisk.</p>
<p>But election after election, turnout has been dropping.</p>
<p>KNBC’s Nolan called for more civics education in California schools that drew the applause of some of the one hundred plus people who braved a chilly night in Los Angeles to attend the two-hour event.</p>
<p>“Citizenship is learned,” he said. “We can do better.”</p>
<p>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla pointed out that Placer County is the state’s top location for young voter turnout.&nbsp; The Registrar told Padilla that the county office makes it a point to go to schools and promote the idea of voting.</p>
<p>As a result of the passage of the New Motor Voter act, it will now be easier to register to vote in California, but that’s only half the battle.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to get them to register but harder to get them to vote,” said Orange County’s Kelley.</p>
<p>Getting them vote, yes that’s the challenge.</p>
<p>California Senate Bill 450, which authorizes a county to conduct any election as an all-mailed ballot election if certain conditions are satisfied, including conditions related to ballot drop-off locations and ten-day polling vote centers, was getting lots of positive response.</p>
<p>Padilla and Kelley both promoted its passage.</p>
<p>A similar model has been implemented in Colorado and voting turnout has increased around 5 percent.</p>
<p>Two other areas spawned some interesting debate.</p>
<p><strong>Should we incentivize people to vote?<br /></strong>Christopher Hecht, a data analytics expert, opined that maybe offering a lottery prize to those who vote might spur more interest, which met strong opposition from Matt Masterson, U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner.</p>
<p>“If we have to incentivize people to vote, we have failed,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>What about online voting?<br /></strong>While voting integrity and security issues were predictably discussed, there were different opinions.</p>
<p>KNBC’s Nolan said he hoped it never happened.</p>
<p>“Going to the ballot box reminds you that you are part of a community, he said.</p>
<p>UCLA’s Dr. Lewis thinks online voting will happen, but he’s not happy.</p>
<p>“I’m in the buggy behind the horse,” he laughed. “It’s lamentable, but it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Masterson admitted that online voting presents some challenges, but he thinks we’ll eventually vote online. The concept of community has changed too.</p>
<p>“Facebook is a community, now,” he said.</p>
<p>The spirited discussion didn’t land on one solution, but the need for using technology to enhance the process was obvious.</p>
<p>“We need technology,” said Kelley. ”We are at a dangerous point right now and need to refresh our voting systems the right way.”</p>
<p>Padilla indicated the need to trying a number of things.</p>
<p>“There’s no one way to provide options,” he said.</p>
<p>For democracies to work, elected leaders need to be responsive and representative, and voters must be able to hold elected officials accountable for results. Democratic integrity requires an electoral process that empowers voters and gives candidates and incumbents the incentives to listen and lead.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Five towns in North Carolina are <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article55722610.html">taking a mulligan on 2015 elections</a>. According to the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>, the State Board of Elections ruled this week in favor of municipal election challenges in Benson, Trinity, Lumberton, Pembroke and Ahoskie. In each of those towns, a second-place town council candidate complained of possible election law violations that could have cost them the election.
</li>
<li>Brad Nelson, director of elections in Pima County recently wrote to both the local Republican and Democrat party asking to <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/012016_election_count/gop-dems-nix-county-bid-cancel-hand-count-presidential-primary/">cancel the county’s hand count</a> of ballots for the presidential primary because the hand count would be required to take place over the Easter weekend. According to the <em>Tucson Sentinel</em>, state law requires a hand count of a random sample of precincts after elections, to double-check the machine tally of ballots, a loophole in the statute would allow the county to call off the verification if the two political parties did not nominate members to take part in the count. “I would respectfully ask that you both consider not having your party participate in the hand count audit so that the holiday weekend is not impacted. It&#8217;s your call and whatever you decide, my office will be ready to accommodate that decision,” Nelson wrote. Leadership for both parties denied the request.
</li>
<li>DataHaven, a data collection agency that interprets and collects public data has updated a 2011 Rock the Vote scorecard that ranked Connecticut 48th out of 51 jurisdictions (or a score of 4.2 out of a possible 21). The update gives the state a score of 11.2 and <a href="http://wtnh.com/2016/01/14/new-survey-reveals-improvements-in-states-voting-access/">credits election reforms like online voter registration and Election Day registration for the improvement</a>. “Online and Election Day Registration have been huge successes but there’s more we must do. Connecticut can and will be a model to the nation for ease of voting and civic participation,” said Secretary of State Denise Merrill.
</li>
<li>There are college poll workers and high school poll workers and in Rutherford County, Tennessee they want to add <a href="http://www.dnj.com/story/news/2016/01/18/rutherford-county-teachers-sought-poll-workers/78958170/">teachers to the list of poll workers</a>. With schools already scheduled to be closed for three election days in 2016, Elections Administrator Alan Farley told the <em>Daily News Journal</em> that teachers and school staff are perfect for the job of poll worker. Not only will teachers get the $120 poll worker payment but they may also be eligible for in-service credit. I see an&nbsp;opportunity for teachers who want to earn a little money on the side, but I think they&#8217;ll learn something,&#8221; county schools director Don Odom said. &#8220;I think it really is an opportunity to go back and see the process firsthand.&#8221;
</li>
<li>While the supporters of instant runoff voting in Maine might not think this is pretty cool, from an elections geek standpoint, it is. According to the <em>Bangor Daily News</em>, law changes made after an 1880 standoff that could have led to a civil war may sink an effort to implement ranked choice voting. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap says <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2016/01/20/the-point/how-an-1880-maine-insurrection-could-sink-ranked-choice-voting/?ref=moreInstate">ranked choice voting likely conflicts with the Maine Constitution</a>, which was changed in 1880 to say that a governor could be elected with a plurality — and not necessarily a majority — of votes.

														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>The final meeting of a task force appointed to study <a href="http://www.annistonstar.com/news/lawmakers-to-push-for-ex-felon-voting-rights/article_94e1d3e8-bf08-11e5-9bb2-97ab9cdf07c2.html">voting rights of ex-felons</a> met this week and is preparing to vote on recommendations for restoring the vote to some former inmates. The task force will make those recommendations to the state legislature.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska: </strong>Supporters of a statewide ballot initiative to <a href="http://www.alaskapublic.org/2016/01/14/pfd-voter-initiative-nets-needed-signatures-for-ballot/">tie voter registration in with PFD applications</a> has met the signature threshold to make an upcoming ballot. Initiative supporters gained the signatures of 42,000 voters—about twice the required number to make the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: A pair of bills have been reintroduced for the 2016 session that would make it all but impossible for voter-outreach groups to collect and drop off early ballots. The proposals would make it a felony for anyone but a family member, roommate, caregiver, postal worker or candidate to collect early ballots from another person in an act sometimes called <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/lawmakers-introduce-bills-outlawing-early-ballot-collection/article_fa76c4f0-7968-5823-9df6-e4966fc23f36.html">&#8220;ballot harvesting.&#8221;</a></p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: A Senate committee postponed debate and the first vote on a public records exemption that would <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/senate-panel-approves-bill-keeping-voters-information-secret/2262024">make secret the names, addresses, birthdates, and email addresses of all registered voters</a> on Florida&#8217;s statewide voter database.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: By a 4 to 1 vote, the Gwinnett County board of registration and elections voted against <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/gwinnett-rejects-call-for-spanish-ballots/np7zC/">providing ballots in Spanish</a>. Chair Alice O’Lenick said the county doesn’t have enough information to determine on its own whether it should provide bilingual ballots and voting materials. She said the board must wait for direction from the state or federal officials or a court.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: By an 85-56 vote, the Maryland General Assembly voted to override Gov. Larry Hogan’s veto of 2015 legislation that restored the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-veto-overrides-20160120-story.html">voting rights to ex-felons</a> as soon as they leave prison. The veto must also face a Senate override vote, but it is expected to pass.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann has proposed a <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/19/hosemann-election-reform/78998070/">laundry list of election reform</a> for the Magnolia state including implementing online voter registration and offering early voting. &#8220;It is time to address outdated and inefficient election laws which have, in some cases, been on the books for decades,&#8221; Hosemann said on Tuesday, releasing his proposals with a Capitol press conference. &#8220;These proposals make it easier to cast your ballot, harder for someone to cheat the electorate and provide severe penalties for those who do.&#8221; The reforms are based largely on recommendations from a bipartisan election reform task force Hosemann created.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: Sen. Rob Schaaf (R-St. Joseph) has introduced a bill that would <a href="http://www.stjoechannel.com/news/local-news/schaaf-restore-voting-rights-to-felons">restore the voting rights to ex-felons</a> who are on probation or parole. Under Bill 924, voting rights would restore to all ex-felons except those who have committed voter fraud.</p>
<p>Also in Missouri, the latest <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voter-id-bill-wins-initial-approval-in-missouri-house/article_76bf7558-6308-5e4f-9f85-3ef421671b99.html">voter ID</a> legislation won the first round of approval from the full House. The measure must go before the House one more time before moving on to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Two bills (House Bills 1265 and 151) have been introduced that would allow voters facing a ballot with multiple candidates to vote for more than one if they wish. In <a href="https://politics.concordmonitor.com/2016/01/politics-election/dont-want-to-vote-for-just-one-candidate-bills-would-allow-multiple-votes/">approval voting</a>, unlike instant runoff voting, the votes are all tallied equally and the person with the most votes wins.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: As part of his proposed budget plan, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) is calling for 12 days of <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/state/index.ssf/2016/01/cuomo_pitches_early_voting_before_elections_automatic_registration_of_drivers.html">early voting</a> and that all counties must provide one early voting site for every 50,000 residents. Cuomo also called on the legislature to approve automatic voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: Rep. Regina Goodwin (D-Tulsa) has filed House Bill 2277 that states that anyone convicted of a <a href="http://ktul.com/news/local/oklahoma-lawmaker-wants-to-clarify-state-law-involving-a-convicts-voting-rights-01-20-2016">felony could register to vote</a> after having “fully served” their sentenced “including any term of incarceration, parole or supervision.” Goodwin says the legislation clarifies some ambiguous language in the current law.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: Legislation has been introduced that would allow for <a href="http://nooga.com/172155/legislators-introduce-online-voter-registration-bill/">online voter registration</a> in Tennessee. Under the bill, anyone with an unexpired Tennessee driver’s license or personal ID card would be able to go to a state-run website and register to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Several <a href="http://pilotonline.com/news/government/virginia/attempts-to-expand-virginians-voting-rights-are-thwarted-in-general/article_d703e439-3c40-5a4d-91f6-c692ab215725.html">voting reform bills</a> were killed in committee this week including one bill to allow for universal <strong>early voting</strong> up to 21 days before a general election. Another bill that would have allowed voters 70 and older to <strong>automatically vote by absentee</strong> was also killed. The subcommittee also killed a bill that would have allowed young people to <strong>pre-register</strong> to vote at the age of 16.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: Sen. Kevin Ranker (D-Orcas Island) is co-sponsoring Senate Bill 6379 that will <a href="http://sanjuanislander.com/news-articles/government-news/state/20937/ranker-presses-for-automatic-voter-registration-for-eligible-voters">automatically register voters</a> who have enhanced driver’s licenses or commercial driver’s licenses, or who are covered through the state Health Benefits Exchange. Those with regular driver’s licenses will not be registered automatically because the state Department of Licensing does not require proof of citizenship or legal presence.</p>
<p>Also in Washington, Secretary of state Kim Wyman is sporting HB2707/SB6340 that were introduced with bipartisan support this week. Under the proposed legislation, <a href="http://1190kex.iheart.com/articles/portland-local-news-123543/bills-to-allow-17-year-old-14290494">17-year olds could pre-register</a> to vote in history and civics classes or at events coordinated by elections officials. Currently 171/2-year-olds can pre-register, but the new law would lower that to 17 and includes and education and social component.</p>

<p><strong>California: </strong>A California appeals court on Wednesday overturned voting fraud and perjury convictions for former Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon and his wife. The court ruled that the judge made errors in instructing the jury in the trial. The Appeals panel ordered the case sent back to the lower trial court. <span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br /> </span></p>

If Webb wins his case a special election could be called.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas: </strong>Shawnee County District Judge Franklin Theis ruled that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has <a href="http://ksn.com/2016/01/15/judge-kobach-had-no-authority-to-encumber-voting-in-kansas/">no legal right to bar people who register to vote using the federal</a> form from voting in local and state elections.
