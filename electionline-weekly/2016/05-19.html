							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Virginia Election Data Project</strong><br /><em>Project provides tool to ID strengths and challenges in local elections offices</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org?subject=Rights%20restoration">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>This week, the <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/">Virginia Department of Elections</a> released the Virginia Election Data Project, a cooperative effort between the department and local registrars with assistance from <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/election-initiatives">The Pew Charitable Trusts Election Initiatives</a>.</p>
<p>The project analyzes election and voter data provided to the Department by local election offices and presents the data visualized in a <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/dataproject">user-friendly online format</a>.</p>
<p>“Like most election offices, we house a huge amount of data,” explained Edgardo Cortes, commissioner of elections. “While much of it is personal information that needs to be kept securely, there are ways we can be transparent about the data related to election processes to help the public understand election administration better.&nbsp;This is a way for us to use objective data to improve how we administer elections by figuring out best practices and sharing them across the state.”</p>
<p>The department created a working group of local election officials to provide feedback and guidance during development of the project.&nbsp;The working group consisted of Tammy Alexander, electoral board member, City of Petersburg; April Cain, electoral board member, Henrico County; Lisa Jeffers, director of elections, City of Waynesboro; Bill Lewis, electoral board member, City of Hampton; Margaret Marcenelle, electoral board member, Mecklenburg County; John Nunnaly, electoral board member, Caroline County; Donna Patterson, general registrar, City of Virginia Beach; Greg Riddlemoser, director of elections, Stafford County; and Allison Robbins, director of elections, Wise County.</p>
<p>“This project provides a useful tool for identifying strengths and challenges in local election offices.&nbsp; We are building on the long history of working together as an election community to identify ways to better serve our voters,” Donna Patterson, City of Virginia Beach general registrar and a member of the working group, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The idea to partner with Pew came from Pew’s <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/data-visualizations/2014/elections-performance-index">Election Performance Index</a> and wanting to undertake a similar project but at the state level.</p>
<p>Before starting this project, the team at Pew knew that Virginia had exemplary election data and the state makes a lot of it available to the public on their website. But they also knew that making data public isn’t enough to influence policy change or inform the public.</p>
<p>“In Virginia’s case, unless someone had the software and skills to analyze the data that they posted to their website then it was not easy to interpret,” explained Heather Creek, research officer with Pew. “In order to make the data useful to local election officials, legislators, the media, and the public, Edgardo and James [Alcorn, chairman of the State Board of Elections] wanted to create interactive visuals to compare metrics over time and across jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>The technical assistance provided by Pew was free and the only costs involved for the department were the time and effort by existing staff.</p>
<p>The data gathered will help the department and general registrars prepare for November 2016 and beyond. The department and the SBE will use this data to identify general registrars with the best election administration practices and share them across the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think the most surprising was related to voter registration and how people are choosing to register,” Cortes said. “For the first time ever, voters are registering more through our online registration tool than through the DMV.&nbsp; That is a huge change in how Virginia voters interact with the process and is indicative of a shift to conducting election related transactions online.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data also shows registration activity is higher during the first part of this year than it was in 2012, suggesting the state needs to prepare for increased registration activity this year.</p>
<p>Cortes added that the apparent shift to online transactions is definitely bringing changes to local elections offices and will lead to how offices are staffed, how file systems are maintained, and other election office operations.</p>
<p>Creek said that review election administration within a state can tell a more nuanced story about what’s happening.</p>
<p>“For instance, in the EAVS the state reports the number of absentee ballots that were cast, but their system also includes data on the date that an absentee ballot request was received from a potential voter and the date that the local elections staff processed that request and mailed the ballot,” Creek explained. “By knowing the variation in absentee ballot processing times across jurisdictions, the state can learn from the practices of the most efficient jurisdictions and offer guidance to jurisdictions that might need support.”</p>
<p>While Pew is working with several other states to assess their local election data, develop metrics that will help them make policy and administrative decisions, and visualize the data in a way that makes it transparent to the public and useable by local election officials, this is the first project that has been publicly released.</p>
<p>“Some states that we’re working with already have a well-organized, central election database and just need some guidance on the process of developing and visualizing metrics,” Creek said. “Other states have asked us to work with them on evaluating their election data to identify areas where they can standardize data collection practices across their local jurisdictions and improve data management and reporting as a precursor to developing useable metrics.”</p>
<p>Creek said Pew is open to discussing this work with any state that is interested, whatever the nature of their election data.</p>
<p>“Analyzing and visualizing election data has a number of benefits. Tracking metrics over time creates a baseline so that officials can measure the impact of policy and budget changes. They can also identify potential problem areas and head them off before they become crises (or lawsuits),” Creek said.</p>
<p>This type of project can inform conversations between election officials and legislators, as well as local budget authorities, so that policy and budgets are evidence-based. It is also a tool, Creek noted, that empowers local election officials, many of which do not have the staff or software to conduct regular data analysis, to track trends in their jurisdictions. They can use this data to evaluate their administrative operations, increase efficiency, and improve customer service.</p>
<p>And Cortes would recommend it to any state that is not already analyzing their data at this level.</p>
<p>“Election offices should find creative ways to use the data they have available to inform the public and policy makers about election administration and increase transparency to help build confidence in the election process,” Cortes said.</p>

							<h2>Primary Roundup</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Roundup</strong><br />Voters went to the polls (and mailboxes) for primaries in three states this week. In Idaho it was a local/statewide primary, in Kentucky, it was the Democrats turn to choose a presidential nominee and in Oregon, everything was on the table for both political parties at the local, state and federal level. Also, the April 26 primary in Maryland isn’t quite over yet.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho</strong><br />Voters in Idaho went to the polls on Tuesday to vote in numerous state and local races and turnout was low, as predicted with officials in Ada County expecting no more than <a href="http://www.khq.com/story/31996897/the-latest-voters-begin-trickling-in-for-idaho-primary">17 percent turnout</a>.</p>
<p>KTVB took a <a href="http://www.ktvb.com/news/politics/elections/behind-the-scenes-look-into-election-day-1/199556853">behind the scenes</a> look at what happens on primary day in Boise, something they may not have been able to do if it was busier!</p>
<p>Things got so slow, at one Boise polling place, an election worker stood outside the site <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/fa84e3925c174dd183a4fee8fb09f05f/ID--Election-Idaho-The-Latest">wearing a cardboard voting booth</a> and waving at passing drivers encouraging them to vote.</p>
<p>Ada County put <a href="http://www.ktvb.com/news/politics/elections/frustrations-over-learning-curve-with-accessible-voting-machines/202546986">new voting machines</a> to the test on Tuesday and there were no reported problems with the functionality of the machines, although one disabled voter did express his frustrations with the new system.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong><br />Other than the <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/polling-places-open-on-rainy-election-day/article_24dc231a-3c51-5eff-976f-a2398daa8b0a.html">rainy weather</a>, things went relatively well on Tuesday in the Bluegrass State — even if we don’t yet have an official winner (at press time anyway). Turnout across the state was <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article78034812.html">slow, but steady</a> and there were few reported problems.</p>
<p>Despite few officially reported problems, the state’s <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/31996750/calls-to-kentucky-election-fraud-line-up-sharply-from-last-may">election fraud hotline</a> received 76 complaints and questions from 31 counties. A third of those calls came from Jefferson County. Some of the calls were about voting machines, others were complaints about campaign activities too close to polling places and some were complaints about vote buying.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong><br />Voters went to the mailbox in Oregon in Tuesday and at press time it appeared would <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/05/oregon_primary_ballots_on_pace.html">top 1 million</a>, it was not a record breaking turnout. Since Oregon is all <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/what-its-like-casting-a-ballot-in-a-state-that-takes-voting-seriously-20160517">vote-by-mail</a>, there are few, if any reports of problems on voting day, but there were some issues leading up to the election and on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a ballot box in <a href="http://www.bendbulletin.com/home/4330172-151/klamath-county-ballot-box-broken-into">Klamath County</a> was broken into and the ballots were thrown into a nearby dumpster. There were about 240 ballots in the box at the time of the break-in. The recovered ballots were all in good shape and able to be counted. Klamath County <a href="http://www.heraldandnews.com/news/turnout-breaks-percent-in-klamath-county/article_e2fb2a75-f427-5c3e-a6a4-ae9fd2e793c3.html">turnout</a> broke the 60 percent mark.</p>
<p>Officials in <a href="http://theworldlink.com/news/local/coos-county-uses-new-technology-for-ballots/article_5d7d6295-4fbb-506f-bc11-4b65a1581486.html">Coos County</a> were testing the new Clear Ballot voting system on Tuesday. The system cost the county about $11,200 and officials were excited about the prospects of the new system ultimately lowering costs. &#8220;We have been able to reduce a few of the &#8216;hands on&#8217; steps by our election crew, which reduces the time it takes to process the ballots, increases the efficiency and will ultimately reduce our election costs,” County Clerk Terri Turi told The World</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/4332688-151/grant-county-government-phones-internet-down-on-election">Grant County</a>, the county’s phone and Internet were down during the morning hours leaving voters with no local contact for questions or concerns about the election. Apparently an employee opened an email with malware, which lead to the shutdown. Both phone and Internet were back up and running by lunch time.</p>
<p>And on the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/05/oregon_secretary_of_state_winn.html">secretary of state front</a>, Republican Dennis Richardson, a senator and former candidate for governor won the GOP nomination for the state’s top elections job and on the Democrat side it is Brad Avakian, the state’s labor commissioner who will represent the other side of the ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong><br />Late last week, the Maryland State Board of Elections <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-decertifies-baltimore-election-results-investigates-irregularities/2016/05/12/fca6e128-1861-11e6-9e16-2e5a123aac62_story.html">decertified the results of the April 26 primary in Baltimore</a>. State Elections Administrator Linda H. Lamone said the number of ballots cast in the April 26 contest was hundreds more than the number of voters who checked in at polling places. The state also identified 80 provisional ballots that hadn’t been considered.</p>
<p>On Monday, a team of city, state and county canvassers began a precinct-by-precinct review of the ballots cast last month.</p>
<p>According to WJZ, election officials suspect that in some precincts, <a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/05/16/officials-still-working-on-baltimore-citys-primary-election-audit/">provisional ballots were mistakenly scanned and included in the precinct’s vote count</a>. Provisional ballots are given to voters whose names aren’t listed in the precinct registers.</p>
<p>The SBE has opened some of the audit to the <a href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2016/05/17/press-gets-a-limited-peek-at-review-of-baltimores-bobbled-primary/">media</a>, mayoral candidate Shelia Dixon filed suit in a Baltimore court seeking to have the <a href="http://www.wbal.com/article/164195/124/in-court-filing-sheila-dixon-demands-more-transparency-from-elections-officials">audit entirely open to the media and general public</a>.</p></p>

<li>And then there were five. This week Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill announced that work to streamline the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles will also allow the DMV to <a href="http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/State-Unveils-First-of-its-Kind-Automatic-Voter-Registration-Plan-379835671.html">automatically register people to vote</a>. It will take two years to fully implement, but will not require legislation, which can be a lengthy process. &#8220;This is a monumental event enhancing voting rights and opportunity in Connecticut, and a continuation of our rigorous efforts to bring new voters onto the rolls,” Merrill <a href="http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-motor-voter-0518-20160517-story.html">said in a statement</a>. “This agreement also puts Connecticut alongside a vanguard of states that are leading the nation in the movement to register every eligible citizen. This is a proud day for our state, and I wish to thank Commissioner Bzdyra and his staff for their commitment.&#8221; Needless to say, there is <a href="http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-motor-voter-backlash-20160518-story.html">grumbling in the Legislature</a>.

<li>Montana Secretary of State Linda McCulloch announced that <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2016/05/17/satellite-offices-set-tribes-state-says/84512360/">13 early voting offices have been established on Indian reservations</a> in nine counties in advance of the June 7 primary. “For many rural and low-income tribal members, the distance for such a visit can be expensive and a serious burden,” McCulloch told the <em>Great Falls Tribune.</em> “These voting offices help solve this problem.”
</li>
<li>New Mexico Auditor Tim Keller has released a report saying that the secretary of state’s office has <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/774974/auditor-elections-are-chronically-under-budgeted-by-secretary-of-state.html">chronically under-budgeted for elections for a decade</a>. In his report, Keller said that under-budgeting has led to the need for $25 million in emergency loans, grants and special appropriations. Current Secretary of State Brad Winter told the <em>Albuquerque Journal</em> that the problem is not under-budgeting, but that the office is underfunded.
</li>
<li>Finding a large, secure and most importantly dry <a href="http://salisburyindependent.net/wicomico-news/library-culver-dispute-store-voting-machines/">location to store voting equipment</a> isn’t always easy and things have gotten downright testy in Wicomico County, Maryland where the county executive and the public library board are bickering over the storage of the county’s voting machines. According to the <em>Salisbury Independent,</em> County Executive Bob Culver wants to store the county’s 34 voting machines in the library’s basement, but a portion of that area is used for programming for an entrepreneurial center. “He can take us to court. We will continue to refuse,” Rick Keenan, who heads the library’s board, told the paper. “This is just an unconscionable appropriation of space.”
</li>
<li>In the ongoing <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160517/aclu-requests-information-from-county-clerks-on-online-voter-registration">battle over online voter registration</a> in two West Virginia counties, this week the American Civil Liberties Union filed a FOIA request asking the clerks of Kanawha and Cabell counties to provide, among other things, all policies and procedures or internal communications regarding the number of voters who tried to vote but were unable to cast a ballot on May 10 or during early voting; information regarding the number of voters who tried to register online to vote and information regarding how many provisional ballots were cast for the primary election.

<li>I scream! You scream! We all scream for…<a href="http://www.wral.com/ben-jerry-push-to-register-voters-in-north-carolina/15708894/">voting rights ice cream</a>? This week, Ben &amp; Jerry’s co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were in North Carolina to unveil a new flavor of ice cream—Empower Mint. The flavor is part of the company’s Democracy is in your Hands campaign that includes scoop shops across the country installing voter registration kiosks. Cohen and Greenfield chose North Carolina as the launching point for the ice cream because of the changes to the state’s voting laws. &#8220;Since our country&#8217;s inception, many brave Americans have battled to expand voting rights and voter access for African-Americans, for women and young people, but the recent passage of restrictive policies in North Carolina takes our country backwards,&#8221; Cohen said in a statement.

<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> Bucking a trend, the city of Bethel has voted to stick with precinct-based polling sites instead of moving to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/15/bethel-to-keep-polling-stations-instead-of-mail-in/">vote-by-mail</a>. Councilmembers voting against the proposal expressed concerns that it could lead to voter fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> A Senate committee has approved legislation that could make Illinois only the sixth state to <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/Illinois-Senate-panel-advances-automatic-voter-7678567.php">automatically register voters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Senate has approved legislation that will move Minnesota from a caucus system to a <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/politics/4031601-minnesota-senate-approves-move-presidential-primary">presidential primary system beginning in 2020</a>.

<p><strong>National News</strong>: Robert Barnes with <em>The Washington Pos</em>t has a look at the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2008 decision in support of Indiana’s voter ID law. During a recent discussion with Justice Elena Kagan at the judicial conference of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit former Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote the lead opinion in the court’s 6-3 ruling on the law expressed his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/stevens-says-supreme-court-decision-on-voter-id-was-correct-but-maybe-not-right/2016/05/15/9683c51c-193f-11e6-9e16-2e5a123aac62_story.html">regrets about the ruling</a>. “I learned a lot of things outside the record that made me very concerned about that statute,” Stevens said in the conversation with Kagan and Wood. “So I had the question: Should I rely on my own research or what’s in the record?” “And I thought in that case I had a duty to confine myself to what the record did prove, and I thought it did not prove the plaintiffs’ case. And as a result, we ended up with a fairly unfortunate decision.”</p>
