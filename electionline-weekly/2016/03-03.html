							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Signs of the super things to come?</strong><br /> <em>Voters headed to the polls in record numbers this week for Super Tuesday</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>Although absentee ballots are still arriving from overseas and provisional ballots are still being verified, for voters, depending on where they lived and which party they voted for, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/03/02/468918065/republican-super-tuesday-turnout">Super Tuesday, was indeed super in some places, in others, it was just meh</a>.</p>
<p>And for elections officials, who no doubt think every election is super, Tuesday’s contests in the nine states holding primaries (Alaska-GOP, America Samoa-Dems, Colorado and Minnesota all held caucuses), were a mixed bag as well with some jurisdictions registering few if any problems and others being forced to apologize for long lines and delayed results.</p>
<p>In the newsletter last week, we mentioned 10 things that we would be keeping any eye on this week and while there were issues with almost all 10, there were no systematic problems. Here’s a rundown of how Super Tuesday played out in the nine states, but before we get to that, we think <a href="http://www.stwnewspress.com/news/chaotic-day-closes-for-payne-county-election-board/article_1d3becc0-e02d-11e5-b157-e77a83716146.html">Payne County, Oklahoma</a> Assistant Secretary of Elections Dondee Klein best summed up how elections officials felt on Tuesday when she spoke to the Stillwater News Press late on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>“Thursday’s for being tired,” Klein told the paper and then from somewhere in the room someone added, “And margaritas on Friday!”</p>
<p><strong>Alabama<br /></strong>This biggest news out of Alabama, was there was no news. The state rolled out its voter photo ID for the first time during a presidential election and at press time, we found no reports of voters experiencing any issues with lack of or type of idea.</p>
<p>The day was not without issues though. Throughout much of the day, the state’s voter website, <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/alabamavotesgov_slammed_by_hig.html">AlabamaVotes.gov</a> experienced slow-down problems as it struggled to keep up with the traffic of a <a href="http://www.waaytv.com/appnews/alabama-sets-record-for-primary-turnout/article_7b755508-e0bc-11e5-a163-6b3053217683.html">record-setting primary</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.waaytv.com/appnews/alabama-sets-record-for-primary-turnout/article_7b755508-e0bc-11e5-a163-6b3053217683.html">Gadsden</a>, a man was arrested outside of a polling place for yelling at voters and using abusive language.</p>
<p>Mother Nature couldn’t put a damper on things in <a href="http://www.wtvm.com/story/31357503/voting-continues-in-green-hill-despite-power-outage">Lauderdale County</a> when storms caused power outages for about an hour a one polling place. Approximately 200 voters were able to successfully cast their ballots when the power was out.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2016/03/01/voting-machine-problems-reported/81156402/">Montgomery County</a>, there were reports of voting machine malfunctions at two precincts during the early morning voting hours, but voters were able to continue voting using other machines.</p>
<p>On election night, <a href="http://www.wbrc.com/story/31369085/madison-county-voting-issuesdelays-explained">Madison County</a> experienced technical difficulties that kept the full results from being available until close to 11:30 p.m. According to the county Elections Administrator Frank Barger, there was an issue with conveying election results onto the digital platforms used by the website.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong><br />Several counties launched vote centers for the first time this week and four counties pilot tested new voting systems and according to published reports, there were few, if any problems with either.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/mar/02/state-sees-a-few-glitches-at-polls-2016-1/">Pulaski County</a>, some of the batteries used for voting machines had to be replaced sooner than expected and some polling places ran out of ballots late in the day. Voters were instructed to use the electronic voting machines.</p>
<p>There were <a href="http://www.4029tv.com/news/voters-deal-with-confusion-over-voter-id-law/38310378">reports</a> of <a href="http://katv.com/news/local/poll-workers-demanding-voter-id-reported-in-at-least-4-counties">voter ID issues in at least four counties in Arkansas</a>. According to KHBS, a voter in <a href="http://www.4029tv.com/news/fort-smith-voter-turned-away-for-not-having-an-id/38285574">Sebastian County</a> was turned away for not having an ID, but Election Commissioner Meghan Hassler told the television station that it was a mistake on the part of the poll worker. Hassler told the station that the turned away voter did come back to cast their ballot.</p>
<p>Results were delayed in <a href="http://5newsonline.com/2016/03/02/crawford-county-voting-machine-glitch-backs-up-election-results/">Crawford County</a> due to a glitch in the machinery that kept volunteers counting ballots until 3 a.m. And in <a href="http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/new-poll-workers-longer-ballot-contributed-election-reporting-delays-soffer-said">Jefferson County</a>, officials blamed the results delay on new poll workers and long ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong><br />Record-breaking early voting numbers in the Peach State did not diminish the number of voters that showed up on Super Tuesday. In <a href="http://wrbl.com/2016/03/01/lee-county-voter-turnout-shocking-poll-workers/">Lee County</a>, poll workers were shocked by the voter turnout saying that they had never seen that many voters at a primary before.</p>
<p>Voters in one <a href="http://www.wtoc.com/story/31355081/glitch-causes-voter-frustration-at-northeast-atlanta-polling-place">Atlanta-area</a> polling place expressed concerns when they were given paper ballots to use instead of being able to use one of the electronic voting machines. According to the precinct manager,&nbsp;the machines were programmed for the wrong precinct. So voters had a choice. They could either stay and vote on paper or they could come back later.</p>
<p>Officials in Gwinnett County are investigating reports that <a href="http://www.wtoc.com/story/31365577/gwinnett-county-poll-workers-investigated-for-alleged-racial-mistreatment">Latino voters may have been mistreated</a> at one of the county’s polling places.</p>
<p>Although they were done before the 11 p.m. news, results were delayed in <a href="http://www.macon.com/news/politics-government/election/article63576047.html">Macon-Bibb</a> and local elections officials chalked that up to heavy turnout and new precinct managers.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts</strong><br />The <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2016/03/01/super-tuesday-voter-turnout-massachusetts-projected-smash-presidential-primary-records/hA2o058KbN1MC9D6Nyf96M/story.html">probable record turnout</a> in Massachusetts was punctuated with <a href="http://www.enterprisenews.com/news/20160301/want-ballot-in-bridgewater-might-cost-you-back-rub">back rubs</a> and <a href="http://www.gazettenet.com/news/townbytown/amherst/21326798-95/amherst-voters-weigh-in-on-candidates-bake-sale-awaits-hungry-electorate">bake sales</a>, but probably the biggest news coming out of the Commonwealth on Tuesday was whether or not former President Clinton violated state <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/01/did-bill-clinton-violate-election-rules-mass/5octlX1d28GwmN3kitiECK/story.html">electioneering laws</a> — he did not, barely.</p>
<p>Aside from that, things went relatively smoothly despite large crowds of voters at some polling locations. New voting machines in <a href="http://wareham.wickedlocal.com/news/20160301/early-voting-turnout-heavy-in-wareham-new-voting-machines-working-well">Wareham</a> did well, although some voters in <a href="http://carver.wickedlocal.com/news/20160301/carver-turns-out-in-large-numbers-to-back-trump-and-sanders">Carver</a> were confused about the process and who they could/couldn’t vote for in the primary.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/primary-voting-smooth-for-latinos-at-city-polling-site/article_15e0c25c-2f5c-5dbe-abd1-36e6b41749bf.html">Salem</a> where Hispanic voters had recently complained about hostility at the polls, things seemed to be professional and congenial on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong><br />According to the Oklahoma State Election Board, turnout in the Sooner State was 39.5 percent which is a <a href="http://kfor.com/2016/03/02/officials-super-tuesday-breaks-oklahoma-record-for-voter-turnout/">record for a presidential preference primary</a>. And those big numbers of course created lines at some polling places.</p>
<p>The day did not start off well in <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/elections/multiple-tulsa-precincts-experience-voting-device-malfunctions-tuesday-morning/article_fc282b59-22cf-552e-9eb5-f6479710c099.html">Tulsa</a> when voting machines did not function properly and some voters were incorrectly turned away from the polls. Assistant Elections Secretary Martha Bales said that poll workers had received the proper training and instructions on what to do in the event of a machine malfunction, but that one poll worker did not follow procedures. &#8220;Sometimes when they get out to the precincts, they just seem to forget some of the information,&#8221; she told Tulsa World.&nbsp;There were also issues in other Tulsa precincts that had been consolidated or moved from one location to another.</p>
<p>Some voters in <a href="http://okcfox.com/news/local/super-tuesday-some-edmond-voters-waiting-45-minutes">Edmond</a> reported waiting in line up to 45 minutes to cast their ballot, this was of course if they were able to find a place to park. According to Fox25, there were no complaints though, just voters happy to have their voices heard.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.kswo.com/story/31359272/sterling-voters-cast-ballots-in-the-dark">Sterling</a>, even though the entire town was without power, including the polling locations, voters still went to the polls in large numbers and were greeted by poll workers who used sunlight and flashlights as their guide.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong><br /><a href="http://www.wbir.com/news/local/long-lines-long-delays-super-tuesday-voting-issues/64940228">Heavy turnout</a> was the rule of the day in Tennessee following a record number of people turning out for early voting. And like other states many of the problems reported in Tennessee on Super Tuesday stemmed from turnout.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://wkrn.com/2016/03/01/dozens-still-in-line-to-vote-after-polls-close-in-hendersonville/">Hendersonville</a>, the polls remained open for hours after closing time in order to accommodate those in line. In <a href="http://franklinhomepage.com/franklin-precincts-seeing-lines-out-the-door-record-numbers-cms-24222#.VtiBCfkrJD9">Franklin</a>, lines were out the door at times as voters patiently waited, sometimes in the rain, to cast their ballots.</p>
<p><a href="http://wreg.com/2016/03/01/voters-frustrated-after-problems-at-the-polls/">Memphis</a> and Knoxville both experienced significant issues on Super Tuesday prompting the <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/long-lines-at-some-polls-on-primary-day-2d12ecaf-a1c9-36ba-e053-0100007f5fda-370850291.html">Knox County</a> elections administrator to say that he will ask for money and more election workers for November.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong><br />It only seems fitting that the largest state in the lower 48 also experienced the <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Tuesday-anything-but-super-for-some-Texas-voters-6866932.php">most problems</a> on Tuesday and most of those <a href="http://www.krgv.com/story/31371199/high-voter-turnout-impacts-voting-procedures">problems stemmed from large turnout</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.kvia.com/news/absent-poll-workers-lack-of-space-caused-long-voting-lines-at-mesita-elementary/38309318">El Paso County</a>, where long lines forced some voters to turn away before casting a ballot, County Elections Administrator Lisa Wise blamed some of the problems on lack of poll workers who called in sick. &#8220;I hate to hear that voters left because lines were too long and we&#8217;re really going to work with our judges on how to handle long lines,&#8221; Wise told a local television station.</p>
<p>Officials in <a href="http://www.kens5.com/story/news/2016/03/02/some-bexar-co-precints-were-unprepared-record-turnout-super-tuesday/81253430/">Bexar County</a>, <a href="http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/03/02/139831/long-lines-at-polling-locations-in-houston-on-super-tuesday/">Harris County</a> and <a href="http://www.dentonrc.com/local-news/politics-headlines/20160302-lingering-lines-keep-poll-sites-open-late.ece">Denton County</a> all experienced issues due to overwhelming turnout on Tuesday. In Denton County the polls were forced to stay open late in order to allow everyone in line to vote. In <a href="http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2016/03/gop-voters-overwhelm-north-dallas-polling-place-but-turnout-sparse-in-other-spots.html/">Dallas</a>, one GOP polling place ran out of ballots due to demand whereas other Dallas-area polling places saw light turnout.</p>
<p>Although county officials run the party primaries in Texas, it’s up to the parties to choose polling locations and that caused some issues for voters in <a href="http://www.kristv.com/story/31359232/new-polling-places-pose-challenges-for-some-voters">Nueces County</a>.</p>
<p>Vote centers in <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2016-03-01/long-lines-hold-voting-results-lubbock-county">Lubbock County</a> performed well on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Due to a late opening, one polling place in <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/elections/weslaco-voting-hiccup-will-delay-closing-polls-in-one-location/article_bc16cb1e-dfd1-11e5-852e-dff4733090bb.html">Hidalgo County</a> was ordered to stay open.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/official-wilco-machines-working-fine-despite-radio/nqbjB/">Williamson County</a> officials struggled to dispel rumors about vote flipping. The county did not receive any complaints from voters or poll workers, but people reporting that their vote was flipped called into a local radio station to report the issues.</p>
<p>Some counties like <a href="http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Elections/232036/smith-county-elections-results-delayed-by-record-turnout">Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.myplainview.com/news/article_1bda741a-e031-11e5-96fa-0f5ba261de36.html">Hale</a> cited the large turnout and lines for the reason why results were delayed on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>And because there is always one person who wants to cause a scene simply because they can, one voter create some issues in a Houston-area polling place when he came in with what <a href="http://www.khou.com/story/news/local/2016/03/03/man-says-wearing-empty-holster-polling-place-silent-protest/81253182/">turned out be an empty gun holster</a>. The voter, who was also a Republican election judge, said he wore the empty holster in protest since he cannot bring his gun into a polling place.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong><br />Although turnout was high, it wasn’t record-breaking in the home state of candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and Secretary of State Jim Condos reported that there were <a href="http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/view/story/106a4af156444269b4320dfc07f3880d/VT--Vermont-Primary-President-The-Latest">few, if any problems</a> with casting ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong><br />It was a double whammy for the Commonwealth this primary season as some counties launched new voting equipment for the first time in a presidential election and voter ID was required statewide for the first time in a presidential primary. Despite what could have been a recipe for disaster, things went relatively well on Tuesday in the Old Dominion State. Although there were isolated issues throughout the state, there was <a href="http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/view/story/106a4af156444269b4320dfc07f3880d/VT--Vermont-Primary-President-The-Latest">nothing systematic</a>.</p>
<p>Some of those isolated issues involved confusion over polling places and voting precinct alignments in <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/roanoke/roanoke-s-new-voting-precinct-alignment-causing-some-confusion-registrar/article_5a53a8db-1ccc-5da9-83e7-c4c9b6e43206.html">Roanoke</a>. <a href="http://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2016/03/confusion-in-prince-william-co-over-new-polling-locations/">Prince William County</a> voters also experienced some confusion over new polling places.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://wtvr.com/2016/03/01/ballot-already-filled-out/">Richmond</a> there were concerns about ballots being placed in a duffle bag instead of a ballot counting machine. Turns out the machine was inaccessible and until the machine could be accessed, the ballots were held in a secure duffle bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2016/03/01/arlington-county-runs-out-of-preprinted-gop-ballots/">Arlington County</a> ran out of GOP ballots and had to make new ballots on a photocopier. No voter was denied a ballot while the copies were being made.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2016/03/01/augusta-county-ada-voters/81149430/">Augusta County</a> continued to struggle with ADA-complaint polling places a year after the U.S. Department of Justice notified the county about deficiencies.</p>
<p>Although campus polling locations can be fraught with controversy, the new polling site at James Madison University saw more than 1,000 voters on Tuesday and had the third-highest turnout in all of <a href="http://www.breezejmu.org/news/over-voters-turn-out-to-new-on-campus-voting-precinct/article_9635e2fe-e021-11e5-8d6e-0b395aa73009.html">Harrisonburg</a>.&nbsp;</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Blackfeet Tribe recently sent a letter to Pondera County, Montana officials saying the county’s recent offer of <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/blackfeet-tribe-calls-better-voting-access-pondera-county#stream/0">10 hours of in-person access to late registration and absentee balloting in Heart Butte was unacceptable</a>. The letter also said non-Indian, off-reservation Pondera County residents have a 19-1 advantage over Blackfeet Tribal members in ballot access. County officials say they do not have staffing that would be required for the request of a satellite voting office on the reservation for 30 days prior to the election. “Native American tribal members in Montana have unequal access to voting, early voting, in-person absentee, late registration,” Tom Rodgers, a lobbyist for Native American issues told MTPR.
</li>
<li>Only time will tell how this affects elections offices, but unless Congress or the courts intervene, the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/01/468796570/stamp-prices-set-to-drop-2-cents-in-april-putting-usps-in-sticky-situation">cost of a first-class postage stamp will actually fall $.02 on April 10</a>. And while on the surface this may seem like a good thing, the United States Postal Service is warning that it could actually be a disaster for the self-funded agency. “The exigent surcharge granted to the Postal Service last year only partially alleviated our extreme multi-year revenue declines resulting from the Great Recession, which exceeded $7 billion in 2009 alone,&#8221; Postmaster General and CEO Megan J. Brennan said in a <a href="http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2016/pr16_009.htm">statement</a>. &#8220;Removing the surcharge and reducing our prices is an irrational outcome considering the Postal Service&#8217;s precarious financial condition.”
</li>
<li>Speaking of postage, in Utah <a href="http://www.parkrecord.com/summit_county-news/ci_29581959/summit-county-switches-mail-ballots">Summit County</a> Chief Deputy Clerk Kellie Robinson told the Park Record that with most of the state’s counties already voting by mail that Summit would have the support necessary to make the switch. &#8220;It has just been the last couple of years that everyone has started moving in that direction. The clerks had a talk last year about coming up with a plan and it&#8217;s just easier if we all use the same system,&#8221; Robinson told the paper. In <a href="http://www.thespectrum.com/story/news/local/cedar-city/2016/03/01/iron-county-introduce-new-vote-mail-format/81171326/">Iron County</a>, the county commission recently approved new return envelopes in order to increase ballot privacy. The envelopes will have two gum strips and also feature an affidavit for the voter to sign.&nbsp;

<li>Members of Cook County, Illinois’ Chinese community are prepared to help members of the Korean community with the transition to <a href="http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/korean-translated-ballots-are-being-readied-for-debut-in-march-15-illinois-primary/">bilingual elections materials</a>. “The Chinese community stands by the Korean community, and we will do our best to share our experiences with them to help them ease into a translated voting experience,” said C.W. Chan, chair of the&nbsp;<a href="http://cbcacchicago.org/#head-news">Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community</a>. “There are many challenges ahead, but [sample translated ballots] is just the first stepping stone.” Cook will be providing sample ballots in Korean in the upcoming March 15 primary.

<li>This week, Vote Riders, the League of Women Voters and the NAACP joined up with Dane County, Wisconsin elections officials and others to kick off the country’s <a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/madison-area-activists-officials-announce-concerted-voter-id-effort/article_d2b50987-5629-5e3e-a01f-35a98ff1ad39.html">very first Voter ID Awareness Month</a>. “We’re gearing up for April,” Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell told <em>The Capital Times</em>. “We’re really focused on November as well. I think there will be more voters who are not aware of the law, and this is part of an overall strategy to educate them in advance.” The coalition will provide rides to get people to the Department of Motor Vehicles for ID cards or driver’s licenses and mount an education campaign. Following this inaugural outing, Vote Riders will produce a toolkit for other localities to use.

<li>We don’t know whether to laugh or cry. In a special Super Tuesday edition of late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s popular <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/kimmel-hilariously-trolls-liars-claim-voted-article-1.2550296">“Lie Witness News”</a> segment, producers for the show interviewed people on the streets of Los Angeles about whether or not they had voted on Super Tuesday. Numerous people responded about what their voting experiences had been like that day. Problem is California voters don’t go to the polls until June 7.
</li>
<li>And <em>electionline </em>would just like to give a shout out to <a href="http://voteseminole.org/about/meet-mike-ertel/">Michael Ertel</a>, supervisor of elections for <a href="http://voteseminole.org/">Seminole County, Florida</a>. We’re on his email list and are thoroughly enjoying his daily updates on early voting. Not only are they super informative about the process, but they’ve occasionally been pretty funny. Elections are serious business, but it’s always good to have a sense of humor about things when you can.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> A bill drafted by two Berkeley students and introduced by legislators from the Bay Area would <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-college-voter-registration-20160303-story.html">automatically register to vote California college students</a> attending one of the state’s public colleges and universities when they sign up for classes. &#8220;These students want to see more of their friends and colleagues registered to vote and educated about the voting process,&#8221; Assemblymember David Chiu (D-San Francisco) told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. &#8220;They did their research and found a great solution to get more young people registered and to the polls, and I look forward to working with them on this worthy effort.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> This week the House State, Veterans &amp; Military Affairs Committee killed legislation, on a 5-4 party line vote, that would have required Coloradans to show a <a href="http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/house-panel-kills-measure-requiring-photo-id-to-vo">photo ID</a> in order to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Senate Bill 169 that would prohibit electioneering 100 feet from polling places instead of the current 300 as well as require <a href="http://wkms.org/post/election-related-modifications-moving-through-kentucky-general-assembly#stream/0">challenges to absentee ballots</a> returned by mail be delivered to the county clerk’s office before 8 a.m. on Election Day was recently approved by the Senate and now moves to the House.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: A bill to give <a href="http://www.publicnewsservice.org/2016-02-29/civic-engagement/vote-behind-bars-bill-headed-to-nh-house/a50575-1">voting rights to incarcerated felons</a> was approved by the Elections Law Committee 15-3 and now heads to the full House for debate.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Voters in Clovis voted overwhelmingly to approve amending the city charter to require voters to present a <a href="http://www.cnjonline.com/2016/03/01/clovis-oks-voter-id-for-municipal-elections/">photo ID</a> when casting ballots in city elections. The vote was 2,036-666. According to the <em>Clovis News Journal</em>, city commissioners still must work out the details about which IDs will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Legislation is pending in the New York City Council that would require the city board of elections to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-nyc-pols-shame-eligible-voters-article-1.2546923">send all eligible voters in the five boroughs a voter history card</a> that would tell people how many elections they voted in and how many they’ve missed. “As far as I’m concerned, true democracy exists not when people can vote, but when people do vote,” Councilman Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx) told the <em>Daily News.</em> He said he felt compelled to introduce the bill, which has its first hearing in the Council on Monday, because of New York’s abysmal voter participation rate.</p>
<p>Also in New York but at the state level, the Senate voted this week to <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Senate-says-August-primary-would-be-best-6866917.php">consolidate state and federal primaries</a> (but not the presidential preference primary) to a single date in August. The Assembly had approved legislation to move the primaries to June.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Attorney General Mike DeWine has rejected the initial paperwork of a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/mar/01/dewine-rejects-amendment-language/">automatic voter registration</a> with driver’s license applications and renewals. In his letter, DeWine said the amendment was poorly written and could be interpreted to allowing 16-year-olds to vote.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: A bill to <a href="http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/local/senate-holds-measure-to-unify-elections-boards/article_a3bcf375-c467-51b2-a69a-f9e1567ae736.html">consolidate the boards of elections</a> of St. John-St. Thomas and St. Croix into one board and reduce the membership from 14 to nine has been held in committee.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> According to the <em>Yakima Herald</em>, a proposed <a href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/voting-rights-bill-gains-support-in-state-senate/article_dc84f1c4-dd28-11e5-adcb-8fbd721a7c25.html">state Voting Rights Act</a> that has languished for years in the state Legislature now appears to have bipartisan support in the Senate. Late last week the bill passed out of the Senate Committee on Government Operations &amp; Security.</p>
<p>Also in Washington, by a 47-0 vote, the Senate approve a bill that <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/spincontrol/2016/mar/01/election-officials-names-wont-be-election-mail/">keeps the secretary of state’s name off the state voter pamphlet</a> in his/her official capacity and also keeps the county auditor’s name off ballot envelopes and other accompanying materials. The bill is now on its way to Gov. Jay Inslee’s desk.&nbsp;</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: U.S. District Court Judge Robert Shelby has ruled that <a href="http://www.lakepowelllife.com/san-juan-voting-districts-ruled-unconstitutional/">county council voting districts in San Juan County are unconstitutional</a>. The districts were redrawn in 2011 were gerrymandered in such a way to dilute the Navajo voting power despite the fact that Navajo voters are the majority in the county.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> A federal grand jury has <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article62541357.html">charged that several people conspired to buy votes</a> for Magoffin County Judge-Executive Charles Hardin and the county clerk in the 2014 election cycle. According to the <em>Lexington Herald-Leader</em>, the indictment is the first to publicly name Hardin and Clerk Renee Arnett Shepherd as the alleged beneficiaries of vote-buying.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: The Mississippi Supreme Court ordered the secretary of state’s office to <a href="http://www.mpbonline.org/blogs/news/2016/02/29/ms-supreme-court-orders-addition-of-presidential-candidate-to-primary-ballots/">add a Democratic presidential candidate’s name to the March 8th ballot</a>. Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann had refused to put the name on the ballot since absentee and military and overseas voting had already begun. Hosemann told Mississippi Public Broadcasting that the costs to add the name will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: Seven residents and the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission have filed suit against San Juan County for <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/3587049-155/san-juan-county-sued-for-violating">violating the Voting Rights Act over the county’s move to vote-by-mail</a>. The suit claims that vote-by-mail “unreasonably hinders” Navajo citizens’ ability to vote on equal terms with white voters. &#8220;Navajo is a traditionally unwritten language,&#8221; according to the lawsuit, and the mail-only system fails to &#8220;provide adequate oral assistance to limited English-proficient Native American voters.&#8221; The lawsuit also claims that vote-by-mail relies on an unreliable U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: The trail against the state’s <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/article_5a603fe5-7a08-504b-b2c7-257915ae6d42.html">voter ID law</a> continued this week and even though it was Super Tuesday in the Commonwealth, several former state and local elections officials testified that they were not aware of any eligible voter who had been denied their right to cast a ballot due to lack of ID.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: A complaint filed in federal court alleges flaws at the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles are preventing residents from getting the <a href="http://wisconsingazette.com/2016/03/01/32700/">necessary ID in order to vote</a>. According to the <em>Wisconsin Gazette</em> the complaint outlines more than a dozen policies making voting more challenging for eligible citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>Also on the national front, <em>Stateline </em>has a piece about the rising costs state and local governments are facing with <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/kimmel-hilariously-trolls-liars-claim-voted-article-1.2550296">replacing aging voting equipment</a>.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: As of this week, all 58 California counties are now part of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-california-voter-database-online-20160301-story.html">VoteCal, the statewide voter registration database</a>. The project cost $98 million and has been more than a decade in coming. According to the<em> Los Angeles Times</em>, the VoteCal database will undergo a battery of operational testing to sort out any remaining problems before being officially certified&nbsp;in June. But the final hookup to Stanislaus and Monterey counties Monday marked an important milestone.</p>
<p>Also in California, Secretary of State Alex Padilla testified before a Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments committee about the state’s <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article63246792.html">aging voting equipment</a>. Padilla wants the state to foot more of the $450 million bill to replace the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Voters in Flagler County casting their ballots at one of the county’s three early sites will be using the county’s new <a href="http://flaglerlive.com/91093/ballots-on-demand/">ballot-on-demand system</a> for the first time. The new printers were paid for with HAVA funds. Supervisor of Elections Kaiti Lenhart told FlagerLive that ballot-on-demand printers (which look no different than ordinary office printers) have already saved taxpayers nearly $6,500 in ballot printing costs. “It is my mission to reduce costs and improve the elections experience in Flagler County,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong>: The Gage County board voted unanimously this week to purchase <a href="http://beatricedailysun.com/news/local/ballot-counting-machine-purchased/article_18802e20-4496-5dc4-8ccd-65d2bba7e0ab.html">new ballot-counting equipment</a>. “We have issues with slow ballots, jamming, it stops. It does read correct — I want to make sure everyone knows we do not have a problem with reading the ballots and totaling the votes,” County Clerk Dawn Hill told the<em> Beatrice Daily Sun</em>. Hill said that the new equipment will speed up the process and work with ballots that are sometimes a bit messy since, well voters are sometimes a bit messy.&nbsp;</p>
