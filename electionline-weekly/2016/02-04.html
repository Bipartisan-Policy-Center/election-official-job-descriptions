							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Automatic voter registration debuts in Oregon<br /></strong><em>Once again Oregon leads the way in election reform</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>Once again Oregon has found itself on the leading edge of election reform.</p>
<p>On January 4 2016, the state became the first in the country to begin <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/voting/Pages/motor-voter-faq.aspx">automatically registering voters</a> who visit the state’s <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/pages/driverid/licenseget.aspx">Division of Motor Vehicles</a> (DMV) to apply for a new or renew a driver’s license or state ID.</p>
<p>Since Oregon Motor Voter launched one month ago, the state has added 4,348 voters to the rolls.</p>
<p>Under the law, once the voters are registered they receive a Motor Voter card from the Oregon Elections Division and they have three options: Do nothing and remain registered, opt-out, or choose a political party.</p>
<p>Voters have 21 days to respond to the card. If they don’t respond to the card, they may still opt-out at any time by going online or to their local elections office. Once a voter opts out, it is noted on their DMV file and they will not be automatically registered again upon a future visit to the DMV.</p>
<p>According to the elections division, <a href="images/OMV_MonthlyReport_2016-02-02_002.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">which is reporting its findings today</span></a>, since the law launched on January 4, 4,653 new voters were automatically enrolled as voters. Of those only 305 returned their cards and chose to opt-out of registering by the 21-day deadline. An additional 437 people returned their cards choosing a party affiliation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OMV_MonthlyReport_2016-02-02_.jpg" alt="OMV MonthlyReport 2016 02 02 " width="419" height="324" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>Former secretary of state and now Governor Kate Brown (D) championed the <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2015R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2177/Enrolled">legislation</a> and one of her first acts as governor was to sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>While the legislation was the Brown’s baby, it fell upon current <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins</a> and her staff to implement the new law.</p>
<p>Preparing the state to automatically register voters required a project manager and the coordination of three offices — the DMV, the Elections Division and the Department of Administrative Services, which did the printing and mailing of the Motor Voter cards.</p>
<p>Although the state was already receiving information from the DMV they did have to add specific fields to the DMV forms like proof of legal presence in the state.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a start-from-scratch process,” Atkins said. “We made a decision that they would develop a report each night of relevant transactions that met our criteria and then we would go and get that and match it against our centralized voter database and then we take the bull by the horns so-to-speak and send them a mailer.”</p>
<p>Atkins said the response to AVR, so far anyway, has been surprisingly restrained. The office had prepared to hire temp staffing to handle the volume of calls they anticipated, but those calls never came.</p>
<p>“We expected a bunch of calls, good news is we really haven’t gotten that,” Atkins said. “Certainly no outraged calls of yet. More than anything calls came from people who thought they were already registered.”</p>
<p>Atkins said the feedback from county elections officials has been good too.</p>
<p>Another surprise for Atkins and county clerks was the impact the new process would have on updating voter rolls. In the month since AVR launched, nearly 17,000 existing registrations have been updated with new addresses.</p>
<p>“This wasn’t unexpected, but we hadn’t focused on what it would actually mean,” Atkins said. “It’s a really exciting piece from a lot of stand points.”</p>
<p>Atkins said she and the clerks will be monitoring the things during the May election, but they anticipate a lot fewer ballots will be returned undeliverable.</p>
<p>“There is a lot better chance now that everyone who is registered will actually get a ballot at the right address,” Atkins said.</p>
<p>Currently the state is only registering those who have a new touch with the DMV since January 4, but during the “down time” of the summer months, the secretary’s office will be going back and registering all eligible voters who had contact with the DMV since January 1, 2014.</p>
<p>“We made the decision early in the process that we should be getting the moving forward program up and running and be able to have a smooth start,” Atkins said. “We’re treating it as a separate process and think that some of the communications will have to be different.”</p>
<p>Speaking of communications, Atkins said that because the office wasn’t granted a bunch of money to do PSAs or advertising they have had to rely heavily on Oregon media and with many advocacy organizations and student groups to get the word out to voters. Everyone who comes to the DMV does get a brochure that explains all the ways that people can register.</p>
<p>And now for the question that everyone wants to know, just how much did this whole thing cost?</p>
<p>“We hope to be able to share with the world what everything cost once we know,” Atkins said. “But there are some numbers still missing.”</p>
<p>The office was given authorization to use $750,000 in HAVA funds to hire a project manager and for hardware and software related costs. And of course the costs of the mailings. The legislature also set aside funds to reimburse counties on a per-registration basis.</p>
<p>“We don’t foresee that we’re going to ask for more money till the next budget cycle,” Atkins said.</p>
<p>Atkins said as AVR rolls into its second month they aren’t preparing to make any changes or adjustments to the system based on how the first month rolled out. She said her office is carefully reviewing every element of the process, but so far nothing has jumped out that needs changing or adjusting.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic voter registration in other states<br /></strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-ca-motor-voter-law-20151016-html-htmlstory.html">California</a> has also approved automatic voter registration system, although it differs slightly from Oregon’s in that potential voters have the opportunity to opt out at the time of their transaction with the DMV. Although the law took effect on Jan. 1, 2016, it remains unclear when it will actually come into practice because according to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, the DMV is waiting on the development of regulations and not all counties are yet part of VoteCal.</p>
<p>In 2015 the New Jersey General Assembly approved automatic voter registration, but Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed it. Democratic members of the General Assembly have said overriding Christie’s veto would be a top priority.</p>
<p>Automatic voter registration has been introduced in at least 18 states and the District of Columbia since Oregon introduced its legislation and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1970?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22s1970%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> (D) and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/244601-dem-unveils-automatic-voter-registration-bill">Rep. David Cicilline</a> (D-RI) have also introduced federal legislation for automatic voter registration in their respective chambers.</p>

														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New U.S. Election Assistance Commission Executive Director Brian Newby has sent letters to <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/KS%20-%20Elec.%20Dir,%20NVRA,%201-29-16.pdf">Kansas</a>, <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/GA%20SOS%20-%20NVRA,%201-29-16-OCR.pdf">Georgia</a> and other states saying that the EAC has <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/02/465353108/as-voting-begins-several-states-voter-id-laws-remain-in-flux">updated instructions on filling out the federal voter registration form to include the proof-of-citizenship</a> requirement for would-be voters using the federal form in those states. This decision seems to be in conflict with past executive directors and at least one of the commissioners, Thomas Hicks (D) who <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Statement%20by%20Commissioner%20Hicks%20NVRA%20Form%20(2-2-16).pdf">issued a statement</a> objecting to the move saying that it “contradicts policy and precedent previously established by this commission” and seeking a formal vote by the Commission on the change. Newby told NPR that he believes he is within his right to make the changes.
</li>
<li>The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks (NACRC) and the International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and Treasurers (IACREOT) announce the name of their newly merged organization: <a href="https://www.prlog.org/12530428-nacrc-and-iacreot-announce-name-of-their-new-merged-organization.html">International Association of Government Officials</a> (IAoGO, pronounced &#8220;I-GO&#8221;). The merger and new organization announcement comes as a result of a vote by both organizations on June 30, 2015, to approve the proposed merger. The new merged organization IAoGO will officially begin operating on September 1, 2016.
</li>
<li>The elections offices in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and Denver, Colorado are getting in on the Super Bowl fun by making a small wager over the game which, for those that don’t know, features the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers. Unlike some other big game wagers, this one doesn’t involve which team wins, but <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/panther-tracks/article58148683.html">which elections office has the most team swag</a>. And Mecklenburg County has brought in a secret weapon: Former Panthers wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad will appear in the photo to be posted on Facebook.
</li>
<li>The Saint Louis County, Missouri NAACP has asked county elections officials to <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2016/01/30/naacp-wants-some-st-louis-county-polling-places-moved/">consider using buildings other than police stations as polling places</a> for the upcoming April primary and general election. “Why would we add an additional hurdle of having the fear of walking into a polling place, providing identification in a police department and thinking folks would be OK with that? Especially in an area where there’s real concern about the number of warrants that have been issued,” NAACP member John Gaskin said to CBS.
</li>
<li>Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has proposed a <a href="http://www.ohio.com/news/break-news/husted-issues-new-rules-to-prevent-thousands-of-absentee-ballots-from-being-tossed-out-again-1.658213">rules change that should alleviate problems faced with delayed absentee ballots</a>. Husted reversed his previous opinion that nothing but a postmark could be accepted and now will accept the barcodes that often appear on envelopes because they include the date mailed. It will require the purchase of a $500 reader. “This policy is consistent with the spirit of the law and common sense dictates that we should use technology to count every ballot we can,” Husted said according to the <em>Akron Beacon-Herald</em>.
</li>
<li>And it’s not just Ohio residents that are having issues with the U.S. Postal Service. Recently, several potential voters in Grant County, New Mexico who mailed in voter registration forms had those forms returned to them by the Postal Service. Turns out that the Postal Service had not notified the elections office that the funds in their account were running low so there was <a href="http://www.scdailypress.com/site/2016/01/29/mix-up-means-some-not-registered-to-vote/">no money to cover the postage-paid envelopes</a>. “Ever since I’ve been here, if there wasn’t enough money in the fund to cover those registrations, they would let us know,” Clerk Robert Zamarripa told they <em>Silver City Daily Press</em>. “They would hold them there for us to come pick them up.”
</li>
<li>This week Montana Secretary of State Linda McCulloch announced the establishment of <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2016/02/01/mcculloch-announces-satellite-voting-offices-reservations/79647706/">five satellite elections offices on Indian reservations</a>. The satellite offices will offer services that are typically only available in the main county offices including late registration and in-person absentee voting. “These offices will ensure American Indians’ ability to participate effectively in the electoral process is protected. I applaud the counties and tribes that have worked together to create expanded access to the voting process; this type of collaboration is what makes Montana a great state to live in,” said McCulloch.
</li>
<li>Pennsylvania has become the latest state to join the <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/pennsylvania-seeks-to-improve-accuracy-of-voter-rolls/article_7f4a951f-50b8-523b-a35e-9d1fd449ca98.html">Electronic Registration Information Center</a> (ERIC).
</li>
<li>The Republican Party of Virginia voted this week to ask the State Board of Elections to not enforce the statement of affiliation — <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/starexponent/virginia-gop-abandons-loyalty-oath/article_5d7f61a4-c7c8-11e5-95d3-07ea5fdc97c7.html">loyalty oath</a> — during the upcoming March 1. Primary.
</li>
<li>Miami-Dade County, Florida has introduced a <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article57277743.html">new “I Voted” sticker</a> just in time for the 2016 election cycle. The new sticker is in three languages — English, Spanish and Creole. The new stickers are larger than the old stickers. They are also round and red, white and blue. And because everything has a hashtag these days, the stickers also include #iamelectionready.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation: </strong>Speaker Paul Ryan (R- Wis.) told members of the Congressional Black Caucus that while he supports the new revisions to the <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/268159-ryan-backs-voting-rights-bill-but-tells-black-caucus-its-out-of-his-hands">Voting Rights Act</a> that the caucus is supporting, he won’t bypass a committee chairman to move the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>The Alabama House Democratic Caucus will seek to establish <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/house_democrats_push_for_lotte.html">automatic voter registration</a> with a new or renewed driver’s license. There would be an opt-out mechanism in place. The Caucus will also introduce legislation to allow voters to <strong>cast an early ballot</strong> at county courthouse six days in advance of an election.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona: </strong>A House panel has approved HB2456 that would move Arizona to a <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/house-panel-approves-bill-changing-electoral-votes/article_92ca6b2b-095d-5a5a-be57-865f6955f844.html">national popular vote</a> system.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: What you wear to the polls may no longer be an issue in the Peach State. Senate Bill 199 <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/it-may-soon-be-safe-to-wear-an-nra-cap-to-the-poll/nqJCr/">clarifies what constitutes campaign material</a> and is in response to an incident in Douglass County where elections officials required a voter to remove an NRA hat before entering a polling place.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas: </strong>Minority leaders and voting rights advocates are pushing for passage of a bill that would allow <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2016/jan/31/minority-groups-push-same-day-voter-registration/">same-day registration</a> in Kansas. &#8220;We really believe everybody should have access to voting anytime, not just a few days out of the year. As long as they come with ID, why shouldn&#8217;t they be able to vote?&#8221; said Rep. Gail Finney, D-Wichita who introduced the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Once again, legislation is moving through the Kentucky House that would <a href="http://weku.fm/post/voting-restoration-measure-again-heading-house-floor#stream/0">restore voting rights to nonviolent ex-felons</a>. Similar legislation was approved last year, but died in the senate.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: Legislation to require a voter to show a <a href="http://themissouritimes.com/26713/house-voter-id-begins-journey-in-senate/">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot began its journey through the Senate this week. The bills were presented to the Senate Financial and Governmental Organizations committee and the Elections committee. Rep. Justin Alferman, one of the sponsors said after eight years of trying to get similar legislation through the Senate, there have been some changes. “The most important change is that we’ve made safeguards in this bill to make sure the state pays for 100 percent of the cost,” Alferman told <em>The Missouri Times</em>.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico: </strong>A bill proposed by State Rep. Javier Martinez failed 5-4 in the House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee. Under the legislation—a proposed constitutional amendment—the state would have been required to “take adequate and reasonable action to ensure” that all qualified electors are registered to vote. This would have included adding <a href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/new-mexico/legislature/2016/01/29/panel-kills-bill-expand-states-voter-pool/79543794/">same-day registration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Legislation that would <a href="http://wibx950.com/legislation-to-combine-primaries-passes-in-state-assembly/">combine the June federal and the September state and local elections</a> into one June primary has been approved by the Assembly. If approved, the bill would save the state more than $25 million a year.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Rep. Terry Alexander (D-Florence) has introduced H-4382 that would <a href="http://www.scnow.com/news/local/article_743c7164-ca04-11e5-9f1d-53025471de2e.html">require high schools to provide students with a voter registration card</a> before the student turns 18 and would also require lesson on the importance of voting. Students would not be required to register.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: Legislation that would allow Utah clerks to <a href="http://utahpoliticalcapitol.com/2016/02/03/clerks-close-to-receiving-okay-to-release-unofficial-results-prior-to-official-count/">release unofficial results while counting vote-by-mail ballots</a> has been approved by the Senate Government Operations and Political Subdivisions Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: The Senate has approved several <a href="http://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/virginia-senate-passes-bills-to-expand-absentee-voting/article_45a73fb6-8c40-5cbc-b42a-e4da623ac976.html">absentee voting pieces</a> legislation including a bill that would allow residents to vote absentee in person before an election without providing an excuse. Other legislation approved would allow people 65 and older to vote permanent absentee and a third bill would allow for no-excuse absentee voting for 21 days before an election.</p>
<p>In other absentee voting legislation the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections voted 7-6 to reject legislation that would require localities to provide <a href="http://www.insidenova.com/news/arlington/bill-for-postage-paid-absentee-balloting-dies/article_c660d692-c9c8-11e5-a4b4-b3cb622c8074.html">postage-paid envelopes</a> with absentee ballots.</p>
<p>The committee also approved legislation that would <a href="http://augustafreepress.com/senate-committee-passes-bill-banning-primary-loyalty-oaths/">eliminate loyalty oaths</a> or statements of affiliation in state-subsidized party primaries.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia: </strong>The Cabell County commission approved a resolution allowing the county clerk to provide <a href="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/commission-approves-change-to-emergency-absentee-voting-policy/article_5b9ce123-0020-5b18-af9a-9e5faa6ea22e.html">emergency absentee ballots</a> to voters who are confined to a hospital or health care facility within a 35-mile radius of the county seat and to nursing homes throughout the county.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: The Senate Elections Committee has approved SB295 on a 3-2 part line vote that allow Wisconsin to become one of the growing number of states to offer <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/online-voter-registration-bill-to-eliminate-special-deputies-b99663972z1-367549541.html">online voter registration</a> in 2017. However, under the bill, special registration deputies or political parties or nonprofits would no longer be allowed to sign up voters — although possibly with an iPad.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>In court filings, Secretary of State John Merrill has urged a federal judge to allow the state’s <a href="http://www.wvtm13.com/news/State-urges-judge-to-let-voter-ID-law-stand/37793146">voter ID law</a> to stand. Greater Birmingham Ministries and the NAACP filed suit against the law as an infringement on voting rights.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia: </strong>In ruling that the city’s board of elections had no authority to approve a ballot initiative for circulation, Judge Maurice Ross has called into question the validity of the entire elections board for almost four years. It seems that the three board members have been serving expired terms since 2012, 2013 and 2014 and therefore Ross ruled that the <a href="https://wamu.org/news/16/01/29/dc_judge_shoots_down_public_vote_on_15_minimum_wage">board was not properly constituted</a>. An attorney for the board argued that the city’s Home Rule Charter allowed them to remain active board members until replaced. The judge disagreed. “Because of legislative and executive inertia, you just want me to follow the line?&#8221; Ross argued during the hearing. Attorneys for the board <a href="https://wamu.org/news/16/02/03/dc_elections_board_seeks_to_reverse_judges_ruling_on_minimum_wage_vote">have asked Ross to amend or alter his ruling</a> citing a 1988 law that they say allows board members to continue serving beyond their terms. Additionally, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racin has asked the court to allow him to intervene in the court fight.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Under an agreement between the county and a group of Hasidic Jews who had sued the county over <a href="http://www.recordonline.com/article/20160201/NEWS/160209919">voting rights violations</a>, the Sullivan County Board of Elections will be federally monitored for the next five years and will have to pay more than $500,000.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina: </strong>The case over North Carolina’s <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ruling-weeks-north-carolina-voter-id-mandate-36650667">voter ID</a> now rests with U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder. Schroeder has asked both sides to provide additional information by Feb. 24.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The office of Secretary of State Al Jaeger has filed a motion to dismiss in a lawsuit brought against the state’s <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/motion-to-dismiss-voter-id-lawsuit-filed/article_fbc53003-638a-5446-ad31-0259893cb307.html">voter ID law</a>. Plaintiffs from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa say that Native Americans face a disproportionate burden to obtain the required ID. The motion from Jaeger’s office denies that claim. “A qualified North Dakota voter is no more or less a qualified voter because he or she lives in the city or on the farm,” the motion said. “Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the proper remedy, even assuming an unjustified burden on some voters, would be to invalidate the entire statute.”</p>
<p><strong>Virginia: </strong>Plaintiffs in the case challenging Virginia’s <a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Democrats-Ask-Judge-to-Add-1-Week-to-Voter-ID-Trial-366987461.html">voter ID</a> law have filed a motion asking the judge for a two-week trial instead of one because they have so many witnesses — 40. The trial is set to begin Feb. 22.</p></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>This week, Alabama joined an ever-growing list of states and the District that allow voters to <a href="http://abc3340.com/news/local/alabama-launches-electronic-voter-registration-system">register online to vote</a>. New registrants do need a valid Alabama driver’s license. The new system launched two weeks before the deadline to register for the upcoming primary.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia: </strong>Just in time for the voter registration deadline, the state released a new app <a href="http://www.wtvm.com/story/31079302/new-app-makes-ga-voter-registration-easier-as-deadline-approaches">GA VOTES</a> available for Apple or Droid that allows residents to register to vote by entering their driver’s license number.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: Maryland elections officials are hoping to launch the state’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-officials-run-into-problems-with-early-voting-in-april-primary/2016/02/03/d4d27b1e-ca99-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html">new paper ballot voting system</a> during early voting instead of on primary day because the state’s outgoing touch-screen voting machines cannot display all the candidate’s names on one screen.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: According to the secretary of state’s office, since <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/716661/news/new-mexico-residents-embrace-online-voter-registration.html">online voter registration</a> launched at the beginning of 2016, 2,867 new registrations have been completed through the online portal.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: The State Board of Elections has launched a new absentee ballot system that will allow voters to <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/communities/skiatook/news/new-online-absentee-ballot-request-system-launched/article_5e42c377-cbdc-5c9a-bd7b-2b191ffa94c2.html">submit their ballot request online</a>. “Voting by mail is a convenient way to cast your ballot in Oklahoma without having to worry about lines on Election Day,” Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax told Tulsa World. “This new system will make voting by mail easier than ever by letting voters request an absentee ballot with the click of a mouse.” In addition to the new online request system, voters will still be able to request ballots via mail, fax, e-mail or delivering the form in person.</p></p>
