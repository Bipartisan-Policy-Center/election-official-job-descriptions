							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama works to make sure everyone counts<br /></strong><em>State becomes first to use online voting system for UOCAVA voters in presidential race</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org?subject=ElectionlineWeekly%2004.14.16">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>Not everyone gets the opportunity to vote for who their new boss may be, but thanks to a new program in Alabama, that’s exactly what more than 100 UOCAVA voters stationed overseas got to do in the March 1 presidential primary.</p>
<p>Only they didn’t have to find a printer, put pen to paper and then make their way to a mailbox, instead they took to their keyboards and requested and submitted their ballots online.</p>
<p>During the “SEC Primary”, Alabama became the first in the nation to implement statewide, a fully electronic end-to-end voting system for a presidential primary election.</p>
<p>Through the years there have been a multitude of attempts to quickly and securely get service members stationed overseas their ballots and get those ballots returned. Other localities have tested various ways of doing it, but this is the first statewide use of a uniform, all electronic system.</p>
<p>The state used <a href="http://www.everyonecounts.com/">Everyone Counts’</a> eLect electronic ballot delivery and return system for UOCAVA voters stationed overseas.</p>
<p>“We know that the military often feel as if their voices aren’t heard in the election process because of the hoops that they have to jump through to receive their ballots &#8211; much less get them returned on-time. We have a solution that solves that problem and it was proven to be effective this past Super Tuesday for Alabama,” said Lori Steele Contorer, Everyone Counts CEO.</p>
<p>During the March primary 493 UOCAVA voters received their ballots electronically with 173 being eligible to return them also via the secure electronic system. Of those 173 eligible, 128 ballots were returned.</p>
<p>Eligible voters were able to log into a secure website using a special code they received via email and then were able to cast their ballot online. The voter was then notified that the ballot had been received and counted.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sos.alabama.gov/">secretary of state’s</a> office considered this to be very successful and will be offering the option to UOCAVA voters again in November.</p>
<p>The state first <a href="http://www.wsfa.com/story/30219300/al-becomes-first-state-to-offer-armed-forces-electronic-voting-abroad">partnered with the City of Montgomery</a> in October 2015 to test the program on a smaller scale. During that election two service members stationed abroad used the system. Although two may seem like a small number, the state was pleased enough with the results to use the system in March.</p>
<p>“It went well, which is why we chose to carry it over into the regular primary,” Secretary of State John Merrill said. “We were excited about the interest and encouraged that people wanted to participate.”</p>
<p>In the coming months, the state will be working with the military and the local press as well as identifying every possible eligible voter about the system so it can be used more broadly in November.</p>
<p>“We want to reach as many of our voters as possible and be able to have as large of a turnout as possible,” Merrill said.</p>

							<h2>Primary Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Update</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SusanB.jpeg" alt="SusanB" width="259" height="259" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin-right: 15px; float: left;" /></p>
<p>Voters went to the polls in New York on Tuesday for the state’s closed presidential primary and while some pre-primary fears of thousands of unaffiliated voters turning up at the polls to vote in the closed primary didn’t quite come to pass, the day was not without controversy.</p>
<p>The bulk of the issues occurred in Brooklyn. There, more than 100,000 people were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/nyregion/new-york-voters-face-problems-at-the-polls.html?_r=0">removed from the voters rolls</a> in the months leading up to the primary. Elections officials argue that it was delayed, but normal voter roll maintenance, but state and federal officials have launched an investigation.</p>
<p>Also in Brooklyn, several <a href="http://patch.com/new-york/brownsville/multiple-brooklyn-polling-sites-opened-hours-late-tuesday-morning-voters-say">polling places reported problems</a> with voting machines and building access delaying start times for up to two hours in some cases.</p>
<p>The closed primaries did raise some issues. In <a href="http://wrvo.org/post/many-su-students-turned-away-polls-over-voter-registration-issues#stream/0">Onondaga County</a>, home to Syracuse University, elections officials reported that about one-third of voters who showed up at the polls were turned away because they were not registered for either party.</p>
<p>Officials in Onondaga County said <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/04/voter_issues_nyc_polls.html">part of the problem on Tuesday could be blamed on social media</a>. Democratic Commissioner Dustin Czarny told <em>Syracuse.com</em> that the county saw more provisional ballots than normal and said social media spread a lot of misinformation which resulted in the provisional ballots. &#8220;Social media took a story and ran with it telling people they could register or do affidavit voting and it would count because of the lawsuit,&#8221; Czarny told the website. &#8220;We saw a lot of social media scares on Facebook and Twitter that not only should people go to the polls, but some posts said the judge had ruled in their favor, which was not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/news/local-news/binghamton-university-poll-runs-out-of-ballots-on-primary-night">Broome County</a>, home to Binghamton University, the polling place at the Old Student Union ran out of ballots. Voters had to fill out affidavit ballots instead. According to county officials, about 95 percent of the campus is registered to vote.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wptz.com/news/plattsburgh-primary-voters-say-they-were-denied-voting-ballot/39118828">Franklin County</a> elections officials reported some issues with independent voters wishing to cast ballots. Some voters seemed to understand that the problem was not the fault of the local elections officials. &#8220;It&#8217;s disheartening and I do want to make it clear, you know, it&#8217;s not the people at the elections here. It&#8217;s not their fault. They&#8217;re fine, decent, hard-working people who are following the rules that they have to get,&#8221; Janet Zanchelli of Plattsburgh told WPTZ.</p>
<p>And in what may be our favorite primary day story to-date, some voters in Rochester have taken to placing their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/04/20/new-york-voters-decorated-susan-b-anthonys-grave-with-their-i-voted-stickers/?tid=sm_tw">“I Voted” stickers on the headstone of Susan B. Anthony</a>. “It was definitely like I was putting it on her lapel, like, ‘This one’s for you Susan, here you go,’ ” Brianne Wojtesta told <strong>The Washington Post</strong>. The practice has been happening for several years now and cemetery officials have said they are OK with it.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Preview</strong><br />Voters in five states — Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — head to the polls next week and there are a few things worth keeping an eye on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-goes-back-to-paper-ballots-for-primary-election/2016/04/19/54381e04-0604-11e6-bfed-ef65dff5970d_story.html">Maryland</a>, the state will be using it’s new, all-paper ballot voting system for the first time in a presidential election.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://wtnh.com/2016/04/20/dmv-system-crash-impacts-voter-registration/">Connecticut</a>, the state’s DMV crashed for two days this week. What impact that may or may not have on voter registration in the Nutmeg State remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Elections officials in some <a href="http://www.observer-reporter.com/20160420/elections_officials_scramble_to_comply_with_court_case_restoring_democrat_to_us_senate_ballot">Pennsylvania</a> counties are scrambling to add a last-minute candidate after a court ruling placed the candidate back on the ballot. Also still in limbo is a constitutional question about judge retirement age. The question, while on the ballot, may or may not be counted.</p>
<p>And in <a href="http://wpri.com/2016/04/20/ri-will-only-open-1-in-3-polling-places-for-primary/">Rhode Island</a>, the state will only be using 1 out of 3 polling places that it normally uses. The state is making the cuts for cost savings and said that similar reductions were made for the March 2008 primary.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fallout from the <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2016/1848-electionlineweekly-april-7-2016?showall=&amp;start=1">botched primary April 5</a> continued this week when the St. Louis County board of election commissioners <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-county-election-board-suspends-top-director-ballot-blunder">suspended Democratic director Eric Fey</a> for two weeks without pay. According to St. Louis Public Radio, the commission also suspended Elections Coordinator Laura Goebel, but did not sanction Republican director Gary Furh. “The employees who work here are very dedicated,” Commissioner John Maupin told KWMU. “And they are trying to do the best job they can. So whatever we do is only to try to enhance their ability to do their jobs. And the only job they have to make sure people can vote.”
</li>
<li>It’s not quite the Hatfields and McCoys, but there is definitely trouble brewing in Wild and Wonderful West Virginia. Recently, we reported that of the state’s 55 counties, only two, Kanawha and Cabell were <a href="http://www.register-herald.com/news/county-clerks-accuse-tennant-of-piling-on/article_1096a328-8be6-50f4-9681-9fc9602f0acc.html">refusing to allow new voters to register using the state’s new online voter registration system</a>. Secretary of State Natalie Tennant said the clerks in those counties were uniformed about how the system works. Now, the clerks are fighting back and they’ve got the support of the West Virginia County Clerk’s Association. The Clerk’s Association sent Tennant a letter accusing her of making “antagonistic and incorrect” statements. According to the Register Herald, Donald Evans, president of the association and Monroe County clerk said clerks were only give one afternoon to test the new OVR system and provide feedback. &#8220;We are not anti-change, but we want to be included in the process of change and its implementation,&#8221; Evans wrote in his letter. Tennant responded to the letter in part by saying: &#8220;I am befuddled by the assertions in the letter that there was no communication with or inclusion of the county clerks when specifically talking about the implementation of the Online Voter Registration (OVR) system. I value the collective knowledge and experience that the County Clerks have to offer. And I have a record of asking for clerks to share it.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Same-day voter registration has been controversial in Illinois, but numbers from Will County prove that despite the controversy — clerks are unhappy about the costs and added lines it creates — it’s wildly popular with residents. According to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-election-day-registration-st-0418-20160415-story.html">5,778 residents in Will County took advantage of same day registration during the March primary</a>. The recent primary was the first time the county offered same day registration at all 300 of its precincts. Same day registration &#8220;is a good thing, but we don&#8217;t want anyone to be turned away (by the long wait),&#8221; Judy Wiedmeyer, Will County&#8217;s chief deputy clerk told the paper. &#8220;At least we didn&#8217;t run out of ballots, like some other counties.&#8221;
</li>
<li>A recent investigation by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> found that as many as 73 percent of California voters registered for the American Independent Party actually thought they were registered as independents. Some advocates and elections officials are <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-american-independent-party-california-voter-registration-card-20160419-story.html">blaming the design of the state’s voter registration forms</a>. According to the paper, the analysis of registration records from AIP members finds a higher percentage of forms that were mailed in rather than completed at a state or local office. &#8220;When they use the word &#8216;independent,&#8217; I want to clarify it,&#8221; Cathy Darling Allen, Shasta County&#8217;s registrar of voters told the paper. She and elections officials in other counties said voters routinely ask in-person questions about how to navigate the various choices. But for those who fill the cards out on their own, there&#8217;s no help.
</li>
<li>She didn’t win a new car, or a trip to a tropical island, but 18-year-old Katarina Gruber from Pierce County, Washington is getting a lot of attention for being <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article72556687.html">Washington’s 4 millionth registered voter</a>. Although she registered back in March, shortly after her birthday, she was recently recognized by state and county leaders. “In the elections community, this is a pretty big deal,” Secretary of State Kim Wyman said at the event. Gruber told <em>The News Tribune</em> that registering shortly after her birthday was a no-brainer. &#8220;Growing up, you have your parents, and they’re involved in voting and they’re talking about it, and you hear it on the news all the time. So honestly, in my point of view, I couldn’t really ignore it,” Gruber told the paper.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong>: By a 56-3 vote, Senate Bill 9 was approved this week. Under the bill, political advertising will no longer be allowed in the <a href="http://www.youralaskalink.com/news/election-integrity-bill-passes-alaska-senate/article_8b61a3fc-0508-11e6-9720-a3771c38f585.html">state’s official voter guide</a> and the Division of Elections will now be allowed to identify voters who are ineligible to vote.</p>
<p>Also in Alaska, because there is a 120-day rule between the adjournment of the Legislature and the placement of a measure on a ballot, the citizen-lead initiative to <a href="https://www.adn.com/article/20160418/pfd-voter-registration-initiative-be-bumped-november-ballot">tie PFD applications to voter registration</a> will move to the November 2016 general election ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: Tucked inside another elections bill is language that would require Maricopa County to have <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/provision-would-require-maricopa-to-have-poll-location-per-voters/article_f0339110-f44e-5442-88f8-c414119b0475.html">at least one polling place for every 1,700 people eligible to vote</a>, which would translate into approximately 200 polling places. The amendment to HB 2017, which still requires a roll-call vote, also allows the county recorder to designate emergency polling places for a presidential preference election.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: The Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee and Budget Subcommittee recently hosted a joint hearing on whether or not local elections officials will be able to get some of the <a href="http://www.cafwd.org/reporting/entry-new/california-counties-worried-about-cost-of-june-primary-election-and-beyond">$120 million available for state-mandated election programs</a>. Secretary of State Alex Padilla and representatives from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and other organizations testified that, if funding isn’t increased for elections in California, there could be problems.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, the Board of Supervisors will soon hold its first ever joint meeting with the Youth Commission to decide whether or not to put forward a proposal to <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/san-francisco-examines-lowering-voting-age-methods-boost-turnout/">lower the voting age in San Francisco to 16</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: Legislators are set to introduce a bipartisan bill that would <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election/ci_29792597/colorado-presidential-primary-bill-would-allow-independents">create a presidential primary system</a> for the state and would allow the state’s unaffiliated voters to cast their ballot in the primary. The legislation would allow unaffiliateds to choose a party for the primary and that party affiliation would then expire 30-days after the primary.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Gov. Rick Scott has signed legislation into law that will allow for the creation of of a task force to review the development of an <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/scott-signs-last-of-2016-bills-overseas-military-o/nq6QR/">online voting system</a> for overseas military voters.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana</strong>: With the support of Secretary of State Tom Schedler, legislation allowing students at Louisiana state colleges and universities to use their <a href="http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/louisiana/2016/04/20/bill-make-voting-easier-college-students-sails-through-committee/83294846/">college-issued ID</a> to cast a ballot is quickly making it’s way through the state Legislature.</p>
<p>Also in Louisiana, a constitutional amendment that would have required people seeking appointment as parish registrar of voters to <a href="http://www.americanpress.com/news/local/20160420-Registrars">meet a set of qualifications</a> failed to reach the 70-vote mark (67-23) in the House.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: According to recent reports, despite a busy calendar, legislation to <a href="http://www.dglobe.com/news/4011769-primary-vs-caucus-state-legislature-governor-seem-ready-make-change">switch from caucuses to primaries</a> beginning in 2020 is moving quickly both through the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-Farmer-Labor controlled Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: State Sen. Bill Seitz has introduced legislation that would change state law to require a cash bond before a judge could <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/news/politics/elections/ohio-republicans-want-cash-for-longer-voting-hours/138516731">order polls to stay open</a> past the scheduled closing time. The law also would set a higher standard for proving the need for longer hours and would allow for the immediate appeal of any ruling that extends poll hours.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: State Rep.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona: </strong>The Democratic Party and the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-party-and-clinton-campaign-to-sue-arizona-over-voting-rights/2016/04/14/dadc4708-0188-11e6-b823-707c79ce3504_story.html">suing Arizona over problems voters—mostly in Maricopa County—faced during the March primary</a>. The state’s “alarmingly inadequate number of voting centers resulted in severe, inexcusable burdens on voters county-wide, as well as the ultimate disenfranchisement of untold numbers of voters who were unable or unwilling to wait in intolerably long lines,” the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>In other primary lawsuit news, Judge David Gass <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/The-Latest-Judge-won-t-immediately-toss-primary-7258095.php">refused to dismiss</a> a case seeking to throw out the results of the March 15 primary. He said he will hold an evidentiary hearing on Monday, April 25.</p>
<p>In yet more Arizona litigation news, on Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the state’s voting map and the legality of the <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/276974-supreme-court-upholds-arizona-voting-map">nonpartisan redistricting commission</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong>: The U.S. Department of Justice informed Connecticut officials that it is <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-motor-voter-probe-20160420-story.html">investigating the state’s participation in Motor Voter</a>. The April 15 letter says, in part: This is to notify you that I have authorized a lawsuit against the state of Connecticut and appropriate state officials to enforce compliance with Section 5 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993,&#8221; which applies to local &#8216;motor voter&#8217; programs in the states,&#8221; Vanita Gupta, a deputy assistant U.S. attorney general, wrote April 15 to Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: Following a four-hour hearing there was still no decision on a preliminary injunction to block Kansas’ <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kansas-voterid-idUSKCN0XB17F">proof-of-citizenship</a> law. The ACLU, which sued the state in February to stop the law, hopes for a ruling before elections in August and November.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The secretary of state’s office lost a long-running lawsuit over <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-loses-appeal-of-duran-era-case-on-illegal-voting/article_e13e43b0-7847-50b0-9c13-8f283b66a86d.html">legal fees in a public records case</a> that the ACLU filed against former Secretary of State Dianna Duran. According to the Santa Fe New Mexican, the original case stems from Duran’s since-discredited claims that 117 non-citizens voted in 2011. The state will now be required to reimburse the ALCU more than $90,000.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: According to <em>The New York Daily News</em>, more than 200 New York voters have joined a lawsuit claiming their party affiliations on their voter registration was changed without their consent and therefore they were unable to vote in this week’s primary. The suit calls for New York to be an <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hundreds-ny-voters-file-lawsuit-alleged-voter-fraud-article-1.2603876">open primary state</a>, allowing anyone to vote in primaries regardless of party affiliation.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: The Public Interest Legal Foundation, on behalf of the Virginia Voters Alliance Inc., has sued Anna Leider, the general registrar of voters for the City of Alexandria. The suit alleges that Leider <a href="http://www.alexandriagazette.com/news/2016/apr/14/alexandria-brief-lawsuit-filed-against-general-reg/">did not maintain proper voter rolls</a> with the city having more registered voters than eligible citizens.</p></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Rhode Island</strong>: Rhode Island has launched a <a href="http://wpri.com/2016/04/15/voter-info-goes-mobile-with-new-state-website/">new mobile version of the state’s Voter Information Center</a> that allows voters to check their registration status, look up their polling place and view a sample ballot. The Voter Information Center is available in English and Spanish, and has constantly updated, customized information for upcoming elections. “We live in a mobile-driven society and I have made it a priority to modernize our elections so that folks can find the information they need, when they need it,” Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea told WPRI.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Wisconsin: </strong>According to the <em>Green Bay Press Gazette</em>, Brown County is seeking $100,000 in taxpayer funds to <a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/17/brown-county-voting-system-almost-failed/82995818/">replace the county’s aging voting system as soon as possible</a>. County Clerk Sandy Juno said the county had hoped to get through the 2016 election cycle with the existing system, but a system failure during testing before the March primary mean Juno wants to make the change now. &#8220;We need to take care of this right away,&#8221; Juno told the paper. &#8220;It&#8217;s an emergency.&#8221;</p></p>
