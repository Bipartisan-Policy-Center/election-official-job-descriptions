							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Using LinkedIn to recruit poll workers</strong><br /><em>Site is second-most used social-networking site</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:david.alan.levine@gmail.com">David Levine<br /></a>Special to electionlineWeekly</p>
<p>Recruiting enough qualified poll workers for any election, let alone a presidential election, is a daunting challenge for many jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Of the 43 election administrators the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference on State Legislatures</a> (NCSL) has interviewed in the last few years, 15 ranked poll worker recruitment as their biggest challenge.</p>
<p>While there is no silver bullet that will make the problem disappear, one approach used by some jurisdictions – and which could be used by more – is recruiting poll workers through LinkedIn.</p>
<p>There are 10 ways election officials can use LinkedIn to recruit more and/or better poll workers. These ways are innovative and unique; sustainable and effective; offer a “big bang for buck” and can be readily duplicated or increased in scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> is a business-oriented social networking service used primarily for professional networking, particularly recruitment. Reaching out to individuals to hire (and be hired) is its sweet spot. In fact, 22 percent of Internet users over age 18 have used LinkedIn, making it the second-most used social network among adults (after Facebook).</p>
<p>Here are 10 ways election administrators can use LinkedIn to recruit poll workers:</p>
<ol>
<li>To develop and expand a personal network of individuals to whom an office can send a request for a referral of a recommended poll worker for a particular position. LinkedIn has members from all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies, encompasses 130 different industries, and includes well over 100,000 recruiters. Developing such a network through LinkedIn could, for example, help recruit bilingual poll workers to assist voters who aren’t comfortable conversing in English.
<p>Having such a network also allows you to build a virtual referral chain, so that people will actually make referrals – taking the time to think of possible candidates/prospects in response to a query, or even proactively referring people to you when they hear of a need.</p>
</li>
<li>To stay in touch with previous colleagues for potential future employment relationships. LinkedIn helps professionals stay in touch with people who have worked for them or with them in the past. These people could themselves be future poll workers and/or provide referrals to potential poll workers.
</li>
<li>To actively search for candidates among LinkedIn members by searching on keywords for people who include the required qualifications in their LinkedIn profiles. Professionals on LinkedIn are encouraged to develop keyword rich, comprehensive profiles. Election officials need poll workers who possess a variety of skills, such as people skills, customer service, and problem solving. LinkedIn allows elections officials to search for individuals who possess the right combination of skills and experience. Election officials need to be sure to share their contact information on LinkedIn to make it easier for prospective poll workers to contact them.
</li>
<li>To develop a complete, keyword-rich profile for your office on LinkedIn. People looking for employment on LinkedIn also search LinkedIn by keywords. They may be looking at company profiles to make up lists of companies for whom they’d like to work, or browsing for opportunities that could use someone with their background.
<p>Some will say that poll work is different than typical employment opportunities because it’s temporary and pays relatively little. That’s true. However, there are a number of reasons someone might be interested in serving as a poll worker. It may help an individual acquire experience that he/she doesn’t already have, such as management skills if he/she becomes a chief judge. It allows people to give back to the community in a tangible, positive way that’s bigger than themselves. People from all walks of life volunteer for a variety of causes, including helping out at a local church, assisting a schools PTA, or serving on the board of an organization. Being a poll worker can offer similar benefits and satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>To identify potential poll workers who contact you through LinkedIn’s mailing system, Inmail. Such individuals could be social media savvy candidates who can help you in on election day if there’s critical information that needs to be disseminated quickly, such as inclement weather or a power outage at a polling place. An efficient way to get the word out is via social media, so a LinkedIn-native poll worker would be an asset.
</li>
<li>To search for potential poll workers by past or current employer, such as other election or government offices. It’s important not to re-invent the wheel unnecessarily. For example, there are myriad civic-mind organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, that deploy large groups of individuals to assist voters in the run up to and on Election Day. Identifying these individuals, contacting them and showing them how serving as a poll worker would build on their previous experiences is critical. It gives election officials access to workers who are passionate about elections, and increases the experience and diversity of the workforce.
</li>
<li>To search for poll workers based on recommendations and references from sources you trust. In the past, the predominant way an employer would get a prospective candidates’ references – and an affirmation for their previous job performance – was to ask for references towards the ends of a candidate’s application process. With LinkedIn, employers can often see some prospective employees’ references right on their profile, which is far more efficient, and makes it easier for election officials to quickly determine if a prospective poll worker is qualified.
</li>
<li>To ask current co-workers to activate their networks to reach out to potential passive poll worker candidates for jobs. As election officials know all too well, not everyone is actively looking to be a poll worker. But many people are open to discussing the opportunity, and your co-workers can help make the case to others about why being a poll worker is a good opportunity. It allows certain folks to get community service credit and others to be paid a little money. It allows some individuals to meet new people and others to reunite with old friends and/or colleagues. Employee referrals are valued because most employees will only refer people with whom they want to work.
</li>
<li>To use Inmail, the internal inbox at LinkedIn, to request assistance from your network or selected professionals to find qualified candidates for the positions (such as Chief Judge) that require more experience and more technical skills. In fact, 38% of college-educated adults have used LinkedIn, making it an ideal social network to find more skilled poll workers. Additionally, LinkedIn is the only social network with more 50-to-64 year-olds than 18-to-29 year-olds, making it more likely to find people with management experience to staff your polling place.
</li>
<li>To join groups at LinkedIn. Participants in groups may share interests, memberships, specializations, backgrounds, and experience that you seek in a potential employee. Group members may also know of a potential employee with the profile you seek.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many, many ways to recruit poll workers. They can come from a jurisdiction’s internal database, referrals, cold-calls, or other non-online networking associations, to name a few. LinkedIn is not a substitute for these, but it is a serious recruit networking source that jurisdictions can use efficiently and at low cost to fill their poll worker ranks.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>Voters in four more states — Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York — went to the polls this week to cast their primary ballots. Like many other non-presidential primaries this year, the story was the same — low turnout.</p>
<p>The day was relatively uneventful, but there are a few election administration stories worth noting.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160913/ri-primary-new-voting-machines-appear-to-pass-test">Rhode Island</a>, the state launched it’s new voting equipment and by all accounts, things seemed to go relatively well with the 600 new machines.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/1085127-469/nashua-voters-satisfied-with-new-polling-sites.html">Nashua, New Hampshire</a>, voters appeared pleased with two new polling locations that are now in school buildings instead of churches as they had been for the last two election cycles.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.nh1.com/news/absentee-ballots-too-wide-for-counting-machines-replacement-ballots-sent-out/">absentee ballots</a> did have to be hand counted in New Hampshire after new ballots had to be sent out because the originals were too large to fit through counting machines.</p>
<p>Elections officials in Delaware are investigating why the <a href="http://www.wdel.com/story/77181-delaware-dept-of-elections-investigating-website-crash-during-returns">state’s website crashed multiple times</a> Tuesday night. Although traffic to the site was high from those seeking results, the state’s election commissioner said the crashes should not have occurred. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it was massive demand, but also we have DTI looking into it&#8221; Commissioner Elaine Manlove told WDEL. &#8220;We thought we were covered for that, and DTI&#8217;s working on why we were not,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And Tuesday marked the first election in Delaware where <a href="http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/delaware/item/97161-ex-offenders-head-to-polls-during-delaware-primaries">ex-offenders who had completed their sentences but still owed financial restitution were able to vote</a>. According to WHYY, one such voter Haneef Salaam, had not been able to vote since 2004 because although he completed the terms of his sentence, he still owed $100 in judicial fees. When he exited from the voting booth on Tuesday, election staff cheered and congratulated him. “It felt so good, everyone was happy for me. I was shocked, I didn’t think they would be so happy to see someone voting for the first time,” Salaam told the station. “It felt awesome, I felt so empowered to be able to have my voice heard for the first time ever.”</p></p>

														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>University of Wisconsin-Madison students who lack the proper ID to vote will be able to get the <a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/uw-madison-students-can-get-voter-ids-at-polling-places/article_03d3ceda-e77d-5052-b88f-78be31c75eab.html">proper credentials printed for them at the polling place on Election Day</a>. The University, which created a special voter ID card just for students will offer ID service stations at all camp polling sites. &#8220;It means you can just tell students, go to the polls and vote. Don’t worry about it,&#8221; Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell told <em>The Capital Times</em>. &#8220;That&#8217;s really kind of an important shift when we’re talking about voter ID. Voting’s easy. If there are any problems, they can be resolved at the polls.&#8221;
</li>
<li>It may not be as exciting as receiving the Sears Roebuck &amp; Company Christmas Wishbook Catalog from days of yore, but this year’s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-voter-guide-november-ballot-20160909-snap-story.html">California statewide voter guide is probably as big as a Christmas catalog</a>. Thanks to 17 statewide ballot propositions this year’s guide is 224 pages—a length that the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> believes may the longest in election history. “It could have been worse,” Kim Alexander, president of the nonpartisan California Voter Foundation told the paper. The guide, which will end up taking about seven weeks to produce and mail, will set taxpayers back about $15 million.
</li>
<li>In other historically long news, this year’s general election ballot in Snohomish County, Washington is <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/news/ballot-for-nov-8-general-election-is-packed/">the longest general election ballot in history and will cost voters $0.68 to mail</a>. The ballot is so long, that the marquee race—the presidential contest—won’t appear on the front page of the ballot because state law requires ballot measures to appear on the front of the ballot and there are 16 this year. “We were afraid that would happen,” Snohomish County Auditor Carolyn Weikel told <em>The Herald</em>. “This is the largest and longest ballot we’ve had in at least 10 years.” There are so many items, three columns are required to get everything onto the 18-inch, double-sided sheet of paper. By comparison, the two-sided primary ballot had two columns and ran 19 inches long.
</li>
<li>And because we just had to share this! Kolbotn, Norway has <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/68214-darkthrone-frontman-glyve-fenriz-nagell-involuntarily-elected-to-local-office/?mbid=social_twitter">a new backup representative</a> on its town council and he’s none-too-pleased about the situation. Glyve Nagell, a black metal star told <em>Clyrvnt</em> that he jokingly allowed to add his name to the list of those who would serve as backup representative. “My campaign was a picture of me holding my cat saying, ‘Please don’t vote for me.’ But people just went nuts,” Nagell told the magazine. Fenriz will have to serve as a backup representative for four years. “I’m not too pleased about it. It’s boring,” Nagell told the magazine. “There’s not a lot of money in that, either, I can tell you!” (H/t Sam Derheimer for this news tip).

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has reintroduced the Senate version of the <a href="http://madisoncountycourier.com/?p=73001">Voter Empowerment Act</a>. Eleven senators—all Democrats—signed onto the bill. The Voter Empowerment Act addresses the major delays and barriers that which from around the country experienced during the 2012 election cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> By a 24-7 vote and citing recent problems with a House race in St. Louis, the Senate voted to overturn Gov. Jay Nixon’s (D) <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-legislature-overrides-nixon-s-veto-of-voter-id-bill/article_c98fc4f9-b85b-5810-9ccd-1e28d62f2651.html">veto of voter ID legislation</a>. The charge to overturn the veto was lead by Sen. Will Kraus (R-Lee’s Summit) who recently lost a primary bid to serve as secretary of state.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: As electionlineWeekly goes to press, the New Jersey Assembly plans to challenge Gov. Chris Christie’s (R) of a bill that would have <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/democrats_plan_override_vote_of_christies_veto_on.html">automatically registered</a> residents to vote when conducting business with the state’s driver’s license division. According to <em>New Jersey.com</em>, the Assembly may have enough votes. There were 54 &#8220;yes&#8221; votes in the Assembly when it passed in June – the veto-proof majority necessary in the 80-seat house.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Litigation</strong>: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against Alabama, Georgia and Kansas from requesting <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/10/493405211/court-blocks-proof-of-citizenship-requirement-for-voters-in-3-states">proof-of-citizenship</a> from voters when registering using the federal voter registration form. The ruling orders the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to remove &#8220;from the state-specific instructions those requirements directing voter registration applicants to submit proof of their U.S. citizenship.&#8221; Forms submitted since the requirement was introduced in January &#8220;should be treated as if they did not contain the now-stricken state-specific instructions,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The Democratic National Committee has settled part of a lawsuit it filed in U.S. District Court in April following the state’s presidential primary. The suit argued that voters were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-arizona-idUSKCN11G04J">disenfranchised because Maricopa County</a> dramatically reduced the number of poll sites available. As part of the settlement, Maricopa County election officials agreed to consider the Democrats&#8217; recommendations on polling place queuing and the use of electronic management systems.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed suit against the state arguing that Georgia’s <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/georgia-voter-registration-process-violates-the-law-lawsuit-claims/445923905">voter registration process</a> violates the Voting Rights Act and has prevented thousands of eligible voters from becoming registered. The suit alleges that Georgia’s strict match rule incorrectly eliminates thousands of potential voters.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court refused to allow Michigan to enforce a ban on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rejects-michigan-ban-on-straight-ticket-voting/2016/09/09/7ce6bff6-7533-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html">straight-ticket voting</a>. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, the justices declined to get involved, but gave no reason for turning down the state’s request that it be allowed to enforce the ban. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have granted the state’s request but also did not reveal their reasoning.</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, voter Joel Crookston filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/09/13/michigan-man-sues-for-right-to-take-ballot-selfie.htm">ballot selfie law</a>. Under Michigan’s current law, penalties for taking a ballot selfie can include a $500 fine and having the ballot in question disqualified.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> With absentee voting already underway, the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that the St. Louis Board of Elections improperly accepted absentee ballots in a House race and that the <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/appeals-court-oks-re-do-primary-78th-house-district#stream/0">special election may proceed</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> This week the Montana Supreme Court ruled that Roger Roots, a Libertarian <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article101583637.html">candidate for secretary of state</a> may remain on the November ballot.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: On Tuesday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments about the constitutionality of New Hampshire’s <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/appeals-court-consider-ban-voter-selfies-n646866">ban on the ballot selfie</a>. Social media site Snapchat is one of the groups pushing for the end of the ban.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/trial-in-paterson-election-fraud-lawsuit-slated-to-start-on-monday-1.1657667">trial in the city of Paterson</a> got underway this week in the city’s 2nd Ward city council race. This is the second time in two elections cycles a race for this seat went to court.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The New Mexico Supreme Court heared arguments this week regarding whether <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/843045/high-court-to-hear-case-on-election-law-amendments.html">constitutional changes that received majority support from voters, but did not reach the 75 percent threshold are actually in effect</a>. The League of Women Voters, which brought the lawsuit, argues that the state Constitution makes it clear that changes to the Constitution that deal with voting and education require the proposition to meet the 75 percent threshold. “If we’re not restricting people’s voting rights, it seems to me a majority of the people ought to be able to expand the rights and modernize the language,” state Sen. Daniel Ivey-Soto, D-Albuquerque, a lawyer and former state elections director who is representing the League told the <em>Albuquerque Journal</em>.

<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> This week Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann launched ‘<a href="http://yallpolitics.com/index.php/yp/post/44896/">Y’all Vote</a>’. The site allows citizens already registered to vote update their registration information. The site also provides voters with all the information they may need for the upcoming election. “Making it more convenient for Mississippi voters to change preexisting information, while ensuring the security and accuracy of information submitted, was the ultimate goal of Y’all Vote,” Hosemann said in a statement. “However, there are numerous other benefits, including saving taxpayers’ time and money. We will be able to print less paper applications and process information more efficiently. Voters will not have to pay for postage.” As an aside, can electionline say just how much it loves the name!</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> A <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/politics/article/Challenger-Podlodowski-discovers-loophole-in-9213802.php">back-end pathway into the state’s voter registration database</a> was discovered and closed last week. According to the <em>Seattle Post Intelligencer</em>, the information accessible via the back-end pathway included voters’ personal cell phone numbers, personal email addresses, ballot delivery types and the coding used to message military and overseas voters. &#8220;We want to make it clear that this was neither a security breach nor a hack of the voter system,&#8221; said the secretary of state&#8217;s release.&nbsp; &#8220;Also, no otherwise protected personally identifiable information, such as Social Security or driver&#8217;s license numbers, was ever accessible.&#8221;</p></p>
