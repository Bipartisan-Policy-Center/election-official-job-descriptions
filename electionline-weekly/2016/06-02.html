							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calling all election geeks (present and future)</strong> <br /><em>The University of Minnesota wants you!</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:dchapin@umn.edu">Doug Chapin<br /></a>Election Academy, <a href="http://www.hhh.umn.edu/center-study-politics-and-governance/election-academy">Humphrey School of Public Affairs</a></p>
<p>Now, more than ever, there is attention to the field of election administration and the people who keep the nation’s democracy – and the voting systems that support it – running, and running well.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was <a href="http://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/2015/07/08/humphrey-school-launches-first-of-its-kind-online-program-to-train-election-administrators-throughout-u-s/">pleased to announce</a> that the University of Minnesota had approved an online <a href="http://www.hhh.umn.edu/electioncertificate">Certificate in Election Administration</a>, which would allow students to complete a program of courses culminating in a Regents-approved graduate certificate. Courses are offered entirely online, with weekly self-paced assignments and discussions leading to a final paper, project or exam.</p>
<p>The program is aimed at three communities of people:</p>
<ol>
<li>Current election administrators who seek to expand or deepen their knowledge of the field, especially those who seek to place their state/local experience into a larger national and theoretical framework [NOTE: We know that this fall is likely not the best time for many of you, but going forward we can offer group rates for jurisdictions or other organizations who enroll 5 or more students];
</li>
<li>Present or future graduate students in public administration or other disciplines who wish to use the skills they’re developing to help form the next generation of election administrators nationwide; and
</li>
<li>Professionals in other fields – law, design, information technology, journalism, etc. – who are interested in bringing their skills and experiences to the field of elections and want to put them into context and/or who wish to gain a deeper understanding of election administration as part of their ”day jobs”.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are also deeply interested in finding ways to reach students interested in civic engagement – particularly those from traditionally-underrepresented communities, where training and education in election administration becomes not only the basis for a lifelong career but a means to making the profession look more like the population of voters it serves.</p>
<p>Registration is now open for students nationwide for Fall 2016 for three courses:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PA 5971 – Survey of Election Administration | Doug Chapin (3 credits)</strong></span><br />Comprehensive course on the general building blocks of election administration from voter registration to recounts [offered Fall and Spring] [NOTE: this course is also open to undergrads and is an excellent way to dive into the current debates over election administration across the nation!]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PA 5972 – Elections and the Law) | Doug Chapin (3 credits)</strong></span><br />An introduction to legal concepts and structures, aimed at helping election administrators work effectively for – and against- the lawyers they encounter on the job [offered Fall and Spring]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PA 5973 – Politics, Policy and Election Administration | Larry Jacobs (2 credits)</strong></span><br />Lively and penetrating dive into the big arguments about democracy that help administrators frame concrete decisions about how to organize and administer elections.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PA 5975 – Election Design | Dana Chisnell and Whitney Quesenbery (2 credits)</strong></span><br />An introduction to design concepts coupled with opportunities to apply them to problems and projects related to the field of elections.</p>
<p>In addition, we have several courses under development for Spring 2017 and beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Analysis in Election Administration | Tammy Patrick (2 credits)</li>
<li>Voter Participation and Community Outreach | TBD (2 credits)</li>
<li>Budgeting | TBD (1 credit)</li>
<li>Organizational Management | TBD (1 credit)</li>
<li>Communication | TBD (1 credit)</li>
<li>Capstone Project in Election Administration | Staff (2 credits)</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, as the program grows, we have plans to expand our offerings to match the evolving nature of the field … please let us know if there are one or more topics, not listed above, that you think would be a good basis for a course for you and your peers. We’re also open to partnering with specific states and localities to assist with regular training or updates for your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, I’m very excited to be a part of a project aimed at broadening educational opportunities in election administration to reach the next generation of election officials. Come check us out, and tell your friends and colleagues to do so as well &#8211; the University of Minnesota wants you!</p>
<p>To learn more, please visit our <a href="http://www.hhh.umn.edu/certificate-programs/certificate-election-administration">webpage</a> or contact <a href="mailto:dchapin@umn.edu?subject=Interest%20in%20UMN%20Certificate%20in%20Election%20Administration%20(electionlineWeekly)">me</a> or my colleague <a href="mailto:chit0018@umn.edu?subject=Interest%20in%20UMN%20Certificate%20in%20Election%20Administration%20(electionlineWeekly)">Lea Chittenden</a> … and thanks to my friend and partner in electiongeekery Mindy Moretti for the opportunity to share with all of you!</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong><br />While the 2016 primary season isn’t quite over yet, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is already looking ahead to 2020 and is advocating that Georgia and other states stick with the <a href="http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/05/26/georgia-eyes-another-sec-primary-in-2020/">SEC Primary</a> that happened this year on March 1.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland<br /></strong>Candidate and former Mayor Sheila Dixon chose <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/politics/bs-md-ci-dixon-no-recount-20160531-story.html">not to seek a recount</a> in the April primary in Baltimore. Dixon lost by about 2,400 votes. The state, which decertified the primary for a review found that about 1,188 provisional ballots were improperly counted. The state has since recertified the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the city Board of Elections has re-certified the election results and I have decided not to seek a recount, the questions surrounding this election must be answered,&#8221; Dixon said in a statement to <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>. &#8220;The irregularities in this election are not acceptable. This process is not over until we can assure every Baltimore citizen that their vote will be counted, not just in this election, but in future elections as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong><br />The North Carolina State Board of Elections has ruled that <a href="http://www.wral.com/some-durham-county-voters-will-receive-new-primary-ballot/15742944/">892 provisional ballots cast during the March 15 primary in Durham County may be recast by mail</a>. According to <em>The Associated Press,</em> the decision by the SBOE came out of an investigation into discrepancies in the primaries that found the state only had physical copies for 980 provisional ballots, despite having approved or partially approved 1,039 provisionals. The new ballots will be sent after the June 7 Congressional primary.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong><br /><strong>The</strong> Oregon Secretary of State’s office released information this week about <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionsstatistics.aspx">the impact automatic voter registration had on the state’s May primary</a>.</p>
<p>According to the most recent analysis by the state Elections Division, 8,135 votes were cast by Oregonians who were registered through the Oregon Motor Voter (OMV) program. With 43,571 eligible OMV voters, this means 18.7 percent of the OMV-registered voters who were eligible to vote on May 17th (registered by April 26th) participated in the primary election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s important to keep in mind that the population of voters registered through Oregon Motor Voter made up about two percent of the electorate in the recent primary election,” Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins said in a statement. “This is a very small number in an election that saw the largest number of primary voters in Oregon’s history. We have made some interesting observations on this population, but these numbers are only the first glimpse of how Oregon Motor Voter might result in more participation.&nbsp; We look forward to doing more analysis after the November General Election and in the years ahead.”</p>
<p>Other analysis shows that voters who chose to register with a political party voted at higher rates than did nonaffiliated voters. Nonaffiliated voters who registered through OMV voted at a rate of about 6 percent whereas nonaffiliated voters who registered through other means voted at a rate of about 22 percent.</p>
<p>“This election gave us our first metric to assess participation by new OMV voters – but it will take a number of election cycles for the exact effects of the program to be analyzed. I think we can say: so far, so good. But we have a lot to learn over the next several election cycles as this pioneering program becomes the norm for voter registration in Oregon,” said Atkins.&nbsp;</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark is hoping to avoid some of the confusion voters saw in the March presidential preference primary by including information on new voter cards that <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/new-voter-id-cards-in-pinellas-include-closed-primary-reminder/2279668">reminds voters that Florida is a closed primary state</a>. Clark’s office will mail 623,000 voter cards during the next few weeks in an effort to notify voters before the Aug. 1 deadline to change parties.
</li>
<li>Secretary of State Steve Simon announced this week that Minnesota would allow <a href="http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/05/31/veteran-id-same-day-registration/">Veteran ID cards as an acceptable form of identification</a> — combined with authorized proof-of-residence — for same-day registration.
</li>
<li>According to a new poll by <em>The Associated Press</em>-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, many <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/americans-want-presidential-nomination-system-changed-poll-says-1.1608140">Americans are not happy with the way the presidential candidates are chosen</a> and have little faith in the fairness of either party system. According to the survey, the public prefers open primaries to those that are closed to all but party members. They like primaries instead of caucuses, and they oppose the party insiders known as superdelegates, who have a substantial say in the Democratic race.
</li>
<li>The Cookeville, Tennessee <a href="http://www.cookevillehistorymuseum.com/">History Museum</a> has debuted a new exhibit—<a href="http://herald-citizen.com/stories/new-exhibit-brings-election-process-to-life-for-kids,15506">My Vote is Power! An Exhibit for Kids</a> — that aims to give those too young to vote a hands-on experience with the voting process and being a citizen. “Politics can get kind of heavy, but we want this to be fun and hands-on for the kids,” Ashley McKee, education specialist, told the <em>Herald-Citizen</em>. The exhibit will allow students to cast a ballot, dress up as famous presidents and first ladies, design their own political posters and spend some time in the reading nook. “Kids will have an opportunity to cast their vote, design a poster, enjoy some quite time in our reading nook, become a historic or patriotic figure in the dress-up area and have fun with our light-hearted introduction to the election process,” Museums Manager Beth Thompson told the paper.

<li><strong>Personnel News</strong>: Hays County, Texas Elections Administrator <strong><a href="http://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/news/cowan-says-shell-retire-end-2016">Joyce Cowan</a></strong> has announced that she will retire at the end of 2016 after more 30 years on the job.</li>

He&#8217;s irreplaceable, but our loss is the EAC&#8217;s gain,” said David Becker, director, election initiatives. “And I know we&#8217;ll all continue to benefit from his insight in his important new role.”</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson has introduced the “No One Can Take Away Your Right To Vote Act” in Congress that would restore voting rights to more than a million Floridians. Under the legislations, <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/fl-grayson-voting-rights-restoration-20160526-story.html">ex-felons would have their voting rights restored</a> upon completion of their sentence. Currently, Florida is one of only three states where convicted felons lose their voting rights forever unless it’s restored by the state.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong>&nbsp; Illinois is poised to become the sixth state to <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/article/20160531/NEWS/160539899">enact automatic voter registration</a> after the state’s General Assembly approved the legislation. The House voted 86-30 this week to send the bill to Gov. Bruce Rauner’s desk. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, Rauner has expressed support of the legislation. People visiting the Department on Aging or the departments of Human Services, Healthcare and Family Services, Employment Security and the Secretary of State&#8217;s office (for drivers’ licenses) could register.</p>
<p>Also in Illinois, the General Assembly approved legislation that will allow <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160601/news/160609850/">17-year-olds</a> who turn 18 by the time of the general election to vote in future primaries. In addition to voting, those 17-year-olds will also be able to serve voter registrars, sign candidates’ nominating petitions and circulate petitions as well. It will also allow 17-year-olds to vote in consolidated primary elections.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> The House Education Committee has approved a bill that would allow university students to use the <a href="http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/louisiana/2016/05/31/house-committee-oks-use-student-ids-voting/85216278/">state-issued college ID in order to vote</a>. The bill would go into effect in 2019. The bill has the support of the secretary of state’s office and all the four-year public universities in the state.</p>
<p>In other news, the state has <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/louisiana-repeals-century-old-voter-registration-requirement/article_c41f5002-71c9-5415-8a72-c6715d3fe376.html">repealed a 142-year-old law</a> that required naturalized citizens to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. The state was facing a lawsuit over the requirement. Secretary of State Tom Schedler supports the lifting of the law. &#8220;Saving taxpayers&#8217; money by avoiding a needless lawsuit was common sense,&#8221; Schedler told <em>The Associated Press</em>. &#8220;My office has already begun the process of communicating with our registrars of voters statewide to make sure they are informed immediately of the change in the law.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: With a 52-21-1 vote, the Assembly approved A-1944 that would require the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to automatically register or update a person’s voter registration as part of the process of apply for or renewing a driver’s license. According to the <em>Bergen Dispatch</em>, the bill that provides that the MVC would <a href="http://bergendispatch.com/articles/37756418/Bill-Creating-Automatic-Voter-Registration-through-MVC-Gains-Assembly-Approval-.aspx">automatically register to vote</a> any person who applies for a special learner’s permit, an examination permit, a probationary driver’s license, a basic driver’s license, or a non-driver identification card, or for renewal of any license or identification card, according to the permanent address provided by the applicant, unless the applicant specifically declines the automatic voter registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in New Jersey, A-3591, the “New Voter Empowerment Act,” which would <a href="http://politickernj.com/2016/05/bill-to-expand-primary-voting-rights-clears-assembly/">allow 17-year-olds to vote in a primary election</a> if they turn 18 by the general election was approved by the Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Legislation that would set a process for state courts to follow when considering whether to grant <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/State/2016/05/31/Bill-would-alter-poll-hour-extensions.html">last-minute extension of voting hours</a>—including a cash bond from the requestor—has been approved by the Legislature and is on the desk of Gov. John Kasich (R). According to the <em>Toledo Blade</em>, a spokesman for Gov. Kasich said he plans to review the bill.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> A 2014 ballot measure—which earned 71 percent approval—that made races for sheriff, tax collector and four other constitutional offices in Orange County nonpartisan was overturned by Circuit Judge Keith White who said the county had <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-orange-partisan-elections-20160527-story.html">no authority to determine how constitutional officers are elected</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The Woodlands Condominium Association in Mays Landing has <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/townnews/politics/judge-to-decide-if-woodlands-polling-place-moves/article_11189bac-235b-11e6-8d8b-dbaa0419b514.html">hosted a polling place for about 24 years</a> and now they no longer want to, citing liability concerns, but the Atlantic County wants them to continue to do so. Judge Mark H. Sandson sided with the condominium association saying that the government <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/private-property-owners-can-say-no-to-hosting-polling-place/article_529663e6-2461-11e6-96d2-43453d9bfbe7.html">cannot force</a> a private property owner to provide a polling place.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> A woman from East Liverpool has been indicted on <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/may/26/east-liverpool-woman-indicted-35-voter-fraud-charg/">35 counts of felony voter fraud</a> — 32 counts of false voter registration and three counts of false signatures.</p>
<p>Also in Ohio, the secretary of state and attorney general have asked a federal court to stay an order to reinstate <a href="http://radio.wosu.org/post/state-asks-stay-early-voting-case">early voting</a> days in Ohio. Both offices have asked the court to postpone the implementation of the order while they appeal to the Federal Appeals Court and at the very least until after the Aug. 2nd special election in Columbus.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> A 12-person jury has found that former Clatsop County Clerk Maeve Kennedy Grimes was <a href="http://www.dailyastorian.com/Free/20160527/former-county-clerk-awarded-more-than-400000">improperly fired</a> following the 2014 general election. She was awarded $400,000 in damages.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The plaintiffs in Virginia’s <a href="http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-voter-id-appeal-20160526-story.html">voter ID</a> lawsuit have filed a notice to of appeal with the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals based in Richmond. The plaintiffs — Democrats — have asked for an expedited review.</p>
<p>The Virginia Supreme Court will hold a <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/article_eb3ad3d2-51be-530c-864e-f45fea4c2dc8.html">special session on July 19</a> to consider a lawsuit filed by state GOP leaders challenging Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s executive order that restored the voting rights to more than 200,000 ex-felons.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Wisconsin’s <a href="http://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-voter-id-trial-wraps-verdict-expected-july">voter ID</a> trial wrapped up last week and although a verdict is expected sometime in July, Judge James Patterson said his decision will come too close to the August 9 primary so the ID law will remain in place for that election at least.</p>
