							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>First systematic evidence says 2016 voting lines were shorter than 2012</strong><br /><em>Overall, average in-person wait time in 2016 was 11 minutes</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:cstewart@mit.edu">Charles Stewart III</a>, Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science<br />Department of Political Science<br />The Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>
<p>In the midst of an election campaign full of concerns over whether voting machines were being hacked and vigilantes would confront voters in polling places, there is good news about the administration of elections in 2016. The first systematic evidence about the experience of voters in the election reveals that lines waiting to vote were shorter than in 2012.</p>
<p>This evidence is contained in the preliminary results from the Survey of the Performance of American Elections, conducted in the aftermath of the 2016 election. This survey, like the ones before it in 2008 and 2012, asked all in-person voters how long they waited in line to vote. (For those interested, the methodology of the SPAE is discussed at the end of this article.)</p>
<p>Overall, the average in-person voter waited 11 minutes to vote in 2016, compared to 13 minutes in 2012 and 16 minutes in 2008. The biggest improvements came in the states that had the longest lines in 2012. Racial disparities were reduced in 2016, though they still remain in some places, especially in early voting.</p>
<p>In 2012, voters from five states and the District of Columbia reported average wait times of greater than 20 minutes — Florida, D.C., Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia, and Michigan. All of these states’ voters reported significant decreases in average wait times in 2016. The most dramatic decrease came in Florida, which fell from an average of nearly 45 minutes in 2012 down to 8 minutes in 2016.</p>
<p>In past years there have been significant differences in wait times, comparing Election Day and early voting. For instance, in 2012 Election Day voters waited an average of 13 minutes to votes, compared to 20 minutes for early voters. These differences virtually disappeared in 2016, with Election Day voters waiting an average of 11 minutes to vote and early voters waiting 13 minutes.</p>
<p>Of great concern in the past have been racial discrepancies in wait times. These discrepancies were reduced in 2016, though not eliminated entirely. In 2012, whites waited an average of 12 minutes to votes, while Blacks waited 22 minutes. In 2016, average wait times for whites declined to 10 minutes, while the average wait time for Blacks declined to 16 minutes.</p>
<p>The report of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration declared that no voter should wait more than 30 minutes to cast a ballot. Although wait times in 2016 were significantly better than in 2012, the thirty-minute benchmark still has not been achieved in most states. Overall, 9 percent of voters waited more than 30 minutes. In 18 states plus DC, more than 10 percent of voters waited longer than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This analysis was based on data that were literally hot off the press. More work needs to be done to probe the nuances of the data and, perhaps most importantly, explain what accounts for the improvements in 2016.</p>
<p>Upon initial examination, one explanation does not appear to hold much weight. It does not appear that shorter wait times were due to lower turnout or shifting voters out of Election Day into early voting or absentee modes. The sheer number of voters in 2012 was roughly the same in 2016, which eliminates lower turnout as a major contributor to short wait times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the greatest improvements in wait times were in states, such as Florida, where early voting was not significantly different from 2012. Therefore, the most likely explanation for improve wait times in 2016 has to do with capacity building and other administrative improvements. These are factors that will probably not be easily documented through the survey research evidence, but will have to await other forms of investigation to verify.</p>
<p>The SPAE contains a treasure-trove of information about the experience of voters in the past election. Wait times are just one aspect of the election that was documented through this survey project. As the final dataset is prepared and careful examination of the data undertaken, expect more “voter-eye views” of the election to follow.</p>
<p>The Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE) has been conducted following the federal elections of 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The purpose of the SPAE is to document the experience of American voters as they cast their ballots in the federal election. The survey is administered to 200 registered voters in each state plus the District of Columbia, for a total sample size of 10,200. The survey was conducted by YouGov using an Internet panel. Observations have been weighted to provide a representative view of voters in each state. A full report of findings from the SPAE will be published in early 2017. The Survey of the Performance of American Elections was initially designed by members of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project and funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which bears no responsibility for any of the analysis conducted here.</p>

							<h2>Overseas Voting Initiative</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Overseas Voting Initiative</strong></p>
<p><strong>CSG Overseas Voting Initiative working group releases recommendations</strong></p>
<p>LEXINGTON, Ky. — The Council of State Governments Overseas Voting Initiative’s Technology Working Group, during the 2016 CSG National Conference in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, announced <a href="images/TECH_WG_PRINT_MMS_12_5_16.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">recommendations to address challenges facing military and overseas voters</span></a>.</p>
<p>After more than two years of research and collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense’s Federal Voting Assistance Program, or FVAP, the CSG OVI Technology Working Group developed recommendations in three core areas: 1) Unreadable/Damaged Ballot Duplication, 2) Common Access Card/Digital Signature, and 3) Verification and Data Standardization/Performance Metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recommendations from the OVI Technology Working Group for improvement in the UOCAVA (Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) voting process provide real-world examples that will serve as a model for legislators and election officials throughout the country,” FVAP Director Matt Boehmer said. “FVAP and CSG teamed to form the Overseas Voting Initiative three years ago, and we are very encouraged by the OVI&#8217;s progress to date.”</p>
<p>As more ballots are transmitted electronically, there is sometimes a need to duplicate damaged and unreadable ballots so vote tabulators can count the ballots. Among other suggestions, the report provides recommendations related to the ballot duplication process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because UOCAVA citizens and other absentee voters are not marking their ballots in an election jurisdiction and placing them in scanner for review and eventual tabulation, there are a variety of unreadable or damaged ballot issues that can be encountered by election officials that require special attention by their staff members to &#8216;duplicate&#8217; these ballots so they can be correctly tabulated according to each voter&#8217;s intent,” said Marci Andino, executive director of the South Carolina State Election Commission. “Through the CSG OVI Technology Working Group, my colleagues and I developed recommendations in this area to streamline this time-consuming process of ballot duplication to ensure all ballots—including ballots unreadable by scanners and damaged ballots—can be tabulated as the voters intended. I am very pleased to have led the OVI&#8217;s effort in the area of unreadable/damaged ballot duplication while working closely with my very skilled state and local election counterparts from across the country as we developed recommendations to simplify this procedure using technologies and processes that facilitate accurate and efficient ballot duplication.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recommendations also note that leveraging the U.S. Department of Defense Common Access Card, or CAC, ensures election officials can verify an individual’s identity using the best technology possible.</p>
<p>Lori Augino, director of elections in the Office of the Washington Secretary of State, led the subgroup that examined the use of Common Access Card digital signatures to complete election-related activities and provide an option for military personnel to designate their UOCAVA voting status using a state’s online election portal.</p>
<p>“Our fantastic team conducted significant research into this area and listened to many speakers on related topics in order to supply recommendations to state election officials and legislators surrounding use of a CAC digital signature to aid active service members absent from their voting residence who are registering to vote and requesting a blank ballot,” Augino said. “Leading this subgroup was particularly important to me. Our service members are fighting in the far stretches of the world for our freedom. It’s incumbent upon us to remove roadblocks so they can participate in our elections. Technology can help us achieve that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, per the recommendations, capturing the election office-voter interactions in a standard data format allows big data analytics to be used to identify best practices in election administration for military and overseas voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really enjoyed participating in the OVI Data Standardization Subgroup as my Orange County, California, election team and I have been collecting, analyzing and making data available to researchers and the public for many years,” said Neal Kelley, registrar of voters in Orange County, California. “So I see this project as an excellent extension of this work we have been doing. Our group considered the benefits that would be achieved from having a single standard for collecting and reporting UOCAVA-specific voter data at the transaction level—each critical interaction between the voter and state or local election office—and during this review, we identified several important benefits to having a data standard for military and overseas voting, with some of these benefits realized by state and local election offices and others by FVAP and the EAC (U.S. Election Assistance Commission).&#8221;</p>
<p>CSG Overseas Voting Initiative Director Kamanzi Kalisa said the tech-based solutions and associated recommendations leverage existing knowledge and technologies, meaning that state and local election officials can easily implement the recommendations.</p>
<p>“On behalf of The Council of State Governments, I would like to thank Lori Augino, Director of Elections for the New Jersey Department of State Robert Giles and Neal Kelley for their leadership in directing the efforts of our Overseas Voting Initiative Technology Working Group research areas, and all the working group members who have contributed so much to this collaborative work effort that we hope spurs further dialog and action in these key subject areas affecting military and overseas voters,” Kalisa said.</p>
<p><strong>About The Council of State Governments</strong><br />The Council of State Governments is the nation’s only organization serving all three branches of state government. CSG is a region-based forum that fosters the exchange of insights and ideas to help state officials shape public policy. This offers unparalleled regional, national and international opportunities to network, develop leaders, collaborate and create problem-solving partnerships.</p>
<p>In late 2013, CSG entered into a four-year partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense’s Federal Voting Assistance Program to improve the voting process for service members, the families of service members and citizens living abroad. The creation of the OVI Technology Working Group was one component of the partnership. The group comprises state and local election officials from across the country.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recounts Update</strong>: Recounts concluded in several states this week. In <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/partial-recount-nevadans-presidential-ballots-confirms-nov-8">Nevada</a>, the partial recount of the November 8 presidential election concluded with no change in numbers for the candidate requesting the recount. In <a href="http://wnct.com/2016/12/09/stuber-concedes-state-auditors-race/">North Carolina</a> with a statewide recount of the auditor’s race almost complete, Republican candidate Chuck Stuber conceded, bringing the remaining recount to a halt. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/curtains_close_on_michigan_pre.html">Michigan</a> Court of Appeals ordered the state board of canvassers to reject Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s request for a recount of the presidential ballots. The <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/09/michigan-supreme-court-denies-jill-steins-recount-effort/95223122/">state Supreme Court</a> affirmed that ruling Although the recount ended in Michigan, many questions still swirl about the voting process in <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/12/vote-audit/95358702/">Detroit</a> and the state will audit the city’s election. <a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/wisconsin-recount-reveals-small-change-in-vote-count-some-problems/article_545e11e2-16fe-5283-99ad-e6d87a893a3b.html">Wisconsin</a> was the only state to begin and complete a statewide recount of the 2016 presidential election and the recount found only a 131-vote change. &#8220;This was really a remarkable achievement by the county clerks, the canvassing boards, the tabulators, the municipal clerks,&#8221; elections administrator Michael Haas told The Capital Times. The recount did reveal some problems with older voting machines, but no major issues. And in <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/early-returns/2016/12/12/Allegheny-County-pittsburgh-pennsylvania-certifies-election-results/stories/201612120117">Pennsylvania</a>, U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond ruled against the Green Party’s request for a statewide recount. Diamond said that the last-minute tactics would mean “all of Pennsylvania’s six million voters could be disenfranchised.”</p>
<p><strong>The DuPage County, Illinois</strong> board chairman, clerk and election commission have <a href="http://www.mysuburbanlife.com/2016/12/13/dupage-county-proposes-merger-of-clerk-election-commission/ap5lpm9/">formally proposed merging the election commission and the county clerk’s office into one</a>. When introducing the proposal, Chairman Don Cronin said the move could realize a cost savings for the county while expanding the bipartisan board of election commissioners. The proposal, which will need to be approved by the state legislature, would expand the board from three to five members, including two representatives from each major political party, appointed by the County Board chairman, and the county clerk as chairman.</p>
<p><strong>Citing the success of the state’s new</strong> “Motor Voter” program which automatically registers Oregonians to vote, officials announced this week that Oregon <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/12/oregon_voters_shattered_previo.html">shattered the state’s record for voting-age voter turnout</a>. Overall, 70.4 percent of the state’s voting-age population sent in ballots. The previous record, set in 2008, was 66 percent. According to The Oregonian, about 44 percent of the new “motor voters” cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted</strong> announced this week that his office <a href="http://statenews.org/post/secretary-state-tells-legislature-his-office-doesnt-need-money-upcoming-budget">will not seek any operational funds from the state in the next two-year state budget</a> and that he’s asking for a 100 percent cut in his funding. Through a business licensing fees and cost-cutting measures, the secretary of state’s office has a $19 million surplus. “Well, I do want to lead by example in the sense that, let’s face it, if I had asked for an inflationary increase, everyone would have said ‘well, that’s just fine, go ahead, it’s just same old, same old.’ Well we are not going to do the same old, same old. We are trying to act responsibly. We are trying to act differently.”</p>
<p><strong>After a <a href="http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/local/election/printing-firm-agrees-to-cover-burlington-county-s-extra-election/article_4250711a-c174-11e6-9e7d-977766c5fd35.html">printing error</a> forced poll workers</strong> in Hudson County, New Jersey to hand count 20,931 mail-in ballots, the printing firm that made the mistake said it will reimburse the county almost $30,000 in costs that the county incurred from the hand count. According to the Burlington County Times, In addition to being reimbursed by the printer, the County Clerk&#8217;s Office, the Election Board and the Superintendent of Elections Office have identified additional actions and checkpoints that workers will perform before future elections in order to detect a similar error sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes the real news is just as strange</strong> as the fake news. Recently, officials in Douglas County, Colorado told an election judge that he was no longer welcome to work for the county after a member of public heard the election judge boasting that on Election Day he had <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/douglas-county-election-judge-not-welcome-back-after-allegedly-saying-he-destroyed-democrat-ballots">destroyed all the Democrat ballots</a>. Despite the allegations, Douglas County said it knows none of their ballots were destroyed. &#8220;The fact that we received a complaint about the behavior of an election judge is enough to call into question that election judge&#8217;s ability to continue as an election judge in future elections,&#8221; Wendy Holmes, director of public affairs, told ABC7.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: Hays County, Texas Elections Administrator and Voter Registrar <strong><a href="http://haysfreepress.com/index.php/2016/12/14/county-elections-admin-says-goodbye-to-the-race/">Joyce Cowan</a></strong> will retire on December 31 after 31 years on the job. <strong><a href="http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/20161214/longtime-montville-clerk-to-retire-dec-31">Lisa Terry</a></strong>, Montville, Connecticut clerk will retire on December 31 after nearly 20 years on the job.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;VI. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Virginia Sen. Mark Warner (D) has introduced the <a href="https://fairfaxnews.com/2016/12/warner-introduces-fast-voting-act/">FAST Voting Act</a>. The Fair, Accurate, Secure and Timely Voting Act of 2016 would create a competitive grant program—similar to the Race to the Top, encouraging states to aggressively pursue election reform. “The FAST Voting Act addresses these challenges by encouraging and helping states to make voting faster and more accessible through commonsense reforms like reducing long waiting times, expanding early voting opportunities, and eliminating other obstacles that prevent people from exercising their franchise,” Warner said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Rep. Mark Lowery (R-Maumelle) filed a bill this week that would require voters to <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/dec/13/arkansas-lawmaker-files-bill-requiring-document-id/">show a document or ID card to verify their registration</a> — requirements similar to those that were struck down by the state’s Supreme Court in 2014. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to protect the integrity of the ballot,&#8221; he told the <em>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</em>. &#8220;There are a lot of instances in our day-to-day life where photo ID is required, and it just seems to me to not be so big a stretch to say that something as important as a vote be verified by photo ID.&#8221; Lowery told the paper he believes the bill would hold up to a legal argument if it is passed by a two-thirds supermajority.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof said this week that the Senate will not vote on stricter <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan-senate-wont-vote-on-voter-id-foia-picket-bills_">voter ID</a> regulations during the remaining days of the lame duck session.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> A group of activists have drafted a bill that would change the process for how <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/crime/felons-seek-expanded-voting-rights-in-nebraska/article_02037ec4-8f2f-5b8f-8683-762e215cefc4.html">ex-felons voting rights are restored</a>. The activists are currently seeking a senator to introduce the legislation. Currently Nebraska ex-felons must wait two years to have their voting rights restored after the completion of their sentences. Under the proposal, the two-year wait time would be eliminated.</p>
<p>Also in Nebraska, at a meeting conducted by a special legislative committee on election technology, Sen. John Murante said that the state is eyeing a move to <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/all-mail-voting-in-nebraska-on-the-table/article_bc986aa5-ed8e-5186-a242-9846f3eaa154.html">all-mail elections</a> while Sen. Adam Morfled said he would support a hybrid vote-by-mail/vote center plan like in Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Rep. Larry Hall (D-Durham) met a 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline to file elections-related legislation for the upcoming special session. House Bill 5 would <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/democrats-introduce-bills-to-change-voting-hours-create-redistricting-committees/article_db046e17-c6ee-5a25-a72e-7342980009d6.html">restore the hours and days to the early voting period</a> that were removed in 2013 and House Bill 6 would create a nonpartisan redistricting committee.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Rep. Craig Hall (R-West Valley City) has said that he will sponsor legislation that will get rid of the state’s new universal <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/4690723-155/after-long-election-lines-lawmaker-looking">vote-by-mail system</a>. “Some people love vote-by-mail, and that’s great, but some people have absolutely no interest in voting by, and we ought to cater to the voter’s preference,” Hall told the <em>Salt Lake Tribune.</em></p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> A Des Moines woman accused of <a href="http://iowapublicradio.org/post/woman-charged-voting-twice-pleads-not-guilty#stream/0">voting twice</a> for Donald Trump has entered a plea of not guilty. She told Iowa Public Radio she voted twice because she was concerned her first vote for Trump would be changed to one for Hillary Clinton, and that “the polls are rigged.”</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Attorney General Ken Paxton has formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the state’s <a href="http://www.caller.com/story/news/local/texas/state-bureau/2016/12/13/paxton-formally-asks-supreme-court-take-up-voter-id/95399148/">voter ID law</a>, which was ruled unconstitutional earlier this year by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. Dept. of Justice has said that the law was passed to disenfranchise African-American and Hispanic voters, but it’s unclear what the DOJ may do/say under a new administration.</p>
<p>Also in Texas. State District Judge Don Witting ruled that Hidalgo County&nbsp;<a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/elections/judge-orders-new-election-in-hidalgo/article_a0ae24e2-c27c-11e6-a410-637a1a75288d.html">must redo a June council election</a> after he found “clear and convincing evidence” that one candidate received votes in violation of the Texas Election Code.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Saratoga Springs prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss a criminal case against a voter who work a <a href="http://fox13now.com/2016/12/09/case-dismissed-against-man-who-wore-make-america-great-again-hat-to-polling-place/">Make America Great Again hat</a> to a polling place during early voting. Tai Ho’o was cited for disorderly conduct after he refused to wear the hat and an argument ensued. The Utah County Clerk and the Lt. Governor’s Office investigated the accusations and determined that because “Make America Great Again” did not specifically name Donald Trump, it didn’t fall under their definition of electioneering.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has turned back a challenge to <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_f0464d2f-fe15-5cbf-b6e3-21e759ae93ed.html">Virginia’s voter ID law</a>. In 2015, the state’s Democratic Party and two voters filed suit alleging that the Republican-controlled General Assembly had enacted the law to disenfranchise voters. In May, after a two-week trial in March, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson upheld the photo ID requirement, and the plaintiffs appealed. This week, a three-judge panel of the Richmond-based appeals court upheld Hudson’s decision. “In sum, not only does the substance of (the law) not impose an undue burden on minority voting, there was no evidence to suggest racially discriminatory intent in the law’s enactment,” Judge Paul V. Niemeyer of the appeals court wrote.</p></p>

<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Secretary of State Brian Kemp is alleging that the state’s voter registration database was the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3148710/security/georgia-says-its-traced-an-attempted-voter-hack-to-dhs.html">target of an attempted hack</a> from an IP address belonging to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. “This morning I sent a letter to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson demanding to know why,” Kemp said in a Facebook post. According to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, the attempted hack took place on November 15. The Department of Homeland Security has informed Georgia election officials that there was <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/feds-state-disagree-attempt-hack-georgia-state-computers/wiGpYlstNl62FdMP3rPBoL/">no attempt to hack</a> into the state&#8217;s election computer system, but did acknowledge an agency employee left an electronic paper trail that might make it appear something nefarious was afoot.&nbsp;</p></p>
