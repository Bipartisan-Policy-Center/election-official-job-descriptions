<p><strong>Five steps to getting online voter registration right<br /></strong><em>Measure twice, cut once princple applies to elections too<strong><br /></strong></em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:davidalanlevine@gmail.com">David Levine</a></p>
<p>Online voter registration has become a “thing” in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>When implemented properly, it makes it easier for voters — especially military and overseas voters — to register.</p>
<p>It also helps maintain the accuracy of voter rolls; reduces the cost of list maintenance; reduces the inherent potential for error in paper-based systems; saves significant amounts of money; reduces delays and congestion at polling places; and improves the voter experience because voters get immediate feedback when they are registered or when their information has been updated.</p>
<p>There are complications and subtleties, but as online voter registration becomes widespread, more ways are emerging to refine the process to better serve voters and election officials.</p>
<p>This piece provides five tips that will help as jurisdictions create an optimal online voter registration system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow as many eligible voters as possible to register online, including those without state-issued IDs.</li>
<li>Have a mobile optimized website that is optimized for smart phones and tablets.</li>
<li>Make the online voter registration website easy to use and understand, including by voters who have disabilities or limited English.</li>
<li>Collaborate with local officials</li>
<li>Make sure your online voter registration website is secure.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Allow all eligible voters to register online<br /></strong>Before 2014, applicants generally could only complete an online voter registration application if they had a signature in the database of their state motor vehicle agency (“MVA”) that could be electronically transferred to complete the application.</p>
<p>By the end of 2014 five states offered citizens without a state ID or driver’s license the opportunity to complete a voter registration over the Internet and this trend will grow because there are several ways to reliably verify an applicant’s identity and eligibility other than a signature from the MVA.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, for example, the state does not collect signatures for voter registration purposes. Instead, it accepts and verifies an applicant’s Social Security number to confirm identify and eligibility.</p>
<p>In both Delaware and Missouri, voters can use a stylus pen or a finger-based signature from their touch-screen devices in lieu of a signature transferred from the MVA.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to allow applicants to attest to the truth of statements in their online application by executing a computerized mark, a process that is fairly common in electronic consumer and real estate transactions.</p>
<p>The online registrant would then supply an actual, “wet” signature at their polling place. This is comparable to HAVA’s requirement that first time voters who have registered by mail present identification at the polling place if they have not already done so.</p>
<p><strong>Develop a mobile-optimized website</strong><br />Having a mobile-optimized voter registration website (“MOW”) is critical because people are increasingly conducting web searches from mobile devices – smart phones and tablets – rather than desktop PCs.</p>
<p>You can create a MOW by adding mobile capabilities to an existing site or developing a mobile version. To determine how mobile friendly a website is, you can conduct a manual inspection of the site on a mobile device and/or using Google’s Webmaster tools, which will show errors that affect the website’s mobile friendliness and suggest fixes.</p>
<p>Having a mobile optimized voter registration website improves the (mobile) user experience and increases the average time a mobile device visitor will spend on the site by presenting information in a complete and usable manner. It produces faster website load speeds, which is both inherently helpful and less likely to result in users abandoning the page. It improves your mobile search engine optimization, which makes it more likely that your website will show up in response to a search for voter registration information.</p>
<p>In short, having a mobile optimized website it makes it more likely that the growing number of voters who access the Internet primarily from smartphones and tablets will get to your website and successfully register there.</p>
<p><strong>Make the online website accessible<br /></strong>People with disabilities often do not have a driver’s license, and/or have difficulty traveling to brick-and-mortar registration sites. So if the goal is registering as many eligible voters as possible, states need to go beyond the legal requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>For example, Indiana utilizes special text-to-speech software for users with visual impairments or reading challenges. And California upgraded its online voter registration application by adding user-friendly enhancements, including a simpler, more intuitive layout, and improved accessibility features.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, online voter registration sites should also be optimized for those whose English language skills are limited. Data from the 2014 American Community Survey shows that over 63 million people (a record) speak a language other than English at home. That number has risen 16.2 million since 2000 and 3.6 million since 2010.</p>
<p>After English, the languages with the most speakers are Spanish (39.3 million) and Chinese (3.1 million), but the largest percentage increases from 2010 to 2014 were among speakers of Arabic (up 29 percent), Urdu (up 23 percent), and Hindu (up 19 percent).</p>
<p>And though certain states, such as California, New Mexico, and Texas, have a larger portion of their population speaking primarily a foreign language, the three states with the largest percentage increase in foreign language speakers from 2010 to 2014 were North Dakota, Wyoming, and Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>Make website easy for election officials to use and understand<br /></strong>In many ways, an online voter registration system can only be as good the local election officials who use it.</p>
<p>In many states, for example, local election officials review online voter registrations before they are entered into a statewide database. If the online registration system isn’t easy for these local election officials to use or understand, applications are less likely to be processed efficiently, and voter rolls are less likely to be updated quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure the online voter registration website is secure</strong><br />Perhaps because the Internet is still relatively new, the public (and elected officials) often have less confidence in the security of online databases than public records.</p>
<p>So even if it were not otherwise important (which it is), building public (and legislator) confidence in online registration requires steps be taken to ensure online voter registration systems effectively protect voters’ private information.</p>
<p>To that end, encryption, Captcha, and other programs can help protect against automated hacking. In the same vein, strategies/tools such as routine audit logs, secure networks, and unique identifiers can help impede unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Interestingly, none of these security measures can be applied with paper registration from.</p>
<p>As of early 2016, online voter registration is a critical component of election administration for most U.S. jurisdictions.</p>
<p>But to realize its full potential for voters, administrators, and other stakeholders, the online process and experience must be upgraded and refined. The five suggestions discussed in this article should make it easier for localities to successfully implement online voter registration, and easier for their citizens to vote.</p>

<ul>
<li>Voter education is an important job for any elections administrator, but at what cost? Recently, Detroit officials approved spending <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/01/21/cost-election-messages-billboards-detroit-skyrockets/79136406/">$900,000 on 21 billboards featuring key voting dates and reminders</a>. The cost has almost doubled from previous years with the contractor citing the number of elections and changes to voting laws. “Detroit has issues with people understanding the rules. &#8230; It’s going to be a hard thing informing voters of no straight-party voting,” Randy Oram president of the billboard company told <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>. Following complaints about the cost, Mayor Mike Duggan <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/01/25/mayor-puts-brakes-elections-billboard-contract/79321374/">pulled the contract</a> for further review.
</li>
<li>Challenges to numerous presidential candidate petitions in <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2016-01-23/petition-challenges-delay-early-voting.html">Illinois may delay early voting and vote-by-mail for up to two weeks</a> elections officials said. Early voting was set to begin on February 4, but objections have been filed to signatures on seven candidates petitions. Until the objections are settled ballots cannot be printed.
</li>
<li>Officials in Washington County, Arkansas were <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/jan/24/retirements-close-county-polling-site-2/?f=news-arkansas">forced to close a polling place</a> in Prairie Grove after five poll workers retired. &#8220;This was unexpected for us to have to do this, but at this point, with the time constraints we are under, this was the best decision for the election commission to make,&#8221; Jennifer Price, election commission coordinator told the <em>Democrat-Gazette</em>.
</li>
<li>Voters are creatures of habit to be sure and change can often bring lots of questions. Such is the case in Benton County, Washington where the county has moved from the traditional sealable secrecy envelopes for ballots to <a href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article56279465.html">open-ended ballot sleeves</a>. The county—like others in Washington—made the move to the open sleeves to save time and money. “For processing on our end, it seems like it will speed things up,” Amanda Garcia, elections administrator for the county told the <em>Tri-City Herald</em>.
</li>
<li>The kids are alright! A couple of stories this week that involved young people and voting that caught our attention. In <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Waller-County-OKs-2-days-of-early-voting-at-6788837.php">Texas, Waller County</a> has agreed to host two days of early voting on the campus of Prairie View A&amp;M University, a historically black campus and the site of voting rights protests in the past. In <a href="http://nashvillepublicradio.org/post/nashville-s-own-rock-vote-pace-teen-registration-record#stream/0">Nashville, Tennessee</a> elections officials are hoping to set a record for the number of teens registered to vote. And students at <a href="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/01/er_cold-case-project/campus.html">Emory University</a> in a class focused on the Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project discovered the long forgotten grave of Isaiah Nixon, a black man who voted in the 1948 Democratic primary in Montgomery County and was later murdered by two white men that night.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona: </strong>Secretary of State Michele Reagan is planning legislation that would <a href="http://www.yourwestvalley.com/valleyandstate/article_c306420a-c079-11e5-949c-33634cb0b528.html">end state funding for presidential preference primaries</a>. If approved, the legislation would save the state about $10 million. Elections Director Eric Spencer said that in addition to a cost savings, the legislation is also being proposed because the state’s largest group of voters—independents—are ineligible to cast ballots in a primary.</p>
<p>In other news, a House committee has approved legislation that would block voter-outreach groups from <a href="http://kjzz.org/content/256033/house-committee-oks-bill-outlawing-early-ballot-collection">collecting and dropping off early ballots</a>. Under the proposal, it would be a felony for anyone but a family member, roommate, caregiver, postal worker or candidate to collect ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Legislation has been introduced that would tweak the calculation used to decide how much <a href="http://news.wfsu.org/post/plan-pay-election-supervisors-more-gets-pushback">supervisors of elections should get paid</a> and increases the base salary.</p>
<p>A bill that would make most <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/secret-voter-data-bill-on-shaky-ground-is-tabled-a-second-time/2262851">public information</a> on Florida voters actually secret has been tabled for a second time, this time by Rep. Thad Altman who introduced the legislation. The bill would have made all 12 million Florida voters&#8217; home addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses secret and was supported by the majority of supervisors in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: The House Elections Committee has agreed to sponsor a proposal put forth by Secretary of State Kris Kobach that would require all counties to <a href="http://ksn.com/2016/01/25/kobach-seeks-to-mandate-audits-of-kansas-election-results/">manually audit 1 percent of election returns</a> beginning in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Rep. Reginald Meeks has introduced House Bill 290 that would allow voters to cast ballots <a href="http://www.hclocal.com/content/early-voting-bill-under-consideration">early in-person without an excuse</a>. The bill would also increase the window of voting in-person absentee to include at least two Saturdays.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: The Maryland Senate has moved a vote to override Gov. Larry Hogan’s veto of <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-maryland-senate-postpones-vote-on-larry-hogans-veto-of-felon-voting-rights-bill-20160121-story.html">ex-felon voting rights</a> legislation to February 5 in order to give the Senate time to fill a vacant seat.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong>: Secretary of State John Gale and Sen. Tommy Garrett introduced a bill that, if approved, would convene a task force to spend 2017 studying the state’s <a href="http://statescoop.com/nebraska-legislature-weighs-future-states-election-technology/">voting technology</a> and investigate whether to move to all-mail voting or even possibly online voting in a few years.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Senate has again approved a <a href="http://www.wcax.com/story/31024047/nh-senate-passes-30-day-residency-requirement-for-voting">30-day residency requirement</a> for voting. The bill, similar to one that was vetoed last year, now moves to the House for consideration and if approved would mean someone who moves the state after October 8, 2016, could not vote in the general election.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, legislation has been introduced that would allow for <a href="http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/nh-bill-would-allow-online-voter-registration">online voter registration</a> in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: A coalition of faith-based groups and tea party members testified against legislation that would create <a href="http://www.the-news-leader.com/latest%20headlines/2016/01/27/faith-based-group-opposes-timing-of-ohio-s-online-voter-registration-bill">online voter registration</a> in the Buckeye State. The groups want the possible move to online voter registration postponed until after the presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>: A move to have all three Philadelphia election commissioners keep <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20160128_Philly_election_chiefs_nix_dock-their-pay_proposal_-_for_now.html">daily work logs</a> — and have their pay docked if they do not — stalled this week for lack of support.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The Committee on Rules and Judiciary has approved legislation that would <a href="http://viconsortium.com/politics/bill-to-create-one-board-of-elections-for-entire-territory-moves-ahead/">merge all three boards of elections</a> into one system that would govern the elections for the entire territory.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: Under Senate Bill 27, absentee and by-mail ballots would be <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/3463045-155/by-mail-ballots-may-come-closer-to">sent out closer to election day</a>. The bill, approved 27-0 by the Senate would allow ballots to be sent three weeks before an election instead of the current four.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections approved legislation that would allow Virginians to cast <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_407dafcb-fb5d-5cfe-aaef-76f104f60756.html">no-excuse absentee ballots</a>. The bill received bipartisan support in the committee and now moves to the full Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: A Senate committee is considering legislation that would change the rules about what types of ID are acceptable for the state’s <a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/ids-from-wisconsin-towns-counties-could-not-be-used-for/article_3d951262-0057-5179-9250-050a93f19ddf.html">voter ID law</a>. Under the proposal, IDs previously issued by towns or counties could not be used to vote, register to vote or obtain public benefits.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama: </strong>U.S. District Judge L. Scott Coogler set a Feb. 11 hearing on Greater Birmingham Ministries’ move for a preliminary injunction that would suspend the <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2016/01/25/judge-sets-hearing-suit-against-alabama-voter-id-law/79299154/">photo identification rule</a> for the March 1 primaries in Alabama. But Coogler&nbsp;said in his order that he could cancel the hearing if he “determines that Plaintiffs’ motion may be decided on the papers.”</p>
<p>In other legal news, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from lawyers representing Shelby County <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/01/us_supreme_court_shelby_county.html">seeking to recover $2 million</a> in attorney fees from the U.S. Department of Justice for the county’s victory in <em>Shelby v. Holder</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: A lawsuit filed against Secretary of State Brian Kemp to compel him to inform voters that their <a href="http://www.ajc.com/ap/ap/georgia/lawsuit-filed-over-release-of-georgia-voters-data-/nqB8C/">data had been breached</a> has been dismissed because the attorney who filed suit against the secretary said the purpose of the suit had been met.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The trial involving the state’s <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/elections/expert-at-voter-id-trial-blacks-are-twice-as-likely/article_7b974cb3-93d2-5a41-8b18-ee3c7156bb92.html">voter ID law</a> kicked off this week with opening arguments and the plaintiffs making their case. Witnesses included the head of the North Carolina NAACP, Charles Stewart from MIT and Barry Burden from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota: </strong>Seven members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa have sued Secretary of State Al Jaeger claiming that recent changes to the state’s <a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/3929782-north-dakota-tribal-members-sue-over-voter-id-laws">voter ID laws</a> infringe on their right to vote. According to <em>InForum</em>, the lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court in Bismarck to find that voter ID requirements passed by the Legislature in 2013 and 2015 “disproportionately burden and disenfranchise Native Americans.”</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: The Shelby County election commission appeared in court this week to defend itself against a <a href="http://wreg.com/2016/01/26/wanda-hablert-election-commission-appear-in-court-over-election-results/">lawsuit filed by a losing candidate</a> who claimed that voting machines were not working properly during the recent election. Losing candidate former city councilwoman Wanda Halbert wants all the county voting machines audited.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Virginia elections officials have urged the Supreme Court to keep in place a new <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/virginia_urges_supreme_court_to_let_redistricting_plan_stand-245556-1.html">court-approved redistricting</a> plan for upcoming congressional elections. According to Roll Call, halting the plan, would again allow “racial packing&#8221; to taint elections following the redistricting that occurred after the 2010 census, the Virginia State Board of Elections said in a brief. The redistricting plan was put in place by a panel of three federal judges.&nbsp;</p></p>
