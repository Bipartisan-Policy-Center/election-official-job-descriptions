							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>EAC hosts 2016 swing state roundtable</strong><em><br />&#8216;Elections in battleground states are like elections on steroids’</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>You’ve planned for it, you’ve dreaded it, and now it’s finally here. 2016. There’s no going back and the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> kicked things off this week with a roundtable discussion of elections officials from nine of the battleground states.</p>
<p>“Even though from the public perspective, it may seem like election season is just beginning, for the election officials, we’ve been preparing for a number of months, even a number of years,” said Moderator <a href="http://elections.kennesaw.edu/">Merle King of Kennesaw State University</a>. “The election cycle is the apex. The finish line.”</p>
<p>The roundtable was held in the Washington, D.C.-area and streamed live on the Internet. The wide-ranging conversation covered everything from social media to emergency contingency planning to technology to media relations to setting standards.</p>
<p>Participants included: Brian Corley, MPA, supervisor of elections, Pasco County, Florida; Pedro A. Cortés, Pennsylvania secretary of state; Luanne Cutler, registrar of voters, Washoe County, Nevada; Matt Damschroder, assistant secretary of state, Ohio; Robert Dezmelyk, moderator, Town of Newton, New Hampshire; Sandra Juno, clerk, Brown County, Wisconsin; Paul Pate, Iowa secretary of state; J. Kirk Showalter, general registrar, City of Richmond, Virginia; and Wayne Williams, Colorado secretary of state.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.eac.gov/roundtable_-_preparing_for_election_2016_in_battleground_jurisdictions/">still watch</a> the whole thing online — and electionline would really encourage you to do so, it was a great conversation and so interesting that we didn’t even check Facebook once while we were watching. Since we think you should watch it, just consider this your Cliffs Notes version of the roundtable.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures in place<br /></strong>If there was one common theme with the entire conversation, no matter the topic, it was be prepared.</p>
<p>“When I started in 1994 we were using brick phones and fax machines. The expectations are higher now,” said <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">Iowa’s Paul Pate</a>. “”We’re focusing more and more on preparing. We spend a lot of time working with our local county auditors. We spent a lot of time on training and training and training to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pascovotes.com/">Brian Corley of Pasco County, Florida</a> noted that emotions are high this year, almost a fever pitch among various stakeholders and that there is literally no margin for error as election administrators this year.</p>
<p>“Standards lead to confidence,” said <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/">Colorado’s Wayne Williams</a>. “There are a host of different challenges, but the bigger issue is working collaboratively with our 64 counties and ensuring that procedures are the same from county to county.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dos.pa.gov/votingelections/pages/default.aspx">Pennsylvania’s Pedro Cortes</a> pointed that there are issues in almost every election in every state and no one, not even Florida wants to be “the next Florida.”</p>
<p>“Everybody expects perfect elections and there is no such thing,” Cortes said. “A good election hinges on a well-informed electorate and properly trained elections officials.</p>
<p>Cortes said it is so important to be consistent with procedures.</p>
<p>“No matter what you do to prepare, plan, test, you need to have a plan B,” said <a href="http://www.newton-nh.gov/Pages/NewtonNH_Webdocs/deptindex">Robert Dezmelyk, moderator, Town of Newton, New Hampshire</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social and traditional media<br /></strong>The panelists all agreed on the importance of keeping the public informed, not just through the traditional media, but also through the use of social media.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how we get there, if the public perceives we are doing something incorrectly or behind the scenes, if the public perceives it, it is so,” said Luanne Cutler, registrar of voters for Washoe County, Nevada. “Make them [the media] our partners to kind of get the word out. We really do know what we’re doing and we’re trying to do the best we can.”</p>
<p>Williams said that it is vital to establish relationships with political reporters before an election. He said it’s important to speak with them and make sure they understand the processes ahead of time because no one has time on election night to explain the nuances of provisional ballots. Reporters are trying to file stories and elections officials are trying to tally the votes.</p>
<p>“Clear, concise, continuous communications with all of your stakeholders. That means we don’t have a whole lot of issues with people understanding,” Cortes said. “The communications office is probably the center of what we do.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/">Ohio’s Matt Damschroder</a> said that one of the interesting things he thinks elections officials are starting to see is that there is no longer the traditional filter of media.</p>
<p>“Voters and elections officials can interact directly,” Damshroder said. “Election officials have a much great duty now to interact directly with the public and its incumbent on the public to get more information directly from the sources to get correct information.”</p>
<p><strong>Voting systems<br /></strong>Aging voting systems is a problem facing many jurisdictions nationwide this year. None of the participants in the panel discussion will be using entirely new voting systems this year, although Colorado’s system is relatively new and in Richmond, Kirk Showalter will be rolling out a new system for the first presidential election.</p>
<p>Listening to the panel discuss how they keep their voting systems up and running reminded us a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver">MacGyver</a>.</p>
<p>“Election officials now have to be sophisticated IT administrators in addition to everything else they have do,” Damschroder said. “Sweat the small stuff because everything is small stuff. All those little things can really add up to make sure their isn’t a larger problem.”</p>
<p>Cutler said her county is fortunate enough to have some extra voting machines so if something happens they can quickly replace a malfunctioning machine.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.co.brown.wi.us/departments/?department=e4cd9418781e">Sandra Juno, clerk, Brown County, Wisconsin</a> having everything available that they need right there in the county has been very helpful.</p>
<p>“We chose to do all of our programming and printing of ballots in Brown County so we have the opportunity if something happens, we can fix it,” Juno said. “We do hire our vendor to send in a staff person to be on site for each election.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.richmondgov.com/content/Registrar/">Richmond’s Kirk Showalter</a> rolled out a new voting system in 2015 and was able to use that additional time to learn about the quirks of the new system so she and her staff can be prepared should there be any issues in 2016.</p>
<p>“There is a good reason why election administrators avoid putting new equipment out in a presidential election year. There are an amazing number of details that go with changing the systems,” Showalter said.</p>
<p>Cortes noted that so much attention has been placed on the aging equipment, but there are still hiccups with brand new equipment, which is why, circling back to earlier discussions, it is so important to have contingency plans.</p>
<p>None of the panelists anticipated any major problems with voting systems in 2016, but the same could not be said for the future if the aging equipment is not replaced before 2018 and 2020. Pate was pretty blunt on this point.</p>
<p>“I’d like to put out an appeal to state legislatures, governors, maybe even Congress,” Pate said. “Funding would be nice.”</p>
<p><strong>The electorate<br /></strong>One of the more interesting topics of conversations was the how has the electorate changed since 2012 and what did the officials envision it looking like in 2016. All the participants almost universally agreed that they are not seeing the interest from young people like they were four, even eight years ago. They all agreed that this could change by November, but early indicators don’t show a large participation by young voters.</p>
<p>“In 2008 and 2012, the level of student involvement was unprecedented, but I am not seeing that so far this year” Showalter said.</p>
<p>Showalter did say that she’s seeing an unusually high number of uniformed and overseas voters getting in touch with her office already even though balloting for the March primary has yet to begin.</p>
<p>Cortes noted that when Pennsylvania’s online voter registration system launched in August of 2015 of the first 60,000 people to register to vote, 3,000 of them were 65+.</p>
<p>“This isn’t going to be the youth vote this year,” Pate said. “It’s the Baby Boomers and little younger.”</p>

<li>According to the <em>Great Falls Tribune</em>, Montana Secretary of State Linda McCulloch has agreed to a meeting with a coalition of voting rights groups that sent her office a letter in late December 2015 claiming that Montana has <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2016/01/04/groups-claims-bumps-road-motor-voter-law/78282304/">not fully complied with sections of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a>—specifically the sections that establish clear voter registration obligations at the Motor Vehicles Department and the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. “We’re finding that the process is not working the way required under the act. People who try to register to vote when they conduct a driver’s license transaction are not being able to register to vote,” said Catherine M. Flanagan of Project Vote.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://kstp.com/news/stories/s4005688.shtml">Minnesota Elections Emergency Planning Task Force</a> has released a <a href="http://archive.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2015/mandated/151344.pdf">report</a> to the Legislature outlining how elections should be held in the event of an emergency. The 14-member task force has been meeting for about a year to come up with the recommendations that include the state and each county having it’s own emergency plan and that the plans must address including the needs of voters with disabilities, ballot security and the process of relocating a polling place in case of an emergency.
</li>
<li>Anyone who has ever done any home remodeling knows what a nightmare it can be — and that it always takes longer than anticipated. Officials in the clerk’s office in Champaign County, Illinois are hoping none of those issues befall them during the <a href="http://www.illinoishomepage.net/news/local-news/making-space-for-more-voters">expansion of their office</a>. We&#8217;re sort of under a hard and fast deadline,&#8221; County Clerk Gordy Hulten told a local television station. &#8220;We start voting for the March primary in this room on February 4, so we need to have everything done and polished and ready for voters by then.&#8221; The expansion will accommodate 10 new staff members and make the voter registration counter accessible.
</li>
<li>In September 2015, Weston, Connecticut Republican Registrar Theresa Brasco and Deputy Republican Registrar Lisa Flanagan each submitted their resignations, effective December 31, 2015 citing a “corrosive and inhospitable” work environment. The pair <a href="http://www.thewestonforum.com/57718/weston-registrars-rescind-their-resignations/">rescinded their resignations last week</a> citing a change in leadership in Weston and the responsibility to their jobs. “Next year is a presidential election year and out of a sense of responsibility to the town — now that the tenor and tone of town hall have improved markedly — we are willing to go back and fulfill our terms,” Brasco said.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida: </strong>Rep. Mike Hill (R-Pensacola Beach) has introduced a constitutional amendment that once again make the <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-should-florida-make-secretary-of-state-an-elected-office-again-20160106-post.html">secretary of state’s position an elected position</a>. If approved by voters, the state would begin elected a secretary of state in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan: </strong>Gov. Rick Snyder (R) has signed legislation that <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/05/snyder-signs-bill-eliminating-straight-ticket-voting/78302866/">eliminated straight-ticket, single-party voting</a> and during the signing, urged the Senate to pass a bill that will allow voters to cast an absentee without providing a reason. Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Snyder are pushing the Senate to approve legislation that would allow for <a href="http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2016/01/michigan_senate_gop_faces_pres.html">no-excuse absentee voting</a>, a provision that was originally enjoined with the straight-ticket voting legislation.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Senate has voted down a bill that would have opened up the <a href="http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/nh-senate-votes-down-bill-to-allow-all-voters-to-vote-through-absentee-ballots">absentee balloting process</a> in the state to all voters and would have allowed the secretary of state’s office to prepare absentee ballots.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Discussion continues amongst state lawmakers about <a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/politics/3917911-voter-registration-discussion-focuses-verifying-residency">whether or not to create a voter registration system</a> for the state, currently the only state that does not register its voters. During the latest round of talks, legislators discussed the state’s de facto voter registration list from the state department of transportation. Some legislators argued that was not a valid list because no one verifies the addresses listed on a license and some are businesses.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina: </strong>Rep. Wendell Gilliard (D-Charleston) has introduced legislation that would create a <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20160103/PC1603/160109939/1177/wendell-gilliard-pay-poll-workers-15-an-hour">Poll Workers Compensation Study Committee</a> to explore the feasibility of paying poll workers $15-an-hour. “If South Carolina hopes to attract such (qualified) people to serve as poll workers, it must be diligent ascertaining and providing a competitive and fair level of compensation to poll workers,” the resolution states. Poll workers currently make $60 a day for training plus $60 for Election Day (less than $6 an hour).</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: A former high school civics teacher turned state representative has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/3382894-155/lawmakers-bill-would-let-17-year-olds-vote">allow 17-year-olds who are 18 by the time of the general election to vote in the primary</a>. Currently 20 states that allow 17-year-olds to pre-register also allow them to vote in the primary if they are 18 by the general.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong>: The Burlington city council is considering moving the city to a <a href="http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/burlington-city-council-look-into-giving-voters-the-option-to-vote-at-any-polling-place">vote center system</a>. The council approved a resolution 10 to 1 to have the board for registration of voters look into what they are calling “universal polling locations.”</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Supreme Court: </strong>The Guardian has an interesting <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/05/edward-blum-voting-rights-act-civil-rights-affirmative-action">profile of Edward Blum</a> who is currently before the court on two cases, including the Texas “one person, one vote” case. Blum also sponsored <em>Shelby v. Holder</em> in 2013 and told the paper, “I think about it a lot, I worry about it a lot. I agonise over this,” Blum told the Guardian. “It may be that one or two of the states that used to be covered by Section 5 has gone too far.”</p>
<p><strong>Florida: </strong>Just before the end of 2015 a Florida judge approved a <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/judge-approves-voting-rights-groups-map-of-senate-districts/2259453">new map of Florida’s 40 Senate districts</a>. The approved map is one that was recommended by a coalition of voting rights groups. Supervisors of elections statewide had pushed for a decision—any decision—to be made so they could prepare for the 2016 election cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona: </strong>The Cochise County Elections Department has launched an <a href="http://www.svherald.com/news/new-interactive-vote-center-map-to-assist-voters/article_5992baa2-b425-11e5-b9bb-9fb8b3758c40.html">interactive map to help voters learn about the county’s vote centers</a>. The map allows voters to see where all the vote centers are located, input their current location to find the closest vote center and get driving and parking information for the vote center they want to visit.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: The secretary of state’s office this week said that the state’s <a href="http://www.news4jax.com/news/politics/florida-remains-on-schedule-for-2017-online-voter-registration">online voter registration system</a> remains on schedule to launch in 2017. &#8220;DOS (the Department of State) has formulated and begun a six-phase development and implementation plan, of which the initial discovery phase is now complete,&#8221; a report released by DOS says.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: Hinds County will not be purchasing an additional 50 <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2016/01/06/county-wont-buy-more-electronic-poll-books/78353284/">electronic poll books</a> in advance of the March 8 primaries because the Democratic Party has said that it will use paper poll books to check in voters instead of the electronic poll books. The Republican Party has not said whether or not they will use them. Hinds County Election Commission Chairwoman Connie&nbsp;Cochran has expressed her dismay at the poll books not being used. &#8220;It would be a step backward,&#8221; Cochran said if electronic poll books aren&#8217;t used.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska: </strong>Hall County has purchased a <a href="http://www.nebraska.tv/story/30857089/hall-county-buys-new-ballot-counting-machine">new ballot-counting machine</a> that the county hopes will speed up the counting process and decrease costs since the machine can process folded ballots and the county is encouraging more people to vote-by-mail. “We’ll do as many as 10,000 ballots in an election cycle, so we’re going to take and cut those postage costs down because we can send it first class now,” Election Commissioner Dale Baker told KNTV. Election Baker has named the machine Annie.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.caceo58.org">Re-Imagining Voting In California</a></strong>: This panel discussion will stear clear of the oft-discussed voting machine issues and will instead focus on how technology in general might improve the process of voting. For instance, there has been progress made in some areas but can we do better? What if there were no barriers? What do voters expect – and how can the technological advances that surround us in our daily lives merge into improving the overall voting experience? We’ll also explore how the media views this topic – and what can be done in the short term versus the long term. It’s exciting to move off of the “constraint” discussion and have a broader dialogue. This event will be webcast live on CACEO’s website, caceo58.org. Viewers are encouraged to join in the discussion using the hashtag #caceoimagine.
