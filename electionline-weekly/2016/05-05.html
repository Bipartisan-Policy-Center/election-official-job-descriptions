							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>EAC hosts public hearing on accessibility</strong><br /><em>Equipment is there, but obstacles remain for voters with disabilities</em></p>
<p>By Dan Seligson</p>
<p>It has been 14 years since the implementation of the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/workflow_staging/Page/41.PDF">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA). It has been almost that long since election officials across the country have worked to implement (and in many cases, replaced and re-implemented), new voting machines, polling place procedures and improved access to polling sites.</p>
<p>Yet, at a public hearing in Boston last week, it became clear that while HAVA has succeeded in many ways – including the mandatory addition of polling place machines that allow voters with a variety of disabilities to vote independently and with confidence that their vote counted – the experience of voting has lagged behind the vision laid out by HAVA.</p>
<p>“One in five Americans have a disability,” said <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> member Thomas Hicks, leading his first meeting as Chair of the commission. “Their voting rights must be honored as vehemently as all others.</p>
<p>Testimony from voters with disabilities from around the country, particularly those with visual disabilities, share a theme: machines that do the job, but many hurdles to clear before getting to use a reliable machine operated by a well-trained, empathetic poll worker.</p>
<p>“The voting machine works well for me,” wrote Frank Welte, a California voter in testimony. “However, at least on three occasions, the voting machine was not set up and operating when the polling place opened…I have ended up waiting quite some time…for poll workers to figure out how to activate the voting machine.”</p>
<p>Erica Jones, a New York voter and advocate for people with disabilities, said her experience was not the independent experience envisioned in HAVA.</p>
<p>“The poll workers were not aware how to operate the accessible Ballot Marking Device. Also, I was not given a private vote as other voters were surrounding the area of the [device],” she said.</p>
<p>“It would be nice if a blind person like myself could use the write-in part of the ballot like everyone else,” said Brian, a voter from New Jersey who did not provide his last name.</p>
<p>For their part, the U.S. Election Assistance Commissioners who held the hearing in Boston said they understood the ongoing challenges in implementing not only the requirements of the federal law, but improving the on-the- ground experience of voters with disabilities on election day. As did <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/eleidx.htm">William Galvin</a>, the top voting official in Massachusetts, who gave a keynote at the beginning of the hearing.</p>
<p>“The creation of [the EAC] came out of an electoral crisis in 2000,” Galvin said. “Sixteen years later, we have made progress but still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Galvin said until 2000, the voting experience of voters with disabilities was “papered over.”</p>
<p>“If you’re like me and you’ve been involved with elections for a long time, you’re so focused on the mechanics and outcome of an election that you don’t take as much time as you should thinking about what the right to vote would mean to individual citizens,” Galvin said.</p>
<p>To that end, some localities are taking steps to train poll workers to assist voters with disabilities exercise their right to vote. A program in Boston, for example, has an additional voluntary training for poll workers, training them to be empathetic and sensitive to the needs of votes with disabilities.</p>
<p>“That training went beyond information about machines and focused on understanding voters with disabilities and how poll workers can appropriately assist them,” said Dion Irish, chairman of the <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/elections/">Boston Elections Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, for its promise, the course is voluntary, designed for once- or twice-a- year temporary citizens who serve as poll workers. And very few, Irish noted, had actually opted to take the training.</p>
<p>Challenges for voters with disabilities have gone beyond machines and poll worker shortcomings. During New England’s nightmarish winter of 2014-2015, election officials struggled to ensure ramps at polling places were clear of snow – then large puddles – on election day in municipalities that hold town elections in March.</p>
<p>And year round, there are often parking shortages, particularly spaces reserved for people with disabilities that are close enough to ramps and doorways.</p>
<p>Most places in California never see a flake of snow. Yet, different challenges continue to hinder voting by people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“Great barriers to access still exist in every region of California,” said Ted Jackson, community organizing director for the California Foundation for Independent Living Centers. “Officials continue to rely on voter education materials that are out of date. Vote-by- mail is not accessible by all. In some places, there is a lack of understanding about how to protect the rights of voters… to read and cast a ballot independently.”</p>
<p>In short, a substantial amount of progress has been made, but perhaps even more remain.</p>
<p>“It’s not that the equipment isn’t there or doesn’t work,” Galvin said. It does work and it is there. People administering each election need to make sure a person with a disability can use the equipment with confidence and without any sense of stigma. The process now is about furthering and helping election officials – and citizens – to move it forward.”</p>
<p>A full video of the hearing is <a href="http://eac.ovsmedia.com/player.html?eventID=2016041000">available here</a>.</p>

							<h2>Primary Roundup</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Roundup</strong></p>
<p>Hoosiers (and Boilermakers and Irishmen and Sycamores) went to the polls on Tuesday in the nation’s only presidential primary this week. <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/05/03/indiana-primary-2016-presidential-election-indiana-voters-indiana-polling-donald-trump-ted-cruz-john-kasich-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/83895038/">Turnout was high</a>, especially for Indiana, which struggles with turnout, and there were some issues, but not some of the issues that had plagued vote center counties in previous elections.</p>
<p>A poll worker in <a href="http://fox59.com/2016/05/04/miami-county-election-worker-to-be-disciplined-for-turning-voters-away/">Miami County</a> will be disciplined after they told as many as 30 people standing in line near closing time that they may not be allowed to vote because the polls close at 6 p.m. Staff were able to get some of those voters back to the polls, but not all of them.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://fox59.com/2016/05/04/officials-400-500-ballots-in-hancock-county-had-errors/">Hancock County</a>, about 400 to 500 ballots did not include a race for county commissioner. The ballots were distributed at one vote center between 6 a.m. and 10:26 a.m. when the error was caught. Also in Hancock County, <a href="http://www.ibj.com/articles/58400-software-woes-mean-long-waits-for-some-indiana">software problems</a> created long waits at some polling places.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/elections/st-joseph-county-clerk-says-digital-poll-books-worked-well/article_bbc6d730-1226-11e6-97c5-f379e86fbc33.html">St. Joseph County</a> debuted e-poll books for the primary and other than a “few glitches” things went well with the debut. The county did have to send additional iPads to a few polling places because turnout was greater than anticipated. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking at purchasing some additional iPads,&#8221; County Clerk Terri Rethlake told the South Bend Tribune. &#8220;As we do in every election, we learn things and tweak things and, hopefully, it helps the voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>In bellwether <a href="http://wthitv.com/2016/05/03/long-lines-impact-some-terre-haute-voting-centers/">Vigo County</a> [for the general people, not the primary!] it was a busy day with occasional long lines impacting voting in Terre Haute. There was one strange incident where a poll worker allegedly said that ballots of female voters should be shredded. The county elections office is investigating. “We put a lot of time, money and effort in running these elections,” Vada Long with the elections office told WTHI. “It’s <a href="http://wthitv.com/2016/05/04/vigo-county-voter-registration-office-investigating-poll-worker-comments/">hard finding poll workers</a> to work, and then we find out they’re discouraging voters. It’s heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>Vote center granddaddy <a href="http://wlfi.com/2016/05/03/high-interest-primary-election-causes-long-lines-at-the-polls/">Tippecanoe County</a> reported heavy crowds, but no major problems. First-time voters from Jefferson High School talked with a local television station about the process. “This is a really cool process,” John Colestone told WLFI. “This is the first time I’ve voted, so it was really cool to get out there and support the candidate that you think is going to make the country better.”</p>
<p>In <a href="http://wishtv.com/2016/05/03/marion-county-clerk-voter-turnout-incredible/">Marion County</a> turnout was so steady that a poll worker “complained” about not being able to read! “The irony is I came prepared to read a book today, thinking that we wouldn’t have this great a turnout,” poll worker Robert Hill told WISH. “I can’t even open it up.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/local_story/Officials-look-to-speed-things_1462408960">Johnson County</a> had about a 40 percent voter turnout which occasionally lead to long lines so the county is already planning to add more vote centers and poll workers for the fall.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/local-news/10-voting-machines-to-be-counted-wednesday">Vanderburgh County</a>, 10 voting machines had to wait until Wednesday to be counted because they weren’t shut down properly. The machines had to be returned to the elections office to be double checked and counted.</p></p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Former Mayor Shelia Dixon who was running for election in Baltimore last week is <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/2016-mayor-race/bs-md-mayor-election-challenge-20160503-story.html">considering a challenge to the city’s election results</a>. About 3,000 vote separate Dixon from the unofficial winner Sen. Catherine E. Pugh. Activists have called on Gov. Larry Hogan not to certify the election until an investigation can be completed. The activists, including the NAACP cite primary day problems in the city including voters who were turned away and lost ballots. According to <em>The Baltimore Sun,</em> the board is processing <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/2016-mayor-race/bs-md-ci-election-count-20160504-story.html">about 7,000 provisional ballots</a> and more than 3,800 absentee ballots that are arriving by mail daily, Jones said. He expects the final results to be certified Friday. A Maryland State Board of Elections official said that timeline was not unusual.
</li>
<li>In other primary follow-up news, nearly two months after North Carolina’s March primary, <a href="http://www.wral.com/nearly-2-months-later-primary-results-still-being-examined/15681772/">ballots in 20 counties are still being reviewed</a> to ensure that the state’s photo ID law and other new voting laws were properly enforced. According to the <em>Associated Press</em>, State election officials said such audits are designed to promote statewide uniformity by county election officials and local precinct workers on how provisional ballots will be counted or handled in advance of the fall election. A smaller review occurred after the May 2014 primary. &#8220;This is about making sure the results are correct but it is also about making sure the counties are educated about issues,&#8221; state board Executive Director Kim Strach told the AP. &#8220;In November, we won&#8217;t have this ability.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Some voters in Oregon are seeing double. For voters that changed their party affiliation right before the April 26 deadline for the state’s upcoming closed primary they <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/04/double_ballots_its_ok_just_fil.html">will receive two ballots</a>. One reflecting their old affiliation and an updated one reflecting their new party affiliation and candidate choices. To make sure that ballots go out on time, they are printed and prepared before the registration deadline, therefore some voters will need to get a new ballot. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong. “It&#8217;s OK to have two ballots,&#8221; Molly Woon, spokeswoman for the Oregon Secretary of State Jeanne Atkins told <em>The Oregonian</em>. &#8220;But you won&#8217;t get to vote twice.&#8221; The state has gone on an all-out media blitz to explain the situation and even recently posted a haiku about it on their Twitter account:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Two ballots? Don&#8217;t fret.<br />Vote the second ballot, please.<br />Safeguards are in place.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Baby steps. Thirteen precincts in Stevens County, Minnesota have opted to <a href="http://www.morrissuntribune.com/news/4024233-13-precincts-stevens-county-switch-voting-mail">conduct future elections all by mail</a>. Approximately 1,475 registered voters live in those precincts, representing about 25 percent of the 5,685 voters registered in Stevens County.

<li>Free popsicles? Sign us up! A nonprofit in the El Paso County, Texas-area is <a href="http://www.kvia.com/news/a-sweet-way-to-encourage-voter-registration/39353810">offering free popsicles to anyone to registers to vote</a> or even anyone who engages with volunteers about the process. Turnout has been as low as 6 percent in the county the Paleta Power is looking to change that by getting voters registered and engaged in the issues. &#8220;It&#8217;s really important to try and engage voters in as many way as possible to try and understand why, why is there such apathy,&#8221; County commissioner David Stout told KVIA.

<li>Personnel News: <a href="http://www.oxfordeagle.com/2016/05/02/election-workers-honored-in-taylor/">Diane Owens</a>, election commissioner and Geardie Carter, poll manager in Oxford, Mississippi were recently honored for their long service to elections. <a href="http://patch.com/rhode-island/bristol-warren/former-bristol-town-administrator-nominated-board-elections-0">Diane Mederos</a>, former Bristol town administrator has been nominated to serve on the Rhode Island board of elections. Former East Providence Mayor <a href="http://www.abc6.com/story/31874886/raimondo-wants-new-elections-director">Isadore Ramos</a> has also been nominated to the Rhode Island board of elections.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Oregon Senator Ron Wyden announced this week that he plans to introduce federal legislation to move the U.S. to a <a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/03/wyden-introduce-federal-vote-mail-bill/83871936/">national vote-by-mail system</a>. According to the <em>Statesman Journal</em>, the bill would send a ballot to every registered voter before each election. Postage on the ballot&nbsp;envelopes would be prepaid.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Jerry Brown has signed legislation into law that will provide <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article74759212.html">$16.3 million to counties to help cover the costs</a> of the upcoming June primary and the expected “deluge” of petitions from groups seeking to qualify ballot measures for the November election. “It absolutely goes a long way to assisting us in juggling this kind of perfect storm: the initiatives colliding at the same time we’re producing ballots and tallying ballots,” said Orange County Registrar Neal Kelley told the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>.</p>
<p>Also in California, the Assembly has approved AB1921 that would allow voters to <a href="http://www.ktvn.com/story/31869339/california-assembly-oks-bid-for-more-mail-in-vote-designees">designate anyone to turn in their mail-in ballots</a> for them. Existing law limits that to immediate family members and housemates.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> By a 60-37 vote, the Louisiana House voted down a proposal that would have allowed <a href="http://www.americanpress.com/20160428-Voting-Rights">ex-felons to have their voting rights restored</a> upon release from incarceration instead of when they complete parole or probation.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Senate Democrats and Republicans have reached an agreement over a proposal that would <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/agreement-reached-in-missouri-senate-over-contentious-voter-id-proposal/article_a3b1025c-c209-5767-9f0d-9d8c7e2df993.html">require voters to show ID to vote</a>. Under a version of the legislation adopted this week, if voters don’t present a photo ID, they would sign a statement under penalty of perjury attesting that they are who they say they are. The voter would then have to present some form of ID, such as a university-issued ID or a utility bill. The bill awaits Gov. Jay Nixon’s <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voter-id-requirement-gets-final-go-ahead-in-the-missouri/article_ac2f8f3a-1a7a-5a8f-bba3-33ee7150223d.html">signature</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Legislation that would <a href="http://www.uticaod.com/article/20160502/NEWS/160439971">combine the state’s federal and state primaries</a> has stalled in the Senate. It was approved by the Assembly earlier this year, but the Senate has failed to act. According to the <em>Utica Observer Dispatch</em>, a spokesman for Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins who sponsored the bill said they are still hopeful about the legislation moving forward when the Senate reconvenes.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> Gov. Peter Shumlin signed legislation into law making Vermont the fourth state to adopt <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2016/04/28/automatic-voter-registration-becomes-law/83664176/">automatic voter registration</a>. he Vermont law streamlines voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles with a system that identifies eligible Vermont residents and automatically sends their information to the town or city clerk for addition to the checklist, unless they opt out. Vermont’s law will go into effect July 1, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Superior City Council is considering a proposal from the city clerk that would allow <a href="http://www.superiortelegram.com/news/government/4023104-proposal-makes-poll-work-flexible">flexibility in staffing the polls</a>. Clerk Terri Kalan is seeking to change the city ordinance to allow poll workers to serve in shifts, instead of one 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. shift.</p></p>

														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Project Vote is suing the state of Arizona because it claims that the state requested <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/05/03/nonprofit-sues-arizona-for-voting-records.htm">$50,000 for a copy of election registration records</a>, something it provides to political parties for free. The suit alleges the request for payment violates the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Secretary of State Michele Reagan, Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell and Pima County Recorder F. Ann Rodriguez are named in the suit.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> In an ongoing dispute over the April election, the town of Basalt is suing a resident who filed a <a href="http://aspenpublicradio.org/post/basalt-election-clerk-sues-over-election-related-open-records-request#stream/0">FOIA request</a>. The lawsuit requests clarification from the court on whether already deleted text messages between the mayor and town’s top elections official, are subject to the FOIA request.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has arrested David Levin, 31, owner of Vanguard Cybersecurity. Levin is facing counts of unauthorized access of any computer, computer system, computer network or electronic device for <a href="http://www.fox4now.com/news/estero-man-charged-with-hacking-into-elections-website">hacking into the Lee County Elections Office website</a> and the State Division of Elections website.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> Attorneys for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Fair Elections Network have sued the state over an 1874 law that they <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/lawsuit-claims-la-voter-registration-law-is-discriminatory/article_323a3932-e462-5102-b92b-af4bac2e03c5.html">claim subjects naturalized citizens to a higher voter registration requirement than those born in the U.S.</a> The class-action suit aims the law is unconstitutional because it requires naturalized citizens to provide documents proving their citizenship when they register to vote, while other residents simply must swear that they are citizens on the voter registration application.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> U.S. District Judge Brian Morris dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Montana Republican Party and 10 GOP county central committees that <a href="http://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/judge-tosses-closed-primary-lawsuit-but-fight-is-not-over/article_6222149c-6634-5767-9cb7-2ec2dee1be87.html">sought to close the state’s GOP primary</a>. The suit had argued that the open primary system violates Republicans’ freedom of association and forces candidates to change their message to appeal to crossover voters.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: In more closed primary news, State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron rejected a please by a Manhattan attorney who wanted the courts to rule that the state’s <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/judge-rejects-challenge-new-york-closed-primary-system-article-1.2622021">closed primary system violates the state constitution</a> because independents aren’t allowed to vote. Engoron noted that several Court of Appeals rulings and Supreme Court rulings have already leaned in favor of closed primaries.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ordered an <a href="http://www.wxii12.com/news/Appeals-court-orders-expedited-review-in-NC-voter-ID-case/39268460">expedited review</a> of U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroder’s decision that North Carolina’s new election law creating voter ID requirements and eliminating same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting does not discriminate against minority voters.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Final arguments were made this week in a suit over changes made in 2014 to requirements for <a href="http://www.ohio.com/news/politics/state/final-arguments-being-made-in-dispute-over-ballots-in-ohio-1.680002">absentee or provisional ballots</a>. Democrats claimed that the new law creates hurdles for voters, especially minority voters.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court left in place Texas’ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/us/politics/justices-leave-texas-voter-id-law-intact-with-a-warning.html?_r=1">voter ID law</a>, but it did leave open the possibility it would intercede if the appeals court considering a challenge to the law did not act promptly. In March, the full Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to rehear the case and set arguments for May.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Although a suit had been filed at press time, Virginia Republicans have retained the services of an attorney in their efforts to stop Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s executive order to <a href="http://wjhl.com/2016/05/02/virginia-gop-plan-to-challenge-governors-rights-restoration-order-for-convicted-felons/">reinstate the voting rights of more than 200,000 ex-felons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The battle over online voter registration moved, albeit briefly, to the courts this week when the ACLU, on behalf of one Democrat and one Republican sued in an effort to force the clerks in Kanawha and Cabell counties to accept new voter registrations via the state’s <a href="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/wv-high-court-rejects-suit-over-online-voter-registration/article_8bc83c32-4225-598a-b51c-a9f5b82dd54c.html">online voter registration</a> like the other 52 counties do. The petition before the court had asked for a writ of mandamus to require the clerks to accept the online registrations. The State Supreme Court gave no reason for the rejection of the suit.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, the state’s Democratic members of Congress are urging the U.S. Department of Justice to <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/democrats-urge-justice-department-to-challenge-wisconsins-voter-id-law-b99717882z1-377882671.html">review the state’s voter ID requirements</a>. &#8220;The barriers these requirements have set up and the harmful impact they have had for many Wisconsin voters demonstrate that now is the time for a full and thorough review of the constitutionality of the voter ID law,&#8221; they wrote.</p></p>
