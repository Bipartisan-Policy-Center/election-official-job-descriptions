							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Election Toolkit launches</strong><br /><em>Free and low-cost tech tools will help promote civic engagement nationwide</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:whitney@techandciviclife.org">Whitney May</a>, director of government services<br /><a href="http://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Technology and Civic Life</a></p>
<p>This election year, election officials will have a new collection of tools to help them engage their communities in the electoral process and improve how elections are run throughout the U.S. The <a href="http://electiontools.org/">Election Toolkit</a>, an online library of resources for election officials, includes tools like a free app to measure voter wait times, guidelines on how to create short videos and infographics, and a collection of civic icons and illustrations.</p>
<p>All of the tools in the Toolkit are either free or low cost and come paired with step-by-step instructions, making them accessible to any election official, regardless of their budget or tech skills.</p>
<p>“Understanding how to use digital tools is key to effectively communicating things like law changes and deadlines to voters. And using data can help make sure that every voter’s experience is seamless,” says Tiana Epps-Johnson, Executive Director at the Center for Technology and Civic Life. “While technology can’t solve every problem, we see the Toolkit as a resource that any election office can use to manage and publish their really rich information in ways that communities have come to expect.”</p>
<p>Local election officials play a vital role in the civic life of their communities, but their work is often restrained by outdated technology and tight budgets. Recognizing a need for a new collection of resources in elections, the Center for Technology and Civic Life, a nonprofit based in Chicago, devised the Election Toolkit for the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation’s News Challenge on Elections, which funds ideas that better inform voters and increase civic participation. The Election Toolkit was named one of the 22 winners of the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/knight-news-challenge-awards-32-million-ideas-bett/">Knight News Challenge</a> in July 2015.</p>
<p>To assemble and design the Toolkit, the Center for Technology and Civic Life – along with project partners the <a href="http://civicdesign.org/">Center for Civic Design</a>, the <a href="http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/Pages/Default.aspx">Cook County (IL) Clerk</a>, the <a href="http://www.votehillsborough.org/">Hillsborough County (FL) Supervisor of Elections</a>, and the <a href="http://elections.inyocounty.us/">Inyo County (CA) Clerk-Recorder-Registrar </a>– called upon the experience and expertise of local election officials.</p>
<p>The Toolkit partners held a <a href="http://www.techandciviclife.org/news/2015/12/22/election-officials-gather-in-chicago-for-toolkit-workshop">workshop in December</a> and asked election officials about their goals and challenges and about the kinds of technologies that they wish they had. After narrowing down their ideas, the officials provided feedback to shape the look and feel of the Toolkit website, and they participated in usability testing to ensure that the Toolkit would be intuitive to its target audience. The website went live on June 16.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s election officials need data and digital skills to better engage people in elections and other civic events,&#8221; says Noah Praetz, Cook County Director of Elections. “And while the tools themselves are really valuable, so is the network that’s developing in our field,” added Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Craig Latimer. “It’s in all of our interest to make elections as good as they can be throughout the country.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/6.16electionline.png" alt="6.16electionline" width="797" height="505" style="display: block; margin: 15px auto; border: 1px solid #000000;" /></p>
<p>Kammi Foote, Inyo County Clerk-Recorder-Registrar, has already successfully used the <a href="http://electiontools.org/tool/infographic-design/">Infographic Design</a> tool to educate voters about the California primary. “It is important to provide information to voters in ways that are easily understood,” Kammi stresses. “It is also crucial that our message extends to a wide audience. There are billions of people using social media on a daily basis. If election officials want to disseminate useful information to the greatest number of people, infographics are an obvious choice.”</p>
<p>With a heated presidential election coming in November, the Election Toolkit is launching at a time when election administration is increasingly under the spotlight. By advancing the important work of all election officials, the Toolkit will also help to improve the voter experience nationwide.</p>
<p>You are invited to visit <a href="http://www.electiontools.org">www.electiontools.org</a>, sign up so you can bookmark your favorite tools and leave feedback, and share the website with all the election officials in your network. You can also visit the site and recommend a tool to add to the collection.</p>
<p>And be sure to join the conversation about the Toolkit on Twitter using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/electiontools">#ElectionTools</a>.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia<br /></strong>Voters headed to the polls in the District of Columbia on Tuesday for the final presidential primary of the 2016 election cycle. Most voters probably didn’t realize that the day was historic and not because of what was on the ballot, but because they had a ballot at all. June 14 marked the 60th anniversary of the District’s <a href="http://wamu.org/news/16/06/13/60_years_ago_dc_votes_in_first_presidential_primary">first-ever presidential primary</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BabyAbe.jpg" alt="BabyAbe" width="243" height="243" style="margin: 15px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />Although with only 21 percent turnout there were no reports of crowds or lines at polling places, there were some issues.</p>
<p>Apparently a “glitch” with the District’s <a href="http://wamu.org/news/16/06/14/some_dc_voters_see_sudden_change_in_party_affiliation_glitch_in_mobile_app_blamed">mobile voter registration app</a> switched some Democratic voters to No Party voters when people updated their registration information in the days leading up to the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a voter believes that his or her party affiliation status is listed incorrectly, the voter can cast a special ballot. The DCBOE will count the special ballot if it determines, based upon a review of its records, that the voter is eligible to cast a ballot in the primary election,&#8221; Interim Executive Director Terri Stroud told WAMU in an email.</p>
<p>Another problem that voters ran into—although it’s unclear how many—was a change in District law that requires voters wishing to update their voting address on election day to go to their old precinct, instead of their new precinct to update their information. Social media was filled with accounts of people running into this problem.</p>
<p>And in another <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/14/d-c-s-board-of-elections-makes-it-shockingly-easy-to-snoop-on-your-fellow-voters/">quirk in District law</a>, many voters were alarmed to discover that the city’s voter rolls, including name, address, party affiliation and how many times and how they had voted appeared on the city’s elections website.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the information contained in this listing is public information,&#8221; Kenneth McGhie, the D.C. Board of Elections&#8217; general counsel told The Washington Post. &#8220;Indeed, we indicate on our voter registration form that &#8216;voter registration information is public, with the exception of full/partial social security number, date of birth, email, and phone number.&#8217; All of this information can be obtained from the DCBOE pursuant to a data or Freedom of Information Act request.”</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong><br /><a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/06/15/statewide-primary-turnout-appears-light/"><strong>Turnout,</strong> or lack thereof</a>, was the story of the day for Maine’s primary elections. According to the Press Herald, only about 1 in 10 registered voters cast ballots in many Maine towns.</p>
<p>“People do believe in democracy and believe that their vote does count,” Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap told the paper. “That being said, because there is a light fight ticket this year on the primary ballot, many people hadn’t seen campaign ads, they hadn’t seen the signs or haven’t paid much attention to them and did not even realize that Tuesday was primary Election Day.”</p>
<p>Despite the low turnout — or possibly because of it — the state will <a href="http://news.mpbn.net/post/dunlap-says-his-office-ready-if-recount-requested-1st-district-gop-primary#stream/0">most likely see a recount</a> in the 1st District Republican primary where only a few dozen votes out of more than 21,000 cast separate the candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong><br />Despite heavy early voting and absentee voting, primary day in The Silver State was only around 21 percent. There were <a href="http://mtstandard.com/news/national/government-and-politics/the-latest-no-election-day-problems-noted-in-las-vegas/article_149c381c-0caa-5a40-9fa6-d91036f0212d.html">few if any reported problems</a> throughout the state.</p>
<p>At mid-day Washoe County Registrar Luanne Cutler said things were going as expected. &#8220;It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2016/06/14/primary-elections-latest-news-vote/85859962/">really been running as we expected</a>, which is slow and steady,&#8221; Cutler told the Reno Gazette-Journal and that didn’t change throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong><br />The Peace Garden State (how many of you knew that was North Dakota’s nickname?!) saw a turnout of about 24 percent on Tuesday, which exceeded turnout during the June 2014 mid-term primary, but not the 2012 presidential primary. Despite the turnout, there were <a href="http://www.kvrr.com/news/local-news/Little-Hassle-At-Polls-Despite-Higher-Turnout/40060104">relatively few problems</a>.</p>
<p>The state reported very few problems with its <a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/4054894-primary-turnout-strong-statewide-24-percent-eligible-voters-casting-ballots">voter ID law</a>. Deputy Secretary of State Jim Silrum told INForum that the state received only about 10 calls regarding voter ID issues.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/bismarck/close-bismarck-commission-race-could-prompt-recount/article_575d5c2c-25de-58e3-aaf0-229f26165278.html">Bismarck</a> city commission race could come down to a recount pending the canvassing boards’ count of absentee ballots. And in <a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/4055536-nd-mayor-race-ends-tie-28-votes-piece">Hannaford</a>, the mayor’s race has ended in a tie, but the results are still unofficial with some absentee ballots yet to be counted. Each candidate received 28 votes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/local/4055599-mail-voting-success-hettinger-and-billings-counties">Billings and Hettinger counties</a> conducted their primaries by mail and by all accounts the process was a success. Voter turnout in Billings County jumped from 25 percent to 50 percent under vote-by-mail.</p>
<p>In Fargo, <a href="http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2016/jun/14/postcard-some-west-fargo-residents-received-contains-wrong-polling-location/">postcards</a> about voting that some West Fargo residents received about their new polling location had the incorrect information on them. The county placed signs on the doors of the incorrectly listed address directing voters to the <a href="http://www.kvrr.com/news/local-news/Some-West-Fargo-Voters-Headed-to-Wrong-Polling-Location/40069120">correct address</a>.</p>
<p>And an afternoon power outage in <a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4054518-video-power-outage-causes-minor-voting-disruptions-grand-forks">Grand Forks</a> did nothing to slow down voters who continued to fill out their paper ballots by the glow of emergency lights.</p>
<p>“I didn’t notice at first, because it was light in the entryway,” voter Sally Akerline told the Grand Forks Herald. “I guess I’ve never voted in Grand Forks before, so I didn’t know what to expect. But they seemed to handle it pretty well.”</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This week, Ohio joined 18 states and the District of Columbia as part of the <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/dead-voters-and-out-of-staters-will-be-purged-from/nrgJT/">Electronic Registration Information Center — ERIC</a>. As part of this, in mid-August more than 1.5 million Ohioans that are not registered, but eligible will receive a mailing encouraging them to do so. The mailing will cost about $400,000 and will be covered by a grant from Pew.
</li>
<li>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission, in partnership with the National Braille Press has created a <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/EAC.Releases.Voting.Rights.Card.Braille.6.14.16.pdf">voting rights card in Braille and large print</a> for visually impaired voters. “We believe it is very important to offer the card in Braille and large print,” Chairman Thomas Hicks said in a statement. “We are proud to work with the National Braille Press to make this happen,” he said. “As people with disabilities go to the polls this fall, this resource will help remind them of their federal voting rights.”
</li>
<li>Once again, things are not so jolly in Forsyth County, North Carolina. Elections board members are considering using the <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/elections/local/crafters-express-concerns-again-about-south-fork-voting/article_1cfad95b-7685-54fc-8559-4cb4a8d52169.html">South Fork Community Center for early voting</a>, but the scheduling would conflict not only with the Holly Jolly Craft Fair, but also the Gingerbread Craft Fair. The same issue arose in 2014, but a compromise was eventually worked out. If elections officials and recreation officials cannot come to some sort of agreement it could mean an $80,000 revenue loss. The site was a popular early voting site in 2014 and election board members believe it may have actually driven traffic to the craft show.
</li>
<li>Voters in Massachusetts will have the chance to early vote for the first time this fall and now localities are working on the logistics of what that will look like. In Boston, city elections officials are <a href="http://www.wbur.org/politicker/2016/06/15/early-voting-boston">soliciting ideas from the public on where the city should place its early voting locations</a>. &#8220;A democracy is only strong and vibrant when all residents are able to participate and make their voices heard,&#8221; Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said in <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=21665">a statement</a> announcing the early voting feedback plan. Thoughts and ideas are due today via a special website (www.earlyvoting.boston.gov). Hmmm, maybe Forsyth County should look to their neighbors to the north.
</li>
<li>Members of the Merrimack, New Hampshire town council and school board met this week to try and find a solution to the traffic nightmare experienced at the Merrimack High School polling place in February. The town is <a href="http://www.wmur.com/news/after-traffic-disaster-on-primary-day-merrimack-looks-to-add-polling-places/40059100">considering adding two more voting sites</a> for a total of three. “No matter where you are, there&#8217;s going to be traffic issues, but this will be markedly better,” town council chair Nancy Harrington said at the meeting according to WMUR. “The sites we’re talking about are demographically separated so there should be a great improvement.”
</li>
<li>Wicomico County, Maryland’s county executive blinked. For months the county executive and the board of the library had been <a href="http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2016/06/14/voting-machine-showdown-between-wicomico-library-ended/85862076/">at odds over the storage of voting equipment</a> with the county executive wanting the library to vacate 3,000 square feet of space for their storage and the library pushing back saying that space was used for programming. According to <em>DelmarvaNow</em>, the county will purchase and renovate another building—for about $900,000—to not only store the voting machines, but house the entire county elections operations.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> Gov. John Bel Edwards has signed legislation into law that will allow college students with an <a href="http://www.ccenterdispatch.com/news/state/article_16ec333d-59b4-5c14-ad19-8ec1e218b985.html">ID issued by a state university or college</a> to use that ID to vote.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey:</strong> Once again, legislation that would <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/bill-to-automatically-register-residents-to-vote-advances/article_a486c780-a9c8-5b3e-8634-a3be8618b570.html">automatically register</a> Garden State residents to vote is making its way through the General Assembly. The bill was approved by the Assembly in May and this week was approved by a Senate panel.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Gov. John Kasich (R) has signed legislation into law that will allow voters to <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/jun/13/gov-kasich-signs-online-voter-registration-bill-la/?mobile">register online</a> beginning in 2017. Currently voters may update their existing information online, but new voters cannot register. The legislation was championed by Secretary of State Jon Husted (R).</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The Senate Rules and Judiciary Committee has approved legislation that would create a <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/news/local-news/2016/06/09/unified-elections-board-moves-forward-senate">single elections board</a> with 14 members—seven from each V.I. district. The bill would also increase the stipends that board of elections members receive.</p>
<p>In other elections news, the committee also approved a bill that would explicitly state that a voter must be domiciled in the USVI in order to register to vote there. According to the bill, a person can have only one domicile for voting purposes, and it is the place where a person habitually resides when not called elsewhere to work or for some temporary purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Budget Committee approved spending $250,000 for <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/legislature-s-budget-committee-approves-for-voter-id-education/article_45de9619-d69e-528b-84ed-3590a5c1b338.html">a public education campaign on the state’s voter ID law</a>. The money would pay for public service announcements on radio and television, web ads, online videos and even possibly ads at movie theatres, on buses and on social media. All materials will be in English and Spanish.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> This week, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said that his office <a href="http://tucson.com/news/election/arizona-ag-won-t-investigate-secretary-of-state-over-election/article_94228e2a-3280-11e6-8392-2f5b386928c9.html">will not investigate Secretary of State Michele Reagan</a>’s failure to update the state elections manual. According to Capitol Media Services, Michael Bailey, the chief deputy acknowledged that the secretary’s interpretation of the law on releasing the manual was unique, but that it was also plausible.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Late last week, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling requiring Kansas to “suspended” voter to vote in federal elections even though they did not provide <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/10th-circuit-kansas-block-voters-casting-ballots-39770859">proof-of-citizenship</a>. The appeals court judges said Kansas had not made the necessary showing for a stay pending appeal, but agreed to hear the appeal quickly.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: The Center for Independence of the Disabled New York (CIDNY), the National Federal of the Blind and several New York voters have sued the state’s board of elections and Department of Motor Vehicles claiming that the state’s <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-state-board-elections-and-department-motor-vehicles-sued-discrimination/">online voter registration system violates the American with Disabilities Act</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Despite an appeal from the state, John Michael H.
