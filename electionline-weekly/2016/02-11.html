							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: In Focus This Week is a repost from February 2012. Electionline rarely, if ever, reposts stories, but given the fact that this story is probably more true today than it was four years ago — and that we’re a bit under the weather this week — we thought it would be a good idea to share again. All other sections of the newsletter this week are new. Thank you for your understanding.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Doing a nonpartisan job in a hyper-partisan world<br /></strong><em>Elections officials work to put job over politics</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline.org</p>
<p>For 11 years Sherre Toler made sure the residents of <a href="http://www.harnett.org/elections/">Harnett County, N.C.</a> had everything they needed to cast a ballot on (or before) Election Day.</p>
<p>She enjoyed the work she was doing and although one can never tell what the future may hold, she could have envisioned herself retiring from there someday.</p>
<p>But on January 3, 2012 Toler resigned from a job she loved because she could no longer remain impartial. A constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage will appear on the May 2012 primary ballot.</p>
<p>“This issue has been debated in the past but has never before been placed on the ballot so I had an opportunity to think about it before it actually happened.” Toler said. “However, when the vote was announced, I knew there was no way I could conduct a vote such as this.”</p>
<p>Toler said she spoke with friends and family about her decision and that they were supportive of her decision. She also said that her colleagues in Harnett County have been supportive as well.</p>
<p>“My board and staff have been incredibly supportive and have all wished me well,” Toler said. “I have nothing but respect for the elections community as a whole, and I know that the overwhelming majority of elections officials work hard to make sure that all elections are conducting fairly and honestly.”</p>
<p>In today’s society when everyone seems to wear their emotions and beliefs on their sleeve — or express them in 140-characters or less — how do elections officials put whatever feelings they may have aside in order to conduct fair and efficient elections?</p>
<p>“Not only is it possible for election administrators to be nonpartisan; it should be a job requirement,” said <a href="http://law.uci.edu/faculty/page1_r_hasen.html">Richard L. Hasen</a>, Chancellor’s Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California as well as editor of the <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/">Election Law Blog</a>.”</p>
<p>Hasen noted that in other countries, the norm is that election administrators have their allegiance to the integrity of the process and not to a political party or an ideological belief. He pointed out that in the U.S., this norm is followed only some administrators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance is basic. &nbsp;The umpire shouldn&#8217;t be member of either team. &nbsp;How to get there from here? &nbsp;In some states we need to change the rules on how we pick our election referees. &nbsp;Until then we must hope that virtue and integrity overcomes partisan pressures,&#8221; said <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/bios.php?ID=23">Edward B. Foley</a>, Isadore and Ida Topper Professor of Law and director of <em><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Election Law @ Moritz</span></em>.</p>
<p>Elaine Manlove, commissioner of elections for the state of <a href="http://elections.delaware.gov/">Delaware</a>, said it’s not just about doing her job, it’s about the law.</p>
<p>“Delaware law requires that I as well as my staff and all of the elections employees in the three county offices be non-partisan. We can&#8217;t do anything political from putting a bumper sticker on our cars to signs in our yards to campaign contributions,” Manlove said. “Having this law as a backdrop is a constant reminder to us as well as to the politicians we interact with that we remain non-partisan.&nbsp; It’s more than being ethical – it’s the law.”</p>
<p>Some elections officials, like <a href="http://www.elections.state.md.us/">Maryland’s</a> Linda Lamone, felt that there are standards in place to ensure that officials remain professional and impartial.</p>
<p>“I think you are over-thinking this.&nbsp; Most election officials are very professional and adhere to the principles and standards as set out in the <a href="http://electioncenter.org/electionresources/documents/principles%20color.pdf">two</a><a href="http://electioncenter.org/electionresources/documents/standards%20color.pdf">documents</a>…from the <a href="http://www.nased.org/">National Association of Election Officials</a>.”</p>
<p>It’s not always easy for even the most impartial elections official to stay out of the line of fire of partisan politics.</p>
<p>Recently, Kevin Kennedy, who heads Wisconsin’s nonpartisan <a href="http://gab.wi.gov/">Government Accountability Board</a> has faced the <a href="http://chippewa.com/news/opinion/editorial/article_c440f6fe-0c89-11e1-9201-001cc4c03286.html">glare of the media</a> as the state struggles through a series of hyper-politicized elections administration issues including voter ID and numerous recalls. <em>[In late 2015 the Wisconsin General Assembly voted to disband the GAB and instead replace it with two partisan boards, o</em><em>ne that will oversee elections issues and another that will deal with ethics, campaign finance and lobbying regulations. Members of both commissions will be selected by&nbsp;both parties.]</em><em></em></p>
<p>For Kennedy, it’s not been about politics, it’s about doing a job that he was hired to do. He noted that his focus is on applying the law as given to him by the legislature and the courts. The political polarization he encounters is a reminder to him that decisions are not made in a vacuum.</p>
<p>“I think the touchstone for addressing these issues is to look at the fact this is my job.&nbsp; I have been entrusted with a&nbsp;responsibility to&nbsp;administer a set of duties that lies at the heart of what our government is built on,” Kennedy said.</p>
<p>“I have&nbsp;a responsibility to fairly and&nbsp;transparently&nbsp;administer&nbsp;elections to&nbsp;ensure confidence&nbsp;in the&nbsp;integrity of the&nbsp;electoral process.&nbsp; As a result, my commitment is to the voters,&nbsp;the&nbsp;candidates and&nbsp;the election&nbsp;officials to do my job&nbsp;in a fair and&nbsp;impartial manner.&nbsp; Anything less and I am not&nbsp;honoring&nbsp;the trust that has been given to me by the people&nbsp;through my&nbsp;appointment by the&nbsp;members of&nbsp;the Government&nbsp;Accountability Board.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jocoelection.org/AboutUs/Staff.htm">Johnson County, Kan</a>. Elections Commissioner Brian Newby [<em>now executive director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</em>] makes sure that his impartiality even trickles into his personal life. Even on the most social of all social media sites, Facebook, Newby is cautious about who he friends.</p>
<p>“I have a goofy internal policy that I won’t accept a social network friend request or connection if the person is a candidate at the time.&nbsp; I understand that once connected, an elected official can later become a candidate or a friend may later run for an office and I don’t defriend them,” Newby said. “I just wouldn’t want anyone to think I was in cahoots with a candidate by buddying up socially with a candidate.&nbsp; Many don’t know I have this policy so they probably think I’m just rude and also heartless when I accept a losing candidate’s request the day after the election.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newby won’t even affiliate with candidates for cake! He noted that recently, a good friend of his had a 50<sup>th</sup> birthday party and the friend was a candidate for office and so Newby gave his regrets because he didn’t want any perception that his attendance meant any kind of approval of his friends candidacy.</p>
<p>Sara Ball Johnson, former director of elections for Kentucky and now clerk for Colorado Springs, Colorado, emphasized the importance of shutting out the background noise that comes with being an elections director.</p>
<p>“It is even more important to be a-political now than in the past. Every little decision is made under a microscope in the election world, but that is not necessarily bad. The more open and transparent we are the better to counter act the misinformation that spreads like wild fire,” Ball Johnson said. “There is no place for partisan answers when answering questions on elections or voting.”</p>
<p>Ball Johnson also had some parting advice for elections officials at all levels:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Follow the law not the rhetoric;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Never make a decision based upon the party affiliation of the inquirer;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Be consistent&#8230;always review the law, case law,&nbsp;and policy before making a decision;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Be proactive, never ever wait for something to blow-up before you address it. If you know there is a weakness in procedure or law, work to fix it before it becomes a problem. You never want to be in court or in the media admitting you knew it was a problem but failed to try to fix it. Paper trails are your friend;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Train, Train, Train and then Train again! I am a firm believer in constant and redundant training in all areas of election administration. Train yourself, your staff, local registrars, pubic, party officials, candidates and anyone else you can think of on the proper procedures for conducting elections;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Always attend local, state, and national election groups conferences/training sessions. I get some of my best ideas from my colleagues. No need to reinvent the wheel, borrow an idea and make it your own; and</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Be accessible to media and never say &#8220;no comment&#8221; or refuse to return their phone calls. The media can be your friend or your enemy.&nbsp;Remember it takes minute for someone to say &#8220;I was disenfranchised&#8221; but it will take you several minutes to explain why they were not disenfranchised.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s some pig! We’ll get to that pig in a moment, but <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-voting-new-hamphire-style--20160209-story.html">voters in New Hampshire</a> headed to the polls this week for the <a href="http://wkms.org/post/new-hampshire-secretary-state-defends-primarys-first-nation-status">first-in-the-nation primary</a> and while there were early concerns about the impacts the <a href="http://www.vnews.com/lifetimes/volunteers/20973192-95/new-photo-id-voter-law-sees-smooth-implementation">state’s new voter ID law</a> may have on <a href="http://www.wmur.com/politics/primary-turnout-may-have-set-record/37929448">turnout</a> or the process, those fears seemed to be unfounded. There were of course lines and traffic jams. In <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/09/politics/merrimack-traffic-voting-new-hampshire/">Merrimack</a>, the polls had to <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charlotte.jpg" alt="Charlotte" width="273" height="135" style="border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />be kept open past the 8 p.m. closing time to accommodate a line of voters who were caught in a traffic jam outside of the polling place. <a href="http://www.citizen.com/news/2016-02-10/Front_Page/New_voters_grow_in_numbers_line_up_at_polls_in_Ply.html">Plymouth</a> polling places reported lines for those who wanted to register and vote that day. In the late afternoon there was a line in <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/Primary-turnout-takes-some-by-surprise">Manchester</a> that was more than 100 feet long. Oh, and as we mentioned there was a pig. It seems a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/09/wayward-pig-shows-new-hampshire-polling-place/chwdyHFkMG4SlBmsjYoOjO/story.html">600-lb sow broke free of her enclosure and headed toward a polling place</a> in Pelham to check out what all the fuss was about on Tuesday. After spending about 45 minutes trying to round up the pig, Pelham police eventually called the farm from where they believe the pig escaped and the farmer came to get her. No word on whether she got an “I Voted” sticker or not, but we sure hope she did! Just think of what Charlotte would have had to say about that!</p>

<li>Green is the new yellow in Maricopa County, Arizona. The county is <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/politicalinsider/2016/02/04/no-transparency-maricopa-county-ballot-envelopes-opaque/79512700/">changing the color of its ballots</a> from yellow to green because apparently in some light it is possible to see the marked yellow ballots through the ballot secrecy envelope. Apparently, you can see through yellow,&#8221;<strong> Karen Osborne</strong>, the county&#8217;s elections director told <em>The Arizona Republic</em><strong><span style="font-family: Cambria;">.</span></strong> &#8220;But you have to work real hard at it.&#8221;&nbsp;Osborne didn’t know what color green the ballots will be because she is color blind, but Yavapai County Recorder Leslie Hoffman told the paper that the ballots are a dark mint green.
</li>
<li>The Summit County, Ohio board of elections recently held an hour-long fact-finding hearing over <a href="http://www.ohio.com/news/break-news/elections-board-hears-complaints-of-racial-bias-anger-over-more-mishandled-mail-1.660596">whether or not black voters had been mistreated</a> by white poll workers in 2015. While the board did not determine whether the incident in question actually happened, they did determine that there are practices or procedures in place to prevent an incident like the alleged one from happening and that the board would be creating new cultural and racial sensitivity practices and possibly additional training for poll workers.

<li>Although not mandated by law, Chicago and suburban Cook County, Illinois will offer <a href="http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/ballots-in-korean-for-march-15-primary-expected-to-increase-participation/">ballots in Korean at 23 precincts</a> that have a heavy concentration of Korean-Americans. The precincts will also have bilingual election judges available. “We are finding ways to open the doors to people to vote and make it easier, make it less intimating, less frustrating and find ways to bring people in,” State Rep. Elaine Nekriz (D-Northbrook) said at a recent press conference.
</li>
<li>We’ll file these under things that only happen every four years. Unaffiliated voters in <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2016/02/09/why-was-the-republican-party-left-off-a-sacramento-county-elections-mailer/">Sacramento, California</a> angrily flooded the county elections office with calls when a mailer they received did not give them the option of voting in the Republican primary. “The way I was reading this letter, I would have to chose one of the following options if I wanted to be able to vote,” Barbara Wells told CBS. But out of the three options, the Republican party was not one of them. “I almost drew a box and said ‘Republican’ next to it,” she said. Turns out there was nothing wrong with the mailer, the Republican party in California doesn’t allow unaffiliated voters cast ballots in its primary unless they want to register as a Republican. This affects about 1 in 4 voters in California. And in <a href="http://www.wbur.org/2016/02/10/united-independent-party-registration-confusion">Massachusetts</a> elections officials are concerned that as many as 20,000 voters who enrolled in the United Independent Party may have actually intended to register as independents and not with the small political party. Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said that numerous emails and calls to the office by voters complaining that they had incorrectly signed up for the UIP prompted the secretary of state’s office to craft a statement on the voter registration form clarifying the difference between registering UIP and independent.

He was 55. Lyons first joined the board of elections in 2007 and was appointed chairman in 2013.

My heart is just broken,” she told the <em>Statesville Recorder &amp; Landmark</em>. “Ed was such a genuine person. I called him ‘the rock’.” Lyons served as treasurer of the Iredell County Republican Party and was a member of the executive committee of the N.C. Republican party. He was licensed to practice law in North and South Carolina, and was admitted to practice before the United States Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and federal courts in the Carolinas.</li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona: </strong>By a 34-23 vote, the House approved legislation that would make it a felony to <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/house-passes-bill-making-it-crime-to-turn-in-others/article_fc95cef1-4901-5b74-92a6-299398ef60a7.html">return someone else’s absentee ballot</a> with exceptions for family members, those in the same household and professional caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: The Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee approved <a href="http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_29497264/bill-could-reduce-early-voting-centers-county">two elections-related bills</a> this week. SB 16-107, which was unanimously approved, would require mandatory minimum training for voter registration circulators. SB 16-122 will reduce the required number of voting services and polling centers to be open the first week of early voting. It also no longer requires polling centers to be open the first Saturday of early voting.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong>: Secretary of State Denise Merrill is pushing legislators to support a bill that would <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/government-and-politics/20160208/merrill-seeks-automatic-voter-registration-at-connecticut-dmv-to-hike-turnout">automatically register voters</a> in the Nutmeg State.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho</strong>: Secretary of State Lawerence Denney has proposed legislation that would allow residents in Idaho to <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/hbo/2016/feb/10/denney-proposes-online-registration/">register online to vote</a>. The proposal would include verification through the Idaho Transportation Department’s driver’s license records.</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>: A hearing was held this week on a proposal that would <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/02/08/supporters-say-limits-on-videotaping-at-maine-polling-places-needed-to-avoid-conflict/">require videographers monitoring referendum signature-gathering to stand further away</a> from polling places. The proposal, according to sponsor Sen. Bill Diamond (D-Windham) comes in response to voters who felt intimidated by people videotaping during the 2015 elections.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: By a 29-18 vote, the Maryland Senate followed in the footsteps of the General Assembly to override Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) veto of legislation that would <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-felons-voting-20160209-story.html">restore the voting rights to ex-felons</a> who are no longer incarcerated, but may still have elements of their sentence they need to fulfill such as probation or financial restitution. The law will go into effect on March 10 and approximately 40,000 released felons will be eligible to vote in the state’s April primary.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: The House unanimously approved legislation to allow Rhode Island voters to <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160209/ri-house-approves-bill-allowing-electronic-voter-registration">register online to vote</a>. There is currently no Senate version of the bill, although one is expected.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Sen. Craig Tieszen (R-Rapid City) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/legislature/lawmaker-wants-to-purge-nomadic-rvers-from-voting-rolls/article_3fbbffc8-2394-5b95-bde7-a38a72841d0f.html">forbid the use of a mail-forwarding service</a> as an address for voter registration. According to <em>the Rapid City Journal</em>, the bill targets nomadic recreational-vehicle owners, known as RVers, and others who use mail-forwarding services such as Americas Mailbox near Rapid City, whose address is listed by nearly 3,500 registered voters.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iowa: </strong>The Iowa Supreme Court will consider whether or not to relax the state’s <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/government/2016/02/09/iowa-high-court-consider-states-ban-voting-felons/80076902/">lifetime ban on voting by convicted felons</a>. According to the Des Moines Register, the court said it would hear case which could clear up longstanding confusion over which of the state’s former offenders is eligible to vote. Iowa is only one of three states that has a lifetime ban on ex-felon voting.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi: </strong>The Attorney General&#8217;s Office has taken over the prosecution in a <a href="http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2016/feb/09/attorney-general-prosecute-case-against-poll-worke/">voting fraud case</a> filed last year against five southwestern Mississippi poll workers. The Attorney General&#8217;s office stepped in after the county prosecutor and District Attorney recused themselves from the case.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina: </strong>Last week, a three-judge panel of the 1st and 12th Districts ruled that <a href="http://www.wral.com/voters-attorneys-want-new-congressional-maps-drawn-now/15342563/">redistricting done by the Republican-lead General Assembly in 2011 was unconstitutional</a>. The state asked for a stay of the ruling arguing that hundreds of absentee ballots had already been cast for the March 15 primary. The panel denied the state’s motion. The state has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency stay for the upcoming election to go ahead under the current boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio: </strong>A lawsuit has been filed that claims the state rules enacted in 2014 <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/02/ballots_for_4105_voters_were_t.html">violate constitutional rights</a> and disproportionately hurt black, Latino and poor voters. The suit claims that nearly 12 percent of absentee and provisional ballots rejected in 2014 and 2015 were rejected for reasons that have a greater impact on minority voters.</p></p>
