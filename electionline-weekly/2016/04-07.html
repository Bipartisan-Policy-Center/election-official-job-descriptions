							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long lines at the polls? There’s an app for that!<br /></strong><em>Collin County, Texas app helps voter get moving</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the <a href="https://youtu.be/CCbWyYr82BM">waiting is the hardest part</a> and with work, family and other responsibilities many voters don’t have time to wait in the lines they are sometimes greeted with during high profile elections or peak voting hours.</p>
<p>Election administrators too admit that they <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473293026/what-keeps-election-officials-up-at-night-fear-of-long-lines-at-the-polls">lose sleep</a> worrying about election-day lines and from resource allocation to polling place relocation, work hard to make sure that if there are lines, they are as short as possible.</p>
<p>One county in Texas has done something about election day lines with the Voter Line Wait app.</p>
<p>In 2009 <a href="http://www.collincountytx.gov/elections/Pages/default.aspx">Collin County</a> became part of Texas’ vote center pilot program and have been a successful addition to the county’s elections arsenal.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Election_Maps_QR_Sign_Vertical_copy.jpg" alt="Election Maps QR Sign Vertical copy" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" height="266" width="205" /></p>
<p>“One of the biggest challenges is that voter turnout is not equally distributed between vote centers so the number and placement of locations is critical,” said Bruce Sherbet, administrator of elections for Collin County. Also, providing sufficient equipment and supplies to handle heavier turnout in certain vote centers can be a little challenging.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the mid-term elections in 2010 when vote enters faced many lines, the county’s GIS Administrator Tim Nolan created an app to help voters find the vote center with the shortest lines closest to them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“The EA [at the time] asked all the interested parties to come up with suggestions that might alleviate long lines &#8211; think outside the box,” Sherbet explained. “The GIS representative, Tim Nolan,&nbsp;thought we could do something with mobile device mapping and QR Codes.&nbsp;They took the idea and ran with it.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectionDay_03012016_Infographic.jpg" alt="ElectionDay 03012016 Infographic" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin-right: 18px; float: left;" height="652" width="218" /></p>
<p>The original version was done completely in-house (no additional money) for the 2012 presidential election. Following that, the county enlisted GIS Incorporated (<a href="http://gisinc.com/"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">GISi</span></a>) to help the county build a new version of the app that incorporated routing and directions.</p>
<p>The app is a web application.&nbsp; If your device supports web-browsing then you can run this app.&nbsp; No downloading from the various app stores.&nbsp;You do, however, need to download a QR Code reader to scan the codes.&nbsp;The single app performs three functions &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>Route to the closest polling location based on a typed address (website)</li>
<li>Find the closest polling location based on my current location (mobile device)</li>
<li>Scan QR Code and let me choose another polling location with route direction (mobile device).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a polling location map layer on the app that reveals real-time line waits (Green &lt; 20&#8242;, Yellow 20&#8242;-40&#8242;, Red &gt; 40&#8242;) that corresponds to the Elections dashboard.&nbsp;The Dashboard has been around since Nov 2010 and has a listing of all polling location with line wait colors.</p>
<p>The app was incredibly useful during the March presidential preference primary which, according to Sherbet, was the busiest day ever recorded on the county election website.</p>
<p>While other localities, like the District of Columbia, allow voters to check vote center wait times online, the GIS system in Collin County is the only app of its kind that we know of that can let you know, based on your current location, where the shortest lines are.</p>
<p>Sherbet said the GIS app is pretty easy, however there are some things an elections office would need to have in place before taking on such project and that he and his staff are happy to share any information that other elections officials might find useful.</p>
<p>“I think it is an outstanding app especially in jurisdictions using vote centers,” Sherbet said. “I am certain it has helped route many of our voters to voting locations and it has definitely been instrumental in re-routing voters to locations with lower wait times.”</p>

							<h2>Primary Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Update</strong></p>
<p>Voters went to the polls in several states on Tuesday, but with only Wisconsin casting presidential primary ballots, all eyes were on the Badger State.</p>
<p>Although the state’s new voter ID law had been rolled out at earlier elections, Tuesday marked the first presidential primary where voters had to show a photo ID in order to cast a ballot. In addition to the presidential race, there was also a high-profile Supreme Court race and many local non-partisan races.</p>
<p>While there were reports of issues with both lines and voter ID, overall initial reports are that things went smoothly on Tuesday although the <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/jury-is-still-out-on-voter-id-after-first-big-test-b99701512z1-374789941.html">jury is still out</a> on the implementation of the new voter ID law.</p>
<p>Although the numbers aren’t final, it appears that turnout was about 45 percent which is higher than it’s <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/374737091.html">since 1972</a>.</p>
<p>There were reports of <a href="http://www.startribune.com/cruz-looks-to-wisconsin-to-close-gap-on-trump/374577241/">lines at some polling places</a>, and <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-and-local-election-officials-predict-high-turnout-tuesday-voter/article_8ff43ee8-2b6f-5266-b0a9-bd4c9fcff181.html">reports of some issues with the state’s new voter ID law</a>. Many of these reports came from polling places typically catering to <a href="http://www.heraldonline.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article70313332.html">university students</a>. Students at the University of Wisconsin said that rules about ID were inconsistent. One student reported that she was asked for <a href="https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/04/06/how-new-voter-id-law-caused-confusion-at-uw-polling-centers/">proof of residence, but not a photo ID</a>.</p>
<p>A polling place near Marquette University reported long lines of students wishing to <a href="http://www.cbs58.com/story/31651623/long-lines-to-register-to-vote-at-marquette-university-on-presidential-primary-day">register and vote on the same day</a>.</p>
<p>Some polling places in <a href="http://journaltimes.com/news/local/polling-steady-without-troubles-election-officials-residents-say/article_0fc6e620-e1df-5884-bbec-95ef6be7d9e1.html">Racine County</a> were open beyond the 8 p.m. closing time because voters were still in line. Those polling places ended up closing around 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>A Milwaukee polling place was briefly put on <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/west-allis-polling-site-reportedly-affected-by-police-investigation-b99700541z1-374614401.html">lock down</a> due to police activity nearby, but voting was not disrupted. Instead the doors were locked and when a voter would show up, a poll worker stationed at the door would allow the voter in.</p>
<p>In Madison, some voters complained that <a href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/Truck-dumpster-prompt-complaints-from-voters/38873868">construction equipment</a> parked in front of the polling place was obstructing access to the site. The equipment was removed by 10 a.m.</p>
<p>In Brown County <a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2016/04/06/gab-investigating-voting-17-year-olds/82719668/">three 17-year-olds voted illegally</a>. Two were able to convince poll workers to let them register and vote and the third certified that he was 18 although his birth date on his registration form showed differently. “We also heard that some of the people who voted at age 17 were assertive to the point of bullying poll workers who might have been intimidated into registering them,” Brown County Clerk Sandy Juno told the Green Bay Press Gazette. Unlike some other states, Wisconsin does not allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the general election to vote.</p>
<p>And proving why poll workers can be some of the best people around, Lois Obermeier <a href="http://www.wsaw.com/content/news/Poll-Worker-spends-80th-birthday-working-on-Wisconsins-primary-day-374682861.html">spent her 80th birthday serving as a poll worker</a> in the Town of Mosinee. &#8220;I just love to work with the people and do my duty. It&#8217;s just something I like to do. I mean, I love people,&#8221; Obermeier told WSAW.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri<br /></strong>But Wisconsin wasn’t the only state to hold elections this week. Voters went to the polls in Missouri for municipal elections.</p>
<p>Given the short turn around time from the March 15 presidential preference primary, elections officials in St. Louis County decided to <a href="http://www.kmov.com/story/31622722/only-paper-ballots-available-for-stl-city-county-voters-on-april-5">use paper ballots instead of the county’s DRE machines</a>. St. Louis County Elections Director Eric Fey told a local television station it would have cost the county thousands of dollars in overtime pay to reprogram and test the DRE machines in time for the municipal elections.</p>
<p>The problems in St. Louis County began early with polling places <a href="http://www.ktrs.com/ballot-shortages-expand-in-st-louis-county/">reporting ballot shortages</a> by lunchtime. The county board of elections asked the Circuit Court to keep the polls open for two hours, but just after 5 p.m. Circuit Judge Maura B. McShane <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-county-elections-extended-63-precincts-after-ballot-shortages">denied the request saying</a> in her written order that she didn’t believe the court had the authority to extend the hours.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals overturned McShane’s ruling and <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/st-louis-county-suffers-ballot-problems-voting-confusion/article_47b0e5d7-3d0b-5bf0-b18f-175ff20224d2.html">kept 63 precincts in 24 polling places open for an additional two hours</a>, but some polls had already closed by the time the order was issued. Voters who wanted to vote were encouraged to go to the county elections headquarters.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Jason Kander said that his office <a href="http://www.hastingstribune.com/missouri-secretary-of-state-looking-into-ballot-shortage/article_e5671761-8ff3-5cdf-bc02-8385d66af8b0.html">will investigate</a> how the ballot shortage happened. Frey and his Republican counterpart Gary Fuhr will both <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/politics/elections/house-panel-to-hear-testimony-on-ballot-problems/122875608">testify</a> before the Missouri House Urban Issues Committee.</p>
<p>Fey told Fox 2 News that at polling places with more than one ballot style, the election board <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2016/04/05/st-louis-election-officials-apologize-for-mistake-at-polls/">flipped the numbers of how many ballots for each style</a> were needed meaning some polling places had too few of one ballot type and too many of another.</p>
<p>The only reported problems in <a href="http://www.kmbc.com/politics/electronic-tablets-cause-minor-delays-at-northland-precinct/38878034">Kansas City</a> came first thing in the morning when tablets used to check-in voters weren’t fully charged and therefore didn’t function properly. Voting was briefly delayed.</p>
<p>Also in Missouri, a fire in Princeton forced elections officials to move a polling place to the <a href="http://www.kttn.com/fire-breaks-out-in-downtown-princeton-moving-election-site/">Mercer County</a> Courthouse because smoke from the fire was blowing into the polling place.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina<br /></strong>Voters in North Carolina didn’t go to the polls this week, but there was some news from the state’s March primary. The North Carolina State Board of Elections has decided that there should be a <a href="http://www.wschronicle.com/2016/04/south-ward-get-new-primary/">new election in the South Ward of Forsyth County</a>. Candidate John Larson lost the primary by just six votes and it was later discovered that 26 voters were given the wrong ballots. The county board of elections agreed that Larson’s complaint had probable cause. “With a very close election like this, it doesn’t take very many irregularities to trigger a protest and have probable cause,” said Board Member Stuart Russell.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online voter registration has proved wildly successful everywhere it’s been introduced — including in West Virginia — however, clerks for two of the state’s largest counties <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160404/kanawha-cabell-county-clerks-refusing-online-voter-registration">refuse to accept voter registration forms submitted online</a> and instead send those attempting to use the online system a paper registration form. Cabell County Clerk Karen Cole and Kanawha County Clerk Vera McCormick told the <em>Gazette Mail</em> that they are uncomfortable with the security provisions in the system. “These clerks are choosing not to use the system when 53 other counties are using it,” Tennant told the paper. “They need to be up front and make a statement to the citizens of their counties why they are not accepting voter registration online.” According to Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, so far more than 7,000 people have been denied registration online.
</li>
<li>Oops. This week’s <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/04/05/tuesdays-delaware-city-elections-postponed/82645770/">elections for Delaware City, Delaware’s council were postponed</a> after an error in the legally mandated election notice was discovered. According to <em>The Wilmington News Journal</em>, the Jan. 5 notice, which is filed with state officials and posted in public places within the city, incorrectly stated that all residents of the city who are older than 18 with valid identification can vote. However, the rules have recently changed to require residents to register with state officials to vote on city matters. The city chose to postpone the election instead of possibly having results contested. A new date has not yet been chosen.
</li>
<li>In other Delmarva news, two days after the Pocomoke City, Maryland election, there are still no official announced results. According to the <em>Delmarva Daily Times</em>, due a machine malfunction, when the numbers for each candidate were added up, they did not match the total number of votes cast. The Pocomoke Board of Elections <a href="http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2016/04/06/new-vote-possible-lawsuit-talks-pocomoke-election/82724440/">decided on a revote</a>, but only for the 132 people who cast a ballot on Tuesday.
</li>
<li>In an interesting turn of events, poll workers in Richland County, South Carolina say that they’ve been <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article69768987.html">paid too much for the work they did</a> during February’s presidential primaries. “You can call it a bonus, you can call it anything you want, but it’s $60 I didn’t earn,” poll worker Jim Reid said at a March meeting of the county elections commission. Elections Director Samuel Selph said the county always pays workers $60 for training for election even if they do not attend the training sessions. “We have to do that to keep our poll workers coming to work for us,” Selph told <em>The State</em>. “It may sound a little flimsy, but that’s the way we do it. It was done that way before I got here. &#8230; One of the hardest things we have to do now is find dependable poll workers.” Also in Richland County this week, the county council <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article70168962.html">denied a request for $229,000 in additional funds</a> for required maintenance and licensing fees. The elections office will run a deficit of more than $1 million before July.
</li>
<li>While the Portland Trailblazers may be the basketball team of record in Oregon, Deschutes County Clerk Nancy Blankenship and Jackson County Clerk Chris Walker are teaming up with NBA players Kyle Singler (Oklahoma Thunder) and E.J. Singler (Raptors 905, part of the NBA Development League) to <a href="http://www.ktvz.com/news/nba-players-help-dechutes-county-seek-younger-voters/38858824">create a series of videos encouraging young voters to participate in the electoral process</a>. The brothers both played for South Medford High School in Jackson County. “Voting is important – it helps shape our lives, our jobs and our health care,” Kyle Singler told KTVZ. “It’s really important to us that Oregonians of all ages realize how much voting matters.”
</li>
<li>Even thoug electionline focuses on the administration of elections, we read <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/">this story</a> in Bloomberg over the weekend found it, if true, to be absolutely fascinating and thought that some of you might be interested in it as well.

Lewis</strong></a>, the long-time Sonoma County, California clerk, assessor and recorder died from a rare form of leukemia this week. She was 69. Lewis began her work with the county as a clerk-typist and eventually served seven terms as clerk before her retirement in 2006. “She took on more and more and more responsibility and never complained,” former Supervisor Jim Harberson told the <em>Press Democrat</em>. “She was a very valuable county employee.” An immigrant herself, Harberson said Lewis would take every opportunity she could get to swear in new citizens. She would always tell them that too could some day be county clerk.</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Gov. Rick Scott (R) has signed legislation into law that will expand the acceptable forms of ID for people to vote. The <a href="http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/04/01/rick-scott-signs-voter-id-law-13-other-bills/">additional, acceptable forms of ID</a> include a veteran health ID card issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; a license to carry a concealed weapon; or an employee ID card issued by any branch of government.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) has introduced legislation that would require District officials to give oral and written notification to returning citizens about their <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2016/04/06/councilmember-introduces-bill-originally-drafted-by-high-school-senior/">renewed right to vote</a>. Interestingly, the legislation was written by a high school senior who wrote it as part of his senior project about voter disenfranchisement.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: An attempt to allow Kentuckians to <a href="http://www.somerset-kentucky.com/news/early-voting-bill-is-dead-in-frankfort-polling-procedures-unchanged/article_bc931014-f6cb-11e5-a0a8-27dc382f32c3.html">vote early</a> at least 12 days before an election failed to make its way out of committee before the General Assembly completed it’s work for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>: A legislative committee has unanimously approved a bill that directs the secretary of state’s office to begin the groundwork to <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/04/bill-to-switch-maine-to-presidential-primaries-moves-forward/">switch Maine from a presidential caucus</a> state to a primary preference election state.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCOTUS</strong>: This week the Supreme Court of the United States refused to take up a case determining how states draw voting districts. According to <em>USA Today</em>, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/04/supreme-court-voting-rights-texas-districts-population-scalia/81121876/">one person, one vote</a>&#8221; case was among the most consequential of the high court&#8217;s term, and it delivered a major victory for civil rights groups that opposed opening the door to drawing districts based on the number of voters, rather than total population.&nbsp;The unanimous ruling left intact&nbsp;Texas&#8217; method — followed by nearly all&nbsp;states — of counting&nbsp;residents when drawing state and local voting districts.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: The U.S. Department of Justice has <a href="http://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/justice-department-investigating-voting-irregularities-in-arizona/article_ef787d89-9063-51f5-810e-59506e41cfeb.html">launched an investigation into what went wrong during the March 22 presidential preference primary</a> in Maricopa County. According to the <em>Arizona Star</em>, Chris Herren, chief of the voting section of the Department of Justice, told Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell in a letter Friday that his agency is trying to determine if there were violations of the federal Voting Rights Act, which prohibits states from making changes in election procedures that discriminate against minorities.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: The League of Women Voters of Kansas has joined a federal class action lawsuit that seeks to overturn a state law requiring voters to show <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2016/apr/06/league-women-voters-joins-federal-suit-kansas-citi/">proof of U.S. citizenship</a> in order to register.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: U.S. District Judge Daniel Howland has refused to throw out a lawsuit that alleges that North Dakota’s <a href="http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2016/apr/07/judge-declines-to-throw-out-north-dakota-voter-id-lawsuit/">voter ID law</a> is unfair and unconstitutional. The complaint was filed in January by seven members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, on behalf of Ohio A. Phillip Randolph Institute and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless has filed suit against Secretary of State Jon Husted over <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/04/ohio_secretary_of_state_jon_hu_6.html">how the state removes inactive voters</a> from the rolls. The suit argues that the state is wrong to assume voters are inactive because they have moved.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: The Yakima City Council is expected to <a href="http://www.khq.com/story/31633967/yakima-council-expected-to-drop-appeal-of-voting-rights-case">drop its appeal of the American Civil Liberties Union voting rights lawsuit</a> that changed city elections last year.

The online training allows poll workers to learn and review information presented in class.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: A Facebook ad encouraging people to register to vote netted Washington 13,072 new online voter registrations and updates on March 18, <a href="http://www.dailysunnews.com/news/2016/apr/05/facebook-drive-sets-voter-registration-mark/">the most for a single day since OVR launched in 2006</a>. The previous one-day high was 12,655 on Oct. 8, 2012, the deadline before the last big presidential/gubernatorial election year. “We are pleased with the influx of new voters as we head into the state Primary and General Election season,” Wyman told the <em>Daily Sun News</em>. “We love using social media as one of the avenues to attract new voter registrations.”</p></p>
