							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survey says…<br /></strong><em>Missoula County, Montana voters are happy with elections process</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org?subject=ElectionlineWeekly%2004.14.16">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>It’s difficult to get people to agree on much these days, especially in the current election cycle, but voters in <a href="http://www.missoulacounty.us/home/showdocument?id=10609">Missoula County, Montana</a> seem to agree on one thing…they are pretty happy with how elections are conducted in their county and the county elections office now has the proof.</p>
<p>The county’s <a href="http://www.missoulacounty.us/government/administration/elections-office/election-advisory-committee">Election Advisory Committee</a>, which is comprised of elections staff, county voters and representatives from local central committees, had many assumptions on voter behaviors and barriers, but committee members wanted definitive answers.</p>
<p>Working with the <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/polsci/">Political Science Department at the University of Montana</a>, the Missoula County elections office <a class="wf_file" href="images/MCVPresentationFinal.pdf"><span class="wf_file_text">surveyed voters</span></a> to find their overall satisfaction with the voting process in the county and what, if anything was hindering the process.</p>
<p>“Even though we know achieving 100 percent voter turnout in an election is a challenge, it still surprises us to hear voters will not vote,” said Rebecca Connors, administrator of elections for the county. “This survey helped us identify ‘why’ voters may not vote and we can now work to encourage participation or combat the barriers that may lead to abstaining from voting.”</p>
<p>Assistant Professor of Political Science <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/polsci/people/default.php?s=Rinfret">Sara Rinfret</a> was eager to work on the project with the county.</p>
<p>“[A]s a professor of political science and public administration it is important to not only understand how and why individuals vote, but also unpack best practices for public administrators or in this case the county&#8217;s elections office,” Rinfret said. “And, after all, the public administration side of political science are those individuals that impact our daily lives, our next door neighbors, and hold the keys to implementing public policy in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Rinfret and three students began working with Connors in the Fall of 2015 to develop the survey questions.</p>
<p>The Election Advisory Committee and the elections office wanted to know why voters do not vote, if election costs were an issue for them and if voters were content with the current polling place set up. The University of Montana added questions that captured what voters would like to see more of, barriers to the process and if they are confident in the work the elections office does.</p>
<p>“The Election Advisory Committee and UM worked collaboratively throughout several months to craft these questions; ensuring there were no gaps in data or interpretation of questions,” Connors said. “The University of Montana provided superior data collection, which helped in large part to make certain this project was a success.” </p>
<p>Connors said in the early stages they anticipated mailing a survey to voters in January 2016, but as they researched that option, they learned that the costs involved with mailing and low response rates weren’t going to really meet their goals.</p>
<p>“We have an invaluable partnership with the university and wanted to further our work together to benefit all involved; especially the voters,” Connors said. “The University of Montana presented several different options: mail survey; focus groups and phone survey. The phone survey stood out as the most economical and the most reliable.”</p>
<p>In January 2016, they partnered with the <a href="http://www.westgroupresearch.com/">West Research Group</a> to conduct a phone survey. The phone survey cost $8,000 whereas a mail survey would have cost $30,000 and focus groups would have cost between $18,000 and $20,000.</p>
<p>Question topics ranged from voting behavior and beliefs, Missoula County election practices, and efficiency and ease of the voting process. There were 605 respondents with a +/- 4 percent margin of error at the 95 percent confidence level.</p>
<p>Many of the responses aligned with the county’s thoughts and Connors said the Election Advisory Committee is pleased to now work off of reliable data rather than assumptions. She said the respondents were an accurate picture of voters within Missoula County from party affiliation, age, rural and urban voters, and men and women.</p>
<p>“We are especially pleased to find that voters are confident in the work we do,” Connors said. “The responses will also help support future election legislation, such as bills to support online voter registration, which a strong majority of respondents would like to see happen.”</p>
<p>One thing that the elections office discovered is that while the trend across the state and nation for that matter, is to consolidate polling places to alleviate cost constraints, 47 percent of Missoula County voters disagreed on consolidating polling places and that costs of elections were not a top issue.</p>
<p>Since the county elections office is 100 percent funded by local taxpayers, Connors said she will respect that opinion.</p>
<p>“We want to respect that feedback and keep our current arrangements intact,” Connors said.</p>
<p>One thing Connors said she will be doing based on the survey is to encourage the Legislature to adopt online voter registration. A majority of those responding to the survey said they would like to see online voter registration in the county.</p>
<p>In addition to the information garnered from the survey, for Rinfert, it was a great opportunity for her students — one graduate and two undergraduates—who were eager to get practical skills so they can get good post-college jobs. The students helped develop the survey questions and the graphs for the final report. Rinfret their goal is to publish the results in a peer reviewed journal this summer.</p>
<p>“I strongly believe that it is imperative for our students to move from theory (books) to practice,” Rinfret said. “Allowing an opportunity for students to work with me on this project and the county was exciting. I would not be here today if it wasn&#8217;t for my own professors.”</p>
<p>Connors said the county would be interested in conducting another survey in the future and Rinfret is eager to work with other counties or possibly conduct a statewide voters satisfaction survey.</p>
<p>“I think it was great to see the great work that the county elections office does and to be recognized for it,” Rinfret said. “Often, public administrators are labeled in a negative light and the data presents such a positive story.”</p>

<li>Ay dios mio! <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article70943892.html">Spanish-language voter guides</a> provided by the Kansas secretary of state’s office did not match the English-language and listed an incorrect voter registration date. According to the Kansas City Star, Craig McCullah, who is in charge of the office’s publications took responsibility for the mix-up. “It was an administrative error that I am diligently working to fix,” he said. McCullah said discrepancies in registration deadlines were corrected in the online version of the guide in the past 24 hours, and the rest of the text is being sent to a professional translating service to eliminate mismatches between the English and Spanish versions.
</li>
<li>State and U.S. Postal Service officials are looking into why thousands of Fulton County, Georgia residents did not receive notices from the county election’s office about <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/62cfbd4d03164b63af6c2ed83fabc887/GA--Precinct-Cards-Delayed">polling place relocation</a> until about two weeks after the March 1 primary — if they received them at all. The county’s director of elections and registration said that the design of the cards — with three addresses listed on them — may have lead them to being delayed.
</li>
<li><em>The Daily Tar Heel</em> has an interesting look at the <a href="http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2016/04/when-ids-dont-match-how-new-voter-id-laws-affect-the-transgender-community">impacts North Carolina’s voter ID law may have on transgender residents</a>. According to the article, only those who have a doctor’s note saying they have had gender reassignment surgery are legally permitted to change their gender on their license, although they could go and get a new photo taken. “You know, going to the DMV and paying $13, I’m not sure if it’s right ahead or just behind getting a root canal,” Gerry Cohen, former special counsel of the NC General Assembly told the paper. “There shouldn’t be any kind of requirement that somebody should have to go out and have a new picture just because they’ve grown a beard or have a different gender identification.”
</li>
<li><span style="font-family: MingLiU;"></span>Last week, Fox’s long running reality talent show American Idol aired for the last time and President Barack Obama kicked off the show with a taped message encouraging people to register to vote. &#8220;Voting is the most fundamental and sacred right of our democracy,&#8217; Obama said. &#8220;I believe it should be almost as easy as voting on American Idol, and we’re working on that. But when we choose not to vote, we surrender that right&#8230;<a href="http://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-connecticut-sees-uptick-in-voter-registration-after-obama-s-american-idol-message-20160408-story.html">Not all of us can sing like Kelly Clarkson, but all of our voices matter</a>.&#8221; The day following the show, Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill said the state’s online voter registration system logged 1,258 users, the site typically sees 550 users per day.
</li>
<li>With the New York primary less than a week away, elections officials are bracing themselves for a <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/04/13/independent-voters-could-make-polling-sites-a-nightmare/">potentially chaotic day</a> with many independents not realizing that the state has a closed primary system. “I’m going to predict that a lot of Sanders people who come from the ranks of independent voters are not actually registered Democrats and they will cause lines and waits at the poll sites while they attempt to vote affidavit ballots or obtain court orders to vote,” John Conklin, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections told the <em>New York Post</em>. According to the paper, in New York City elections workers have been advised not to argue with insistent independents and simply provide them with an affidavit ballot. “I can tell you I’ve been in and around elections in New York City for over 30 years and this is the first time I’m hearing of people complaining about the voter registration deadlines quite this vociferously,” Michael Ryan, executive director of the New York City BOE told the paper.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong>: The Senate Government Administration and Elections Committee has approved a bill that would allow Connecticut’s cities and towns to <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2016/04/11/bill-to-allow-fewer-polling-places-in-primaries-back-after-4-years/">reduce then number of primary day polling places</a>. The bill was originally drafted to only apply to cities and towns of 15,000 or fewer, but was expanded to include all cities and towns. Under the legislation, any town’s registrars of voters would have the authority to reduce the number of polling stations up to 60 days before a scheduled primary.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: A bill that would have allowed residents of Kentucky up to two weeks in advance of an election to cast their ballot has died in the Senate. The <a href="http://wkyufm.org/post/kentucky-general-assembly-clerks-pass-expanded-early-voting#stream/0">early voting bill</a> cleared the House, but was never brought up for a vote in the Senate. The Kentucky County Clerk’s Association had opposed the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>: The Legislature has approved a bill that would move Maine to a <a href="http://www.sunjournal.com/news/maine/2016/04/13/legislature-approves-bill-create-presidential-primaries-maine/1905747">presidential primary system</a> instead of caucuses beginning in 2020. The bill is now on Gov. Paul LePage’s desk and while he has not said whether or not he will sign it, he has indicated his support for it.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: In the closing days of the 2016 session, by a vote of 21-24 the Senate killed legislation that would have made Maryland an <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-automatic-voter-registration-bill-killed-in-senate-20160407-story.html">automatic voter registration</a> state. Senators opposing the bill—mostly Republicans—raised concerns that non-citizens wouldn’t be weeded out because Maryland issues them driver’s licenses. There were also privacy concerns for those who are victims of domestic abuse.</p>
<p>While automatic voter registration was not approved, other legislation to expand voter registration access was approved. The <a href="http://www.uspirg.org/news/usp/voter-registration-modernizations-pass-md-legislature">Freedom to Vote Act</a> will expand voter registration opportunities to nearly every state agency and provide technical upgrades to those agencies already providing voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts</strong>: Advocates testified on behalf of House Bill 4097 this week. Under the legislation filed by Boston Rep. Evandro Carvahlo, the secretary of state would be required to establish a system of <a href="http://wwlp.com/2016/04/13/automatic-voter-registration-pitched-to-improve-elections-turnout/">automatic voter registration</a> and voter registration updates for anyone doing business with a state agency or public higher education institution.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for the second time in as many weeks, Missouri Republican senators paused debate on a contentious <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/democrats-stall-voter-id-bill-in-the-missouri-senate-again/article_223060a3-b44a-5402-9c6b-1fd3cd944354.html">voter ID</a> measure after Democrats stalled a vote on the bill. GOP Senators said they will bring the bill back up before the May 13th adjournment.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico:</strong> Secretary of State Brad Winter clarified this week that <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/756668/politics/sos-some-17-year-olds-can-vote-as-of-may-18.html">17-year-olds who turn 18</a> by the time of the general election will be allowed to vote in the state’s June primary, but since the law does not go into effect until May 18, those teens will not be allowed to vote during the first eight days of early voting.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong>: Members of the Pacific Green Party of Oregon have launched a petition drive to put a measure on the ballot this November that would make Benton County the first county in the state to adopt <a href="http://www.gazettetimes.com/county-could-get-instant-runoff-system/article_84961c8f-6a10-5875-90c3-a90b92822e50.html">ranked choice voting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>: State Rep. Jason Ortitay, R-South Fayette Township, introduced legislation that would require a task force be established for the purpose of studying the commonwealth’s <a href="http://www.observer-reporter.com/20160411/ortitay_resolution_would_study_voting_technology">aging voting technology</a>. The task force would also make recommendations on future voting machine and election technology.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: Gov. Gina Raimondo has signed legislation into law that allows voters to <a href="http://statescoop.com/rhode-island-gov-signs-online-voter-registration-bill">register online to vote</a>. The legislation directs Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea’s office to develop an online portal to speed the voter registration process, as well as give voters the chance to edit their electoral information electronically. The legislation also require Gorbea’s office to include “experts concerning disability and usability access to websites” in the development process to ensure that it’s accessible to all and fully compliant with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont: </strong>The Senate unanimously approved legislation that could make Vermont the fourth state to implement <a href="http://digital.vpr.net/post/vermont-senate-approves-automatic-voter-registration#stream/0">automatic voter registration</a>. The measure has already been approved by the House. House members reviewed the Senate bill this week and approved it. <a href="http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/bill-allowing-automatic-voter-registration-passes-vt-legislature">Next up</a>, Gov.

														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kentucky: </strong>Clark County Circuit Court Judge Andrew Adams has ordered Clark County to conduct <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2016/04/11/judge-first-jeff--large-race-recount-flawed/82891118/">a second recount</a> to determine who won one of three at-large seats in November. In his decision, Adams said he will appoint the recount commission and the recount manager himself.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: Although we’re almost a month past Ohio’s March 15 presidential preference primary, Secretary of State Jon Husted went to court this week seeking to <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/04/11/husted-judge-wrong-keep-polls-open-after-bridge-crash/82910370/">overturn a judge’s ruling that kept some polls open</a> an additional hour on the 15th. &#8220;We can&#8217;t change it at this point,&#8221; Husted spokesman Josh Eck told the <em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>. &#8220;Our appeal is based on principle. We don&#8217;t want this to be a precedent going forward, that this kind of order is acceptable.&#8221; The original order, which came about one minute before polls were set to close was unusual because there was no plaintiff and no hearing, Judge Susan Dlott made the decision herself after receiving phone calls from voters stuck in traffic. &#8220;It was simply too late for the order to be implemented uniformly, and the counties made best efforts in this difficult situation,&#8221; Assistant Secretary of State Matt Damschroder said in his statement to the court.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>: The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the American Civil Rights Union (ACRU) against the Philadelphia City commissioners for their failure to respond to inquiries about <a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/philadelphia-hit-lawsuit-concealing-election-records/">voter roll maintenance</a>. According to The Washington Free Beacon, the lawsuit says that for the years the number of registered voters in Philadelphia exceeded the number of people registered to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: San Juan County has filed a countersuit in the ongoing voting rights fight between the county and the Navajo Nation over <a href="http://www.sjrnews.com/view/full_story/27152957/article-San-Juan-County-files-Voting-Rights-countersuit?instance=home_news_left">vote-by-mail</a>. The Navajo Nation argues that be limiting voting to vote-by-mail, the county is violating the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment. The county’s countersuit argues that the county has already made changes to the vote-by-mail process and has plans to provide election-day voting at four locations in 2016. The countersuit also questions the standing of the seven residents in the original lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago ruled that a lower court should consider the ACLU’s latest lawsuit against the state’s <a href="http://www.wpr.org/part-voter-id-lawsuit-gets-revived">voter ID law</a>. &#8220;The right to vote is personal and is not defeated by the fact that 99% of other people can secure the necessary credentials easily,&#8221; wrote Appeals Court Judge Frank Easterbrook. The ACLU’s suit argues that there should be an exception to the law for certain voters who an especially difficult time getting the documents they need to obtain a photo ID.</p></p>

It’s an interactive look at how states implemented and offer online voter registration. The tool tracks which states offer online registration and summarizes our survey findings across five topics: legislation, development, features, access, and processing.</p>

The app also allows voters to view their sample ballot for state and local races and find the contact information for their county auditor.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong>: This week, the Vermont secretary of state’s office launched a new, searchable website that allows researchers, educators and the general public to <a href="http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/new-vt-election-results-website-launches">search election results dating back to 1974</a>. The database includes more than 5,000 elections and nearly 3,000 candidates. “I’m happy that we are able to launch this new research tool today providing Vermonters with easy access to election results,” Secretary of State Jim Condos said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: The Elections Division has launched an upgrade to the <a href="http://myvote.wa.gov/">MyVote</a>, the state’s online voter service, with an emphasis on accessibility. The new version of MyVote was developed in collaboration with the Statewide Disability Advisory Committee, which includes voters who are blind or have sight impairment; the Washington Talking Book &amp; Braille Library; election experts in Washington and other states; and designers and application developers. MyVote was independently tested for usability, using 14 different combinations of internet browsers and screen readers. “We want to put quality information in the hands of voters across the state to help them make voting choices,” Secretary of State Kim Wyman said.</p></p>
