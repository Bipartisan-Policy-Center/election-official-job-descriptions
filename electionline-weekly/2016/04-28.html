							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Washington launches updated, accessible version of MyVote<br /></strong><em>Despite possible risks, state makes improvements during presidential election year</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org?subject=ElectionlineWeekly%2004.14.16">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p><strong>Accessible</strong> <em>[ak-ses-uh-buh l]; adj.— able to be reached or approached; able to be used or obtained; easy to appreciate or understand</em></p>
<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/">Washington Secretary of State’s Office</a> re-launched an updated version of the state’s elections portal <a href="https://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/MyVote/#/login">MyVote</a> that is mobile-friendly, easy-to-use and importantly, accessible.</p>
<p>The secretary’s office worked with Statewide Disability Advisory Committee, the Washington Talking Book &amp; Braille Library — which is a division of the secretary’s office — elections experts and designers and application developers.</p>
<p>According to Lori Augino, director of elections the secretary’s office had already been hard at work on a modernization effort set to launch in late 2017/early 2018, but with the importance of the 2016 election cycle weighing heavy they decided to move more quickly with some changes.</p>
<p>“Knowing this is a year where we expect unprecedented turnout, we asked our Disability Advisory Committee if we should make some incremental improvements before the full modernization effort is set to launch,” Augino said. “The answer was a resounding yes. So we set out create a new and improved voter tool that is accessible to all voters across Washington.”</p>
<p>Augino said the office has been watching activity in other states, including complaints and litigation and researched all of the known cases and reached out to several states to see what lessons they may be able to learn.</p>
<p>In addition, she said the state relied heavily on <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/access-denied-barriers-online-voter-registration-citizens-disabilities">the 2015 ACLU report on voter accessibility</a>.</p>
<p>“When that report came out, we read it cover to cover and analyzed our online voter registration tool and our website to ensure we met all the minimum requirements,” Augino said. “While we met all the requirements, we thought we could do better than just meeting the basics. &nbsp;Our new and improved MyVote tool provides features and accessibility beyond just the minimum requirements.”</p>
<p>The site is available in four languages and allows voters to download a fully accessible e-ballot that they can then return by mail. All elements of the site, including the online voter registration portal, the voter’s guide and information about drop box locations was tested for usability, using 14 different combinations of internet browsers and screen readers.</p>
<p>Because the site was already a pretty comprehensive personalized voter tool, the state didn’t need to expand any functionality and was instead able to focus on improving the user’s experience.</p>
<p>The site was updated for no additional costs other than time for the state’s IT staff, although Augino said the staff did have to forgo working on some other projects while completing the accessibility update.</p>
<p>“The technical team here at the Washington Office of the Secretary of State is phenomenal,” Augino said. “The ‘dream team’ that developed, tested, and marketed the new service included Matthew Edwards, Swathi Kovuri, Stuart Holmes, William Edwards, Dale Garrison, Mike Boucher, Christopher An-Träumer, and Marlene White.</p>
<p>During the process, Augino said the office was surprised by the lack of expert accessibility testers for technology. She said finding independent third parties to test and provide feedback was tough, but they have since identified some additional vendors that they will continue to use to ensure any upgrades or changes they make to MyVote won’t impact the accessibility.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Augino said the office is interested in working with counties and voter groups to identify new needs to incorporate in the future. And the state will continue with the full modernization effort that will improve the way it’s systems are integrated.</p>
<p>“Taking on a project of this nature in a presidential election year was high risk. Typically elections administrators avoid major upgrades or over-hauls to systems during these peak times and focus solely on keeping the systems running smooth,” Augino said. “But this was super important to us. Ensuring all of our Washington voters have access to information at their fingertips is something we pride ourselves on. It was worth the risk!”</p>

							<h2>Primary Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Update</strong></p>
<p>Voters in five states — Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania — went to the polls this week in what we’re calling the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/northeast-regional-train">Northeast Regional</a>. And although there were some issues, by-and-large things went very well, even though there were some things — limited polling places, new voting technology, high turnout, last-minute ballot changes, same-day registration — that could have potentially created issues. Maryland and Pennsylvania, which both had closed primaries, seemed to face none of the issues that Arizona and New York did with unaffiliated voters trying to cast ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware</strong><br />There were <a href="http://www.wmdt.com/news/more-local-news/Delaware-gears-up-for-September-primary-following-presidential/39227148">no reported issues</a> that we could find from Tuesday’s closed primary in Delaware.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong><br />Connecticut faced few problems on Tuesday and certainly none of the problems with same-day registration towns had faced in the past.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue in Connecticut was in the town of Wallingford where officials used schools as polling places. Some schools were <a href="http://www.myrecordjournal.com/news/wallingford/wallingfordnews/8761903-154/state-elections-enforcement-commission-to-investigate-voter-access-complaint-in.html">requiring voters to show a photo ID</a> in order to enter the building. It’s unclear how many, if any, voters were turned away, but the secretary of state’s office is investigating the situation in hopes of remedying it for the fall.</p>
<p>The state tested out a <a href="http://www.centralctcommunications.com/newbritainherald/article_f84bd870-0ce2-11e6-945e-cf89c3a5ca98.html">new results reporting system</a> that allowed towns to electronically upload their results to the state’s reporting system making them available almost immediately. Although not all towns participated in the program for this election, the secretary of state’s office was pleased with how the new system worked.</p>
<p>“I think when you get used to it, it’ll be really good,” Berlin Republican Registrar Elizabeth Tedeschi told the New Britain Herald. “It’s easy putting the figures in, because all the numbers are added up and all the percentages were figured out. Years past, we’ve had to fax it — and wait and wait and wait — for it to go through, because the numbers were busy.”</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong><br />Maryland debuted it’s new <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/26/prince-georges-county-voters-welcome-paper-ballots/">paper ballot voting system</a> on Tuesday and reports were that the <a href="http://www.your4state.com/election/ylehq-maryland/voters-at-the-polls-react-to-using-new-voting-system-that-processes-a-paper-ballot">new system was relatively well received</a> (even by my Dad).</p>
<p>The bulk of the problems in Maryland—which again, were minimal—happened in Baltimore where <a href="http://www.wbal.com/article/159222/122/issues-at-baltimore-polling-locations-city-elections-chief-explains">four polling places opened late</a> and were <a href="https://wamu.org/news/16/04/26/four_polling_places_in_baltimore_ordered_to_remain_open_an_extra_hour">kept open till 9 p.m.</a> by court order. Also in Baltimore, city elections staff forgot to send <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-missing-i-voted-stickers-being-delivered-to-baltimore-polls-20160426-story.html">“I Voted”</a> stickers to polling places and staff spent the morning trying to get them to as many sites as possible.</p>
<p>In an interesting move, city health workers visited polling places offering residents <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/blog/bal-naloxone-training-offered-at-polling-sites-story.html">training with the drug Narcan</a> — an opioid overdose drug. “We figured people would be in line already to vote, so why not take some time and also learn to save a life,” Leana Wen, the city health commissioner told The Baltimore Sun. Health workers didn’t enter the polling places, but stood just outside with campaign workers.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong><br />Concerns with last-minute ballot changes and confusion about the Commonwealth’s closed primary system before the election didn’t seem to manifest themselves into too many actual problems on Tuesday, but the day was not problem free of course, but the <a href="http://fox43.com/2016/04/26/minimal-issues-at-pennsylvania-polling-places/">problems were minimal</a>.</p>
<p>In the Pittsburgh area, there was a report that a <a href="http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/trans-woman-from-allegheny-county-forced-to-produce-name-change-documents-to-vote-in-pennsylvania-primary-aclu-says-request-was-unnecessary/Content?oid=1916634">transgender woman was forced to return home and bring her official name-change paperwork back to the polling site</a> in order to cast a ballot. Although her voter registration card had her current name on it, her state-issued driver’s license had her old name, gender and photo on it. Pennsylvania does not have a voter photo ID law and a staff attorney with the local ACLU said the voter should have never been asked for her photo ID and that Allegheny County needs to do more training for poll workers.</p>
<p>There were several reports of <a href="http://www.dailyamerican.com/power-outage-at-county-polling-location/article_7dc38c66-0be7-11e6-bdeb-7758674ea5ef.html">power outages</a> in different areas of the state, but none of those outages affected voting.</p>
<p>In Philly, an apartment building that was being used as a polling site had <a href="http://6abc.com/politics/problems-reported-at-some-polling-precincts/1310083/">locked up the voting machines</a> overnight and early morning voters were forced to cast paper ballots.</p>
<p>And Mark Walters, a reporter with the York Daily Record has an interesting story about noticing a voter leaving a York County <a href="http://www.ydr.com/story/news/politics/blogs/ydr-politics/2016/04/27/york-county-open-carry/83580180/">polling place with a gun holstered to his waist</a>. According to the reporter an elections official for Conewago Township said that she had not noticed the gun when the voter entered the polling place. It’s unclear from the story whether guns are permitted in Pennsylvania polling places.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong><br />Rhode Island opened only one-third of their normal polling places on primary day and while there was <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20160426/NEWS/160429408">some confusion</a> and a few lines there were few reports of major problems, although Common Cause is calling on the state to <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20160427/NEWS/160429299">make changes for future elections</a>.</p>
<p>One interesting (and, we’re not going to lie, a bit sad) problem that arose with the polling place consolidation is that at least two voters reported they were <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160426/long-walk-to-polling-place-causes-90-year-old-providence-man-to-miss-out-on-voting-for-first-time">unable to vote because the parking lot at the new polling location was too large for them to walk across</a>. John Capuano, 90, told the Providence Journal that he would normally park right in front of his polling place, but his parking space at the new site was “400 feet, 500 feet” from the location and he could not walk that far. Capuano told the paper this is first election he’s missed in 75 years.</p>
<p>The voting site on Block Island nearly ran out of ballots on Tuesday. What made this issue more harrowing is that additional <a href="http://turnto10.com/politics/block-island-polling-place-runs-out-of-democratic-ballots">ballots had to be brought by ferry</a>, which takes longer. When the additional ballots arrived at 6 p.m., the voting site was down to its last seven ballots.</p></p>

<li>Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe used his executive powers to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/04/22/about-200000-convicted-felons-in-virginia-will-now-have-the-right-to-vote-in-november/">restore voting rights to about 206,000 ex-felons</a>. While ex-felons who have completed their sentences had been apply to apply to have their rights restored, the move by McAuliffe will automatically reinstate those rights without waiting for the approval process. “Once you have served your time and you’ve finished up your supervised parole … I want you back as a full citizen of the commonwealth,” McAuliffe said at a press event announcing the executive order. “I want you to have a job. I want you paying taxes, and you can’t be a second-class citizen.” The move drew praise from advocates and condemnation from Republicans who are considering calling a <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_de305f9a-ae4a-51f4-89be-a263cf9e83f6.html">special session</a> of the General Assembly to see if they can make changes to the order. Large numbers of ex-felons are <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_ba9606ea-1091-5d81-bb3a-628d2720a3fd.html">already taking advantage</a> of the order and some local registrars are struggling to keep up with the numbers.
</li>
<li>In the ongoing back-and-forth over U.S. Election Assistance Commission Executive Director Brian Newby’s decision to modify the federal voter registration form allow Kansas, Alabama and Georgia to require <a href="http://ksnt.com/2016/04/22/mccaskill-newby-lacked-authority-to-change-voter-registration-policy/">proof-of-citizenship</a>, Sen. Clair McCaskill (D-Missouri) has weighed in with a letter to EAC saying that Newby lacked the authority to unilaterally modify the form. In a letter to the EAC, McCaskill asked that the commissioners ignore Newby’s actions and publicly consider the changes by the full commission.
</li>
<li>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/25/de-blasio-board-of-elections-reforms/">set aside $20 million for the board of election to implement reforms</a> following issues during the April 19 primary. Di Blasio wants the board to hire an outside operations consultant, establish a blue-ribbon panel to identify failures, enhance poll worker training and improve communications.
</li>
<li>Democracy North Carolina recently released a report that asserts <a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/news/local/inside-politics-group-says-voters-ballots-counted-using-safety-net/article_da972bd8-610a-55b5-8893-3494de44698e.html">that about 29,000 voters had their ballots count in the March primaries using the “safety-net provisions”</a>. The safety-net provisions were an injunction by the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals that prevented the state from eliminating same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting while the 2013 law was being challenged [see Legal Updates]. According to the report 22,855 used same-day registration for the primaries and 6,327 cast out-of-precinct ballots that were counted.

<li>Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman said this week that she will not attend this summer’s <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/secretary-of-state-her-staff-to-skip-tennessee-meeting/">National Association of Secretaries of State conference</a> in Tennessee in part because of recent legislation signed by Gov. Bill Haslam that allows counselors to refuse to treat patients based on the therapist’s religious or personal beliefs.
</li>
<li>When it rains it pours. It will cost Maricopa County, Arizona <a href="http://www.12news.com/news/politics/botched-ballots-will-cost-taxpayers-400000/152995847">about $400,000 to reprint nearly 2 million ballots for the upcoming special election</a> in May. There are two propositions on the ballot and in the Spanish-language portion of the ballot, the title listed for each proposition is the same, although the text of the proposition is correct. The County plans to reprint 700,000 ballots for use at the polls on election days. The 1.3 million early voters who received their ballots by mail will get a postcard explaining the error.
</li>
<li>Speaking of pouring, unfortunately, this is not the first time we’ve had to post a story like this. Just days before voters in Waller County, Texas were set to begin early voting for the May 7 election<a href="http://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Waller-Co-voting-machines-soaked-after-pipe-burst--376635251.html">, a pipe burst in the county courthouse drenching 60 of the county’s voting machines</a>. &#8220;All I heard was water running, falling like crazy from the ceiling &#8211; and when I got in there and saw it I was like oh my goodness,” Waller County Election Administrator Daniel Teed told KBTX. Not all of the county’s voting machines were drenched and Teed hopes that those that were will dry out by May 7.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> This week, lawmakers in Colorado began debating legislation that would <a href="http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160425/NEWS01/160429721/State-lawmakers-debate-funding-a-presidential-primary">move the state from a presidential caucus system to a presidential primary system</a>. The House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee advanced the bill 5-4. It now heads to appropriations to address an estimated $5 million cost.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> The House and Senate have each passed versions of bills that would <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/voting-reforms-mulled">automatically register Hawaiians</a> to vote when they apply for a new or renewal license and would create a vote-by-mail system. The two chambers are now working out the differences between their respective versions of the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> The House approved two bills this week that will <a href="http://www.americanpress.com/20160427-Registrars">set qualifications for voter registrars</a>. House Bill 471 requires registrars to meet at least one of four qualifications—baccalaureate degree from accredited university and two years full-time professional work experience; associate degree with four years of work experience; seven years of work experience or five years of employment in the state’s registrar’s office. The second bill is the constitutional amendment that would put those qualifications in the state constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> According to Minnesota Public Radio senators have again gone on the record in favor of <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2016/04/senators-make-new-voting-push-for-freed-felons/">restoring voting rights more quickly to felons no longer incarcerated</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said that he wants the Legislature to re-address his <a href="http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/26/hosemann-again-pushes-passage-voting-reform-bill/83571204/">election reform proposal</a> during an upcoming special session. &#8220;It makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat,&#8221; Hosemann told the Hattiesburg American.&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s good, bipartisan legislation that we worked on with dozens of Mississippians to get there.&#8221;&nbsp;The legislation was initially approved by both chambers, but upon second reading the House voted it down due to campaign finance amendments added by the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Senate Public and Municipal Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on a proposal to allow a <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/Electronic-voter-checklist-proposal-to-go-before-Senate">pilot program of an electronic voter checklist</a> in three communities this fall in both the September primary and November general election. If approved by the committee it will go before the full Senate on May 5.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, the Senate is considering legislation that would allow caregivers use an absentee to <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/caregivers-vote-with-absentee-ballot-1780565">vote for an adult, child or an infirmed adult in their care</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York:</strong> Assemblyman Luis Sepulveda and Sen. Ruben Diaz have introduced legislation that would require election officials to have <a href="http://www.lakeplacidnews.com/page/content.detail/id/1147751/NY-lawmakers-aim-to-stop-mass-voting-registration-purges.html?isap=1&amp;nav=5068">proof that a voter has died or moved before those voters may be purged from voter rolls</a>. The proposed changes would make it a felony to dump voter registrations unless there&#8217;s &#8220;confirmation&#8221; that the person has died or moved.</p></p>

<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Superior Court Judge David Gass has thrown out a lawsuit <a href="http://www.12news.com/news/politics/judge-tosses-march-voting-fiasco-lawsuit/154822918">challenging the results of the March 15 presidential preference primary</a>. According to KPNX Gass said the voters&#8217; attorney failed to show there was any misconduct in the voting fiasco or that presidential primary&#8217;s results would have been affected by any of the evidence in the two-day hearing.</p>
