							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The best laid plans</strong><br /><em>Court ruling once again splits North Carolina primaries</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>On September 30, 2015 North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed legislation into law moving the state’s presidential primary to March 15, 2016. The House and Senate worked together to move all the state’s primaries to March 15 in an effort to cuts costs and increase turnout.</p>
<p>But then, with ballots already printed, on February 5, 2016 a federal court ruled that the state had to redraw Congressional maps&#8211;maps that had just been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>While the presidential primary is still a go for next week, county elections officials will now be forced to conduct a Congressional primary in June and deal with the confusion and extra work that may come from that.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.alamance-nc.com/boardofelections/">Alamance County</a>, Director of Elections Kathy Holland said the added primary will require extra staff time to field voter questions, concerns and confusion as well as time to contact polling places in an effort secure sites that were not asked for on the yearly committal form.</p>
<p>“The State Board has not given specifics yet regarding requirements for conducting the election but there is a great possibility I will need to request additional funding,” Holland said. “The initial information indicates we will need to have matching early voting hours for 2010 which would mean we would have to open two one stop sites to match those hours. Most likely one site will be quite sufficient.”</p>
<p>Michael Perry, director of elections in <a href="http://dconc.gov/government/departments-a-e/board-of-elections">Durham County</a> said that fortunately the impact of a June primary has been minimal on his office so far.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s possible that we will not need to conduct the June primary in our county or it could be just a few precincts,” Perry said. “After the March primary we will prepare for the June primary.”</p>
<p>While Perry might not be thinking ahead to June just yet, some counties are getting ready, whether they meant to or not. In a fortunate turn of events, officials in <a href="http://www.gastongov.com/departments/elections">Gaston County</a> had already prepared for two primaries.</p>
<p>“Originally when we prepared our budget request to the county last year, the General Assembly had planned for having two separate elections &#8212; a Presidential Preference Primary in March and the regular Primary Election in May,” explained Adam Ragan, director of elections for the Gaston County Board of Elections.” Because of this, my office had budgeted for two elections so even though the General Assembly combined the Presidential Preference Primary and May Primary Election into a single election in March, we had the funds that were originally budgeted for the May Election for use for the June Congressional Primary.</p>
<p>Ragan said he will not need to request additional funds and will cost the county approximately $215,000 if there are party primaries for both major parties and around $185 if they only have one primary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Other counties like Mecklenburg had also budgeted for a second primary all along so additional costs aren’t necessarily a major factor for all counties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that most counties are working on is voter education. Although attention is still very much focused on next week’s primary, elections officials are thinking ahead to June.</p>
<p>Michael Dickerson, director of the <a href="http://charmeck.org/mecklenburg/county/BOE/Pages/default.aspx">Mecklenburg County</a> board of elections said he is currently focusing on media interviews and social media to get the word out.</p>
<p>“Currently it is media interviews. And the use of social media. We have also placed a flyer at each Early Voting location with the State Board’s explanation and the date of the June 7th Congressional primary,” Dickerson said.</p>
<p>Ragan too said that he is relying on social media to get the word out as well as partnering with local political parties and the media to inform voters of the changes. Despite that, Ragan is certain voter turnout will be low for the June primary.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sure voter turnout will be low for the June election. It&#8217;s similar to a second primary that we have on occasion,” Ragan said. “In 2016, with the addition of the June Primary, the General Assembly cancelled any Second Primary this year but, as it relates to voter turnout, it will be similar.”</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8dd887ad-6190-c130-6458-fea3703a1e7b">Holland said that there has been some confusion for poll workers and voters during early voting who wonder why the Congressional races still appear on the ballots, but she said early voting has been an opportunity for voter education. &nbsp;</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Primary Update</strong>: Voters in three states went to the polls on Tuesday with Michigan and Mississippi hosting costs for both parties and Idaho conducting a GOP primary. In <strong>Michigan</strong>, the biggest issues that arose were ballot shortages. Many counties and townships reported shortages including in <a href="http://www.woodradio.com/articles/wood-news-125494/large-turnout-in-michigan-leads-to-14471414/">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/09/clerk-genesee-precincts-unprepared-ballot-shortage/81526810/">Flint</a>, <a href="http://wlns.com/2016/03/08/ingham-co-photocopies-ballots-to-allow-everyone-to-vote/">Ingham County</a> and <a href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/elections-2016/102993209-story">Redford Township</a>. In Detroit, the problem was the voting machines. Wayne County Board of Canvassers officials discovered that a handful of <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/09/primary-ballot-snafus-arise-detroit/81547588/">Detroit</a> precincts registered zero votes during balloting. Memory cards for three precincts showed no votes cast, while five absentee ballot precincts were uploaded Wednesday as zero, acknowledged Daniel Baxter, director of Detroit elections.&nbsp;Canvassers will have to review the ballots in those precincts, but Baxter said they’re unlikely to change the results. According to published reports, the state broke a <a href="http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2016/03/08/ballots-run-short-ingham-county/81506128/">1972 voter turnout record</a>. In <strong>Mississippi</strong>, state officials said things went well and everyone had enough ballots but there were some issues in <a href="http://wjtv.com/2016/03/08/problems-reported-at-the-polling-precincts-in-madison-hinds-counties/">Hinds</a> and <a href="http://www.wapt.com/news/precincts-get-wrong-ballots-candidate-may-challenge/38434344">Madison</a> counties. And in <a href="http://wreg.com/2016/03/08/some-mississippi-voters-confused-because-voting-precincts-changed/">DeSoto County</a>, some voters were confused by new precincts and polling places. In <strong>Idaho</strong>, turnout was hit or miss with some counties seeing lines out the door and others the meagerest of turnouts. Officials in <a href="http://www.localnews8.com/news/Bannock-County-overspent-for-2016-presidential-primary/38435996">Bannock County</a> were prepared to a huge turnout and were annoyed by the low turnout and money spent in preparation for a large turnout. <a href="http://magicvalley.com/news/local/county-clerk-lines-kept-polling-locations-in-twin-falls-open/article_8e3547d7-1ba5-594e-b5ea-466c6034e56d.html">Twin Falls County</a> saw long lines and some polling places were forced to stay open to accommodate the crowds. One <a href="http://kboi2.com/news/election/long-lines-short-lines-idaho-republican-presidential-primary-in-full-swing">Garden City</a> polling site had voters waiting outside the doors at the 8 a.m. opening and a polling place in <a href="http://kboi2.com/news/election/long-lines-short-lines-idaho-republican-presidential-primary-in-full-swing">Namba</a> had to call in additional workers to deal with the crowds. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</li>
<li>Following what sometimes proved to raucous events, several states that held caucuses for their presidential election process are now considering moving back to a primary system. Officials in <a href="http://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/caucus-chaos-prompts-calls-for-a-primary-election/article_716850d2-e0d1-11e5-8364-1ba82ba14512.html">Minnesota</a>, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election/ci_29595403/colorado-considering-presidential-primary-after-2016-caucus-uproar">Colorado</a>, <a href="http://news.mpbn.net/post/after-record-breaking-weekend-lawmakers-debate-caucus-or-primary#stream/0">Maine</a> and <a href="http://wfpl.org/kentucky-gop-caucus-unwelcome-for-some-voters/">Kentucky</a> have all called for their states to revert to a primary system for presidential elections.
</li>
<li>In other primary vs. caucus news, the state of Utah is spending nearly $150,000 to send almost 1 million postcards to registered voters to remind them that the state has <a href="https://www.ksl.com/?sid=38805193&amp;nid=148&amp;title=state-spending-150k-to-promote-switch-from-presidential-primary-to-caucus">switched from a primary process to a caucus system</a>. The move came when the state Legislature failed to provide funds for the 2016 primaries.
</li>
<li>The Elections Division of the Oregon Secretary of State&#8217;s Office have released the first monthly report since introducing automatic voter registration and the report shows that <a href="http://oregonsosblog.us/2016/03/new-oregon-motor-voter-numbers-show-dramatic-increase-in-registered-voters-across-oregon/">15,502 new voters have been registered since Jan. 1</a>. According to Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins, prior to the implementation of automatic voter registration the average monthly number of new registered voters&#8211;through all forms&#8211;was 2,000.
</li>
<li>The ACLU of Virginia has sent Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) a letter calling on him to r<a href="http://augustafreepress.com/aclu-virginia-asks-governor-restore-voting-rights/">estore the voting rights of hundreds of thousands of Virginians who are ex-felons</a>. “Now that the General Assembly is on the eve of adjourning once again without addressing this important issue, we renew our request that you issue an executive order immediately that restores in full the voting rights of the hundreds of thousands of Virginians still waiting for the renewed opportunity to exercise this fundamental,” the letter stated.
</li>
<li>Indian People’s Action has sent a letter to Montana Secretary of State Linda McCullough saying that many of the state’s counties are not complying equally with her directive to set up <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2016/03/08/group-calls-indian-voting-proposals-unequal/81502850/">satellite voting offices on reservations</a>.
</li>
<li>Ooops. Due to a glitch at the U.S. Postal Service, some voters in Bend, Oregon got their gas-tax <a href="http://www.ktvz.com/news/some-bend-gas-tax-ballots-returned-to-voters-too-late-to-mail-back/38389684">ballots returned to them and now it’s too late to put them back</a> in the mail. According to Deschutes County Clerk Nancy Blankenship, equipment at the USPS was reading both sides of the return envelope and returning the ballots. &#8220;We also have taken the extra step, if they slip through and get to Portland (where Central Oregon mail is processed), they are watching for them at the Portland post office,&#8221; she told KTVZ. &#8220;Any they get there would be delivered to (the) Multnomah County (Clerk&#8217;s Office), which is an official drop site, and then get back to us.&#8221;

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Alabama</strong>: A bill introduced by Rep. Laura Hall (D-Huntsville) would allow for <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/state_lawmakers_propose_automa.html">automatic voter registration</a> for anyone applying for a new license or renewing an existing one. Secretary of State John Merrill said automatic voter registration is not part of his office’s legislative agenda for 2016. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Alaska</strong>: This week, Lt. Gov. Byron Mallett signed the certification documents for a ballot initiative that would <a href="http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/proposal-to-include-voter-registration-in-pfd-applications-moves-forward/38392684">link voter registration to applications for Permanent Dividend Funds</a>. Petitioners gathered 36,000 signatures, almost 10,000 more than necessary. Baring a special election, the initiative will appear on the August 16 primary ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: Legislation that would make it a felony for non-family members to collect and submit absentee ballots has been signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey. HB 2023 will allow judges to impose a presumptive one-year prison term and potential $150,000 fine for the practice by civic and political groups of <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ducey-s-signature-makes-ballot-harvesting-a-crime/article_1926bab2-925f-501e-9f22-94bfef91de60.html">ballot harvesting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: By the slimmest of margins (58-54), the Senate has approved legislation that will give all 58 <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/pay-raise-for-election-supervisors-going-to-scott-but-just-barely/2268426">supervisors of elections in the Sunshine State a pay raise</a>. The raises will average about $20,000 and are based on county population.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho</strong>: Legislation to allow for <a href="http://www.khq.com/story/31427591/online-voter-registration-bill-headed-to-the-house">online voter registration</a> has cleared the House State Affairs Committee and now moves to the full House for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong>: Senate File 2142 would give <a href="http://oskynews.org/?p=77166">17-year-olds the right to vote</a> in primary elections if they will be 18 by the date of the general election. Secretary of State Paul Pate supports the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: A bill filed in the Senate this week would put the question of whether <a href="http://www.messenger-inquirer.com/news/local/senate-chief-files-bills-to-restore-felons-voting-rights/article_8a00eb30-bed2-51d1-90ca-86ee62bdcb97.html">ex-felons should have their voting rights restored</a> or not before the voters.</p>
<p>Also in Kentucky, legislation that would allow for <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/bill-allowing-widespread-early-voting-clears-house-panel/article_cda9efa7-76dd-5e67-a2af-702b44c19d61.html">early voting</a> for up to 12 days before an election including two Saturdays was approved by the House.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: A bill before the New York City Council would require the city board of elections to come up with an <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/government/6214-bill-mandates-board-of-elections-emergency-plan">emergency elections plan</a>. The bill would mandate that the BOE be prepared for extreme situations by working with the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Emergency Management to create a reasonable plan to conduct an election amid a crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: Oklahoma House of Representatives will vote on Bill 2277 to <a href="http://ktul.com/news/local/bill-to-clarify-voting-rights-for-ex-felons-goes-to-house-for-a-vote">clarify voting rights for ex-felons</a>. The proposal authored by State Representative Regina Goodwin passed committee in a 6-0 vote. Current Oklahoma law states a completed prison sentence also completes a ban from voting.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong>: By a unanimous 137-0 vote, the House has approved <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2016/03/08/vt-house-approves-automatic-voter-registration/81475632/">automatic voter registration</a> legislation. Vermonters could opt out of voter registration by checking a box on the application or renewal form for a driver&#8217;s license or nondriver identification card. Otherwise, the Department of Motor Vehicles would assume applicants met the legal requirements for voting and would send their information to the Vermont Secretary of State&#8217;s Office.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: Gov. Scott Walker (R) wants the state’s voter ID law amended so that veterans may use their veteran ID as a form of <a href="http://www.wrn.com/2016/03/walker-backs-vets-ids-for-voting/">acceptable ID</a> in order to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia:</strong> A Senate committee has approved <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160308/senate-committee-passes-voter-id-bill-with-many-changes">voter ID</a> legislation albeit with many changes to what types of ID are acceptable. Under the House version, government-issued IDs, Social Security cards and Medicaid cards would have been accepted, but under the amended version in the Senate, birth certificates, voter registration cards, hunting and fishing licenses, Medicaid cards, debit cards, credit cards, health insurance cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, SNAP cards and TANF cards would also be included as acceptable forms of ID to vote.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Maine</strong>: Maine’s attorney general says a citizen initiative that would establish <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/05/maine-attorney-general-says-ranked-choice-voting-may-require-amending-constitution/">ranked-choice voting</a> must go to voters, but the bill raises “significant constitutional concerns” and may be impossible to implement without amending the Maine Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: A candidate running for Congress has filed a temporary restraining order against the state in an effort to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-david-trone-sues-md-over-ballot-issue-20160304-story.html">prevent Maryland from printing paper ballots for early voting</a>. Due to a change in voting systems and a lengthy ballot, all voters voting early must cast a ballot paper and candidate Michael Trone argues in his suit that that is unfair to voters with disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong>: Attorneys representing Mi Familia Vota Education Fund and Nevada resident Eleanor Newell sent a pre-litigation letter to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske and Terri L. Albertson, director of the DMV saying that the state Department of Motor Vehicles is <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/voting-rights-group-threatens-nevada-possible-dmv-lawsuit">not meeting its federally mandated voter registration obligations</a>. The letter states that the DMV is violating federal law by requiring applicants to complete an entirely separate voter registration application, one that requests much of the same information already provided on the driver’s license application.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2016/03/09/17-year-olds-sue-over-voting-rights.html">Nine 17-year-olds have sued Secretary of State Jon Husted</a> over his interpretation of a 1908 law that allows 17-year-olds to cast a ballot in primary elections if they will be 18 at the time of the general election. Under Husted’s interpretation, the law does not apply to presidential primaries&#8211;although 17-year-olds have long been allowed to vote in them under other secretaries of state&#8211;because the law talks about electing candidates, not nominating delegates.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong>: The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals announced this week that the full bench will review whether <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/03/5th-circuit-to-revisit-texas-voter-id-law-220525">Texas’ voter ID law</a> violates the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. Last August, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that the voter ID measure violated the Voting Rights Act because it had a discriminatory effect on African-Americans and Latinos. Texas asked the 5th Circuit to hear the case &#8220;en banc,&#8221; and civil rights groups and the Justice Department urged the court not to rehear the case.</p>
