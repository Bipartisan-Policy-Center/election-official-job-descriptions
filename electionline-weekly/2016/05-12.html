<p><strong>News Analysis: Rights restoration on the rise</strong><br /><em>Restoration of voting rights for ex-felons grows, gets easier</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org?subject=Rights%20restoration">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>This election year, more than a quarter of a million people previously prevented from casting a ballot will be able to join their neighbors at the polls thanks to the work of state legislatures and officials.</p>
<p>Voting rights restoration for ex-felons has become one of the <a href="https://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2016-05-12/felony-disenfranchisement">hot topics for the 2016 election cycle</a> driven largely by the actions of elected officials in Maryland and Virginia.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx">Currently</a> 38 states and the District of Columbia allow ex-felons to regain their voting rights upon the completion of their incarceration. In other states ex-felons may have their rights restored following the completion of all the terms of their service. In eight states they must apply for the restoration of their rights and in two states — Maine and Vermont — felons are permitted to vote while incarcerated.</p>
<p>What follows are some of the more headline-grabbing rights restoration situations in six states.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware</strong><br /><strong>Just</strong> this week, the Delaware Senate approved <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/LIS148.NSF/93487d394bc01014882569a4007a4cb7/d522e11c5e48a18d85257f860045382a?OpenDocument">legislation</a> that will allow felons who have been released from incarceration, but may still have to complete some form of financial restitution in connection with their sentence.</p>
<p>Those still serving probation and with disqualifying felonies—murder, sexual crimes and public trust crimes—will still not be permitted to vote.</p>
<p>According to Elaine Manlove, <a href="http://elections.delaware.gov/index.shtml">state election commissioner</a>, the change in law, if signed with the governor, will have no impact on the processing registrations for her office.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong><br />The voting rights of about 20,000 ex-felons hangs in the balance waiting for a ruling from the state’s highest court.</p>
<p>Currently, ex-felons in Iowa who have not committed “infamous crimes” may have their voting rights restored upon application to and approval of the governor’s office. However, in late March the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/03/30/justices-weigh-restoring-felon-voting-rights/82426832/">Iowa Supreme Court heard arguments</a> in a case brought on behalf of Iowa woman who lost her right to vote based on a 2008 non-violent drug charge. Lawyers on behalf of the plaintiff argued that the crime does not meet the definition of “infamous crime.”</p>
<p>Arguments inside and outside of the court have been passionate. Secretary of State Paul Pate penned an <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2016/04/05/keep-voting-sacred-privilege/82654516/">op-ed</a> for The Des Moines Register supporting the state’s current system of restoring rights to certain ex-felons through an approval process.</p>
<p>While the Supreme Court is considering the arguments, the office of Gov. Terry Branstad has <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/04/27/process-restore-felon-voting-rights-streamlined/83598488/">streamlined the existing process</a> for ex-felons to have their voting rights restored.</p>
<p>“This newly re-designed application form strikes a balance between ensuring that offenders have demonstrated their ability to regain their voting rights, while also creating a more user-friendly process for offenders who would like their voting rights restored,” Lt. Gov. Kim&nbsp;Reynolds <a href="https://ltgovernor.iowa.gov/2016/04/branstad-reynolds-announce-review-four-executive-clemency-applications-streamline-process#.VzSneGZfvBI">said in the release</a>. “This application form is just another example of our administration’s commitment to promote fairness for the victims of crime while being mindful that rehabilitated offenders should have an opportunity to receive clemency.”</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong><br />In the waning days of his administration former Gov. Steve Beshear (D) signed an executive order <a href="http://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-Stream.aspx?viewMode=ViewDetailInNewPage&amp;eventID=%7B21A87BED-DEFF-4206-861C-35F0851FF591%7D&amp;activityType=PressRelease">restoring the voting rights to about 140,000 Kentuckians</a>, however, within hours of being sworn-in, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article51139910.html">signed another executive order rescinding Beshear’s order</a>. Bevin’s order though, does not take away the voting rights of ex-felons who received a rights restoration certificate from the Department of Corrections between Nov. 24 and December 22, 2015.</p>
<p>Bevin, who had been on the record as supporting rights restoration justified his actions by saying it should have been done legislatively and not through executive order.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I have been a vocal supporter of the restoration of rights,” Gov. Matt Bevin (R-Ky.) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/23/kentuckys-new-governor-reverses-executive-order-that-restored-voting-rights-for-felons/">said&nbsp;in&nbsp;announcing the order</a>, “it is an issue that must be addressed through the legislature and by the will of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/Kentucky-Senate-approves-bill-to-clear-path-for-felon-voting-rights/38627256">Legislature</a>, the House approved legislation that would automatically restore the rights of some nonviolent ex-felons once they have completed the terms of their service. On the Senate side, the Senate approved a bill that would put the issue before the voters.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong><br />This April, about 40,000 Marylanders had an opportunity to cast their ballot in a primary election due the restoration of their voting rights.</p>
<p>In 2015, the General Assembly <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?stab=01&amp;pid=billpage&amp;tab=subject3&amp;ys=2015rs&amp;id=HB0980">approved legislation</a> restoring the rights of ex-felons to vote upon their release from incarceration and even if they still have terms of service to complete — parole, probation, financial restitution.</p>
<p>Gov. Larry Hogan (R) <a href="http://governor.maryland.gov/2015/05/22/governor-larry-hogan-vetoes-six-bills/">vetoed</a> the legislation on the last day of the bill signing calendar. Upon returning to session in 2016, the General Assembly <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-felons-voting-20160209-story.html">voted to override Hogan’s veto</a>.</p>
<p>Since becoming law on March 10, rights groups have <a href="http://www.wbaltv.com/politics/exfelons-prepare-to-vote-thanks-to-new-maryland-law/39020716">worked to get as may ex-felons registered as possible</a>, especially in advance of the April primary.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us will be working very hard over the next couple of years to register more and advertise it,&#8221; Baltimore NAACP president Tessa Hill-Aston told WBAL.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong><br />In Minnesota, felons must complete their parole and probation before their voting rights are then automatically restored, but some, including Gov. Mark Dayton support speeding that process up.</p>
<p>Dayton told reporters recently that he would like to be able to restore voting rights in the same fashion that Virginia Gov. Terry McAullife has done, but said that legal counsel have told him his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/dayton-nixes-executive-action-on-felon-voting-rights/377330201/">office does not have that unilateral authority</a>.</p>
<p>“We looked very carefully to see what the boundaries are,” Dayton <a href="http://www.twincities.com/2016/04/27/dayton-wants-to-expand-voting-to-the-formerly-imprisoned/">said</a> according to the Pioneer Press. “I think people who have served their time and paid their debt to society deserve to be re-enfranchised as citizens of this country.”</p>
<p>Currently about 47,000 ex-felons could have their rights restored much faster if they were able to have them restored upon being released from incarceration, but still had terms of service to complete.</p>
<p>In 2015, bi-partisan legislation would have restored the rights to ex-felons upon release from incarceration, but according to local press reports, while it was bi-partisan it didn’t have enough support to make it out of committee.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2016/04/senators-make-new-voting-push-for-freed-felons/">This year</a>, the <a href="http://www.senate.mn/chamber/amendment/amend.php?amend_name=ss2381a50">Senate has once again approved legislation</a> that would restore ex-felons voting rights, but its passage by the House seems unlikely at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong><br />Gov. Terry McAuliffe made headlines in April when he signed an executive order <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_771db279-34d6-5a3d-9557-a417a8afb212.html">restoring the voting rights to more than 206,000 ex-felons</a>.</p>
<p>Upon <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_771db279-34d6-5a3d-9557-a417a8afb212.html">announcing</a> the executive order, McAuliffe said: “There may be some individuals who will try and demagogue this issue and will make reckless accusations,” McAuliffe said. “Our action today does not pardon or change the sentence for any man or woman affected by this plan. These individuals have completed their sentences. They have atoned for their actions.”</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-study-nearly-80-percent-of-felons-allowed-to-vote-were-non-violent/2016/05/11/998e0574-178c-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html">report</a> released by McAullife, about 80 percent of the ex-felons who had their rights restored were convicted of non-violent crimes.</p>
<p>In about three weeks of the executive order, <a href="http://www.13newsnow.com/news/norfolk-felon-urges-others-to-register-to-vote-after-righs-restored/184719062">several thousand ex-felons</a> have registered to vote.</p>
<p>Backlash from the state’s Republican Party was sift and they have enlisted the help of an attorney to <a href="http://wjhl.com/2016/05/02/virginia-gop-plan-to-challenge-governors-rights-restoration-order-for-convicted-felons/">pursue legal action</a> and some members of the General Assembly are meeting to see what they can do <a href="http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Lawmakers-debate-felon-voting-rights-restoration-379058481.html">legislatively</a>.</p>
<p>Ex-felons quickly began taking advantage of McAuliffe’s action and in some cases, the number of new registrants <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_ba9606ea-1091-5d81-bb3a-628d2720a3fd.html">overwhelmed local registrars</a>. Within in days of the announcement, elections officials in Richmond and Henrico County were sifting through hundreds of voter registration applications.</p>
<p>According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, much of the confusion arose among registrars because they said they were not able to verify restoration of a felon’s voting rights either on the Virginia Election Registration Information System, VERIS, or a searchable online site operated by the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>About 10 days after the executive order state officials said they had <a href="http://wric.com/2016/05/03/restoring-voting-rights-state-officials-address-issues-though-challenges-remain-for-registrars/">completed the data entry</a> to make the registration process easier, but some registrars are still having issues and in some cases it can take up to two weeks to verify that an ex-felon is now eligible.</p>
<p>Like in Maryland, voting rights groups in Virginia are <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/starexponent/news/in-virginia-the-race-is-on-to-register-former-felons/article_41bf6980-1397-11e6-b2bf-a3f1d3f73b15.html">working hard</a> to get the word out about the rights restoration and get those ex-felons registered.</p>
<p>“Might sound strange to say this but I felt so much possibility now. I felt like I was going to have the chance to participate in all phases of society again, and I was just tickled to death,” Joseph Miler <a href="http://www.13newsnow.com/news/norfolk-felon-urges-others-to-register-to-vote-after-righs-restored/184719062">told 13 News Now</a>.</p>
<p>Miller was convicted of grand larceny in 1994 and served two years in prison. He has not been able to vote since then saying that he gave up on the process of rights restoration because it was so overwhelming.</p>
<p>“I sort of the believe in the old saying that you don&#8217;t really want something until it&#8217;s taken away from you, and one of the biggest things was the right to vote,” Miller told the station.</p>

							<h2>Primary Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong><br />Things were <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/local/quieter-gop-presidential-race-makes-for-less-dramatic-primary/article_03496de2-45dc-5f18-9eeb-d70771cd2974.html">pretty quiet</a> on election day in Nebraska, which saw state and local races as well as a muted GOP presidential primary. Legislators are looking into <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Nebraska-Primary-Date-Early/2016/05/10/id/728027/">moving the state’s primary</a> up earlier in four years to give Cornhuskers more of a say although according to final number, the state had its <a href="http://www.heraldonline.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article77054247.html">highest turnout since 2000</a>.</p>
<p>The day wasn’t without problems though. About 700 voters in <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/4e1ed896a8284984a062e85f575fda93/NE--Webster-County-Regents-Race">Webster County</a> weren’t able to vote in the University of Nebraska Regents race because the race was not included on the ballot. In addition to those missing voted, because the difference in candidates is only about 166, a recount is expected.</p>
<p>There were some polling place issues even though it was a quiet day. Recent <a href="http://www.klkntv.com/story/31937272/the-latest-damage-forces-lincoln-polling-station-change">storms did force</a> some polling sites to find new locations. And a gas leak in <a href="http://www.ketv.com/news/gas-leak-closes-polling-location/39476756">Omaha</a> caused on polling place to be shut down and relocated on primary day. Also in Omaha, voters were frustrated that the <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/metro/confusion-frustration-after-officials-fail-to-notify-ward-voters-that/article_65d6476b-e78e-5fe0-8a7b-559f78e681b0.html">Douglas County</a> election commission had failed to notify them that their polling place had been relocated.</p>
<p>The great thing, in our opinion anyway, about quieter election days is that the local media has time to find more human interest stories like the one about <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/year-old-grand-island-woman-voted-for-fdr-in-and/article_85012325-4156-5b9d-be50-3a4c1703ad62.html">104-year-old Susan Wiese</a> of Grand Island who cast her first ballot for FDR in 1932 and voted in every election since then. “Voting is a very important privilege,” Wiese said. “The minute you were allowed to vote, I started to vote.” She was 21 years old in 1932 when she cast her first ballot.</p>
<p>KWBE took some time to feature long-time <a href="http://kwbe.com/local-news/experienced-workers-help-johnson-county-election-thrive/">Johnson County</a> poll workers—some who have been on the job for 40 years.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have polling machines when we started and we had counting boards back in those days, where once you had 25 ballots in the box, you could take them out. You’d go in a separate room and count the ballots. Now, they just put them in the machine and they’re counted right when you put them in. When we leave tonight, everything will be totaled up, doesn’t make a difference if there’s two people on the ballot or if there’s 20,” Imogene Mason told the station.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong><br />While early voting numbers broke records in the Mountain State, primary day turnout was mixed, but still higher than normal. There were <a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2016/05/10/still-some-voters-waiting-their-turn-as-polls-close-statewide/">reports of long lines</a> in some counties and there were reports of some voters still in line as the polls closed.</p>
<p>Voters in <a href="http://www.wdtv.com/wdtv.cfm?func=view&amp;section=5-News&amp;item=Harrison-County-Voters-Experience-Long-Wait-Times-30619">Harrison County</a> reported waiting 40 to 45 minutes to vote. County Clerk Susan Thomas told WDTV that for the first time since she’s been a clerk, people were still coming into vote right up until closing time. Thomas said despite the number of voters, things went smoothly and chalked that up to the county’s electronic voting machines.</p>
<p>Lines and electioneering were the two big issues facing voters in <a href="http://wajr.com/election-day-underway-with-minor-glitches-in-mon-county/">Monongalia County</a> on Tuesday. Several voters complained to officials that campaign staff were not adhering to the 300-foot rule.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://woay.com/News.aspx?nid=24289">Fayette County</a>, large turnout and paper ballots slowed down the counting process that wasn’t complete until about 3 a.m. on Wednesday. County Clerk Kelvin Holiday told WOAY that he hopes to have additional electronic voting machines at each precinct in the fall.</p>
<p>It was a late night in <a href="http://www.theet.com/news/local/hardware-problems-cause-late-election-results-in-doddridge-county/article_44fc976b-fbe9-5933-a9a0-a3ccf41c7f4c.html">Doddridge County</a> as well when computer glitches delayed the counting of votes in 12 precincts until after midnight. According to Clerk Beth Rodgers, the problems came from the county courthouse printer and not the county’s iVotronic machines.</p>
<p>Strong turnout also slowed the tally in <a href="http://www.wdtv.com/wdtv.cfm?func=view&amp;section=5-News&amp;item=The-Voting-Count-Hold-Up-in-Upshur-Co--What-Now-With-No-Randolph-Co-Schools-Levy-30642">Upshur County</a> and has left county officials considering a switch to electronic voting machines.</p>
<p>Human error—in the form of folded ballots and over-votes—slowed the counting process in <a href="http://www.newstribune.info/article/20160511/NEWS/160519952">Mineral County</a>. Only six of 30 precincts were counted by 2 a.m.</p>
<p>And in <a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2016/05/10/tennant-warner-matchup-set-for-secretary-of-states-race-in-november/">secretary of state news</a>, incumbent Secretary of State Natalie Tennant (D) will face Mac Warner (R) in November. We’ll have more on that race as it gets closer to Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong><br />In more follow-up to the April 5 primary in St. Louis County, Secretary of State Jason Kander has <a href="http://themissouritimes.com/29627/kander-releases-findings-on-st-louis-county-election-fiasco/">released a report</a> which found that a mix-up of ballot types caused the ballot shortages in some polling places and excesses in others.</p>
<p>Recommendations to solve the problem included creating a step-by-step process to assure the correct number and type of ballot reached each location, creating more peer oversight on proofing and ensuring the correct amendment draft, and creating a contingency plan, should another ballot shortage occur.</p>
<p>“This was an egregious mistake by St. Louis County officials that should never happen again,” Kander said in a statement to The Missouri Times. “I hope St. Louis County takes the Elections Integrity Unit recommendations seriously to help ensure that every eligible voter in the county has an opportunity to cast a ballot in every election.”</p></p>

<ul>
<li>When it rains it pours. The Arizona secretary of state’s office <a href="http://ktar.com/story/1066344/pamphlet-plight-by-arizona-secretary-of-state-could-postpone-may-special-election/">failed to send out more than 200,000 publicity pamphlets</a> for next week’s special election. The failure affects more than 400,000 voters. According to KTAR, spokesman Matt Roberts said the pamphlets should have reached voters 10 days before early voting started on April 20 and blamed a private vendor for the problem. By the time the mistake was discovered and new voter guides mailed and received, it was May 6. He noted that the voter pamphlet is available online and the vendor has been fired. On another note, a coalition of voting-rights advocates will form a <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/new-commission-aims-to-reform-election-procedures-in-light-of-march-22-mess-8283909">new commission</a> to examine everything from polling locations to voter education in Maricopa County.

<li>Wichita County, Texas Clerk Lori Bohannon is saying no mas. Bohannon addressed the county court this week and asked that the clerk <a href="http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/local/clerk-wants-out-of-election-business-327e4767-bfa5-5e0c-e053-0100007f2253-378866411.html">no longer be responsible for handling elections</a> and that instead the county create an election administrator position like other counties in Texas already have. Bohannon said that while she loves running elections, being clerk requires her to spend too much time on other duties. &#8220;… [W]ith election laws changing rapidly, it would be best to have an election administrator,&#8221; Bohannon told the court.

<li>Steve Bousquet and Michael Auslen of the <em>Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times</em> have a great look at <a href="http://www.bradenton.com/news/state/florida/article76303527.html">voter fraud in Florida</a> and how no matter how much candidates like to claim there is a lot of voter fraud in the Sunshine State, there really is very little. It’s definitely an interesting read.

<li>“Not just hashtags, but votes.” We think electionline has found our new tagline. During his commencement address at Howard University, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/obama-urges-howard-university-graduates-be-politically-engaged-n569896">President Barack Obama addressed getting involved in the political process, especially voting</a>. &#8220;It is absolutely true that 50 years after the Voting Rights Act, there are too still many barriers in this country to vote,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;There too many people trying to erect new barriers to voting. This is the only advanced democracy on earth that goes out of its way to make it difficult for people to vote, and there&#8217;s a reason for it, there&#8217;s a legacy to that. But even if we dismantle every barrier to vote, that alone does not change the fact that America has one of the lowest voting rates in the free world.&#8221;

The video, written by Dane County Clerk Scott McDonnell. &#8220;Once you do something and you break the ice, and there’s no penalty and people like it, then it lets the creative juices flow around here,&#8221; McDonell said on a podcast announcing the winners. The Chad Vader video received 477 of the 883 votes cast — and we promise we were only one of those!

<p>Also in California, San Francisco supervisors voted to send a ballot measure to voters this week and if approved, it would <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Supervisors-OK-ballot-measure-to-lower-SF-voting-7458077.php">lower the voting age for local elections to 16</a>. The board voted 9 to 2 to place the measure on the November ballot. “Regardless of whether this measure is approved or not, (San Francisco) is starting a trend that will happen across the country, where cities like ours will consider whether young people can vote,” Supervisor John Avalos said during the meeting this week.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> The Legislature has approved SB 242 that will allow eligible <a href="http://www.delaware1059.com/story/24233-senate-passes-bill-to-restore-voting-rights-for-felons-following-their-time-in-prison">ex-felons to have their voting rights restored</a> as soon as they are released from prison, but before financial obligations may be met.

<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> U.S. District Judge George C. Smith has ruled that <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/05/11/judge-says-blind-denied-voting-access-but-dont-expect-changes-for-november.html">blind Ohioans have been denied “meaningful access”</a> to the state’s absentee voting system. In his decision, Smith wrote, “The inability of disabled voters to vote absentee in a private and independent manner evidences that these voters do not have the same meaningful access to mail-in absentee voting that non-disabled voters enjoy.”</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> An <a href="http://www.dailyastorian.com/Local_News/20160510/1-million-county-clerk-lawsuit-heads-to-trial">unlawful termination suit</a> is headed to trial later this month in Clatsop County. Former County Clerk Maeve Kennedy Grimes’ claims that she was unlawfully fired in 2014 after errors were discovered on the November general election ballot. According to Kennedy Grimes’ $1 million suit against the county, she was fired because her boss, County Manager Scott Somers did not like that he was not consulted about how to fix two ballot mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit against San Juan County over vote-by-mail, have filed a motion in U.S. District Court of Utah to <a href="http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/featured-articles/9464-utah-navajo-plaintiffs-ask-court-to-dismiss-counterclaim-in-voting-rights-case">dismiss a counterclaim by the county</a>. The original claim, filed in early 2016, argues that the county is violating parts of the Voting Rights Act and 14th Amendment by only voting by mail.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Phyllis Booze, former Botetourt County registrar, has dropped her <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/local/botetourt_county/ousted-registrar-phyllis-booze-drops-lawsuit-against-botetourt-s-electoral/article_28af545e-aa92-5f9e-9c9a-3015f4d4a71c.html">unlawful termination suit</a> against the county. Booze had claimed she was terminated from her job for political reasons. In agreeing to the dismissal, the electoral board made no settlement and admitted no wrongdoing. “Everybody is just walking away,” County Attorney Michael Lockaby told the R<em>oanoke Times.</em></p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The City of Yakima owes the ACLU <a href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/aclu-case-costs-yakima-million/article_24da90aa-17b2-11e6-abeb-b3905d84f73b.html">$3 million</a> to cover costs and fees associated with the long-running voting rights fight which the city ultimately lost.</p></p>

<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> According to the <em>Quad-City Times,</em> Scott County&nbsp;voters will be the first in Iowa to be able to utilize a new web-based tool to <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/scott-county-to-provide-interactive-sample-ballots/article_9df5b377-d814-5d5e-938f-d214dc3d013d.html">see and interact with sample ballots</a> for the June 7 primary. The interactive sample ballots allow people to type in a name and date of birth to get the ballot that fits their part of the county. Voters then can pick their candidates and print out a ballot. Alternatively, they can download the ballot to a computer or mobile device. The ballot is a sample, and actual votes are still only cast at a polling place or via absentee ballots. But officials say this will help people see their choices and make selections before going to a polling place or voting with an absentee ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Hood River County, in partnership with the secretary of state’s office is offering new technology that will allow voters to <a href="http://www.hoodrivernews.com/news/2016/may/07/county-unrolls-ballottrax-tool/">track the delivery and receipt of their ballot</a> for next week’s primary. According to <em>Hood River News</em>, BallotTrax, allows voters to sign up online to receive alert messages via text, phone or email. Voters will receive messages when their ballot is mailed out and when it is accepted for counting. “We are excited to offer this resource to voters in Hood River County,” Kim Kean, elections supervisor told the paper. There is no charge for the service, but message charges from carriers may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Fort Bend County is offering a new feature on its website to help make election day voting easier. On voting day, when visitors to the county’s elections website click on the map of voting centers, each voting center will be pinned with a colored pin that will reflect the <a href="http://www.fortbendstar.com/new-tool-helps-voters-find-polls-in-fort-bend-county/">anticipated wait time at each location</a>.</p></p>
