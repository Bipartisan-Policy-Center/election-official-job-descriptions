							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;And we’re off&#8230;<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><br /></span></strong><em>2016 election season finally, fully underway, here’s what to watch</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>Although it may seem like the 2016 election season has been dragging on for years already, things really kick into high gear next week on March 1 with Super Tuesday that features primaries and caucuses in 13 states and territories.</p>
<p>Super Tuesday will include what has been dubbed the “SEC Primary,”&nbsp; — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas — as well as primaries in Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia and caucuses in Alaska (GOP), America Samoa (DEM), Colorado, and Minnesota.</p>
<p>Following Super Tuesday, there will be contests almost every Tuesday, and some weekends too, through June 14 when the District of Columbia Democratic party holds the very last primary in the country.</p>
<p>Elections officials have spent countless hours and dollars purchasing new equipment, training staff and volunteers and educating the public, but since the last time the American public when to the polls en masse, there have been many changes.</p>
<p>How will the voting public cope? How will elections officials? While we think everything is worth watching on an election day, these are the 10 things we’ll be keeping an eye on in the coming months.</p>
<p>And stick with us throughout the day on Tuesdays during primary season. We’ll be bringing you Election Dispatches all day whenever voters are headed to the polls.</p>
<p><strong>New Voting Equipment</strong><br />Although new voting equipment might be the bigger storyline four years from now, there are multiple jurisdictions that will be using new voting systems for the first time in a presidential election — and for the entire state of Maryland for the first time ever. Four counties in Arkansas are testing out a new voting system, Maryland is moving to an optical-scan system for the first time, many counties are launching e-poll books for the first time on a large scale basis and many elections offices have purchased new ballot counting equipment. Will voters and poll workers struggle with the new equipment at polling places? Will elections staff be able to more quickly report results?</p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong><br />North Carolina is the only jurisdiction rolling out voter ID for the very first time. There are numerous other jurisdictions that have given it a test run in small elections, but this is the first time many voters will be asked to show a photo ID for a presidential election. Advocacy groups and state officials have worked to educate voters about the ID requirements, but it remains to be seen what impact this may have on voters. Will people be turned away? Will there be a lot of provisional ballots?</p>
<p><strong>Turnout</strong><br />Turnout is always a “known, unknown”. State elections officials make predictions, but no one every really knows how many voters will turnout on election day. <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/government/politics/elections/tennessee-breaks-early-voting-turnout-record-2c8a95f7-f070-303c-e053-0100007f1bdf-370041191.html">Early voting numbers</a> and absentee ballots requests are up, but do those numbers parlay into increased numbers on election day? Interest is certainly high, but will that high interest remain as the election enters the late spring and it becomes more clear who the nominees may be? Will the Millennials bother to show up?</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong><br />The heart of the primary season kicks off just as spring storms start making their way across the country. Already<a href="http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/louisiana/2016/02/23/early-voting-suspended-anticipation-severe-weather/80799470/" target="_blank">Louisiana</a>has had to limit early voting hours because of storms. Will storms impact turnout on primary days? Will storms affect polling places in the days leading up to primary contests? Watching<a href="http://www.weather.com/" target="_blank">The Weather Channel</a>could be as important for local elections officials and voters as testing election equipment and reviewing sample ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Vote-by-mail</strong><br />More and more voters are turning to the mailbox as opposed to the ballot box. What impact will vote-by-mail have on election day turnout? How will local elections officials cope with the volume of mailed ballots? Following problems in 2015, will all mail ballots in Ohio be counted?</p>
<p><strong>Vote Centers</strong><br />The popularity of vote centers is on the rise in the U.S. While many voters in states like Indiana are used to vote centers, some voters, especially those who typically only show up for marquee elections, in counties in<a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2014/title-7/chapter-1/section-7-1-113" target="_blank">Arkansas</a>and<a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Texas-counties-increasingly-turning-to-vote-6479490.php" target="_blank">Texas</a>will be using vote centers for the first time. Will the allocation of vote centers in these counties be able to deal with anticipated turnout? Will there be voter confusion of those looking for their local polling place?</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Ships</strong><br />Ghost ships —<a href="http://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/2016/02/24/ghost-ships-out-of-the-race-still-on-the-ballot/" target="_blank">as defined by our colleague Doug Chapin</a>— are ballots, many printed back in January in order to comply with UOCAVA, that feature the names of candidates who have suspended their campaigns. Elections officials in<a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/local/some-absentee-voters-ask-for-re-dos-on-ballots/105222590" target="_blank">Florida</a>are already fielding calls from voters who cast absentee or early ballots of former Gov. Jeb Bush wanting to know if they can cast a new ballot. As more candidates drop out, will this create a problem for elections officials? Will it impact early voting turnout?</p>
<p><strong>Late-breaking Litigation</strong><br />Another day, another lawsuit. Currently there are least a dozen lawsuits pending that may or may not impact the primaries and several states and certainly could impact the general election. Will we see more lawsuits as the primary season grinds on into the spring?</p>
<p><strong>Expectations</strong><br />How much will any or all of this affect the speed with which ballots are counted and winners declared? Media coverage of elections is already intense, but it always “goes to 11” in a presidential year. Will there be problems with results and if so, why?</p>
<p><strong>The Circus</strong><br />Even the most apolitical person is aware of the circus-like atmosphere that has surrounded the 2016 election cycle so far. Will candidate and supporter shenanigans impact voters and local elections officials? Multiple school systems in Virginia have canceled classes on March 1 because of concerns about the impact turnout (and at one point time the GOP loyalty oath) may have on students. Candidates and their supporters have already been crying foul over policies and procedures — although without much follow-through — in the early contests; will this continue during the primary season?</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Well this doesn’t happen every election! Missoula County, Montana elections officials say that more than <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/over-800-volunteer-election-judges-missoula-county#stream/0">800 people have stepped up to serve as elections judges</a> for the upcoming elections. That’s about 170 more than served in 2014. &#8220;It’s a huge election year, we really need to have that support. We also needed to hit that number so that we can ensure we have enough staffing to be able to staff our polling places so we can keep them in everybody’s communities,” Elections Administrator Rebecca Connors told MTPR. “We were able to hit that number and we’re very excited about that.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Massachusetts was forced to <a href="http://wwlp.com/investigative-story/primary-concern-ballot-problems-force-state-to-reprint-thousands/">reprint thousands of ballots</a> this week after local elections officials complained that the ink on ballots was not being properly read by certain voting machines. Localities using the AccuVote system were all expected to get new ballots by the middle of this week, less than a week before Super Tuesday.
</li>
<li>Oops! In other ballot-related news, about 20 voters in Hampton, Virginia <a href="http://wkbn.com/2016/02/22/virginia-voters-receive-test-ballots-instead-of-absentee-ballots/">received absentee ballots that had already been completed</a>. It seems the vendor included the marked, test ballots with the rest of the ballots and staff in the elections office were unaware since they are working with a new vendor.
</li>
<li>Nearly two months after launching in Oregon, <a href="http://www.ktvz.com/news/motor-voter-law-adds-10000-voters-to-oregon-rolls/38124162">automatic voter registration has added nearly 10,000 voters to the state’s voting rolls</a>.
</li>
<li>Maybe things would be different if they were states. Local media reported problems with both the D.C. Board of Elections and the U.S. Virgin Islands Joint Board of Elections this week. In the <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/news/local-news/2016/02/18/st-thomas-st-john-boycotts-joint-elections-board-meeting">USVI</a>, members of the St. Thomas-St. John board of elections boycotted the most recent meeting of the joint board because members of the St. Croix delegation had boycotted the previous meeting. The St. Croix delegation had boycotted the previous meeting over travel costs. In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/why-dcs-troubled-election-board-couldnt-get-a-grip-on-its-finances/2016/02/23/788484f6-da48-11e5-81ae-7491b9b9e7df_story.html">D.C.</a> members of the board of elections testified before the city council during oversight hearings that they had no idea where/how millions of HAVA funds were spent because they — the three members of the board — were essentially volunteers and their efforts were not focused on that line of funding.
</li>
<li>Move over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0cTaFr7Jkk">Darth, err we mean Chad</a>, there’s a new Jedi in town. The Contra Costa County, California Elections Office is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the Star Wars franchise with a <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_29535776/eye-east-bay-county-election-video-goes-all">new video it has created to recruit poll workers</a>. The video opens with a scroll of words, just like the popular film series and then transitions to a variety of stills of happy volunteers and elections staff working on the front lines of an election at polling places and in the elections office. It appears that Obi-Wan Kenobi might even be pitching in with the ballot counting. &nbsp;

							<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong>: The Anchorage Assembly is considering a $300,000 appropriation to move the city to a <a href="http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/assembly-to-consider-300000-appropriation-for-transition-to-mailin-ballots/38156260">vote-by-mail system</a>. Among other things, the funds would cover a staff member to oversee the transition.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: A bipartisan effort to <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/bipartisan-push-in-senate-to-make-secretary-of-state-elected/2266636">make the secretary of state position elected</a> as opposed to a political appointee was approved 11-0 by the Senate Rules Committee this week.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong>: Legislators are considering a bill that would <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/31297262/lawmakers-debate-bill-that-would-give-prisoners-voting-rights">allow incarcerated felons to cast a ballot</a>. Rep. Kaniela Ing introduced the bill saying that it would go a long way to helping rehabilitate those serving time.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Sen. Roger Manno (D-Montgomery County) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://news.wypr.org/post/state-lawmakers-propose-automatic-voter-registration#stream/0">automatically register residents</a> to vote whenever they have an interaction with the state’s Motor Vehicle Administration as well as through social service agencies and the state’s health exchange. Residents would be given 21 days to opt out.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> A bill <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2016/02/22/bill-moves-forward-to-expand-sec-of-states-authority-in-voter-fraud-cases/">expanding the secretary of state’s legal authority</a> in prosecuting cases of voter fraud was advanced by a Senate committee vote on Monday. Senate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/16info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=22400059" target="_blank">Bill 786</a>&nbsp;would allow the Missouri Secretary of State to investigate and prosecute cases of alleged voting fraud. The legislation was proposed by Sen. Will Kraus who is running for secretary of state.</p>
<p>Also in Missouri, while thousands of Americans are busy casting early ballots the House rejected legislation that would have allowed residents of the Show Me State to join the <a href="http://www.missourinet.com/2016/02/23/missouri-house-rejects-early-voting-proposal/">early voting</a> party. Those opposed to the legislation said that it would open up more opportunities for voter fraud.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The House Elections Committee is considering legislation that would <a href="http://www.wcvb.com/news/bill-would-allow-jailed-felons-in-new-hampshire-to-vote/38119028">allow incarcerated felons to cast a ballot</a>. If approved, New Hampshire would join Maine and Vermont as the only state that allows felons currently serving time to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: A bill expected to be introduced this spring will give <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/02/22/new-bill-could-give-illegal-aliens-voting-rights-in-new-york-city/">undocumented immigrants the right to vote in local elections</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> Legislators voted to <a href="http://www.wral.com/n-c-lawmakers-work-to-redraw-congressional-maps-delay-electoins/15387527/">move the state’s Congressional primary</a> to June 7 in order to comply with a court ruling that requires the Congressional maps be redrawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Due to a quirk in the law, an ex-felon who may be sentenced to&nbsp;99-years, for example, but is released early due to time off for good behavior and other reasons, is still <a href="http://ktul.com/news/local/ex-felon-voting-rights">prevented from voting</a> even though the terms of their service are complete. Legislation pending would clarify that law.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Legislation that will allow county clerks to <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865648263/Bill-striking-two-week-wait-on-vote-counts-already-on-governors-desk.html?pg=all">release daily vote totals</a> while tallying vote-by-mail ballots is on its way to the governor’s desk. Local elections officials supported the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The House of Delegates has approved legislation that would require voters to show a <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160219/wv-house-passes-voter-id-bill">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot. The bill was approved by the House 64-34 largely along party lines, although some Democrats did vote in favor of it and some Republicans were opposed.&nbsp;</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Litigation</strong>: The U.S. Department of Justice has <a href="http://www.dailyreportonline.com/home/id=1202750457433/Federal-Government-Not-Backing-Own-Official-on-Voter-Ruling?mcode=1202617074542&amp;curindex=4&amp;slreturn=20160125132105">filed a brief opposing</a> the actions of U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Brian Newby to require that three states—Alabama, Georgia and Kansas—using the federal voter form to ask for proof-of-citizenship. In the same case, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/02/judge-voters-proof-of-citizenship-219694">declined to issue a temporary restraining order</a> to stop the requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> U.S. District Judge L. Scott Coogler refused a preliminary injunction request to allow <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/judge_will_not_block_alabama_v.html">alternate means of identification for voters</a> in the 2016 election cycle. Currently, a person without photo identification can vote if two poll workers sign affidavits saying they recognize and &#8220;positively identify&#8221; the voter. Greater Birmingham Ministries and the NAACP asked Coogler to expand that provision so people can vote if they provide certain identification documents without photos or information to identify themselves to poll workers. Coogler criticized the request as a backdoor method to do away with the photo identification requirement that took effect in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Judge Tim Lahey denied a motion by Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehmann to dismiss a case brought by statistician Beth Clarkson, but Lahey also denied Clarkson <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article61222187.html">access to the paper tapes from voting machines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire:</strong> The Attorney General’s office is investigating allegations that members of Bernie Sanders’ staff <a href="http://patch.com/new-hampshire/concord-nh/sanders-staffers-registered-vote-campaign-office-report">registered to vote at Sanders’ New Hampshire campaign headquarters</a> instead of a domicile.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-north-carolina-must-redraw-congressional-districts.php">failed to intervene</a> in a case requiring the North Carolina Legislature to redraw Congressional district lines.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> A trial challenging the state’s <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/article_39be83b1-f570-5f4d-b0da-2bfdfe44eb0a.html">voter ID</a> law kicked off this week. The Democratic Party of Virginia filed the suit last June, alleging that the law enacted by the Republican majorities in the Virginia House and Senate restricting the type of identification required to vote could make it more difficult for minorities, the disadvantaged and the young to exercise their right to vote. Proponents said the law was needed to curb voter fraud by impersonation.</p></p>

<p><strong>Call for Proposals for Guest Posts on Youth &amp; Political Engagement</strong><br /> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/">The Monkey Cage</a>, a blog of&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post</em>&nbsp;that uses social science theory and evidence to “make some sense of the circus that is politics” is partnering with&nbsp;<a href="http://civicyouth.org/">CIRCLE</a>&nbsp;to publish 10 articles on youth voting and political engagement. The partnership is funded by a grant from the Democracy Fund.</p>
<p>We are looking for articles on youth and political engagement accessible to a broad audience. We seek contributions from political scientists and scholars in other relevant fields at all stages in their careers. The majority of selected articles will be posted before the end of the 2016 calendar year; however, we are open to proposals that use data collected in 2016 for posting in the first half of 2017.</p>
<p>A proposal&nbsp;should be a short explanation of the topic, the argument, the main evidence, and the audience for the proposed article. In keeping with the mission of The Monkey Cage, the article should focus on the research and evidence and not engage in policy or partisan advocacy — as one might in a traditional op-ed.</p>
