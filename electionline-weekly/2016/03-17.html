														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Get hacked!</strong><br /><em>D.C. Board of Elections works with civic hackers for voting insights</em></p>
<p>By Ursula Kaczmarek<br /><a href="https://www.dcboee.org/home.asp">D.C. Board of Elections</a></p>
<p>Election administrators generate heaps of data beyond the election night returns that take center stage, but the data revolution that now drives decisions in campaigns, business, and parts of government has yet to transform how we run elections.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.supportthevoter.gov">Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a> noted in its report, a “new technological gap is beginning to emerge, between the data analytical capacity that has improved customer service in the private sector, and the lack of data-driven efforts to improve the experience of voters.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lack of money for election administrators to pay skilled data pros is largely responsible for creating and sustaining this gap. But fear not, cash-strapped election administrators, there is hope.</p>
<p>One of the great things about the data and tech communities in the U.S. is that they are eager to volunteer their skills to improve government processes and systems. These are hackers for good (also known as civic hackers), and they’re an untapped resource for election administrators.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> is a worldwide hackathon that brings together local groups of civic hackers including statisticians, geographers, and coders to explore publicly available data sets and create useful things by analyzing them.</p>
<p>This year, the <a href="http://www.dcboee.org">D.C. Board of Elections</a> made its HAVA-mandated electronic voter file available to the Open Data Day D.C. crowd and got some insights about early voting in the bargain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open Data Day hacking is structured around <a href="https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/Making-early-voting-in-DC-more-popular-P7bOITyfYjA">project pitches</a> that include a problem statement, available data sources, and the skills needed to arrive at a solution. Participants who are interested in the subject matter and have the skills or knowledge gather in project groups and get to work. At the close of the event, teams present their findings, their methodologies, and the tools they used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We wanted to use our voter file data to inform our strategy for early voting outreach, and asked any interested analysts, geography nerds, and statisticians in the house to join us. After 5 hours of hacking, our project team learned the following:</p>
<p>1) Early voting has increased since its debut in 2010;</p>
<p dir="ltr">2) On a precinct level, early voting rates in the primary are partly predictive of early voting rates in the general; and</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DCBOE_Image_1.png" alt="DCBOE Image 1" width="645" height="363" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />3) And voters who live within a half mile of an early voting site were likeliest to have ever voted early.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DCBOE_Image_2.png" alt="DCBOE Image 2" width="701" height="394" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />More of our findings are <a href="https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/DC-Early-Voting-Project-Presentation-9i0D1LhdTCU">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open Data Day happens only once a year, but there is a growing number of local civic hacker groups that meet regularly. Check out <a href="http://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> to see if there’s one near you, and look at nationwide organizations that seek to partner with local government, like Code for America.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you decide to join in a hackathon (and we certainly hope you do), here are some pro tips:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Make doubly sure to abide by your jurisdiction’s laws and regulations governing the dissemination of voter information or other data sets. A quick guide to the rules governing HAVA voter files is available at the <a href="http://voterlist.electproject.org/">United States Elections Project</a>.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Learn about the open source tools hackers are using. These web and software applications are not only free, they come with super helpful user communities who are glad to assist people who are &nbsp;learning on their own. The open source tools we used at Open Data Day that don’t require coding skills included <a href="http://public.tableau.com/">Tableau Public</a> for visualization, and <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>and <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> for geography. We also used R, an open source statistical package that does require coding skills, but the free-to-use <a href="http://swirlstats.com/">Swirl</a> greatly helps with the coding learning curve.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Get the most from your data by combining it with data sets available on open government sites. The <a href="http://www.census.gov/data.html">Census Bureau</a> is a great place to start for demographics, and many cities and states host catalogues on their Chief Technology Officer and open data sites. At Open Data Day D.C., we used the Master Address Repository available from D.C.’s <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/">open data site</a> to calculate distances and create maps.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Go to the workshops. If you’re a newbie, they demystify tech. Create your first data visualization. Learn how to use an API.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">And most importantly, collaborate! If civic hackers have a motto, it’s “build with, not for.”</li>
</ol>

							<h2>Primary Round Up</h2>
														<p>II. Primary Round Up</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Et tu Super Tuesday?!</strong><br /><em>Voters head to polls in five states on Ides of March</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Voters headed to the polls in five states&#8211;Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio&#8211;on the Ides of March and the day was a mixed-bag of issues, but nothing systematic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There were ballot shortages, long lines, late opening polls and late closing polls. There were also many, many counties that had no issues whatsoever. Here is a look at some of the issues that did arise on Tuesday. Also check out our <a href="index.php/2016/1828-election-dispatches-03-15-16">Election Day Dispatches</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Not enough ballots<br /></strong>Counties in some states struggled with having enough ballots to meet demand. In <a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/local/orange-county-supervisor-of-elections-addresses-ballot-issues/164713029">Orange County, Florida</a>, several precincts ran out of ballots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county asked for additional voting time, but was denied. On Wednesday Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles said that this election was the first time precinct-specific ballots were used and that, combined with human error, was likely the reason for the shortage.</p>
<p>Numerous Illinois counties ran out of ballots including <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/article/20160316/NEWS/160319646">Sangamon</a>, <a href="http://www.whig.com/article/20160315/ARTICLE/303159583">Adams</a>, <a href="http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article66456677.html">Madison</a> and <a href="http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article66240412.html">St. Clair</a> counties. While voters were frustrated with the lack of ballots, and the long lines it created, many elections officials tried to spin it in a positive light. “I think it’s a good problem,” Madison County Clerk Debra Ming-Mendoza told the <em>Belleville News-Democrat</em>. “More people coming out to vote — how better can it be?”</p>
<p><a href="http://wkbn.com/2016/03/15/shortage-of-republican-ballots-in-mahoning-county-reported/">Mahoning County, Ohio</a> also had a shortage of GOP ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic poll books</strong><br />While no one suffered problems similar to what counties in Ohio did in 2015 with their electronic polls books, there were still scattered problems with the electronic check-in method in Ohio and other states.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/03/cleveland_poll_worker_pulls_ou.html">Duval County, Florida</a> had to move to paper poll books when the polls opened on Tuesday morning because of a software glitch with the e-poll books. The problem was fixed in most precincts by about 2:30 in the afternoon. Supervisor of Elections Mike Hogan praised his poll workers’ handling of the problem. &#8220;I will tell you the poll workers, this was a bad day for them,&#8221; Supervisor of Elections Mike Hogan said. &#8220;And I really feel bad for them. They had to go back to the old system, and they had to do it on the fly. So we are very proud of them.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/news/local/voters-head-to-polls-this-morning-computer-glitch-slows-check/article_cfd5e120-100c-5078-9ef2-f9e3ef28d6b6.html">Cumberland County, North Carolina</a> also suffered problems with its electronic check-in system.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/check-in-system-to-blame-for-long-lines-at-missouri-polls">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, an upgrade to the city’s electronic poll books may have actually slowed them down.</p>
<p>“We are adding different modules to the server. We are thinking maybe we overloaded it, maybe we need to step back a little bit and see what caused the bog-down on Election Day,” Shawn Kieffer, director of the Kansas City Election Board told KSHB.</p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong><br />North Carolina rolled out <a href="http://courier-tribune.com/news/north-carolina/state-election-board-reports-no-issues-voter-id-changes-others-disagree">voter ID</a> for the first time and how it went depends on who you speak with. State officials said they received very few calls from those experiencing ID problems.</p>
<p>“Most of the calls coming in are about voter registration, unaffiliated voters, and people who have moved,” state election board spokeswoman Jackie Hyland told <em>The Charlotte Observer</em>.</p>
<p>However, Bob Hall, executive director of the voter advocacy group Democracy North Carolina, told the paper hundreds of callers to a hotline reported problems including ID problems, especially from college students.</p>
<p><strong>Odd and ends</strong><br />Elections, no matter how well planned and how well executed, always have their fair share of odd problems&#8211;usually man-made&#8211;and Et tu Tuesday was no different.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://wfla.com/2016/03/15/polk-poll-workers-mistakenly-tell-voters-election-not-for-democrats/">Polk County, Florida</a> poll workers told voters that the election was only for Republicans because they had no Democratic ballots. Turns out the ballots were at the bottom of a closet.</p>
<p>There was a report of a person with a gun that briefly closed a polling place in <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/elections/state/report-of-person-with-gun-briefly-closes-edgecombe-county-precinct/article_f5496e44-eaff-11e5-b24a-7bd444e8a797.html">Edgecombe County, North Carolina</a>. The polling place was closed for about 35 minutes.<span class="wf_caption" style="max-width: 195px; float: right; display: inherit;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chicago_Fire.jpg" alt="Chicago Fire" width="195" height="195" /><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><span style="max-width: 195px; display: block;">Whitney May with the Center for Technology &amp; Civic Life volunteered at the Chicago polls on Tuesday and got to meet actor David Eigenberg who stars in NBC&#8217;s Chicago Fire. May said he was a very friendly and engaging voter. </span></em></span></span></p>
<p>In other gun news, two poll workers in <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/03/cleveland_poll_worker_pulls_ou.html">Cleveland, Ohio</a> got into an argument that ended with one of the poll workers pulling out a gun. No one was hurt and the poll worker was arrested.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/court-order-to-keep-polls-in-southwest-ohio-open-sends-poll-workers-scrambling/38535056">car crash that tied up traffic in several counties in Ohio</a> forced a judge to keep the polls open an additional hour in Hamilton, Butler, Clermont and Warren counties even though elections officials had already begun posting results. Poll workers complained that they were not properly notified and had begun shutting down polling sites.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.wcnc.com/news/politics/elections/cabarrus-county-polling-place-open-late-because-judge-overslept/84157482">Cabarrus County, North Carolina</a> polling place opened late because the chief judge overslept. According to published reports, about four voters left the site before the judge showed up and it was open for voting.</p>
<p>In a story that certainly has electionline a bit fired up, many voters in Chicago complained about not getting <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-election-voter-stickers-met-0317-20160316-story.html">“I Voted” stickers</a>. The county stopped issuing the stickers because according to a spokesman for the board of elections, not only did the stickers not drive turnout, but janitors and officials at polling places complained that they had to spend hours removing the stickers that had been stuck on things other than someone’s shirt.</p>
<p>And in a Missouri there was a report that <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2016/03/15/therapy-dog-reported-stolen-from-missouri-primary-polling-place/">therapy dog was stolen from a polling place</a>. The dog got loose from its home and then ran to a nearby polling place where someone took the dog. The dog was fortunately returned to the family the next morning.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Gallatin County, Montana Clerk &amp; Recorder Charlotte Mills is relying on the U.S. Postal Service for more than just mailed ballots. Mills recently sent out <a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/county/county-tries-direct-mail-recruitment-for-election-judges/article_6d89661d-5ac7-59b8-aa56-813966dd7b3e.html">more than 6,000 letters to county residents</a> aged 65-75 in an effort to recruit them to serve as poll workers during the upcoming election season. “We’ve been near crisis in past elections,” Mills told the <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle</em>. “It’s not just a Gallatin County problem. It’s statewide.” Although she only needs about 209 poll workers, she’s hoping to get about 400 folks to sign up.

<li>Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman is championing the idea of &nbsp;<a href="http://mynorthwest.com/11/2932867/Secretary-of-State-fighting-for-the-Pac12-Primaries">“Pac-12 Primary”</a> for 2020. Modeled after this year’s “SEC Primary,” the “Pac-12 Primary” would have primaries in Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and possibly Nevada and Utah. &#8220;I think that after the season we&#8217;re having right now, people are going to be a little more willing about talking about trying to move that primary up and make it relevant so that Washington voters have a voice in the process and are not just really affected by the rest of the country,&#8221; Wyman told KIRO.

<li>Kentucky has officially joined the growing list of state’s offering <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article65982842.html">online voter registration</a>. The system quietly launched on March 1 and in that time 100,000 voters in Jefferson County have used the system to update their information or register. At a press conference announcing the launch, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes noted that even a 93-year-old Kentuckian had used the system.

<p><strong>Idaho</strong>: The Senate State Affairs Committee is considering legislation that would allow <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/1c28791a384f4df69ab824198f3e87e5/ID--Gun-Licenses-Voter-ID">conceal carry permits</a> to serve as one of the acceptable forms of ID in order to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong>: House File 2147 has been approved by both chambers of the legislature and signed into law by Gov. Terry Branstad. The bill, championed by Secretary of State Paul Pate, <a href="http://www.dailyiowegian.com/news/local_news/bill-makes-it-easier-for-overseas-military-members-to-vote/article_d1d4d0b9-7eea-54e8-8d45-330dd8eff372.html">gives Iowans serving or visiting overseas an extra 30 days</a> to request, receive and return special absentee ballots, extending the time from 90 days to 120 days prior to an election.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: A Senate committee has approved a constitutional amendment that would give the General Assembly the power to r<a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2016/03/16/bill-restore-felon-voting-rights-advances/81854564/">estore voting rights to convicted felons</a> without the need for a gubernatorial pardon. Senate Bill 299 wouldn’t automatically restore voting rights, but instead it would allow the legislature to do it by statute. It passed the Senate State and Local Government Committee on a 10-0 vote.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: A bill before the House Elections Committee would <a href="http://wmuk.org/post/bill-would-allow-selfies-ballot-photos-polling-places">allow voters to take a photo of themselves</a> or their ballot in a polling place, but photographing others would remain illegal.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The House has approved legislation to institute a 10-day <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/house-passes-10-day-residency-requirement-vote-nh">residency requirement</a> for potential voters. Last year, Gov. Maggie Hassan vetoed a 30-day residency requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: By a 30-6 vote, the Senate has approved legislation to allow for <a href="http://wpri.com/2016/03/15/rhode-island-senators-pass-online-voter-registration/">online voter registration</a>. The House approved a similar bill last month and Gov. Gina Raimondo is expected to sign it.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The Senate has rejected two bills supported by Secretary of State Kim Wyman. One bill would have created <a href="http://kpq.com/secretary-of-state-wymans-voting-proposals-sacked-by-fellow-republicans/">automatic voter registration</a> and the other would have allowed 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Legislation requiring West Virginians to <a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2016/03/13/voter-id-bill-with-expanded-options-passes-legislature-on-final-day/">show an ID</a> is on its way to Gov. Early Ray Tomblin’s desk following some amendments to the acceptable forms of ID. Acceptable forms of ID include: local, county or state-issued government card, a debit or bank card, a health insurance card, as well as an affidavit signed by a poll worker on site identifying the voter as someone they have known for at least six months.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Senate has given final approval to <a href="https://www.wrn.com/2016/03/senate-gives-final-approval-to-online-voter-registration-bill/">online voter registration</a>. In addition, the bill also allows veterans to use their veteran ID to cast a ballot. Gov. Scott Walker <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-quickly-signs-voter-registration-bill-b99688810z1-372233461.html">signed the bill into law</a> on Wednesday.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Arizona</strong>: On Monday Judge Roger Brodman denied the state’s redistricting commission’s request to bar Secretary of State Michele Reagan from <a href="http://kjzz.org/content/279210/judge-secretary-state-reagan-can-side-redistricting-plaintiffs">acting as a plaintiff</a> in an ongoing lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Scott Lynn McCarty pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he aided and <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article66257227.html">abetted the payment of a woman for her vote</a> in the May 2014 Magoffin County primary.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Voting rights advocates and the state of Nevada settled a lawsuit over the state’s implementation of a federal law aimed at <a href="http://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/mar/14/nevada-settles-lawsuit-over-registering-low-income/">registering low-income voters</a>. Under terms of the settlement, the state’s Department of Health and Human Services will provide each of its clients a voter registration application, help them fill out the forms and send the applications to state election officials. The lawsuit was brought by the National Council of La Raza and NAACP branches in Reno and Las Vegas in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: On Friday, Common Pleas Court Judge Richard Frye ruled that <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/03/11/judge-rules-17-year-olds-primary-vote.html">17-year-olds who will be 18 by the time of the general election in November, may in fact vote in the presidential primary</a>. Secretary of State Jon Husted’s interpretation of the 1908 law allowing 17-year-olds to vote said that it did not apply to presidential primaries because they are electing delegates, not candidates. &#8220;The secretary has a clear legal duty to promptly advise all 88 county boards of election to discontinue giving oral or written instructions to otherwise qualified 17-year old voters that their choice of presidential convention delegates will not be counted,&#8221; Frye said in his decision. Husted announced that he would not appeal the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong>: Two Houston-area Democratic lawmakers have sent the Department of Justice requesting that DOJ look into the <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/State-reps-call-for-justice-department-6893400.php">distribution of voting machines and polling places in the March 1 primary</a>. Turnout exceeded predictions by more than a third and left many voters standing in long lines for hours. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see how anyone can blame them or us because we were all caught off guard,&#8221; Harris County Clerk Stan Stanart told the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>. &#8220;Voters are the reason why we had the &#8216;problem&#8217;, but in that sense it&#8217;s also a good problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>A losing candidate has filed a suit <a href="http://www.kxxv.com/story/31449441/lawsuit-filed-for-new-election-in-mclennan-county">seeking a new election in McLennan County</a>. Lawyers for the candidate say that clerical errors uncovered several of the county&#8217;s mistakes. In documents submitted to the court, an email from the voting machine operated to county election officials warn against using the coded ballots. The email didn&#8217;t arrive however until 8 days after the election. According to published reports, the suit is on a <a href="http://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Waco-Election-lawsuit-on-a-fast-track-for-judges-ruling-372134342.html">fast-track</a> for the judge’s ruling. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in Texas, a lawsuit has been filed on behalf of four voters who were denied the right to vote because the Texas Dept. of Public Safety is in <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/texas-sued-over-motor-voter-law-compliance/nqkfY/">violation of NVRA</a>. The suit argues that the state treats those who show up at the DPS differently than those who conduct transactions online because the DPS website does not provide the complete voter registration information.</p>
<p>In other NVRA lawsuit news, the American Civil Rights Union has <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/starr-county-elections-administrator-sued-by-american-civil-rights-union/article_10e84d98-ebe9-11e5-99e0-8b983dc9c9b5.html">sued Starr County Election Administrator Rafael Montalvo</a> failed to keep an accurate list of registered voters in violation of Section 8 of the act. According to the suit, Starr County voter rolls reported more registered voters than citizens eligible to vote in 2014, 2012 and 2010.</p></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>National Tech</strong>: At SXSW Interactive, <a href="http://votolatino.org/">Voto Latino</a> announced the launch of a new downloadable Apple application, VoterPal, allowing people to scan their ID to register to vote. The online fields automatically populate, followed by a confirmation email sent in a matter of seconds, cutting down the time from the usual paper registration process. Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of Voto Latino said the aim in developing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voterpal/id1085731116?ls=1&amp;mt=8">VoterPal</a> is to mobilize peer-to-peer voter registration as a solution to stimulating voter turnout. &#8220;So when we&#8217;re trying to figure on how to franchise the next group of Americans, we have to figure out where they are, how they talk, and more importantly, we have to use the technology that they crave,&#8221; Kumar said. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Voters with disabilities in Vigo County will be able to use a new <a href="http://wthitv.com/2016/03/16/talking-voting-machines-to-help-residents-during-election-season/">voting system this year that talks to the voters</a>.
