							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Voting day in D.C. Jail<br /></strong><em>DCBOE program allows those awaiting trial to cast a ballot</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline.org writer/editor</p>
<p>Despite the chaos around them — loud voices, clanging metal doors, carts being rolled here and there across cement floors, a line of seven voters stood patiently waiting their turn to cast their ballot in Washington, D.C.’s primary.</p>
<p>“John” was first in line to vote and after receiving his ballot he studied it carefully and began to fill it out. Before he had even completed the process, he wanted to know about getting his “I Voted” sticker. Could he have two?</p>
<p>After he completed his ballot and put it in the secrecy envelope, “John” carefully peeled the sticker off the paper backing and proudly slapped it on his chest.</p>
<p>The red, white and blue “I Voted” “Yo vote” sticker was in stark contrast to the orange prison jumpsuit “John” and his fellow voters were wearing.</p>
<p>This week, two teams from the <a href="https://www.dcboee.org/home.asp?skip=Y">D.C. Board of Elections</a> (DCBOE) headed to the <a href="D.C.%20Jail">D.C. Jail</a> and to the <a href="Correctional%20Treatment%20Facility">Correctional Treatment Facility</a> to allow eligible inmates to cast an absentee ballot for D.C.’s June 14 primary.</p>
<p>While not unique to the District of Columbia, D.C. is one of only a small handful of jurisdictions that allows inmates awaiting trial to vote by absentee.</p>
<p>Marc Mauer, executive director of <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/">The Sentencing Project</a> has been working for reform of disenfranchisement policies at the national level for more than 15 years and noted that while we’ve seen a good deal of progress in states scaling back restrictive policies on voting by people with felony convictions, access to voting in jails remains a largely unaddressed issue.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of the 700,000 people in local jails are eligible to vote since they are either awaiting trial or serving time on a misdemeanor conviction, but not a felony,” Mauer said. “But there are only a handful of jails in the country where there&#8217;s any ongoing effort to make the voting process accessible to this group of people, so the District of Columbia is a leader in this regard.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>D.C.’s program began in 2004.</p>
<p>“We began this program due largely to the efforts and encouragement of Charles Sullivan of <a href="http://www.curenational.org/">Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants</a> (CURE),” explained Arlin Budoo, facility management and support services coordinator for DBOE. “Mr. Sullivan would attend the Board’s regular monthly meetings and advocate strongly for the establishment of an onsite absentee voting program for eligible inmates.”</p>
<p>Rokey Suleman who oversaw the DCBOE from 2009-2011 supported the program not only in D.C., but also in other jurisdictions where he worked.</p>
<p>“I coordinated jail visits or voting support in every jurisdiction that I’ve worked. I support these programs because I believe that imprisonment exists to rehabilitate as well as punish. Many of the people we encounter in these situations often feel alienated from politics,” Suleman said from Mongolia where he is currently working as an elections observer. “By encouraging those that are incarcerated but eligible to vote we take a step towards getting them to think beyond themselves and becoming a member of a larger community. There is no better way to participate in your community than through voting.”</p>
<p>Just this week <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/08/new-program-aims-to-help-eligible-denver-inmates-vote/">Denver</a> announced that they will be stepping up their efforts to give inmates the opportunity to cast a ballot. The Denver Elections Division will work with the Denver Sheriff’s Department and the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, but unlike DC’s program where elections staff visits the jail, the ballots in Denver will be mailed to the inmates.</p>
<p>Back in D.C., Budoo has been participating in these voting days for years and now serves as the BOE’s lead on the project. He works with representatives at the <a href="http://doc.dc.gov/">Department of Corrections</a> to schedule dates for the drop-off and pick-up of the voter registration and absentee ballot applications and the actual voting. The board also delivers Voter’s Guides to be distributed to the inmates so that they can know who the candidates on the ballot are prior to the board’s arrival.</p>
<p>On voting day at the D.C. Jail, BOE staff and observers from the <a href="http://orca.dc.gov/">Mayor’s Office on Returning Citizen Affairs</a> and The Sentencing Project (including Mauer) arrive around 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Once the group clears security they meet with representatives from DOC and review the prepared ballots with a current census of the jail to determine that the inmates who requested absentee ballots are still there and confirm where they are all currently housed. DOC staff are responsible for confirming whether or not inmates are eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Some inmates that requested absentee ballots may be in court on voting day and so a DOC staff member holds their ballot for them until they return and are able to vote.</p>
<p>For the inmates that requested absentee ballots and have been released, their ballots are “cleared” in the system which then makes it possible for the inmate to vote on election day or during early voting.</p>
<p>The BOE staff, observers and DOC staff split up into three teams each taking one floor of the facility. Each of the teams is accompanied by a security guard.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, sometimes groups of inmates will come to a central location on the floor and in other cases the team will visit the inmates in their assigned wing of the jail with some inmates needing to vote from their cells where they are being held.</p>
<p>On this day, about 70 of the approximately 1,100 inmates housed in D.C. Jail requested absentee ballots and just under 50 ended up casting the ballot.</p>
<p>“I was impressed by the care and concern about the process demonstrated by both elections and corrections officials,” said Mauer, who was observing the process for the first time.</p>
<p>Mauer did express some concerns about the voting hours overlapping with recreation hours, which for about 10 inmates was the case. Budoo said that those ballots were left with the DOC staff coordinator who will work to get the ballots returned.</p>
<p>And of course some inmates change their mind about voting from the time they request their absentee ballot to voting day. That happened with at least one inmate who when approached in his cell to vote told the DOC and BOE staff that “oh hell no” he didn’t want to vote.</p>
<p>Just like any election day, the BOE staff had to be ready for anything and everything and the glare of the media spotlight watching a closely contested race is nothing like the glare of an inmate locked inside his cell watching your every move.</p>
<p>The interaction between BOE staff and voting inmates varied. Some of the inmates said not a word and simply, dutifully cast their ballots. Others had questions about candidates, which of course staff couldn’t answer. Some had questions about the process. Others seemed like they were just eager to speak with someone new.</p>
<p>While most of the voters seemed to carefully review their ballots, one voter entered an office where voting was taking place, declared, for all those who cared to listen, “I’m voting for [name withheld]” and he sat down, filled out the presidential portion of the ballot and didn’t even review the remainder of the ballot.</p>
<p>And some tried to find some humor in the situation like the one inmate who chose to lick his ballot envelope instead of using the glue stick in order to “get some additional nutrition.”</p>
<p>All the inmates who voted were very respectful of the BOE staff and observers.</p>
<p>That being said, being locked inside D.C. Jail and in close proximity to that many inmates could be disconcerting for some.</p>
<p>“Staff members who indicate that they would not be comfortable at the correctional facilities are not forced to participate in the program,” Budoo said. “Fortunately, we have no shortage of Board staff members who are willing to serve as volunteers; we have more individuals here who want to serve than we can actually take.”</p>
<p>The whole process took about three hours, which Budoo said was much better than in the early days when the process would take all day because instead of splitting up into three teams, all the inmates would come to one central location to vote. A process that for a variety of reasons just took a lot longer.</p>
<p>“I think the program is important because it lets the individuals know they are relevant in society and their voices are as important as anyone else’s,” Budoo said. “Even though the resources are limited at the jail, we are always thanked by the inmate population as well as DOC staff for conducting the program at the institution and giving individuals some sort of normalcy to let them know they still have rights.”</p>
<p>Oh and rest assured, “John” did indeed get two “I Voted” stickers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> I just wanted to publicly thank the D.C. Board of Elections for allowing me to tag along on this very special voting day. It was an incredible experience to watch men, who may be facing hopeless situations, to seem so hopeful about casting a ballot. This is what democracy looks like.</em></p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California<br /></strong>While California saw a record number of voters register in advance of Tuesday’s primary, those numbers <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/news/california-saw-surge-in-registration-but-not-in-voting/39966996">didn’t seem to manifest into a record turnout</a>. With many of the state’s counties voting largely by mail and ballots are still being counted at press time, there were relatively few problems on Tuesday given the size of the state.</p>
<p>A computer coding problem in <a href="http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-06-08/146093/">San Mateo County</a> affected about 140 electronic voting machines and forced the use of paper ballots. The problem was discovered around 7 a.m. and resolved by about 8:30 a.m. The issue was with passcodes that connected individual machines to the central processing unit at election headquarters in San Mateo, Jim Irizarry, assistant chief elections officer told <em>The Daily Journal.</em></p>
<p>Law enforcement is investigating allegations of voter fraud and voter suppression in <a href="http://ijpr.org/post/voter-fraud-or-voter-suppression-allegations-fly-siskiyou-county#stream/0">Siskiyou County</a>. According to Jefferson Public Radio, last week the county sheriff’s office and District Attorney’s Office announced they had assisted investigators from the state over allegations of voter fraud. Now activists claim deputies armed with military-style weapons used the investigation intimidate residents from the Hmong ethnic community.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://kron4.com/2016/06/07/oakland-organizations-team-up-to-provide-childcare-at-polling-location/">Oakland</a>, two nonprofit organizations teamed up to offer child care at two polling places in low-income neighborhoods where the cost of child care could have hindered people from voting. The children were entertained with games and toys as well as mock voting booths. “Our goal is ensure that everyone gets a chance to vote regardless of whether they have access to childcare. All too often, we see polling locations in districts across the country plagued by long lines, which women with children may not have time to wait in,” UltraViolet employee Nita Chaudhary told KRON.</p>
<p>There were a handful of problems in <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160607/2016-election-voting-glitches-mar-some-polling-stations-across-los-angeles-county">Los Angeles County</a> were some voters were forced to vote provisionally because their names did not appear on the voter rolls. According to the <em>Los Angeles Daily News</em>, trouble-shooters were dispatched to address issues ranging from a shortage of polling volunteers to missing ink, a lack of supplies and malfunctioning voting equipment.</p>
<p>And it wouldn’t be a major voting day in America if a car didn’t run into a polling place somewhere. This time it was in <a href="http://www.krcrtv.com/news/local/car-slams-into-shasta-county-polling-place/39937902">Shasta County</a> and it was actually the night before when a 16-year-old hit a polling place with her car. Voting was moved to a different location in the building.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong><br /><strong>Although</strong> it may seem like the Iowa presidential caucuses were a lifetime ago, the state held its primary elections this week and according to preliminary numbers, <a href="http://kwqc.com/2016/06/08/scott-county-voter-turnout-slightly-up-from-2014/">turnout</a> was the <a href="http://kwqc.com/2016/06/07/poll-workers-push-voters-to-do-their-jobs/">lowest</a> it’s been in more than decade. Early numbers indicate turnout was about <a href="http://www.timesrepublican.com/page/content.detail/id/1187194/Number-of-primary-voters-casting-ballots-lowest-since-2004.html?isap=1&amp;nav=5013">9.7 percent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Linn-County-unveils-voting-technology--382139871.html">Linn County</a> got to test out new voting equipment on Tuesday and reports are that things went well. &#8220;It&#8217;s simple, easy,&#8221; Cedar Rapids voter Jim Bradley told KCRG. All 98 precincts received new ballot scanners and ballot-marking devices for disabled voters.</p>
<p>Voters in <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/382172661.html">Cedar Rapids</a> in one polling place were forced to cast their ballots al fresco when a smoky smell forced everyone outside for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Montana</strong><br />Overall turnout was near record-breaking in Montana on Tuesday, although given that more and more voters are choosing to vote-by-mail, <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2016/06/07/-person-voting-light-cascade-county-expopark/85572636/">in-person voting</a> on Tuesday was relatively light with few problems.</p>
<p>“Well, the voter turnout was actually pretty good. It was 44.65 percent, which was just a little bit lower than the 2008 primary,” Secretary of state Linda McCulloch told KGVO. “In 2008, it was 45.2 percent. So it was like less than a percentage point.”</p>
<p>McCulloch said the election-day registration numbers were 3,308 with a total of 6,219 people registering in the last 30 days before the election, which is only slightly less than the 2012 record-breaking year.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/Missoula-sees-voter-increase-few-issues-at-polling-places/39965638">Missoula County</a>, while voting went smoothly, there was some confusion about where to show up on election day with some voters coming to the county courthouse to register to vote instead of the county fairgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can register, vote, if you have an undeliverable absentee ballot that&#8217;s where it will be waiting for you. If you need a replacement ballot they can get you taken care of there.&nbsp; It is really your one stop shop on Election Day,” Missoula County Election Supervisor Bradley Seaman told NBC Montana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While turnout may not have been record-breaking statewide, absentee voting in <a href="http://www.ktvq.com/story/32169185/yellowstone-county-voters-set-new-record-turnout">Yellowstone County</a> was. More than 40,000 people requested absentee ballots which tops the last record by more than 3,000.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/ravalli-co-poll-turnout-sporadic-absentees-growing/39948404">Ravalli County</a>, about 70 percent of voters cast their vote via absentee ballot.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong><br />Voters headed to the polls in Garden State on Tuesday in high, but not record numbers and by-and-large things went smoothly. New Jersey’s primaries allow <a href="http://www.njherald.com/article/20160609/ARTICLE/306099977">unaffiliated voters</a> to vote in primaries so some of the problems that cropped up in closed primary states didn’t materialize here, but another problem did. Apparently many voters who think they are unaffiliated forget that they declared for a party four years ago and therefore can only vote in that party this year.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.njherald.com/article/20160607/ARTICLE/160609974">Sussex County</a>, turnout was steady throughout the day, but not record-breaking. County Elections Administrator Marge McCabe did note that one thousand absentee ballots had been requested and 900 were returned. “That’s a high percentage,” McCabe told the <em>New Jersey Herald. </em></p>
<p>Some voters in <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/press/atlantic/woodlands-condo-voters-unhappy-with-new-polling-place/article_6aa93f2e-2ce2-11e6-8e09-abc2a4fd5613.html">Hamilton Township</a> were not happy about their new polling place on Tuesday. For 24-years, voting was held at the Woodlands Condominium Complex, but last month the condo board voted not to host a polling place and so the new polling place was located about two miles away at a school. Most of the people voting at the Woodlands polling site actually lived in the condo complex.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong><br />New Mexico saw a <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/788478/turnout-sets-record-for-nm-primary.html">record-high primary turnout</a> — slightly more than 326,000 — and few problems on Tuesday. Overall turnout was about 34 percent.</p>
<p>Two races for state representative will need to be <a href="http://www.lamonitor.com/content/elections-officials-prepare-recount-two-primary-elections-house">recounted</a> because the margin of victory was less than 1 percent.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/07/despite-hiccups-officials-report-smooth-day-voting/85574546/">Dona Ana County</a>, there were some slow machines first thing in the morning, but the largest issue came from independents and decline-to-state voters wishing to vote in the state’s closed primaries.</p>
<p>“We really haven’t seen any problems. Things are going well,” said Deputy County Clerk Scott Krahling, told the <em>Las Cruces Sun-News</em>. “The biggest challenge has been talking to independents and (decline-to-state) voters who were not aware they couldn’t vote in the primaries. Despite a pretty aggressive marketing campaign, today has made it clear that you can’t reach everyone.”</p>
<p>At a polling place in <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/first-timers-among-santa-feans-who-voted-in-primary/article_26f8b4d0-369b-5f2e-a6e5-87970bf8c580.html">Santa Fe County</a>, poll wokers decided to cheer for first-time voters and so the cheer was especially joyful for 17-year-old Jason Santos who was able to vote in the primary because of a new state law. “It’s exciting to know that I am voting for the next president of the United States of America for the first time,” Santos told the <em>Santa Fe New Mexican</em>. Santos will turn 18 in July.</p>
<p><strong>Puerto Rico</strong><br />Voters in Puerto Rico faced long lines on Sunday for the Democratic primary. The lines stemmed from the elimination of hundreds of polling places in order to cuts costs.</p>
<p>Results of the primary were not immediately available because the <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/06/puerto-rico-election-commission/">state election commission was given Monday off</a> after working all day on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The entire state commission is not operating as everyone worked on Sunday,” Roberto Prats, Democratic Party chairman told <em>The Associated Press</em>. “We will resume tomorrow morning and try to close the local and presidential primaries at 100 percent.”</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong><br />The 2016 primary election went fairly smoothly in South Dakota with few reported problems. Secretary of State Shantel Krebbs’ office reports that <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/news/nation/sd-secretary-of-state-percent-voter-turnout-in-primary/article_6d4d39a7-f77d-578e-85a5-d27b7126c2fa.html">turnout was about 22 percent</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.kotatv.com/content/news/Election-officials-see-waves-of-blank-ballots--382299171.html">Pennington County</a>, Auditor Julie Pearson reported that she saw more blank ballots than in year’s past, but has no idea why. “We always have a handful of ballots that are completely blank which means somebody took the effort to go to the polling place, check–in, wait in line get a ballot, go to the voting booth and then make no marks on their ballot,” Pearson told KOTA. Not all the ballots were blank. On some people had written “none of the above” or “they’re all bad.” Pearson noted they said other things too, but “we just can’t repeat on TV.”</p>
<p>Also in, <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/election/absentee-voter-turnout-rises-in-pennington-co/article_126ed1a0-0831-56d4-928e-6f2b40bdd591.html">Pennington County</a> they did see an increase in absentee ballots. That’s up by almost 3,000 from the June 2014 primary.</p></p>

<li>An audit of the New York City Board of Elections has found that the agency has <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/board-elections-inaccurate-equipment-records-audit-finds-article-1.2663099">lost track of more than 1,450 pieces of equipment, including voting machines</a>. Comptroller Scott Stringer’s office examined inventory and other board records over a three- year period. The audit found four voting machines, 45 computers, 127 monitors, 85 printers and a dozen television sets all missing from BOE facilities. “Maintaining an accurate inventory is critical to transparency, integrity and accountability at any government agency, and on this count BOE is clearly absentee,” Stringer said in a statement announcing the results of the audit.

According to a press released from the secretary of state’s office the Phase II population was initially estimated to be more than 250,000, but many people registered in time for the May primary leaving the number at 145,000.

<li>Despite numerous lawsuits and a Department of Justice review of the 2016 presidential preference primary, Secretary of State Michelle Reagan has said that her office <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/08/reagan-wont-issue-updated-manual-election-workers/85577418/">will not revamp the state’s election procedures manual</a> for the upcoming primaries and general election. A spokesman for Reagan’s office said they will wait until after the 2016 election cycle is complete to revamp the procedures. Some local elections officals are not happy. “Would we like to have it? Absolutely,” Yavapai County Recorder Leslie Hoffman told <em>The Arizona Republic</em>. “But it will still be business as usual.”

<li>Palm Beach County, Florida has joined several others in an attempt to <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-voter-card-confusion-20160607-story.html">clear up confusion four years from now</a>. The county is issuing new voter registration cards that will spell out party affiliation more prominently. According to the <em>Sun-Sentinel</em>, the idea is to make easier for voters to see their party affiliation or to realize sooner that they aren’t registered for a party. &#8220;It&#8217;s a better, clear message to send,&#8221; Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher told the paper. &#8220;It will spell out the entire name of the party &#8230; so [voters] are more cognizant and aware that, &#8216;This is my party.'&#8221; The cost produce the new cards is about $700,000.

<li>Vandals struck polling places in Alabama and the District of Columbia last week. In D.C., an elementary school in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-news/southeast-dc-school-a-polling-site-vandalized-hours-after-ballots-cast/2016/06/05/9d6e8c84-2b48-11e6-9de3-6e6e7a14000c_story.html">Southeast, Washington</a> that was being used as an early voting site was vandalized after hours. None of the elections equipment was damaged or stolen. “There’s absolutely no cause for concern,” DCBOE spokesperson Margarita Mikhaylova told <em>The Washington Post.</em> “Nothing was taken, no ballot boxes were disturbed and elections are continuing as before.” In <a href="http://www.troymessenger.com/2016/06/03/vandals-strike-voting-site/">Pike County</a>, Alabama, vandals broke windows, dented the building and rummaged the interior of a polling place in Ebenezer. “…It’s hard to understand why anybody would to anything like this. It’s country property so it belongs to them. Why destroy something that belongs to you? Just out of meanness?” Pike County Administrator Harry Sanders told the <em>Troy Messenger</em>.
