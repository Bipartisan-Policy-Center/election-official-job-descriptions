<p><strong><span>News Analysis: New Jersey election not so special</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><i>Local officials balk at cost and timing of special election</i></span><br /><i><span style="font-size: 11pt;"></span></i><br /> By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a><br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>In November 2012 many New Jersey elections officials were left scrambling to pull off the presidential election after Hurricane Sandy slammed into the Garden State just days before voters were set to hit the polls.</p>
<p>Now, with local elections officials preparing for the state’s off-year gubernatorial election, once again a storm has hit their shores although this time, the storm is in the form of a special election to replace the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D) who passed away at the age of 89 earlier this month.</p>
<p>Incumbent Gov. Chris Cristie (R), who will be on the November ballot, scheduled the special election for October 16 with a primary set for August 13.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the election was set, it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/nyregion/christie-sets-october-special-election-for-lautenberg-seat.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1">embroiled in controversy</a>. In addition to carrying a $24 million price tag, October 16 is a Wednesday.</p>
<p><span>Sen. Shirley Turner (D-15th District) has </span><a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/senate_committee_approves_bill_to_move_governors_election_to_october.html"><span>introduced two pieces of legislation</span></a><span>. One would move the special election to coincide with the November general election and another that would eliminate special elections all together.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>In addition to the pending legislation, a </span><a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Christie_court_filing_Special_NJ_Senate_election_should_not_be_moved.html"><span>lawsuit</span></a><span> was filed — by an ally of Christie’s November opponent — challenging the governor’s authority to schedule the election when he did. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The state appeals court </span><a href="http://www.app.com/article/20130613/NJNEWS1002/306130147/Appeals-court-OKs-October-Senate-special-election"><span>rejected the challenge</span></a><span> and now the case is pending before the </span><a href="http://www.nbc40.net/story/22612298/lawyers-gov-overreaches-with-election-scheduling"><span>state Supreme Court</span></a><span>. In arguments before the Supreme Court, lawyers for the governor </span><a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/christie_calling_in_reinforcements_for_nj_election_bonanza.html"><span>argued</span></a><span> that the governor has vowed to hire more state workers and rent extra voting machines to ensure that the elections will run smoothly. </span></p>
<p>While the lawyers and legislators are haggling over the election reaction among local elections was mixed with many concerned about voter fatigue/turnout.</p>
<p><a href="http://warren.nj.us/election.html">Warren County</a> Clerk Patricia Kolb is concerned that voter turnout for the special election could be lower than the 10 percent turnout for the regularly scheduled primary on June 3. </p>
<p><span>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s not in the best interest of the voters for sure,&#8221; Kolb told </span><a href="http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/elections/index.ssf/2013/06/gov_christies_special_election.html"><i><span>The Express-Times</span></i></a><span>. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get the turnout.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Antoinette Battaglia, </span><a href="http://www.westmilford.org/Cit-e-Access/webpage.cfm?TID=11&amp;TPID=1837"><span>West Milford</span></a><span> municipal clerk pointed out an added wrinkle that many may not have thought about: the ability to get poll workers.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Poll workers make $200 per day and since wages earned above $600 require filing income tax documents, Battaglia told </span><a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/210787081_Tax_law_and_special_elections_spur_fret_in_West_Milford_clerk_s_office_Money__manpower__and_machines_are_problematic.html"><i><span>The Record</span></i></a><span> she is concerned that some long-time, experienced poll workers will be forced to sit out an election or two in order to not have to file the paperwork.</span><br /><span></span><br /> &#8220;Before polls closed [on June 3] it was already a problem &#8230; the poll workers were already concerned,&#8221; Battaglia told the paper. &#8220;… I will have an urgent need for poll workers. If anybody has anybody who could possibly [be interested in being a poll worker] just drag them in.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>Although the state has assured local election officials that it will pick up the tab for the election, many remain doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Union County freeholders were the first to decline to allocate the funds necessary — approximately $850,000 — to hold the special election. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>&#8220;For us, this is a financial hardship,&#8221; Freeholder Mohamed Jalloh told </span><a href="http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/06/union_co_freeholders_decline_to_fund_special_general_election_calling_it_fiscally_irresponsible.html"><i><span>The Star-Ledger</span></i></a><span>. </span><br /><span></span><br /> <span>Officials in </span><a href="http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2013/06/bergen_freeholders_want_state_to_pay_for_special_election_to_replace_frank_lautenberg.html"><span>Bergen County</span></a><span> followed suit. This week, the freeholders voted unanimously to have their attorney file a “declaratory judgment action” contesting the cost of both the special primary and the special general. </span><span></span></p>
<p> <a href="http://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2013/06/monmouth_county_freeholders_request_state_pay_special_election_cost_up_front.html"><span>Monmouth County</span></a><span> freeholders said they don’t mind holding the special election as long as there are assurances that the state will pick up the tab as promised. </span></p>
<p> Not all local elections officials are concerned about the special election. Hunterdon County Clerk Mary Melfi told the <i>Express-Times</i> that as long as the promised funding comes through, she sees no problem with having the special election, especially after 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially after Hurricane Sandy, there&#8217;s not ever going to be another election that&#8217;s going to scare me again,&#8221; Melfi told the paper.</p>

<li>This week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on one of the voting rights cases before it, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf"><i>Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council</i></a> that challenged the state’s proof-of-citizenship law. In a 7-2 ruling, the court affirmed the 9th Circuit’s ruling that the state had to accept the federal voter registration form that does not include the proof-of-citizenship requirement other than the voter’s affirmation they are indeed a citizen. In writing the opinion for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/justices-reject-arizona-voting-law-requiring-proof-of-citizenship.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">laid out a pathway</a> for the state to pursue getting the question included on the federal form. Ariz. Secretary of State Ken Bennett said the state is not prepared to give up the fight and said the state will <a href="http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/06/bennett-vows-to-push-for-voter-proof-of-citizenship-despite-court-ruling/">pursue appeals</a> with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC). In addition, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that he would <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/305989-sen-cruz-to-introduce-amendment-to-counter-supreme-court-ruling-on-arizona-voter-law">introduce an amendment</a> to the pending Senate immigration bill that would allow states to require IDs before registering. Local <a href="http://www.mohavedailynews.com/articles/2013/06/19/news/state/doc51c15affb9ba8984596131.txt">Arizona lawmakers</a> also began work on efforts to change the state laws to allow proof-of-citizenship. Following the ruling, states that have similar laws — <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ruling-on-voter-citizenship-proof-ensnares-Ga-law-4605707.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2013/06/17/4298484/kobach-thinks-kansas-voting-law.html">Kansas</a>, <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20130617/NEWS01/130617045/Hosemann-Arizona-voter-ID-ruling-has-no-effect-pending-Miss-law">Mississippi</a>, <a href="http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/voter-registration-ruling-won-t-affect-montana-secretary-of-state/article_44c3dbe8-d871-11e2-8a13-0019bb2963f4.html">Montana</a>, <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-voter-registration-law-survives-u.s.-supreme-court-decision/article/3853574">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/06/voter_id_law_pennsylvania_supr.html">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="http://www.kltv.com/story/22615020/etx-elections-administrator-weighs-in-on-supreme-court-ruling">Tennessee</a> — pondered the impacts the high court’s ruling would have on them. While officials in Kansas and other states said the ruling would have no impact, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp said the ruling would <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/georgia-voter-id-law-blocked/nYP9p/">block a portion of the state’s voter ID law</a> — although the law has never been enforced because according to Kemp he has been unable to gain access to a federal immigration database. Kemp told the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> that he is considering appealing the EAC to include new instructions to the federal form.

<li>According to numbers received by the <i>Associated Press</i>, very few people are responding to letters mailed from the Colorado secretary of state’s office <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_23493736/colo-voter-citizenship-checks-yield-few-responses?source=rss">questioning their citizenship</a> and right to vote. In the most recent round of letters (298) 63 people have responded affirming their citizenship and 15 have responding saying they are not citizens and wish to be removed from the voter rolls.

<li>The Democratic Party of Hawaii has filed suit in federal court claiming that the <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/573742/Democrats-say-primary-law-is-unconstitutional.html?nav=5031">state’s primary system</a> is unconstitutional. Under Hawaii law, every registered voter may participate in primary elections regardless of party. The Democrats claim the nomination process is in violation of the First Amendment.

<li>Although the use of <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2013/1123-electionlineweekly-may-30-2013">vote centers</a> is on the rise, this week Hidalgo County, Texas <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_2a323682-d874-11e2-9d6b-001a4bcf6878.html">delayed a plan to test out vote centers</a> this November. According to The Monitor, the county’s elections department began preparing to use vote centers in early 2013. The plan was supported by a committee established to study it, but drew complaints from McAllen City commissioners. The county commission decided to scrap the plan to test it in 2013, but said it would continue to study it.

<li>A fun <a href="#.UcL7vOvhHw5">piece of elections history</a> was found recently in the Washington County, Pa. courthouse. A small, weathered yellow book less than an inch thick is a list of voters in Cecil Township in 1863. The book is on display at the elections office for anyone who wants to stop by and see it or trace their family history.

We design and redesign our program based upon what we learn from our surveys and other data. The 2011 EASE grant program was created to better understand the different challenges that military and overseas voters face at every step of the voting process. The EASE grant program funded 35 programs that included online ballot delivery, online voter registration, automated ballot duplication, online ballot requests and online ballot tracking. With the research that we receive from this program, FVAP will be able to focus efforts on the necessary portion of the voting process to ensure that military and overseas voters are more successful. As we move forward to the next grant program, FVAP will narrow the scope of its research and address two of the most critical aspects of the electoral process for military and overseas voters: ballot transit time and voter confusion. The Effective Absentee System for Elections 2 grant program will focus in two specific areas: the development of online ballot delivery tools and the establishment of single points of contact (single POC) in State election offices. It is vital that we have a significant statistical sample in order to validate the effectiveness of these programs. In order for this to occur, we want to focus on statewide solutions in areas that have a great number of voters covered by UOCAVA. <strong><i>Closing Date</i></strong>: June 24.

The bill, backed by state and local elections officials, will trim the state’s permanent early voting list and limit who may return a ballot on behalf of a voter.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>District of Columbia</strong></span>: While most states finished haggling two years ago over when their state primaries would be held, legislators in Washington, D.C. are considering <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2013/06/17/primary-election-date-change-proposal-appears-to-be-dead/">moving the District’s primary</a> again. Legislation was introduced that would move the 2014 primary to June. The primary, traditionally held in September, was moved to April in 2012 to comply with the federal MOVE Act. Following a recent hearing where members of the public supported moving the primary to June and the D.C. Board of Elections supported moving it to May — if it had to be moved at all — the legislation appears dead in committee with three of the five council members on the committee opposing it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Florida</strong></span>: Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill that would have provided a public records exemption for <a href="http://jacksonville.com/opinion/blog/403455/matt-dixon/2013-06-14/scott-vetoes-records-exemption-email-addresses-collected">email addresses on voter registration forms</a>. “In order to ensure that voters continue to have efficient access to election-related materials and information, it is essential to keep these channels of communication open to the public,” Scott wrote in his veto message.</p>
<p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Maine</strong></span>: A measure that would create an <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2013/06/19/politics/effort-to-create-early-voting-system-dies-in-maine-house/?ref=latest">early voting system</a> in Maine failed to garner the two-thirds support it needed in the House to put the question before voters. The Senate had approved the measure and met the two-thirds threshold.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Maryland</strong></span>: The Bowie City Council, in an effort to boost voter turnout for local municipal elections, recently voted to allow <a href="http://www.gazette.net/article/20130619/NEWS/130619058/1029/bowie-officials-hope-voting-change-boosts-election-participation&amp;template=gazette">no-excuse absentee voting</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New Hampshire:</strong></span> Negotiations between representatives of the House and Senate broke down this week and it appears that an effort to roll back the state’s <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/7036616-95/voter-id-talks-break-down-at-state-house-no-compromise-expected-on-changes-to">voter ID</a> law have failed and the second phase of the law which narrows the list of acceptable IDs will go into effect.</p>
<p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New York</strong></span>: According to published reports, lawmakers in the Senate and Assembly have reached an agreement and are expected to vote at press time on bringing back the beloved <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/06/ny-state-legislators-ready-to-ok-lever-voting-machines-for-city-elections">lever-voting machines</a> for the upcoming primary and primary runoff in New York City. In addition to allowing for the use of the lever-voting machines, the legislation will also push back the date of any runoff election to three weeks after the primary instead of two. Optical-scan machines will still be used for November’s general election.</p>
<p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ohio</strong></span>: Legislation pending in the House may make it as easy as A-B-C to cast a ballot in future elections. Senate Bill 109 — approved in May by the Senate and now being considered by the House — calls for exchanging numbers for letters as the way in which polling places <a href="http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2013/06/20/senate-proposal-to-make-voting-faster/">process voters on election day</a>. According to The Chronicle-Telegram, sign-in tables at polling places would be denoted by signs bearing a certain number of letters in the alphabet such as A to F, rather than the present system that identifies tables and poll workers by precincts such as 1-A, 1-B and 1-C.</p>
<p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rhode Island</strong></span>: The House Judiciary Committee voted 11-1 to recommend a bill (H-5776 Sub A) to the full House. Under the legislation, voters who do not have <a href="http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2013/06/providence-ri--voters-who-have-no.html">photo ID</a> could still vote provided they show some type of ID. <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></p>
