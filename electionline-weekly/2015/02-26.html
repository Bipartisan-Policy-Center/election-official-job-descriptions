							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lifelong passion for process leads to elections job<br /></strong><em>At 21, William Nesbitt takes charge of Danville, Ill. elections</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>While most college seniors are busy making plans for spring break first and graduation and life after college second, University of Illinois, Springfield senior William Nesbitt has his mind on other things.</p>
<p>Nesbitt is planning to conduct his first election as the <a href="http://www.vercounty.org/eleccomm.htm">director of elections for Danville, Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>Nesbitt, 21, officially started on January 20 and has been busy at work since day one.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #000000; float: right;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Nesbitt.JPG" alt="Nesbitt" width="177" height="302" /></p>
<p>“I got so excited last week when we first got our ballots,” Nesbitt said. “I like that am I able to see the progress towards each election from start to finish. Being the executive director of the Danville Election Commission is a very unique type of public service.”</p>
<p>Nesbitt may not be the youngest ever, or even currently the youngest chief election official in the country, but for him, applying for the Danville job wasn’t about being the youngest, it was about working in his community and doing a job he knew he could.</p>
<p>“The main reason I applied for the job was because I felt like I had the qualifications to do the job,” Nesbitt said. “I am also from the Danville area and I wanted to be able to stay in the community. I love this community and I thought this would be a perfect fit for me.”</p>
<p>Nesbitt wasn’t even sure if he was going to get the job or not when he applied, but in addition to a passion for the process, he knew he had at least one thing going for him.</p>
<p>“I previously worked in the Illinois House of Representatives and was able to get two letters of recommendation, one from a Republican and one from a Democrat,” Nesbitt said. “That showed that I have the ability to work with anyone.”</p>
<p>The commissioners that hired Nesbitt are confident in his ability to get the job done.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a pretty complex job, and this is a person who is ready for that,” Commissioner Bar Bailey <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-01-15/new-election-commission-director-anxious-start.html">told</a> <em>The News Gazette</em>. &#8220;He&#8217;s a young man with lots of energy and lots of enthusiasm. I think it&#8217;s going to work well.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, other than the delicate balance of juggling 17 credit hours of college coursework and a 40+-hour per week job, Nesbitt said things are going well.</p>
<p>He said he’s spent a lot time learning the election code and about all the various equipment that the elections office uses. He said he was genuinely surprised about the vast array of technology that the office uses. He noted that working in the elections office is different every day and that keeps him excited about coming to work each morning.</p>
<p>And he’s enjoyed getting to know his colleagues.</p>
<p>“The best part, so far, has been working with the staff in the office,” Nesbitt said. “There are two other employees in the office and they have been wonderful to work with. We are a great team together and I think we will provide the best service to the voters of Danville.”</p>
<p>While he is busy learning the established system and practices and policies in the elections office he’s already thinking ahead to future including purchasing new voting machines — like many jurisdictions the city’s machines are about 10 years old — purchasing more e-pollbooks and making voter-friendly advances to the elections website.</p>
<p>He’s also looking forward to engaging more of his peers in the process. Millennials have a reputation of not voting and Nesbitt his hoping to change that.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, voters my age do not think about how government affects them personally. I have been going to local high schools and our local community college to educate them about the electoral process,” Nesbitt said. “I think interaction is a great way to get voters my age involved.”</p>
<p>As for Nesbitt, he has always had a passion for the elections process.</p>
<p>“It [registering to vote] was the first thing I did when I turned 18. I have grown up in a household that has always stressed the importance of being educated about elections and who is running,” Nesbitt said.</p>
<p>He fondly recalls going to the polls with his father when he was a child and his dad showing him the ballot and talking to him about candidates.</p>
<p>It was also his dad who made his first voting experience extra special.</p>
<p>“The first time I voted was in March of 2012 and my father, Chuck Nesbitt, was actually on the ballot running for the <a href="http://www.co.vermilion.il.us/ctybrd.htm">Vermilion County Board</a>,” Nesbitt said. “So, my very first voting experience is very memorable for me because I was able to vote for my dad and he ended up winning the election.”</p>

							<h2>Knight News Challenge</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Knight News Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The Knight Foundation, Democracy Fund, Hewlett Foundation and Rita Allen Foundation are collaborating on the latest <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a> to answer this question: How might we better inform voters and increase civic participation before, during and after elections.</p>
<p>For this challenge, Knight is looking for ideas and projects that better inform and inspire voters, as well as make the election process more fun and accessible for individuals.</p>
<p>There are no specific projects in mind, and the contest is open to anyone, from&nbsp;journalists, students, civic technologists, and academics, to news organizations, businesses, nonprofits, governments and individuals.</p>
<p>However, the challenge will not fund projects involving voter registration, lobbying or advocating for specific parties, initiatives or candidates.</p>
<p>Winners — there will be more than one — will split more than $3 million.</p>
<p>The challenge opens February 25 and submissions must be received by 5 p.m. on March 19. Winners will be announced in June.</p>

<ul>
<li>This week, Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill proposed <a href="http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-merrill-0226-20150225-story.html">eliminating the state’s elected registrars</a> and instead replacing them with one appointed registrar in each of the state’s 169 municipalities. &#8220;We have now had two elections in the last four years where Connecticut has made national news for problems on Election Day, and enough is enough,&#8221; Merrill said at a press conference. On more positive news for registrars in Connecticut, last week Merrill recognized the registrars in New Haven who processed the <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/government-and-politics/20150220/state-praises-new-havens-same-day-voter-registration">most same-day registrations</a>on Election Day — more than 600.
</li>
<li>This week, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission held it’s <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/EAC%20Selects%20Officers%20&amp;%20Accredits%20Voting%20System%20Test%20Lab-News-Release-FINAL-2-24-15.pdf">first meeting in four years with a quorum</a>. The EAC addressed a variety of issues including selecting a chair and vice chair, accreditation of a new voting system test lab, consideration of possible updates to the standards used to test voting systems and updates to the EAC’s voting system testing program manuals. For a complete rundown and to watch it, visit the EAC’s website.
</li>
<li>While several jurisdictions are now <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27580196/littleton-sends-165-ballots-underage-voters-special-election">allowing 16- and 17-year olds to vote</a> in local elections, Littleton, Colorado isn’t one of them. Which is why it came as a surprise to about 165 underage voters who inadvertently received mail ballots for an upcoming special election. The young people are all pre-registered to vote, just not yet eligible to cast a ballot. Littleton elections officials sent letters to the affected teenagers and the city’s acting clerk Colleen Norton told <em>The Denver Post</em> that her office is ready to intercept any of the 165 ballots should they be returned.
</li>
<li>Citing tradition, the Sunset City, Utah city council voted 3 to 1 to <a href="http://www.standard.net/Government/2015/02/20/Sunset-City-rejects-by-mail-election-siding-with-traditionlist.html">conduct the 2015 elections the old fashioned way</a> — at the polls instead of by mail — as many Davis County jurisdictions have moved to. “I’m a traditionalist. I don’t think it improved our numbers (voter turnout percentages) enough to go all by-mail,” said Councilman Ryan Furniss.&nbsp;“I’m not a fan of the vote by-mail.”
</li>
<li>Village elections in Chautauqua County, New York <a href="http://www.wrfalp.com/2015-village-elections-to-be-held-on-wednesday-march-18-due-to-st-patricks-day/">will take place on a Wednesday this year</a>. What? Yup, because St. Patrick’s Day falls on Tuesday the 17th and a quirk in New York State law prohibits elections from being conducted on St. Patrick’s Day in order to “honor Irish heritage.” Since 1998, when the law was first enacted, St. Patrick’s Day has only fallen on a Tuesday once, in 2009.
</li>
<li>The Rhode Island Legislature is currently debating a bill whether or not to allow <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150220/NEWS/150229969/13943">bake sales at polling places on Election Day</a> and the state Board of Elections is trying to decide whether to weigh in or not. During a meeting last week the SBOE debated the pros and cons of cookies at the polls. Commissioner Stephen Erickson made a motion to support the legislation, but Executive Director Robert Kando said approving the legislation could have unforeseen circumstances. “May I point out to the board that if this were to become law &#8230; that there will be a group in your precincts over which the Board of Elections will have no authority?” Kando said according to <em>The Providence Journal</em>. It makes electionline sad that there is so much angst over baked goods.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delaware</strong>: Rep. Earl Jacques has introduced House Bill 20 that would allow for <a href="http://www.wdel.com/story.php?id=66445">no-excuse absentee voting</a> in the First State. If approved, the legislation would need to pass both houses again in two years because it constitutes an amendment to the state’s constitution. Similar legislation was defeated in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Sen. Garrett Richter (R) is drafting legislation to move the Sunshine State’s <a href="http://www.nbc-2.com/story/28162851/swfl-lawmakers-proposes-to-push-back-primary-elections#.VOthh8b1-Do">primary to March 15</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: The Senate has given first-round approval to Senate Bill 34 that would empower the secretary of state to <a href="http://m.cjonline.com/news/2015-02-24/senate-edges-closer-handing-prosecutorial-power-kobach-voter-fraud#gsc.tab=0">prosecute election crimes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: The House has approved legislation that would allow residents to <a href="http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/Kentucky-House-passes-electronic-voter-registration-bill-293764891.html">register online to vote</a>. Currently only deployed soldiers and residents living overseas may register to vote online.</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>: Sen. Ron Collins (R-Wells) has introduced legislation that would require Maine voters to show a <a href="http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/25/voter-id-legislature-dicussion/24024307/">photo ID</a> when casting a ballot. Similar legislation failed to advance in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: Del. Cory V. McCray (D-Baltimore City) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/freshman-maryland-delegate-pushes-bill-to-restore-voting-rights-for-felons/2015/02/25/8113c90a-bd0d-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html">restore the voting rights to approximately 40,000 ex-offenders</a> in Maryland. Under the proposed legislation, which has 51 cosponsors, offenders would be eligible to vote once they are no longer incarcerated, but may still be serving probation or other terms of their sentence.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee is considering legislation that would move the primary seven days later if the original date falls on certain <a href="http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/local/parrott-bill-would-move-voting-around-religious-holidays/article_ed1fdf30-deb9-5fd7-9aeb-1b268777dbe7.html">religious holidays</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan: </strong>The Senate has approved legislation that would <a href="http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/02/michigan_legislature_settles_o.html">move the state’s primary</a> to March 8. The House has already approved the legislation and it now heads to the desk of Gov. Rick Scott.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Elections and Government Reform is reviewing legislation that would <a href="http://www.michigandaily.com/news/absentee-voting-bill">allow first-time voters to vote absentee</a> or by mail. Currently, unless the voter is disabled, first-time voters are required to vote in person.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: A Senate subcommittee has approved legislation that will allow people to begin voting 15 days before an election. Right now, the state has no-excuse absentee voting, but not <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/02/senate-committee-approves-early-voting/">early voting</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved legislation that would reinstate the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/292818021.html">voting rights to ex-felons</a> on probation or parole. Ex-felons in Minnesota currently have the right to vote once they have completed all the terms of their service and are “off papers.”</p>
<p>Sen. Brandon Peterson has introduced legislation that would require a “<a href="http://www.twincities.com/minnesota/ci_27580958/minnesota-state-senator-wants-none-above-ballot">none of the above</a>” choice on all ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: The Senate approved a bill, 26-8, which would set the <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/51e1688da35c40d8995dfba4ba34d300/MO--Ballot-Measures/">deadline to change ballot measures</a> about two weeks before an election, which is two weeks earlier than under current law. Supporters argued that the deadline change would have thousands of dollars in reprinting ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong>: Assemblyman Ira Hansen has introduced Assembly Bill 94 that would allow voters to receive <a href="http://www.ktvn.com/story/28192490/assembly-bill-would-allow-voters-to-receive-sample-ballots-via-email-1">sample ballots via email</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee voted 6-5 along party lines to advance House Bill 61 that would require voters to <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/legislature/house-committee-oks-middle-road-bill-on-voter-id/article_db1e9b16-de2a-5ff2-af22-311960b61de5.html">verify their ID</a>, but would allow for a wide range of IDs including expired licenses and tribal-issued paperwork that does not include a photo. A more stringent piece of legislation that would have required a current photo ID was defeated 8-3.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: On an 18-29 vote, the Senate voted down a provision that would have allowed North Dakota voters to cast a <a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/politics/3687377-north-dakota-senate-votes-down-provisional-ballots">provisional ballot</a> if they did not have the required form of ID in order to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong>: The Oregon House has approved House Bill 2177 that would <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/mapes/index.ssf/2015/02/automatic_voter_registration_b_1.html">automatically register</a> Oregonians to vote when they obtain a new or update an existing driver’s license. The legislation was approved 35-24 along party lines. It moves next to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: Senate Bill 54 — legislation aimed at delaying a compromise to <a href="http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/4904-senate-kills-bill-to-delay-count-my-vote-compromise">Count My Vote</a> — was killed by the Senate on a 9-19 vote.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: The General Assembly has approved legislation that will allow Montgomery County to make changes to its <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/montgomery_county/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-simplify-montgomery-county-elections/article_24584a06-71b8-587e-afb3-163e11dda872.html">voting precincts</a>, essentially eliminating split precincts, which according to those involved, should make it easier to administer elections.</p></p>

<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Circuit Judge David Preston has thrown out the November election for Magoffin County judge-executive saying that there were so many <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/2015/02/20/3705900_judge-throws-out-election-results.html?rh=1">violations of election rules</a>. According to the <em>Lexington Herald-Leader</em>, the judge cited “a raft of improprieties” including a lack of required information on applications for absentee ballots; precinct officers failing to document how they identified voters and improperly helping people vote; and residents casting early ballots at the county clerk&#8217;s office when there was no Republican election commissioner present as required.</p>
