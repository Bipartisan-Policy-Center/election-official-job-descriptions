							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 115%;"><strong>Knight Foundation announces winners of News Challenge<br /></strong><em>$3.2M awarded for better ideas to inform voters, civic participation</em></p>
<p style="line-height: 115%;">By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the election world was atwitter with the announcement of the Knight News Challenge — a challenge that sought projects designed to better inform voters and increase civic participation before, during and after elections.</p>
<p>The prize? More than $3 million in funding to make the projects come to life and hopefully encourage greater participation in the process by a more informed public.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a> announced the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/7/22/22-ideas-win-knight-news-challenge-elections/">22 winning projects</a> that will split the $3.2 million. Ten of the winners will receive investments of $200,000 to $525,000 each while 12 early-stage ideas will receive $35,000 through the Knight Prototype Fund.</p>
<p>The Challenge is a collaboration between Knight, the <a href="http://www.democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a> [which also funds electionline.org], the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.ritaallenfoundation.org/">Rita Allen Foundation</a>. The Democracy Fund and Hewlett Foundation each contributed $250,000 to the challenge and the Rita Allen Foundation contributed $150,000.</p>
<p style="line-height: 115%;">According to John Bracken, Knight Foundation vice president for media innovation, the challenge received just over 1,000 entries.</p>
<p>“We received more ideas than any other Knight News Challenge, since we have moved to a themed format,” Bracken said. “The winning projects reflect this urgency and present&nbsp;important ways to create sustained engagement around community issues on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>Many of the submitted projects, according to Bracken, focused on unraveling influence in elections and were dedicated to exploring a variety of methods for tracking, analyzing and informing the public on who is fueling campaign messages.</p>
<p>Bracken said that as with past challenges, Knight brought in a group of trusted independent reviewers and advisors working in journalism, civic, tech and governance to help with the decision-making process.</p>
<p>The winners range from the <em>Associated Press</em> with a project on providing less expensive and more accurate alternatives to exit polling to the <a href="http://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Technology and Civic Life</a>’s civic engagement toolkit for local elections officials.</p>
<p>“We’re living the dream! We are getting paid to collaborate with an amazing team of local election officials and design experts to help increase access to civic information,” said Whitney May, co-founder and director of government services for CTCL.</p>
<p>CTCL, along with its project partners, is building the Civic Engagement Toolkit. The toolkit will be a website that any election official can visit to find communication tools recommended and tested by other election officials. The website will also included step-by-step instructions on how to best use each tool for the 2016 general election and beyond.</p>
<p>“Local election offices are a trusted source of nonpartisan civic information for voters, campaigns, and the media,” May said. “We saw the Knight News Challenge as an opportunity to work with local election officials in communities large and small so they might have access to the best communication tools available to share critical civic information and run excellent elections.”</p>
<p>Voting is a topic that Knight is broadly focused on in multiple programs and Bracken said the organization will continue to focus on a range of projects that help make government at all levels more open and participatory. So even if you’re project didn’t win this time, there will surely be a next time.</p>
<p>“Elections represent the best opportunity for Americans to shape policy and reimagine their shared future,” Braken said. “With this in mind, we hope to&nbsp;develop a better understanding of what strategies can result in a more informed electorate and&nbsp;create sustained engagement around community issues on a daily basis.”</p>
<p><em>Electionline</em> will be following up with all the election administration-based winners in the coming weeks to look at their projects more in-depth, but in the mean time here are the 10 investment winners.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In an effort to <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/07/to-speed-up-election-results-miami-dade-plans-tweak-to-precinct-reporting-process.html">speed up election-night reporting</a> the Miami-Dade County Elections Department will now send polling place results directly to elections headquarters once the precinct has closed. According to the <em>Miami Herald</em>, until now poll workers had been required to take the results, saved on thumb drives, to the nearest regional collection centers, which would then send in the tallies. &#8220;We&#8217;re basically eliminating the drive time&#8221; to the collection centers, Chief Deputy Supervisor of Elections&nbsp;<span><strong>Christina White</strong></span> told the paper. She pegged that time at an average of about 15 minutes.
</li>
<li>Thanks to a contest sponsored by the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, Ivan Rojas, a Los Angeles security guard is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/18/us-usa-california-prize-idUSKCN0PS05Z20150718">$25,000 richer just for casting a ballot in the May board of education election</a>. Rojas, chosen at random from all those who cast votes, won the contest that was designed to boost turnout in traditionally low-turnout contests. According to Reuters, California and Alaska are the only states that make it possible to have a voter turnout lottery and it’s prohibited in federal elections.
</li>
<li>Elections officials in Floyd County, Georgia are contemplating whether or not to <a href="http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/floyd-county-election-board-mulls-sunday-voting-will-hear-public/article_4a33cc7c-2f69-11e5-8daa-1fe058b647eb.html">extend early voting on Sunday to upcoming elections</a>. A trial run on Oct. 26 last year drew 261 voters to cast ballots in the run-up to the November midterm election. In comparison, 168 people cast early votes on Oct. 25, the Saturday before. “The board has decided to get feedback from the community to see if Sunday is something we should continue to offer; to see if it’s worth the cost,” city elections clerk Donna Maldonaldo told the <em>Northwest Georgia News</em>.
</li>
<li>Oops! Officials in Craighead County, Arkansas are finally starting to bill schools, cities and the state for more than 10 elections conducted since 2008. According to <em>The Jonesboro Sun</em>, a former election coordinator <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/5ab4d00347c04d9f940c7dcf60557551/AR--Craighead-County-Election-Billing">failed to bill for more than $260,000</a> the county was owed for a variety of election contests it conducted on behalf of the other jurisdictions.
</li>
<li>They say good things come to those who wait, and it’s been nine years since officials in California first announced a plan to move to a <a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2015/07/22/nine-years-later,-california-gets-new-voter-registration-system/">new statewide voter registration system</a> and now, it’s finally ready for implementation! According to Capital Public Radio, two counties began the transition to VoteCal this week. Other counties will follow in the coming months. Secretary of State Alex Padilla’s office says full implementation is scheduled for next June.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: House Democrats have floated a proposal that would have them dropping their push to ban displaying the Confederate flag in national ceremonies if Republican leaders would agree to consider an <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/248222-dems-float-compromise-linking-confederate-flag-to-voting-rights">update to the 1965 Voting Rights Act</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to say to you that the members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the full Democratic Caucus are willing to sit down with the Speaker and work out a way for us to allow the proper display and utilization of &#8230; the flag in certain instances if he would only sit down with us and work out an appropriate addressing of the amendments to the Voting Rights Act,&#8221; Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) said during a press briefing in the Capitol.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) indicated that he <a href="http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/mccarthy-cracks-door-voting-rights-act/?dcz=">may be willing to move forward with at least a conversation the legislation</a>. &nbsp;On a personal level, I’d like to see the debate go forward,” he said. “I’d like to see [us] have the debate in committee. I think everything, when it’s first written and&nbsp;where the world is today, has changed. So just as most of our bills, how do you modernize? “An overall review, I think, it’s the right time to do it,” McCarthy continued. “What the outcome can be, I don’t prejudge.”</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts</strong>: Spencer selectmen may give voters the opportunity to vote on whether they want <a href="http://www.telegram.com/article/20150720/NEWS/150729909">longer voting hours</a> or not. In 2003, in order to cut costs, the town changed its voting hours to 12pm-8pm, but voters have complained that the hours are inconvenient.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: The Ann Arbor city council has voted 7-4 against <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/07/ann_arbor_officials_vote_down.html">reforming the city’s elections</a>. The council voted against putting a question on the November ballot that would have made the city’s elections nonpartisan. In addition, the council voted 10-1 against putting a proposal in front of voters that would have moved the city to nonpartisan elections and institute four-year terms for the mayor and councilmembers.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: This week, Duluth City Clerk Jeff Cos validated a petition that will put a charter amendment on Duluth’s November ballot that would adopt <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/3801075-duluth-voters-will-decide-whether-adopt-ranked-choice-voting">ranked-choice voting for municipal elections</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: In a compromise deal struck between Republicans and Democrats, North Carolina will hold its <a href="http://www.wral.com/lawmakers-to-set-nc-presidential-primary-date/14780073/">2016 primary on March 15</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The Burleigh County commission decided to <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/burleigh-delays-vote-by-mail-decision-for-rural-precincts/article_867e1d54-d1f0-5e2d-bbf2-8f5b0968066f.html">table a vote on moving to vote-by-mail precincts</a> until they have time to allow for more feedback. By-and-large the commission is supportive of the idea, Commissioner Jim Peluso said the commission wanted to give affected voters more time to weigh-in on the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: The King County council voted unanimously to require all elections-related materials in the county be <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/council/news/2015/July/07-20-RDB-Voter-Access.aspx">translated into Spanish and Korean</a>. Currently under Sec. 203 of the Voting Rights Act, the county must provide materials in Chinese and Vietnamese, but the new ordinance will include Spanish and Korean although those numbers don’t quite meet the Sec. 203 requirements. “I and King County Election staff are looking forward to a partnership with Councilmember Dembowski and his staff to provide translation of election materials for Korean and Spanish speaking voters,” Sherril Huff, Director of King County Elections said in a statement. “I anticipate this partnership will be a critical step in supporting all King County Communities.”</p></p>
