							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Virginia DOE releases report critical of WinVote system<br /></strong><em>State, affected localities working to find solution for upcoming elections</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>On April 1, the <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/">Virginia Department of Elections</a> released an interim <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/webdocs/VotingEquipReport/">report</a> citing critical, potential security concerns with the WinVote DREs, in particular with the wireless capability of the system.</p>
<p>Despite the date, this was no joke.</p>
<p>Following scattered reports of problems with voting systems in the state during the November 2014 election, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) called for an investigation into the irregularities. The State Board of Elections began its review in late 2014, but it wasn’t until early 2015 that the extent of the problem became obvious.</p>
<p>“We really didn&#8217;t know until early February that there was a potential security issue with the WinVotes,” said Edgardo Cortes, commissioner of elections for the Commonwealth. “At that point we moved quickly to conduct additional testing, but it wasn&#8217;t until the preliminary test results were provided on March 26 that we knew how <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/WebDocs/VotingEquipReport/4.pdf">serious a vulnerability</a> we were facing.” &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/WebDocs/VotingEquipReport/5.pdf">Twenty-nine</a> localities — about 20 percent of the precincts in the Commonwealth — use the WinVote DREs and of those, <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/WebDocs/VotingEquipReport/6.pdf">10</a> are facing June primaries.</p>
<p>On April 14, the SBE will meet at which time Cortes anticipates the board may decertify the system for use in Virginia.</p>
<p>“We know the timing of this is not great &#8211; but there is never a good time to discuss possible decertification of a voting system,” Cortes said. “I have been in elections for a long time and we would not have recommended the board consider such a serious and immediate option for a minor issue.”</p>
<p>Since the reports release, the SBE has been in touch with all the affected localities, especially those with upcoming primaries. The board has also surveyed the localities to identify some of their needs</p>
<p>The SBE has solicited information from voting system vendors about their capacity to help the jurisdictions conduct a successful June primary and all the vendor plans are available on the state’s website.</p>
<p>Cortes said they have also been exploring the ability of localities to share equipment with neighbors and other “creative ideas suggested by our local registrars and electoral board members.”</p>
<p>“This has been a cooperative process as we head towards next week&#8217;s public</p>
<p>hearing,” Cortes said.</p>
<p>While the process may have been cooperative since the release of the report, not everyone has been happy with the handling of things.</p>
<p><a href="http://vote.arlingtonva.us/">Arlington County</a>, which is one of the 10 localities facing a June primary, is home to 52 precincts and is the third largest jurisdiction using the WinVote DREs.</p>
<p>According to Linda Lindberg, director of elections, the county has been using WinVote machines for nearly 12 years and has never had any significant issues with the machines. Lindberg finds the state’s report and the timing of the report troubling.</p>
<p>“The fundamental problem is that the State Board of Elections and Department of Elections have put us in an untenable position,” Lindberg said. “…[I]f we are able to continue using WINvote, we are tainted by the flawed stigma they have raised. And if we are forced to not use WINvote, we have to come up with the funds and rush a new system implementation. The proverbial rock and hard place.”</p>
<p>Cortes stressed that the report ultimately wasn’t about whether or not localities had any problems in November 2014, but that it was a proactive step to address a serious security issue his office identified before it causes problems during an election.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m a former registrar from a locality that used WinVotes,” Cortes said. “While I would have been unhappy about the timing of this while I was in a locality, it is nothing compared to how I would have felt if I ended up having an equipment problem on election day and found out later that the state knew about it and didn&#8217;t address it.”</p>
<p>Kirk Showalter, general registrar for the <a href="http://www.richmondgov.com/registrar/index.aspx">City of Richmond</a> also has issues with the state’s report. Showalter said the city — with 65 precincts — has been using the system for nearly a decade with few problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have been using the WinVote machines for a decade now and found them to be exceptionally reliable and accurate,” Showalter said. “In the 10 years in which we&#8217;ve used the machines, we&#8217;ve only had two actual mechanical failures in the precincts on election day.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Richmond is also conducting primary elections in June and Showalter said it will be next to impossible to purchase or lease new equipment in time for the election.</p>
<p>“The timing of all of this is most regrettable,” Showalter said. “Our ballot proofs are due to the State Board of Elections on Friday. Yet I won&#8217;t know for certain whether or not we have to switch equipment until next week. The week after we must start absentee voting. As you know, the equipment governs the form and printing of the ballot.&nbsp; Thus, I will not know what equipment I will be able to use for absentee voting until only a week before it starts. In order to be ready regardless of what happens, I am working on two parallel tracks:&nbsp;one using my existing equipment and one using new optical scan equipment.”</p>
<p>Showalter said she is preparing ballot proofs for both eventualities and that her office has identified the type of equipment that they would like to use if they are required to switch equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://henrico.us/registrar/">Henrico County</a>, which has 800 WinVotes for 92 polling places, Registrar Mark Coakley seems resigned to his fate.</p>
<p>“If our DRE’s are decertified on April 14, a plan is in place for voting equipment replacement,” Coakley said. “I have basically put all county administration departments on standby for quick action if needed.”</p>
<p>Coakley said a plan was already in place for the county to purchase new voting machines in the upcoming fiscal year and that if the need to purchase new equipment arises sooner, he said he would leave that up to the county accountants to get the necessary funding before the July 1 start to the fiscal year.</p>
<p>While Henrico uses the most WinVotes, Coakley said the one saving grace if the machines are decertified before the upcoming election would be the predicted low turnout.</p>
<p>“Sadly, as most election officials know, turnout for primary elections is not as high as we would like it to be,” Coakley said. “With DRE equipment or new optical scan equipment we plan on ‘skeleton’ staffing at the polls. Training however will be intensive and efficient. For June, all election officers working the Primary will be trained using county facilities for Saturday and daily classes. Election staff is prepared for as much overtime as our budget can handle.”</p>
<p>Even counties that don’t have an upcoming primary are concerned about the timing of the report because, as Randy Wertz, general registrar in <a href="http://www.montva.com/content/1146/98/185/default.aspx">Montgomery County</a> explained, he has already submitted his budget for the upcoming fiscal year and that did not include needing to replace all the county’s WinVote machines.</p>
<p>“…[W]e have already submitted our budget request for the upcoming fiscal year and we had planned on using our WinVote machines for voters with disabilities,” Wertz said. “This machine was designed specifically for this and is perfect for outside the polls (curbside) voting. We have 115 of these machines and they would have lasted for several years in this capacity. Thus saving county money.”</p>
<p>If forced to go with another voting system for future elections, Wertz said he would have to go to the county board of supervisors for additional funds and that the board would be blindsided by the request.</p>
<p>“Thousands of dollars they had not planned on expending – another unfunded mandate from the Commonwealth of Virginia,” Wertz said.</p>
<p>Like Montgomery County, Arlington had already planned to replace its voting machines, but that money — about $700,000 as Lindberg estimates — is not in the budget until FY17. Lindberg said Arlington has been able to work with a neighboring county to borrow machines for the June primary.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the elections officials in the affected localities have their concerns with the process, if not the machines themselves, what about the voters?</p>
<p>Cortes said that because of the state’s rigorous certification process, which relies heavily on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s certification process, voters should be confident in the election process and that the public should actually take this report as an example of how the election community moves quickly to address a problem and maintain confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Still, some of the officials like Showalter are worried about the impacts this switch may have on voters.</p>
<p>“Voter education is my biggest and gravest concern,” Showalter said. “Unfortunately, the timing and manner in which this issue has been handled has created a no win situation for us. If we use our WinVotes for the June primary, there will be questions about the results. Conversely, if we move to a new system, will the unfamiliarity of it cause something to go awry?”</p>
<p>Showalter noted that the last time Richmond changed voting systems the city had extensive voter outreach over the course of several months. If forced to change for June, she said she will work with candidates and political parties to get the word out and will have elections officers in the precinct ready to educate voters.</p>
<p>With regard to questions about the security of the systems, Showalter said she will take them as she gets them.</p>
<p>“As to the allegations raised about the security of the WinVotes, all I can do is respond to them with what I know to be the truth and answer any questions raised,” Showalter said. “We are and remain fully confident in their security and accuracy.”</p>
<p>Despite conerns, Arlington’s, Lindberg is prepared to put a positive spin on things.</p>
<p>“I am frankly not overly concerned about training or voter education, because I think we can put a positive spin on things, not by condemning the WINvote but by emphasizing this switch was in the plan all along, and we’ve simply decided to accelerate the change,” Lindberg said.</p>

														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday was primary day in many places cities and towns across the country including in Alaska, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada and Wisconsin:
<ul>
<li>In Anchorage, none of the candidates seeking to replace former Mayor Dan Sullivan got 45 percent of the vote so the city will have to hold a <a href="http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/voters-weigh-in-on-anchorage-mayor-schools-props-in-muni-elections/32247888">runoff election on May 5</a>.</li>
<li>Turnout was a mixed bag in Illinois with <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/politics/voter-turnout-around-40-percent-in-mayoral-runoff-officials-say/636412/">turnout for the Chicago</a> mayoral runoff being higher — albeit during early voting than on election day — than what it was during the original primary. Several issues slowed down the vote count in <a href="http://www.mywebtimes.com/news/local/late-night-for-voting-results/article_a0cd45f3-d2b5-5e46-9d5e-01959591961a.html">LaSalle County</a>. Five polling locations in Chicago had to stay open until 8 p.m. because they <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Power-Outage-No-Heat-Among-Tuesday-Polling-Problems-298902931.html">opened late</a>. In <a href="http://www.kfvs12.com/story/28737188/power-outage-stalls-voting-at-jackson-co-polling-location">Jackson County</a>, a power outage temporarily stalled voting at one location. Officials in <a href="http://www.kcchronicle.com/2015/04/08/kane-county-elections-team-springs-into-action/a9i7zn3/">Adams County</a> had to scramble after a fire the night before the election destroyed one of the county’s polling places. The <a href="http://www.kcchronicle.com/2015/04/07/election-complaints-investigated-but-no-violations-found/a8b9g9/">Kane County</a> State’s Attorney’s Office fielded several complaint calls during the day but found no violations at polling places. A ballot error in <a href="http://www.saukvalley.com/2015/04/08/ballot-errors-in-polo-ward-races-caught-early/amvj8df/">Ogle County</a> was discovered at about 8 a.m. and staff was able to make the changes to the ballots after only about 10 people had voted. Voters in suburban <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/politics/new-i-voted-stickers-win-over-suburban-voters/638402/">Cook County</a> were pleased with the new “I Voted” stickers they received on Tuesday, while voters in <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/04/07/i-voted-stickers-a-thing-of-the-past-in-lake-county/">Lake County</a> once again went stickerless.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kmov.com/story/28740189/hail-heavy-rain-create-traffic-problems-throughout-st-louis">Bad weather</a> created some problems for Saint Louis, Missouri- area voters on Tuesday. Also in Saint Louis, some voters and an official with the St. Louis Board of Elections <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/early-confusion-arises-in-some-st-louis-polls-mulling-special/article_f62fcdfb-549a-5f70-a8c4-55207d343ecf.html">reported problems at a polling place</a> where a special tax election was being conducted. Voters claimed that they were turned away because of confusion over who could vote for what in the property tax increase vote. In <a href="http://www.kspr.com/news/local/more-voters-turn-out-in-greene-county-than-expected/21051620_32245232">Greene County</a>, more voters turned out than expected — 23 percent.</li>
<li>And in Nevada reports of a man with a <a href="http://www.8newsnow.com/story/28744496/man-with-weapon-temporarily-disrupts-voting-at-henderson-location">gun near a polling place</a>, which temporarily shut down voting, proved to be unfounded.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After some wrangling — isn’t there always wrangling when money is involved? — poll workers in Vanderburgh County, Indiana will be seeing <a href="http://www.courierpress.com/news/local-elections/commissioners-agree-to-poll-worker-pay-hike_75425103">pay raise</a> during the next election cycle. While the county election board had sought $14,000 additional dollars to raise the “volunteers” pay, the county council approved $8,000. Inspectors will now make $155, lead judges $125 and clerks $105.
</li>
<li>The Mississippi Board of Elections is considering whether or not the lone candidate in a special election meets all the requirements to serve in the state House. If the candidate does, state law allows for the <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/2015/04/07/6163953_lone-candidate-in-house-race-could.html?rh=1">cancellation of the May 5 special election</a>.
</li>
<li>A review by the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia board of elections found that <a href="http://onlineathens.com/breaking-news/2015-04-07/athens-clarke-elections-officials-find-20-people-living-ups-store">approximately 20 voters are registered a local UPS Store</a>. The problem was discovered when staff were conducting a routine “street audit.” According to the Athens Banner-Herald, the assumption by elections officials is that the voters in questions are using mailbox services at the store for their mail and listed that address instead of their home address. The elections office will now attempt to contact the voters registered at the store. This is not the first time something like this has happened. Not long ago Minnesota discovered that multiple voters were registered at a local mailbox store.
</li>
<li>It’s the little things really. Due to a clerical error, some voters in Saginaw, Michigan will have to <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2015/04/some_saginaw_voters_may_need_t.html">refold their absentee ballots</a> because the ballots were sent from the clerks office improperly folded—potentially revealing how someone voted. About half of the 690 requested absentee ballots have been sent out and will require the voter to refold them.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama</strong>: There’s nothing like a good, old-fashioned filibuster and that’s what House Democrats did for about four hours this week while discussing a bill that would move the state’s <a href="http://www.wsfa.com/story/28745497/al-house-democrats-filibuster-voting-rights-bill-for-4-hours">voter registration deadline</a> from 15 days prior to an election to 30 days. While it’s not clear yet whether the legislation will be defeated it did at least halt the conversation on the legislation for this week.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong>: Sen. Lesil McGuire (R-Anchorage) has introduced legislation that would allow Alaskans to <a href="https://www.adn.com/article/20150405/alaska-lawmakers-eye-ways-improve-voter-access-polls">register and vote on the same-day</a>. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House. The bills also call for <strong>online voter registration</strong>. The bills would also change how early voting locations are referred to and would eliminate the term “absentee in-person” and change it to <strong>early voting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>; Legislation that would have limited who can <a href="http://www.expressnews.com/news/article/Bill-modifying-early-ballot-collection-dies-in-6176765.php">collect early ballots</a> finally and quietly died in the House late last week.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong>: The Legislature has approved an amendment to the state’s constitution, that if approved by voters would no longer require elections officials to hold elections if they are <a href="http://harrisondaily.com/news/proposed-amendment-could-prevent-wasteful-elections/article_f463b1e6-dd64-11e4-9ef1-fbc0e1f718ab.html">uncontested</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: Legislation to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/voting-rights-win-bill-cut-georgia-early-voting-dead">cut early voting</a> from 21 days to 12 days, which was approved by a House committee in February failed to move to a full House vote before the legislative session ended late last week, effectively killing the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong>: The Assembly Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections is considering legislation that would require a procedure to check whether noncitizens who obtain a Nevada <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/immigration/bill-calls-check-noncitizen-driver-cards-against-voter-rolls">driver authorization card show up on voter registration rolls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Under House Bill 373, the <a href="http://www.morganton.com/news/proposed-bill-would-delay-voting-machine-upgrades/article_f1c9097c-dd82-11e4-981c-9302f8191789.html">timeline for counties to purchase new voting equipment</a> would be extended. If approve, 36 counties that currently use DRE machines would have until 2020 to make the switch to paper.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The Senate has approved legislation that makes changes to the state’s <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/senate-approves-voter-id-bill/article_1e0e5a3c-c85d-5253-97c3-95e1470640d4.html">voter ID law</a> including changing what types of ID are acceptable. Under the amended law, essentially only a driver’s license, non-driver’s ID, a tribal government card or a long-term care certificate will be acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: Both the Senate (33-0) and the House (75-23) have approved legislation that says “any voter using a mobile electronic or communication device … shall be prohibited from using the device for telephone conversations, recording or taking photographs or videos while inside the polling place.” Once signed, the law goes into effect January 1, 2016. <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/state/bill-would-ban-selfies-other-photos-at-the-polls_08320222">So long selfies</a>!</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: The Arizona Supreme Court has upheld an appeals court decision — without comment — that says <a href="http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2015/apr/06/court-rules-only-charter-cities-can-control-own-el/">charter cities have a constitutional right to control their own elections</a>, even if consolidating elections would control costs and boost turnout. The original suit stemmed from a 2012 law that forced all Arizona localities to hold their elections on even years.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: In an 11-0 ruling, the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ballot-measure-sponsors-must-be-IDd-court-affirms-6178083.php">Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld</a> a California elections law that requires the sponsors of ballot initiatives to identify themselves on the petitions they circulate.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael M. Johnson has <a href="http://www.whittierdailynews.com/general-news/20150406/judge-awards-nearly-1-million-in-legal-fees-to-attorneys-who-sued-whittier-over-district-based-council-elections">awarded nearly $1 million in legal fees</a> to the attorneys who sued the City of Whittier for violating the California Voting Rights Act. Although Johnson ultimately dismissed the lawsuit against Whittier after voters approved district-based elections, he said the plaintiffs had “prevailed on a practical level” and therefore should receive the fees.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong>: On Monday, a Superior Court judge in Hartford postponed ruling on whether to grant an <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-hartford-registrars-injunction-0407-20150406-story.html">injunction that would stop removal hearings</a> by the Hartford council who are determining whether or not to remove the city’s three registrars. The council is permitted to proceed with the removal hearings, but may not hear testimony from witnesses until attorneys for the registrars have time to respond to a brief filed by the city.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: St. Charles County will pay almost $370,000 <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2015/04/03/st-charles-county-to-pay-nearly-370k-in-settlement/25264685/">to settle a lawsuit</a> brought by employees against the county director that alleged Director Rich Chrismer discriminated against them due to their sex, age or disability.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The U.S. Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article17537150.html">declined to review questions about two provisions in North Carolina election law</a> regarding same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting. According to the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>, because U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder has already set a trial date for July 2015, the SCOTUS decision will have little impact on the law for now.</p></p>
