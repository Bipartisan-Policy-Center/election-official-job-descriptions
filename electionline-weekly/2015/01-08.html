							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>First Person Singular: Doug Lewis</strong><br /><em>Reflections on democracy</em></p>
<p><a href="mailto:dlewis@electioncenter.org"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Doug Lewis</span></a><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">, executive director, </span><a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Election Center<br /></span></a><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Private citizen (as of January 15) who still cares deeply for the elections process</span></em></p>
<p>Of all the things that I have seen and worked with in public policy work during the last 45 years, I am constantly amazed that we are able to have such a high caliber of election administration when the nation and state and local jurisdictions continuously undervalue the necessities for serving the public well in making democracy function.</p>
<p>The beauty and hope of American democracy is that it is still the most vibrant example in the world of how a free people can assure self-governance.</p>
<p>For all the foibles that have happened to elections during our lifetime, our system has proven amazingly resilient.</p>
<p>We go through periods of where an observer has to wonder if we are not intentionally trying to kill democracy and then we rediscover our roots, our balance, our system of fair play, and we right what is ugly or simply ill-advised.</p>
<p>I have been around the elections process long enough now to know and feel both the hopes for and the concerns about election administration in the United States of America.</p>
<p>I lived through and witnessed some of the horrible systemic abuses that perverted democracy. While many of those abuses were in states previously covered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, there were also some systemic abuses in major urban areas of America where the “political machines” of people in power were using election administration to assure that they stayed in power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are still pockets around the U.S. where partisans and politically powerful work hard at making sure that the election process results in the overwhelming numbers of only one party or one philosophy.</p>
<p>Democracy is too important to allow it to be manipulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elections must be fair. Not just fair in the accurate counting of votes so they are a reflection of the voters’ will. Elections have to be fair to young and old, to rich people and not so rich, to all races and genders, to be equally as fair to gays as we are to straights, and to all viewpoints. If the election process is presumed to be rigged or unfair then the voters cannot believe in the government that results from the election.</p>
<p>Along with that concern, it is truly disturbing that both political parties engage in political tactics that foster doubts about the fairness of elections: Republicans allege consistently that fraud is possible in American elections and that it occurs with such regularity that voters can’t really trust outcomes. Democrats are no better: they consistently allege that there is systemic “voter suppression” or “voter intimidation” and that it occurs with such regularity that voters can’t really trust outcomes.</p>
<p>Each side is filled with true believers that their point of view is the correct one. No one seems willing to hold up a hand and say STOP!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The allegations are most often unprovable, but that does not stop each side (and the media outlets that agree with each respective viewpoint) from howling it loudly during each election cycle. Haven’t sensible people yet figured out that if they keep alleging the process is unfair and broken and tainted, that the public will believe what is alleged? Doesn’t it do <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">democracy</span></em> a disservice?</p>
<p>My concern for the future is this: we must, as a nation, as a people, as individuals, do what is necessary to protect the process itself. Democracy is not just a form of government, and no matter how inadequate it appears at some times, it is not simply a methodology or a structure to be bent and manipulated when it suits the purpose. Democracy is more than that: it is a way to assure that freedom prevails for humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an ideal that many of the world’s non-free citizens want desperately to experience. Of all the ways that we on this planet have tried to discover a way to govern ourselves through, with, and by the affected people, it is consistently the only process that allows opportunities for freedom.</p>
<p>At the risk of making this sound like unrealistic idealism, it concerns me that otherwise intelligent people truly believe that a democracy restructured so that more of their party, or their philosophy gets elected is an improvement.</p>
<p>Democracy perverted to assure the election of “more of us and fewer of them” soon becomes no democracy at all.</p>
<p>As I leave the election administration world I would encourage stakeholders to step back from their own ideologies and look at this from a fresh perspective. Have <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect</span></em> for how fragile democracy can become. Have <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect</span></em> for the belief systems of others and be somewhat less certain that “more of us and fewer of them” is a good solution.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans at the most intense partisan level truly believe the other side is trying to pervert democracy. There is little or no respect for the viewpoints of the opposition party.</p>
<p>But if we can understand and listen to concerns, can’t we find a way to assure that the greatest fears of each side have protections built into election administration that recognizes some validity to each other’s concerns?</p>
<p>There are partisans from each side who use the issues and concerns strictly as political fodder to arouse their own troops of volunteers, supporters and campaigned hardened operatives. So some of this is likely purely callous in alleging manipulation of the system that is based on fears and pandering. But listen to rank and file party supporters, be they liberal or conservative, and there is simply a core belief that the “other side” is trying to rig the system for themselves.</p>
<p>We read, we hear the two sides’ points of view and yet there is not enough <strong><em>respect</em></strong> among the participants to truly listen to the concerns of each. This belief system is so strong that no amount of factual information seems to sway the conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both sides are ultimately right: there is fraud and there is voter intimidation. Is it rampant? No. There are just enough legitimate examples to remind us that there are still people willing to manipulate the process. The value system is so rigorous for each side (fraud or intimidation) that the viewpoint held is akin to a deep seated religious belief which makes it difficult to proceed in a manner that allows us to make changes to election administration that catch or better still, prevent, the bad actions of fraud or intimidation.</p>
<p>If we don’t find some common ground on these issues then there is no respect for the process itself. We end up with constant attempts to make sure that only “our view” prevails even if it means bending the process by whatever means necessary to assure that “our people” get elected. And there is righteous indignation whenever anyone challenges the belief system of either side.</p>
<p>Both Democrats AND Republicans believe they hold the moral high ground and therefore any legislation or any court proceeding that gives an advantage to the “correct” side is hailed as justified or railed against whenever the opposite happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hope we can have enough respect for each other’s worst fears on these matters to actually shape good but neutral election administration policy.</p>
<p>To the lawyers and legal activists who insist on filing lawsuits late into an election cycle, I encourage you to really think about the impact on democracy (not the immediate impact on the current election). Late changes in an election cycle, whether from a legislature, or from a court, have the potential to lead to confusion and chaos in the election that then can have a fundamental impact on voters’ views about the process. It can also lead to serious malfunctions in election administration because they come so late into the cycle that training, education, policies and procedures become all but impossible to complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have respect for democracy even if you have no respect for the other candidate or the other party. If there is truly an egregious law or procedure that needs to be remedied, then can’t the lawsuits be filed and completed more than nine months before the election?</p>
<p>I know that judges consider themselves the best arbiters of fair or unfair practices and legal action is a primary principal of our form of government (as are legislatures and administrative bodies), but even they need to be more willing to have respect for democracy. This simply means judges may still hear cases on elections but delay implementation of any rulings so they only affect elections that are greater than nine months away. If judges can show more restraint and more respect for the process itself, then some of the lawsuits will diminish over time. Clearly some of the court cases are not truly about righting inequities but about assuring a set of court ordered rules that affect the most immediate election to influence the potential outcome.</p>
<p>If it a court case is truly about inequity, then the cases can be filed and adjudicated far enough in advance of an election cycle that election administration can adjust to the court decision to assure voters of a smoother process that maximizes voters’ rights. We want the process to have the highest chance for success and to serve voters well.</p>
<p>So with my apologies to both Rodney Dangerfield (“I don’t get no respect) and the wonderful Aretha Franklin (“R-E-S-P-E-C-T”), it is my hope that the future of election administration includes a wider sense of responsibility and respect from all stakeholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democracy can be lost. Its survival is not assured and justifying the manipulation of laws and processes because it means “more of our kind gets to govern” diminishes democracy. Prolonged manipulation for partisan gain is likely to cost us the very thing all claim to want – a fair process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Greeks lost democracy it took humankind almost 2,000 years to form another democracy. If we lose it this time, our children and grandchildren and untold future generations may never get to know the freedom we have grown up with and lived under. On Election Day we are all equal and that is as it should be.</p>
<p>So, is it too much to ask for Respect? Respect for each other, respect for other viewpoints and enough respect that we can find ways together to overcome fears about the process, respect for the need to allow the process time to adjust to changes, and enough respect for democracy to challenge anyone who advocates changes to assure victory of one segment of society over another.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: On behalf of electionline and election geeks everywhere, we would just like to thank Doug Lewis for his long and thoughtful tenure in the world of elections administration. He was always willing to take a call or answer an email when we had questions about elections and for that we’ll always be grateful. We’re looking forward to continuing to work with the Election Center and new director Tim Mattice, but we will miss “the other Doug” very much. Thanks for everything Doug Lewis and please enjoy your next adventure, whatever it may be!</p>

														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Jackson, Mississippi chapter of the NAACP has <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/01/06/naacp-filed-federal-complaint-hinds-election-commission/21370975/">filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice against the Hinds County Election Commission</a> following issues with ballot shortages in the November 2014 election. “We took a look at all the options and decided to file the complaint,” Wayne McDaniels, president of the Jackson NAACP chapter told <em>The Clarion-Ledger</em>. “We’re also waiting to hear back from the (Hinds County) district attorney’s office.” In addition to the DOJ complaint, the Hinds County board of supervisors is also conducting an investigation.
</li>
<li>The special panel looking into the <a href="http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2014/12/31/hartford-election-inquiry-needs-more-time/">problems that plagued Hartford, Connecticut</a> on Election Day in 2014 requested additional time to complete it’s probe and will now issue a report on January 16. Staff for the panel said they needed additional time to gather transcripts from earlier meetings as well as conduct some follow-up research.
</li>
<li>Like the <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/mission-motto.pdf">U.S. Postal Service</a>, neither snow nor rain nor heat…will stop elections officials from conducting an election. Such was the case this week in Fairfax County, Virginia when a <a href="http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2015/jan/06/kathleen-murphy-wins-34th-district/">special election coincided with the first significant snowfall</a> of the season. Not only did all polling places open on time, but turnout was actually higher than expected. “We are trying to get more ballots at each site, so that indicates that turnout has been heavier than usual,” site Chief Election Officer Joe Gofus told <em>The Connection Newspapers.
<p></em></li>
<li>Let’s hope the check is in the mail! Pima County has sent the Arizona Secretary of State’s office a <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/pima-county-district-recount-cost-k/article_8921bfb3-3a4d-5c4c-9a06-47a9105ecd10.html">bill for $35,000</a> to cover the expense of the recount in Congressional District 2 race. It took the county about two weeks to complete the recount. According to the <em>Arizona Daily Star</em>, Cochise County is still tabulating…its bill.
</li>
<li>A light bulb has gone off for Broward County Elections Supervisor Dr. Brenda Snipes. Literally. Following a complaint from a failed candidate and an inquiry from the <em>Sun Sentinel</em>, Snipes said she will <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-transparent-envelopes-snipes-20150102-story.html">review procedures for absentee ballots</a>. Apparently, according to the paper and the candidate, anyone can see through the county-provided “privacy” envelopes for the ballots by holding them up to a 100-watt light bulb. “Of all the tests we&#8217;ve done as a part of our election prep, we missed the one about holding the envelope up the light of a hundred watt light bulb,” Snipes told the paper in an email. “Although we have never done this test, we have always been concerned, and proactive about the integrity of the election process&#8230;”

							<h2>Legal Update</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: A lawsuit has been filed in the tightly contested Chula Vista city council race. According to the <em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em>, the lawsuit contends that 15 <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/jan/02/chula-vista-council-race-sparks-lawsuit/">provisional ballot and mail-in votes were not included in the official results</a>. Most of the votes were not counted because the address on the ballot differed from the address on file, but an attorney for the plaintiffs says state law and election guidelines say those ballots should be counted.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: A three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/appeals-judges-fayette-voting-rights-case-to-go-to/njh55/">returned a Fayette County voting rights case back to the lower court</a> for trial. The ruling is the latest in a more than three year fight between the county and the NAACP on behalf of a group of black voters who said the commission’s at-large voting system prevents blacks from being elected.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong>: Despite the sudden death of the candidate, an Indiana attorney has <a href="http://www.wave3.com/story/27743901/clark-county-clerk-candidate-dies-appeal-to-continue">vowed to continue the election challenge</a> in the Clark County clerk’s race. Attorney Larry Wilder told WAVE he will file an appeal to a lower court’s decision to award the race to Susan Popp instead of Kelly Harrod. Harrod won the race on election night, leading Popp by 21 votes. A hand recount reversed the outcome, providing Popp with a 43-vote victory because of numerous ballots that voting machines hadn&#8217;t initially recorded. Wilder said Harrod had a heart attack before Christmas and never recovered. The candidate previous said he wanted to pursue an appeal, and Wilder agreed.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey:</strong> Superior Court Judge Robert C. Wilson has tossed out a lawsuit filed by former Bogota Mayor Tito Jackson and candidate Ingrid Brito. In their suit, the two had contended that <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/judge-tosses-bogota-voter-fraud-suit-1.1185310">votes were illegally cast</a>, but Wilson said the plaintiffs failed to show that enough illegal votes were cast — or that enough legal votes were rejected — to alter the outcome.</p>
<p>In Asbury Park, a suit has been filed challenging the recent mayoral election. The suit, filed by the runner-up, contends that the Monmouth Co. BOE <a href="http://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2015/01/new_asbury_park_mayor_didnt_win_the_election_lawsuit_claims.html">improperly voided more than 300 votes</a> for the runner-up, votes the plaintiff contends would have changed the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The U.S. Department of Justice has responded to a motion filed by Jackson County to toss a voting rights lawsuit with <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/02/us-attorney-scolds-county-voting-law/21214459/">harsh rebuke</a>. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be clear, South Dakota does not have a proud history when it comes to providing Native Americans an equal right to vote,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson wrote. &#8220;We should be doing more, not less, to protect the right of every South Dakotan to vote in our elections.&#8221; The county was initially sued for not providing a satellite-voting center near or on the Pine Ridge Reservation. After pressure, the county placed one voting center in the nearby town of Wanblee and contends because of that, they are not violating anyone’s voting rights. DOJ begs to differ and has asked the judge to move forward with the suit.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The ongoing battle over a recount in an Island senate race continues into the New Year with a <a href="http://virginislandsdailynews.com/news/hansen-takes-her-fight-for-a-recount-to-v-i-supreme-court-1.1811039">notice to appeal</a> being filed with the U.S.V.I. Supreme Court. Incumbent Sen. Alicia Hansen is appealing a lower court ruling that denied Hansen’s petition for a recount and made null and void any actions taken with regard to the recount petition.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: This week the American Civil Liberties Union and other voting rights groups asked the U.S. Supreme Court to <a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/2015/01/07/groups-ask-supreme-court-to-hear-wisconsin-voter-id-case/21417919/">reverse a decision upholding the state’s voter photo ID law</a>. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, in their filing, the groups argued that the Wisconsin case provides an “ideal vehicle” to settle the legal debate over all voter ID laws. &#8220;Unless this court acts now, the court likely will continue to be put in the untenable position of refereeing voter ID disputes on an emergency basis on the eve of elections every two years,&#8221; the ACLU&#8217;s attorneys argued. &#8220;Given the stakes for so many voters across the country, and the uncertainty among lower courts … this court should grant (review).&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>California: </strong>One of the many laws effective January 1 is the <a href="http://patch.com/california/suisuncity/new-law-improves-process-california-ballot-initiatives">Ballot Initiative Transparency Act</a>, which is an attempt to give voters more user-friendly information about proposed initiatives. One provision of the new law provides a 30-day public comment period on proposed initiatives before backers may begin gathering signatures.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Joshua Cardenas, a member of the San Francisco Youth Commission has authored a resolution urging the mayor and board of supervisors to explore <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/youths-seek-to-lower-voting-age-to-16-in-sf/Content?oid=2916012">lowering the city’s voting age to 16</a>. Two supervisors have already indicated their support for the resolution and Supervisor John Avalos said that he is “likely to submit” a charter amendment.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: Legislation was introduced this week that would switch the city to an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-to-consider-instant-runoff-voting-in-local-elections/2015/01/06/d76346b0-95bb-11e4-8385-866293322c2f_story.html">instant runoff voting system</a> for local elections—mayor, council and attorney general.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Sen. Jeff Clemens (D-Lake Worth) has filed SB228 that would allow for <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/01/06/online-voter-registration-proposed/">online voter registration</a> in the Sunshine State. The bill would require the state Division of Elections to create a secure online system by January 1, 2016. Applicants would have to have a state-issued driver’s license or other type of Florida-issued ID with the ID numbers necessary to confirm the voter’s identity.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong>: A new law now on the books will allow elections officials to <a href="http://peoriapublicradio.org/post/new-law-allows-election-commissions-process-absentee-ballots-sooner">begin process absentee ballots before the polls close</a> on Election Day. Elections officials will now be able to begin processing returned ballots up to 15 days before Election Day withholding results until the polls close.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: According to <em>The Courier-Journal</em> <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2015/01/02/court-boundaries-felon-voting-top-agenda/21188231/">voting rights for persons who have completed their sentence for a felony conviction</a> be a top legislative priority when the General Assembly convenes this week. Rep. Darryl T. Owens, chairman of the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee said pushing getting legislation through that would automatically restore the voting rights of ex-felons is a top priority for his committee.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: While San Francisco is pondering <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hyattsville-becomes-second-city-in-the-us-to-lower-voting-age-to-16/2015/01/07/24a7c8be-95c7-11e4-aabd-d0b93ff613d5_story.html">allowing 16-year-olds to vote</a>, Hyattsville, Maryland is on its way to becoming only the second municipality in the country to do so following a 7-4 vote this week to amend the city’s charter. According to The Washington Post, based on Census estimates, about 200 to 250 teenagers will be allowed to vote in municipal elections in May. The measure faces a second and final vote later this month. Takoma Park, Maryland is the only other jurisdiction to allow 16-year-olds to vote.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A bill pending before the New Jersey Assembly would lower the number of <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/senate-bill-would-limit-messenger-ballots/article_2a4a2cae-9535-11e4-b94d-b3576c21baab.html">“messenger ballots”</a> a person is allowed to turn in on behalf of others from 10 to three. The Senate approved the bill 37-0-3 in mid-December.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: The Dayton city council has approved an ordinance that will require all <a href="http://www.rheaheraldnews.com/news/article_6906b014-95e6-11e4-aeea-0f93a49d8b2c.html">property rights voters</a> — voters who own property, but don’t live in Dayton — to cast their ballots via absentee. Rhea County Administrator of Elections Tom Davis supports the switch and told the <em>Rhea Herald News</em> that the new rules would allow for a smoother voting process during both early voting and on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: This week the bipartisan State Board of Elections said it supports Secretary of State Shantel Krebs’ <a href="http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/elections-board-backs-krebs-priorities-for-legislature/?id=174147">2015 legislative priorities</a> including changes that w would allow residents more time to challenge nominating petitions and allow the secretary’s office to audit some voter petition signatures for statewide races.</p>
