							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let them vote<br /></strong><em>Move is on to allow more 16- and 17-year olds vote in local elections</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>Not too many folks can say they were “the first” in their industry to do something, but Jessie Carpenter, clerk for <a href="http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/cityclerk">Takoma Park, Maryland</a> can wear that label with pride.</p>
<p>In 2013, the City of Takoma Park — a Washington, D.C. suburb — gave 16- and 17-year olds the right to vote in local elections and Carpenter was there to conduct the first election.</p>
<p>Since then, Takoma Park has been joined by Hyattsville, Maryland in allowing 16- and 17-year olds to vote, and legislators in San Francisco, Lowell, Massachusetts and the state of Missouri are also considering lowering the voting age.</p>
<p>Back in Takoma Park, Carpenter said the transition was pretty seamless.</p>
<p>Because Maryland allows 16- and 17-year olds to pre-register, when <a href="http://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/sites/elections/Pages/default.aspx">Prince George’s County</a> provides the city with the most updated voter rolls in advance of the election, the county simply includes the pre-registered 16- and 17-year olds on the eligible list and Carpenter goes from there.</p>
<p>In the first election where they were eligible, 59 of the 134 registered 16- and 17-year olds — or 44 percent — turned out to vote.</p>
<p>“Overall voter turnout — for all ages — was just over 10 percent,” Carpenter said. “So you can see that the young people definitely came out in force.”</p>
<p>Carpenter said the young voters who participated seemed genuinely proud to have been able to vote in their hometown.</p>
<p>And Takoma Park hasn’t stopped there. While Marylanders may pre-register to vote beginning at 16, in Takoma Park, voters may begin pre-registering at 15.</p>
<p>“Once our city council enacted the revisions to our City Charter to extend the vote to the younger voters, we promoted the opportunity to vote,” Carpenter said. “We also&nbsp;allowed 15-year olds to register&nbsp;using a city voter registration form so that we&nbsp;could remind them to transition to registration with the State when they became eligible.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hyattsville-becomes-second-city-in-the-us-to-lower-voting-age-to-16/2015/01/07/24a7c8be-95c7-11e4-aabd-d0b93ff613d5_story.html">Hyattsville, Maryland</a> became the second municipality not only in the country, but also in Maryland to lower the voting age for local elections to 16.</p>
<p>The city’s first election with the new, lower voting age will be this spring. Hyattsville Clerk Laura Reams doesn’t anticipate the coming election to procedurally be any different from past elections.</p>
<p>“Since the pre-registered 16- and 17-year old voters will be incorporated into the city&#8217;s voter rolls, the polling location&nbsp;procedures will be the same for all voters,” Reams said.</p>
<p>Although she has no idea what turnout will be like for this group, so far, she said, reaction to the lower voting age has been positive.</p>
<p>“The city has primarily received very positive feedback on this legislation. The city&nbsp;had a great turn out for the&nbsp;public hearing on lowering the voting age &#8211; approximately 80 people, with&nbsp;standing room only&nbsp;in the city&#8217;s council chambers&nbsp;&#8211; and the comments were overwhelmingly in favor of lowering the voting age for City Elections,” Reams said.</p>
<p>Reams said the city’s board of supervisors of elections has done outreach to the local high schools and is hoping to work with the schools in hosting a voter registration drive before the election.</p>
<p>Both Reams and Carpenter said there have been no added costs to their offices under the new voting age requirements.</p>
<p>Much has been written about Millennial turnout — roughly 21 percent in 2014 — but <a href="http://www.civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CIRCLE-youthvoting-individualPages.pdf">studies</a> have shown that the earlier people get involved in the process the more likely they are to remain engaged in the process.</p>
<p>That’s why organizations like <a href="http://www.civicyouth.org/circle-research-supports-efforts-to-lower-voting-age-in-local-elections/">The Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement</a> (CIRCLE) and <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/right-to-vote-amendment/lowering-the-voting-age/">FairVote</a>, support lowering the voting age at the local level.</p>
<p>Perhaps engaging the generation that follows the Millennials — the jury is still out on what to call them — early on will increase participation later in life.</p>
<p>Carpenter isn’t sure if there has been an increase in 16- and 17-year olds registering to vote, but she said that is something her office will be tracking as they ramp up for the next election when they can vote, which is later this year.</p>
<p>“Not everyone in Takoma Park supported reducing the voting age,” Carpenter said. “I think that as time goes by and other communities reduce the voting age, it will become normal. What we would like to know is whether the early voting experience helps make lifelong voters of these teens.”</p>
<p>One unforeseen wrinkle has come though. Following the decision to lower the voting age, the Hyattsville officials did clarify the rules about minimum age to serve as mayor on the council. Although 16- and 17-year olds can vote for those seats, they can’t serve in them <a href="http://www.gazette.net/article/20150223/NEWS/150229822/hyattsville-sets-18-as-minimum-age-for-mayor-council&amp;template=gazette">until they are 18</a>.</p>
<p>The lower voting age movement has met some resistance.</p>
<p>Recently, residents of Brattleboro, Vermont <a href="http://vtdigger.org/2015/03/07/brattleboro-rejects-lower-voting-age-progressive-amendments/">voted down a measure</a> that would have lowered the town’s voting to 16. While voter turnout was only about 14 percent, the measure failed by an almost 2-1 margin.</p>
<p>The town selectboard was divided on the age amendment — there were several other voting amendments on the recent ballot — but David Gartenstein, selectboard chairman told a local paper that the town’s attorney had expressed concerns over the legality of the amendment.</p>
<p>And as we mentioned, cities and towns are the only ones considering lowering the voting either. At least one piece of legislation is pending at the state level.</p>
<p>In Missouri, <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/member.aspx?district=084">Rep. Karla May</a> (D-084) has introduced <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billsummary.aspx?bill=HJR16&amp;year=2015&amp;code=R">HJR16</a> that proposes a constitutional amendment allowing residents of the state who are over the age of 16 to vote. The bill has been read a second time, but no hearings are scheduled and it is not currently on the House calendar.</p>

<p><strong>How to move beyond the partisan divide in election reform<br /></strong>By Paul Gronke</p>
<p>Last Thursday, House Bill 2177, the &#8220;New Motor Voter Bill,&#8221; passed the Oregon Senate following passage on Feb. 20 in the House. Gov. Kate Brown has said she&#8217;ll sign the legislation; it was a signature piece of legislation for her while secretary of state and was introduced at her request in each of the last two legislative sessions.</p>
<p>Oregon&#8217;s move makes sense given the national movement to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the voter registration system in the United States. Our current voter registration system is costly, inaccurate and antiquated. And there is no doubt that the barriers to registration depress voter turnout by keeping otherwise eligible voters from the polls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FairVote, a nonpartisan voting reform organization, has identified voter registration as the one of the most significant barriers to voter participation in the country. A 2012 study by the Pew Center on the States found that one in four, or more than 51 million Americans, were not registered. One in eight voter registration records were inaccurate or invalid.</p>
<p>Keeping these records up to date is very costly. A 2008 study in our own state of Oregon found that the government spends $4.11 per active voter to maintain current records and $7.67 to add new records. The total bill to the Oregon taxpayers was nearly $9 million!</p>
<p>With those figures, it sounds like automatic voter registration is a good thing; it creates a voter registration system that is easier for citizens, less expensive for the taxpayers and less prone to inaccuracy. Moreover, voter registration is not enshrined in our Constitution. As Harvard historian Alex Keyssar has shown, it was only implemented in the 19th century as a method to disenfranchise first poor and foreign-born, and later African American citizens.</p>
<p>So why, then, did every single Republican in the Oregon House and Senate oppose the bill, and all but one Democrat (Scappoose&#8217;s Sen. Betsy Johnson, who opposed it last time) support the bill? The answer is that election administration and reform &#8212; both here in Oregon and nationwide &#8212; have become one more front in the all-out legal and political melee that law professor Rick Hasen calls the &#8220;Voting Wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can we move beyond partisan divides that shake public confidence in our elections system, turning close elections into acrimonious disputes, fueled by social media and often resolved in the courtroom? The ongoing national debate over voter identification is instructive. Opponents of voter ID have had difficulty finding evidence of citizens denied the right to vote because they lacked an ID, while supporters of voter ID have been unable to provide any evidence of voter impersonation at the polling place &#8212; the only kind of voter fraud that a voter ID would prevent.</p>
<p>The way to thread the political needle on voter ID, as Doug Chapin of the University of Minnesota&#8217;s Election Academy points out, seems to be to require IDs but ensure that they are free and easily obtainable. Gov. Brown and legislative leaders in Oregon may take a lead from Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, who, even though he is a Democrat, has pledged not to sign any elections-related legislation that does not have substantial bipartisan support.</p>
<p>There is no chance that Gov. Brown will fail to sign HB2177. When she does, we can be assured of two things in the future:</p>
<p>First, Oregon&#8217;s high voter turnout rate as a percentage of registered voters will surely go down since many of the newly registered voters won&#8217;t cast a ballot in 2016. And second, if we don&#8217;t figure out a way to get partisanship out of election administration, Oregon&#8217;s part in the voting wars won&#8217;t end anytime soon.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It always comes down to money. This week, two secretaries of state went to bat for money for elections in their states. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon Husted announced plans to request <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/03/jon_husted_seeks_12_million_to.html">$1.2 million in state funds to send absentee ballots</a> to every voter in the state for the 2016 election cycle. The mailings cost $1.5M in 2012 and less than $1M in 2014. In Massachusetts, things got a bit heated when Secretary of State William Galvin addressed Gov. Charlie Baker’s proposed 2016 budget. “As you all know this country is scheduled to elect a new president next year. Apparently the governor only wants 49 states to vote, he doesn’t want this one, because he has drastically underfunded the elections budget,” Galvin said at a meeting with House and Senate budget writers. <a href="http://wwlp.com/2015/03/10/galvin-prez-primary-unaffordable-under-baker-budget/">Galvin requested $8.1M for elections and Baker’s budget only offers $5.7M</a>.
</li>
<li>Rutherford County, Tennessee has joined a growing list of counties asking the state to <a href="http://www.dnj.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/vote-centers-may-replace-precinct-polling-locations/24696091/">move to a vote center system for upcoming elections</a>. Under the county’s plan about 20 precinct-based polling sites would be eliminated and the 30 remaining polling places would function as vote centers where any registered voter may cast a ballot. The plans, according to the county, would save the county hundreds of thousands of dollars. Other counties pursing the vote center idea are Sumner, Hamilton, Chester and Gibson.
</li>
<li>In the wake of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, the debate over schools as polling places has increased. With no real alternatives for locations, the Clark County, Ohio board of elections will <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/tecumseh-wants-special-duty-officer-at-school-for-/nkQJG/">hire a special duty officer to patrol a local elementary</a> school during the May 5 election.
</li>
<li>Democratic members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) asking the agency to look into <a href="http://somd.com/news/headlines/2015/19137.shtml">status of voting machine technology the the potential problems</a> outdated machines could cause in future elections.</li>
<li>Looks like City of Jennings, Missouri will be <a href="http://fox2now.com/2015/03/06/ballot-blunder-leads-to-delay-of-fire-district-election/">taking a Mulligan</a> on its April election. With just a month to go before the scheduled spring election, officials at St. Louis County’s board of elections said instead of voting in April, residents in Jennings will have to vote in a special election because <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/county-election-officials-says-ballot-mistake-jennings-will-force-special-election">the ballot created for Jennings fails to include a race</a> for Riverview Fire District. Because absentee voting is already underway, the entire election will have to be scrapped and a special election will be held most likely sometime in August.

<p><strong>Arkansas</strong>: The <a href="http://www.thv11.com/story/news/local/little-rock/2015/03/09/arkansas-house-supports-concealed-firearms-in-polling-places/24665461/">House</a> has advanced a bill that would allow voters with conceal carry permits to <a href="http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/house-committee-advances-bill-allow-concealed-handguns-polling-places">bring their firearms into a polling place</a> with them on election day.</p>

The lawmakers argue that the legislation will save local governments thousands of dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: A House committee has approved legislation that will <a href="http://www.standard.net/Government/2015/03/05/Bill-for-presidential-primary-and-limited-internet-voting-advances.html">move the state’s Democratic primary</a> — the GOP has said they will conduct a caucus — to March in 2016.</p>
<p>Also getting approval from the committee is a bill that will allow military voters and those with disabilities to cast their ballot via the Internet.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: The ACLU of Florida has filed a federal lawsuit in Jefferson County challenging the county’s counting of inmate population of a state prison when drawing district maps. The suit charges the county of <a href="http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/ACLU-Files-Lawsuit-Challenging-Prison-Gerrymandering-Election-Districts-in-Florida-County-295655961.html">“prison-based gerrymandering”</a> by including the inmates.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The New Jersey Democratic State Committee has filed a lawsuit against a former borough councilman alleging he <a href="http://www.app.com/story/news/local/neptune-wall/belmar/2015/03/06/lawsuit-accuses-belmar-republicans-voter-suppression/24531961/">unlawfully challenged ballots</a> from what he believed were Mayor Matt Doherty&#8217;s supporters. Four Belmar voters joined the committee in the complaint who say their vote-by-mail ballots, delivered by messengers, were challenged five days before the November 2014 election.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: A group of Hasidic Jews have filed a federal lawsuit against the Sullivan County Board of Elections and its commissioners claiming that their <a href="http://www.recordonline.com/article/20150310/NEWS/150319914/101143/NEWS">voting rights were denied because of their religion</a>. In January nearly 200 people were removed from the county’s voter rolls because following an investigation, the county determined that the voter did not live at the registered address. The suit claims the many of those who were removed are Hasidic Jews and they were wrongfully removed.</p>
