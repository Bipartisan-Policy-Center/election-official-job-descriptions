							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>D.C. uses data collection teams to gather info<br /></strong><em>Experienced poll workers fan out citywide to assess voter experience</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:sderheimer79@gmail.com">Sam Derheimer<br /></a>D.C. Poll Worker</p>
<p><em>“Research is creating new knowledge.”</em> &#8211;<strong>Neil Armstrong</strong></p>
<p>During last year’s general election, instead of working the polls at the elementary school across the street, I helped election officials in Washington D.C. better understand Election Day from voters’ perspective.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dcboee.org/">D.C. Board of Elections</a> assembled data collection teams from its trusted poll workers to gather information on the voter experience at the polls, specifically to help understand and address delays on Election Day.</p>
<p>The project itself was narrow in scope and methodology — and therefore easily recreated in other jurisdictions — but the potential effect could be transformative.</p>
<p>On Election Day, five teams of three were dispatched to high traffic precincts, where we were stationed for the entire day. We were given instructions, tools, and access to shadow the poll workers, while not interfering with voting.</p>
<p>In hour shifts, we rotated between the check in process, the ballot distribution process, and a flex position whose assignment was to gather data on a more macro level.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Data points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Check in</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wait time to get to a check in clerk</li>
<li>Number of check in clerks working</li>
<li>Timing of check in process per individual voter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ballot distribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wait time to get to a paper ballot clerk</li>
<li>Timing to distribute paper ballot</li>
<li>Number of paper ballot clerks working</li>
<li>Wait time to get to a touchscreen machine</li>
<li>Timing to set touchscreen machine for voter</li>
<li>Number of touch screen machines and number of touch screen clerks working</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total vote time</strong> (from entering the check in line to casting a ballot)<br /><strong>Precinct layout</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Primary Tools</strong><br /></span>Stop watch<br />Tablet<br />Printed survey sheets (in case of internet trouble with the tablets)<br />Binder with instructions and key information on the project</p>
<p>Prior to Election Day, the data teams received a half-day training that covered both the metrics and the tools. In order for the data to be meaningful, project coordinators needed standards and clear instructions so that the wait times recorded at one precinct were consistently measured with the wait times recorded across town.</p>
<p>During the training session, D.C. officials engaged the team members, most of whom were experienced poll workers and have rich knowledge of the voting process, on how to define the metrics (e.g. when exactly is a voter “in line” for a paper ballot). In that way, D.C. tapped into one of its best resources – its poll workers.</p>
<p>As important as clear data definitions, we were instructed to check in with the precinct captain and poll workers prior to the 7:00 am opening of polls. The precinct captains had been informed of the project, but adding a few roaming data collectors to an unavoidably chaotic day could lead to added stress. Like so many situations, communication can inoculate you from potential problems.</p>
<p>Also key, the recorded timings weren’t linked to the individual poll workers – this wasn’t a measurement of a <em>poll worker’s</em> efficiency, it was a measurement of the <em>precinct’s</em> efficiency. Initially, there was mild curiosity from the poll workers, but that soon evaporated as voters flooded the precinct and they got busy. Then it was time to stay out of the voters’ and poll workers’ way and start timing.</p>
<p>Though, inevitably, in slower times, some poll workers turned around to ask about their own performance. Personally, if they asked, I gave them their last timed transaction, and then tried to move on so as not to influence their behavior. But in the future, it may improve similar projects to establish rules on how to address poll workers who want to know about the data collected.</p>
<p>The data was entered into the tablets and uploaded every hour. Election officials were getting hourly updates on the performance of the select precincts. A broader project could therefore inform resource allocation District wide, as the election progresses through the day.</p>
<p>The data was then compiled into an after election report for the D.C. Board of Elections and will help election officials not only track, but also help alleviate delays and problems on Election Day.</p>
<p>With data on average wait times, by hour, by position at the polls, throughout the entire day, election officials can better allocate resources – both staff and machine. Precinct management can be form fit according to the data to assign poll workers to anticipated choke points in the voting process <em>before </em>they become overtly problematic.</p>
<p>Poll worker duties that are currently performed by two separate positions may be combined where tasks are completed with consistent quickness. Tasks that measured longer may be divided and conquered.</p>
<p>Additionally, the data should inform pollo worker trainings for future elections. The better D.C. can educate its poll workers on from where and when delays originate, the better they can apply resources to prevent them from occurring to begin with.</p>
<p>For D.C., the cost for the project was 15 poll workers and staff time to develop the metrics and configure the tablets, which D.C. already owned. But the value of the data is much larger to any jurisdiction seeking to shorten lines and improve the voting experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there was one other set of recommendations that emerged from my data collection team. One of my teammates, a native Russian, believes that American elections would benefit if precincts pumped in music, and even more from a cart offering a selection of teas and cakes for purchase.</p>
<p>So D.C., data is great, but let them eat cake.</p>

<li>With a 43-vote lead hanging in the balance, <a href="http://mynewsla.com/orange-county/2015/02/04/recount-orange-county-supervisor-special-election-begin-monday/">a recount in a special election</a> in Orange County, California will begin on Monday. According to published reports, candidate Lou Correa, who requested the recount, said he wasn’t looking to overturn the results, but had requested the recount because of reports of “irregularities and questionable votes.” On election night, there was a two-vote lead, but the margin expanded by 237 in the count of vote-by-mail ballots dropped off at polling places on Election Day. The count of provisional ballots carved deeply into the lead until Correa fell 43 short.
</li>
<li>Last week, Ohio <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-daily-briefing/2015/02/2-4-2015-husted-says-immigration-actions-could-jeopardize-integrity-of-elections.html">Secretary of State Jon Husted sent a letter to President Barack Obama</a> citing his concerns about Obama’s executive order on immigration. According to the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>, in his letter, Husted said in his letter that he is concerned non-U.S. citizens may illegally register and vote because they will have increased access to the forms of identification typically needed to register to vote. In the letter, Husted also asked Obama to provide state election officials with access to accurate, searchable databases of non-citizens who have valid Social Security numbers.
</li>
<li>Officials in Vermillion County, Illinois are considering <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-02-03/vermilion-explore-consolidating-county-city-voting-offices.html">consolidating the county and city elections office</a>. Currently the Danville Election Commission handles elections for the city of Danville and the county clerk’s office handles elections for the rest of the county. County Board Chairman Mike Marron told the <em>News-Gazette</em> that he will put together a group that will study two options: Eliminating the election commission and rolling those responsibilities into the clerk’s office; or creating a countywide election commission.

<li>New Yorkers love their bagels and their pizza and their <a href="http://wamc.org/post/disabled-call-elimination-lever-voting-machines">lever voting machines</a> and while the machines have been outlawed since 2002 (phased in over time of course), New York was the last jurisdiction to move away from using levers. They are however, still in use in some local elections and advocates for the disabled have had enough. Advocates are hoping that more disabled voters will use the HAVA-approved accessible voting machines in each polling place. &#8220;We encourage everyone and anyone to use the machine, even though it takes a little bit longer. The more people we can get to use the machine the more feedback we&#8217;ll get, and I think that will then improve the system quicker,” Cliff Perez a systems advocate told WAMC.

							<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: Rep. Gloria Frazier (D-Hephzibah) has introduced HB 146 that would allow voters who are already registered to vote in Georgia to <a href="http://onlineathens.com/general-assembly/2015-01-29/georgia-voters-moving-state-could-re-register-poll">update/change their name and/or address information at the polls</a> on Election Day. Voters would only need to provide a signed statement certifying the change.</p>
<p>House Bill 130 would allow anyone whose voter <a href="http://www.macon.com/2015/02/02/3564924_butler-rep-seeks-quick-voter-application.html?rh=1">registration is not processed in 45 days to take the county’s voter registrar or the secretary of state’s office to court</a>. Rep. Patty Bentley, a former Taylor County voter registrar, offered the legislation. “Forty-five days is more than enough, in my opinion,” said Bentley.</p>
<p>Rep. Mark Hamilton (R-Cunningham) has introduced HB 194 that would limit <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/bill-shortens-early-voting-mandates-polls-open-on-/nj3yw/">early voting</a> to 12 days and require every county to open on the Sunday during those 12 days. Polls would also be open on Saturday. Current law mandates 21 days of early voting including Saturdays, but not Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong>: Rep. Joy San Buenaventura (D-Hawaii) has introduced legislation <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20150130_Lawmaker_wants_to_hold_state_elections_officer_accountable.html?id=290395891">to limit the length of time the state’s top election official may serve</a> in that role. The bill would limit the time of service to two years and require performance evaluations after elections. San Buenaventura cited the problems with the primary election as the reason for introducing the legislation. &#8220;They [the voters in Puna on the Big Island] felt really disenfranchised,&#8221; San Buenaventura said during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. &#8220;They felt that their vote didn&#8217;t count. Hundreds of them were prevented after Iselle from physically going to the voting booth, and when they tried to vote in the makeup election, they were denied.&#8221; San Buenaventura said voters wanted current election official Scott Nago fired, but since he was not, she chose to introduce this legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong>: A House committee is currently considering legislation that would eliminate the requirement that both major parties agree to the switch before counties could <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/bill-lead-polling-places-77576/">move to vote centers</a>. Under the bill, a simply majority on county election boards would allow for the move to vote centers.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers shot down an amendment that would have kept <a href="http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150203/NEWS/150209893">polls open until 8 p.m.</a> in the Hoosier State. Currently polls close at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The House Elections Committee is considering a bill that will allow local elections officials to count absentee ballots that have been properly cast, but <a href="http://wishtv.com/2015/02/05/bill-would-allow-absentee-ballots-from-dead-voters-to-count/">when the voter dies before the vote count</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in both chambers of the Minnesota legislature that would <a href="http://www.postbulletin.com/news/politics/bipartisan-alliance-wants-to-restore-felon-voting-rights/article_e7b6caeb-00e7-58c0-8860-3ea2c6c07856.html">allow convicted felons to vote after they have completed their sentences</a>. If approved, about 47,000 Minnesotans would automatically get their rights restored.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: Sen. Chris McDaniel has introduced <a href="http://www.myfoxal.com/story/27978153/mcdaniels-election-reform-bill-close-to-dying">two pieces of election reform legislation</a>. One would eliminate crossover voting and provide more options for investigating voter fraud and the other would close the state’s primaries. The bills have been referred to the Appropriations and Elections committees. Instead of McDaniel’s Senate Elections Committee which has caused McDaniel to cry foul.</p>
<p><strong>Montana</strong>: The House State Administration Committee tabled House Bill 48 by an 11-9 vote this week. HB 48 would have allowed Montanans with a driver’s license to register to vote or update their existing <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/03/house-panel-tables-electronic-voter-registration-bill/22815231/">voter registration online</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong>: LB 111 and LB10 both advanced out of the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee this week. LB111 would require Nebraskans to show a government-issued <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/voter-id-winner-take-all-election-bills-advance-from-committee/article_b4435e93-69f3-5f34-9e0f-0a95a55aeddd.html">photo ID</a> in order to vote and LB10 would return Nebraska to a winner-take-all system of awarding <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/voter-id-winner-take-all-election-bills-advance-from-committee/article_b4435e93-69f3-5f34-9e0f-0a95a55aeddd.html">Electoral College votes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: While Takoma Park and Hyattsville, Maryland are the only jurisdictions in the country to <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/New-Mexico-lawmaker-pushing-teen-voting-in-school-6049063.php">allow 16- and 17-year olds to vote</a> in municipal elections, Rep. Javier Martinez of Albuquerque wants them to be allowed to vote in school board elections in New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: This week the House Elections and Ethics committee approved legislation that would allow Oklahomans to become <a href="http://www.normantranscript.com/news/committee-approves-absentee-voting-bill/article_e42d8a14-accb-11e4-b5c3-4f1990251a12.html">permanent absentee voters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong>: Legislation supported by Secretary of State Kate Brown that would <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/249573-118290-automatic-voter-registration-plan-advances">automatically register Oregonians to vote</a> cleared its first hurdle this week with a 5-4 vote of support from the House Rules Committee. The bill next moves to the Legislature’s joint budget committee.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong>: State Rep. Rick Galindo (R-San Antonio) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://www.woai.com/articles/woai-local-news-sponsored-by-five-119078/bill-would-make-election-days-student-13211710/">make Election Day a school holiday</a> so schools can be used as polling places without impacting the school day or possibly putting students in harm’s way. Election Day would be a teacher training and in-service day.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong>: The Vermont Senate is considering S.29 a bill that would allow voters to <a href="http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20150131/NEWS03/701319965">register at the polls on Election Day</a>. The current registration deadline is 5 p.m. on the Wednesday before the election. Secretary of State Jim Condos testified before the Senate Government Operations Committee on behalf of the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: A House panel has backed legislation that would require voters who cast their ballots by mail to include a copy of a <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/general_assembly/house-panel-backs-photo-id-for-absentee-voting/article_1383c924-1cc5-5aa2-940c-bdc7d2e23147.html">photo ID</a> in order to vote. Since July 2014, Virginians casting a ballot in person had to show a government-issued photo ID to vote, but those voting by mail did not have to provide any form of identification. The committee approved the legislation 16-6. It now heads to the House floor.</p>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_f8bde4f9-07e4-5c85-b3e6-eb961d525801.html">other voter ID-related bills</a> were shelved this week including SB 820 and SB 688 that would have allowed students at private secondary schools to use their school-issued ID to cast a ballot. In addition, Senate Bill 922 was also killed. Under this bill, IDs issued by state agencies such as the Department of Health, Department of Social Services and Department of Medical Assistance Services would have been permitted to cast a ballot.</p>
<p>This week the Senate approved a bill that would allow those 65 and older to cast and <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_f8bde4f9-07e4-5c85-b3e6-eb961d525801.html">absentee ballot without needing an excuse</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate Privileges and Elections Committee approved SB 853 that allows <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_f8bde4f9-07e4-5c85-b3e6-eb961d525801.html">voters 75 and older to go to the front of the line</a> at polling places on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: A bill to eliminate <a href="http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/603981/Senate-passes-voting-bill.html?nav=5061">straight-ticket voting</a> was approved by the Senate this week. It now moves to the House of Delegates.</p>

							<h2>Legal Update</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: Attorneys for the Arizona Libertarian and Green Parties argued before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals late last week over the state’s voter registration form that <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/01/29/az-voter-registration-forms-debated-in-9th.htm">requires voters to write-in the name of smaller political parties when registering</a>. The state argues that the forms — first issued in 2011 — increase efficiency and cut costs. Plaintiffs say voters wishing to register for one of the three minor parties have an undue burden placed on them. A lower court shot-down the equal-protection challenge to the forms.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: Late last week, the California Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court’s dismissal of <em>Rubin v. Padilla</em>, a suit brought by smaller political parties that challenged the constitutionality of the state’s <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/30/calif-court-top-two-primary-protects-individual-voter-third-party-rights/">top-two primary system</a>.</p>
<p>A voter sued the city of Del Mar and Everyone One Counts, Inc. over the city’s decision to use an <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/01/30/socal-city-voter-wants-to-stop-online-election.htm">Internet-based voting system</a> for an advisory election. The suit, which sought an injunction against this week’s advisory election claimed that the voting system had not been certified by the secretary of state’s office. Superior Court Judge Edward Mohns found that the plaintiff could not prove he would be harmed by the process and <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/02/02/del-mar-can-accept-votes-via-internet.htm">allowed the election to proceed</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: According to <em>The Denver Post</em>, a Douglas County judge dismissed a suit claiming that Castle Rock <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27421717/judge-throws-out-election-claims-against-castle-rock">improperly ran a special election</a> in summer 2014 that lifted the town’s open-carry firearm restrictions. Plaintiffs challenged the process the town used to tabulate ballots, but the judge ruled that because the town is a home-rule entity, the municipal election code doesn’t apply.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: A judge has ruled that Democrat Steve Allen <a href="http://www.macon.com/2015/02/02/3564480_allen-wins-case-will-remain-on.html?rh=1">may continue serving on the Macon-Bibb County board of elections</a> through March 31, which is the end of his current term. The county Democratic Party had sued Allen claiming that he wasn’t properly appointed.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong>: Judge David Ackerman ordered Kane County to conduct a <a href="http://www.kcchronicle.com/2015/01/30/judge-orders-primary-election-in-campton-hills/ajty1f/">primary election on February 24 for Campton Hills</a>. The county had argued that holding the primary would cost $140,000, but the judge ruled that the county should proceed and comply with election law as closely as possible in the shortened timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: Members of the Constitution Party have filed suit in St. Louis County over the county’s Charter that <a href="http://www.callnewspapers.com/Articles-Impact-News-i-2015-02-04-276813.112112-Lawsuit-challenges-countys-exclusion-of-thirdparty-candidates-in-special-elections.html">excludes third parties from special elections</a>. They lawsuit alleges the Charter’s clause that only allows major parties in special elections is unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in Stafford County Superior Court this week <a href="http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/ACLU-Secretary-of-state-violating-court-order-6059766.php">asking the court whether Secretary of State William Gardner is violating an earlier order</a> by sending letters to voters who cast ballots by domicile affidavit.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Voting rights groups argued before Superior Court Judge Michael Morgan that the state’s <a href="http://www.wral.com/opponents-ask-judge-to-throw-out-voter-id-requirement/14407160/">voter ID law</a> — to take effect in 2016 — should be tossed as unconstitutional. Plaintiffs argued that voter ID needs to be adopted by the state as an amendment to the state constitution and not part of a larger election reform package as was the case in 2013. &#8220;We have a constitution that says every qualified voter can vote at every election and any election, and then we have this new statute, VIVA, that says, &#8216;Oh, in order to be permitted to vote, you also have to do this one other thing, which is to present a photo ID,'&#8221; Press Millen an attorney for the plaintiffs argued.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that Tennessee elections <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/01/29/6th-cir-finds-election-officials-have-no-case.htm">officials who were fired in 2008 have no legal claim</a> because their positions were political and subject to patronage. After Republicans took control of the Tennessee General Assembly — and therefore had a majority on county elections commissions — numerous election administrators were fired. &#8220;Because the position of Tennessee administrator of elections is a position for which political affiliation is a permissible requirement for the effective performance of that public office, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that plaintiffs were lawfully subject to patronage dismissal,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Griffin wrote on behalf of the majority.</p>
