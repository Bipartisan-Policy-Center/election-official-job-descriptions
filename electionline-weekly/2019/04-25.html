							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Census Bureau releases 2018 voting and registration data</strong><br />
<em>Turnout was up, among young people and those who use alternative voting methods</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>This week, the<a href="https://www.census.gov/"> U.S. Census Bureau</a> released the<a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/p20/583/"> 2018 voting and registration table package</a> which provides data down to the state level on voter turnout and shows the use of alternative voting methods.</p>
<p>These tables also present a portrait of the voting population by demographic and economic variables including race, sex, age, educational attainment, employment status, tenure, income, disability, marital status, citizenship and veteran status.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3854" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout-figure-1-300x171.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="235" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout-figure-1-300x171.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout-figure-1-768x438.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout-figure-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" />“The Census data is yet another source of information about how many Americans voted in 2018, and serves as a useful backdrop for other similar sources like the EAC’s<a href="https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/election-administration-voting-survey/"> Election Administration and Voting Survey</a> and reported vote totals at the state and local levels,” said Doug Chapin, director of election research for<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/"> Fors Marsh Group</a>.</p>
<p>The big news, that most already knew and the Census confirms is that turnout was historically high in 2018, an 11 percentage point increase from 2014.</p>
<p>Following a year of social activism that saw young people register in large numbers, it should be no surprise that, among 18- to 29-year-olds, voter turnout went from 20 percent in 2014 to 36 percent in 2018, the largest percentage point increase of any age group  — a 79 percent jump.</p>
<p>According to the Census Bureau, voter turnout went up more in some groups than others from 2014 to 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>Among men and women, voter turnout increased by 11 and 12 percentage points respectively.</li>
<li>Voter turnout increased among non-Hispanic Asians by 13 percentage points, a 49 percent increase.</li>
<li>Among Hispanics, voter turnout increased by 13 percentage points, a 50 percent increase in Hispanic voter turnout.</li>
<li>Non-Hispanic black voter turnout increased by 11 percentage points.</li>
<li>Those with higher levels of education had higher levels of voter turnout in 2018.  Those with less than a high school education had the smallest increase in voter turnout (5 percentage points). Those with a high school diploma or equivalent had the second-lowest increase (8 percentage points).</li>
<li>Voting by native-born and naturalized citizens both increased by 12 percentage points. This increase is not significantly different between native-born and naturalized citizens.</li>
<li>Unlike the 2014 midterm election, voter turnout among those living in nonmetropolitan areas (up 8 points) was lower than for those living in metropolitan areas (up 12 points).</li>
</ul>
<p>“Needless to say, this data is incredibly valuable to election officials, policy makers, and other election stakeholders who seek to better understand turnout, demographics of the voting and non-voting populations, voting participation methods, and the reasons why some people do not get registered and do not vote,”<a href="https://www.eac.gov/important-data-on-the-2018-elections-released-today/"> wrote</a> David Kuennen, senior research program specialist at the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Kuennen noted that the data is also valuable to the EAC as it works to complete the 2018 EAVS survey, which is due out by the end of June.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Michael McDonald, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, has a<a href="https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/1120701085319147521"> series of tweets</a> digesting some of the data and explaining why the Census data varies from the data he provides at the<a href="http://www.electproject.org/"> United States Election Project</a>. One tweet in particular really stood out to us:</p>
<p>“What does this all mean for 2020? We are likely in for a storm of the century, with turnout levels not seen for a presidential election in the past 100 years. It is likely persons of color and younger people will participate in 2020 at unprecedented levels,” he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative voting</strong><br />
The survey also looks at the use and availability of what the Census refers to as alternative voting methods. Those methods include early voting and vote-by-mail.</p>
<p>According to the Census survey, 40 percent of voters used an alternative voting method. The Bureau noted that while the use of alternative methods usually drops during midterms, there was no significant difference between 2018 and 2016.</p>

The graph shows the distribution of ballots cast on Election Day, early-in-person, and by mail. According to Stewart, the same graph for 2000 had almost all the states clumped at the top.</p>
<p>Georgia, Texas and Utah had the highest increases, by percentage, in alternative voting rates from 2014 to 2018. Alternative voting increased by 36 percentage points in Utah, 25 points in Texas, and 21 points in Georgia.</p>
<p>“It should be of no surprise that the states with the highest turnout and engagement in the country empower voters with convenient options to vote. Utah saw a significant increase in engagement as a result of their efforts to give voters more time and more options,” said Amber McReynolds, executive director of<a href="https://www.voteathome.org/"> Vote At Home</a>. “Election administration policies must be about who votes, not who wins. It is important for all policy makers to focus on improving the voting experience by leveraging the proven policies that work such as voter registration modernization and convenient voting options.”</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><em>The New York Times</em> has an article this week that details the lengths former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen went to focus the Administration on the efforts DHS was making to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/russia-2020-election-trump.html"> prepare for new and different Russian forms of interference</a> in the 2020 election. According to The Times, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Nielsen not to bring it up with the president.</p>
<p>Current Administration officials, including Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence said, “Election security is and will continue to be one of our nation’s highest national security priorities.”</p>

							<h2>2020 Candidates on Election Issues</h2>
														<p>New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) has sent a letter to all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates asking all of them to sign a petition opposing House Bill 1264 that would require college students to be a<a href="https://www.kxly.com/news/politics/national-politics/nh-senator-calls-on-2020-dems-to-support-repeal-of-voter-law/1071129883"> permanent resident</a> of the state to vote. Currently, New Hampshire does not require registered voters to prove residency &#8212; only to prove &#8220;domicile.&#8221;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/440000-2020-dems-back-repeal-of-controversial-new-hampshire-voting-law"> Several of the 2020 candidates</a> including Kamala Harris, Corey Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kristen Gilibrand and Beto O’Rourke have already come out in opposition to the law.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New Haven, Connecticut, which has long been plagued by long lines and late results</strong>, is putting<a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/New-Haven-putting-thousands-on-the-line-to-fix-13781808.php"> thousands of dollars on the line</a> to figure out how to fix its Election Day problems. According to the New Haven Register, the city has already spent $21,284 for an analysis and recommendations by Daniel Penn Associates LLC on how to avoid what transpired Election Day 2018 in the future. The recommendations from this report include: Improve the skill set of longtime staff, eliminate pre-registration, extend the amount of training and boost the total number of workers. The city is spending an additional $50,000 on a three-month study by Gem Consultants LLC that will help the city come up with<a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Study-recommends-New-Haven-election-changes-13790172.php"> new protocols</a> to conduct elections.</p>
<p><strong>The 2019 New York City Charter Commission has issued a preliminary staff report</strong> recommending that the city move to a<a href="https://www.amny.com/news/politics/rcv-nyc-1.30155321"> ranked choice voting</a> system allow for up to 10 candidates to participate for each office. In the report, the commission contends that  the change would save taxpayers money for costly runoff elections, such as the nearly $11 million 2013 runoff for public advocate. AMNY notes that the report acknowledges that RCV could prove problematic including &#8220;ballot exhaustion,&#8221;  in which candidates may be removed because some voters did not rank them, and confusion about the new system among the electorate. The commission said if the city did implement the new system it would require a ballot redesign and a strong educational outreach to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Amendment 4 Update</strong>: While Florida legislators continue to wrangle over limitations to what ex-felons may or may not regain their right to vote since the approval of Amendment Four, the Tampa Bay Times said a review of the state’s voter rolls says the rolls are growing. According to the paper, The Division of Election website shows the state recorded a net increase of 16,354 voters, after 150,015 inactive voters were removed from the list between January and March 31. At this point in the election cycle four years ago, election supervisors reported a net increase of 7,030 voters after 63,985 names had been scrubbed from registration lists. &#8220;I think it’s because of Amendment 4,&#8221; Mark Earley, Leon County Supervisor of Elections told the paper. &#8220;People are just starting to hear about a presidential election coming up. We&#8217;ll see a much bigger jump this time next year as the presidential preference approaches in March.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>NC9 Update</strong>:<a href="https://www.wral.com/early-voting-sites-open-in-9th-district-primary-for-us-house/18344452/"> Early voting</a> kicked off this week in the do-over of the North Carolina 9th Congressional District contest that was voided earlier this year after it was determined that election fraud interfered with the race in 2018. Early-voting sites are open through May 10 in the district&#8217;s eight counties. Six counties have just one early-voting site open on weekdays during regular business hours. Mecklenburg County has seven sites.<a href="https://www.robesonian.com/news/122565/122565"> Bladen County</a>, which was at the heart of the election fraud scandal in 2018, had to do some last-minute changing to curbside early voting after it was discovered that the original location was too close to the board of elections as defined by state statute. The primary is May 14.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) has introduced the Democracy Restoration Act of 2019 that would automatically<a href="https://mont.thesentinel.com/2019/04/18/cardin-proposes-bill-to-reinstate-voting-rights-to-people-released-from-jail/"> restore the voting rights</a> in federal election to formerly incarcerated individuals once they have completed the terms of their sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> By a 125-24 vote, the House has approved a bill that would allow the Nutmeg State to offer<a href="https://fox61.com/2019/04/24/house-likely-to-take-up-bill-for-early-voting/"> early voting</a>. The bill would allow voters to cast their ballot at least three days before an election. A binding early voting referendum would be placed on the ballot in 2020. The earliest it could be implemented is 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Senate Bill 230 and House Bill 131 would require that each county supervisor of elections enters into an agreement with the clerk of the circuit court to receive, on a monthly basis, a list of potential jurors who have identified themselves as<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/2019/04/18/florida-lawmakers-seek-to-purge-undocumented-immigrants-from-voter-rolls/"> undocumented immigrants</a>.</p>
<p>By a 71-45 vote, the House has approved a bill that would require<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article229619604.html"> formerly incarcerated</a> residents to pay all court fines, fees and restitution before their rights can be restored.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> A House-Senate conference committee has advanced House Bill 1248 that would create a statewide<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/04/hawaii-takes-another-step-toward-statewide-all-mail-voting/"> vote-by-mail</a> system and extend the time early voting locations are open in each county.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> Sen. Troy Carter (D-New Orleans) has introduced a bill that would<a href="https://www.wwno.org/post/legislature-considers-automatic-voter-registration-bill"> automatically register</a> people to vote when they apply for a driver’s license or non-driver ID. Residents would have the option to opt out of voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> House Speaker Sara Gideon (D-Freeport) has introduced a bill that would allow Mainers to be<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maine-house-speakers-bill-would-implement-automatic-voter-registration"> automatically registered to vote</a> when conducting business with the state. Gideon’s bill is loosely modeled after Oregon’s legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> The Assembly has approved Assembly Bill 431 which would<a href="https://elkodaily.com/news/local/nevada-assembly-votes-to-restore-felons-voting-rights/article_640ac628-2942-502a-8fbb-08668388321b.html"> automatically restore the voting rights to felons</a> once they have completed the terms of their sentence.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Senate is debating House Bill 611 which would allow for<a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/lawmakers-debate-no-excuse-needed-absentee-voting/article_21e607df-9a38-556e-bf7a-59f43f30341f.html"> no-excuse absentee voting</a>. The legislation, which passed the House by a 198-163 vote is opposed by the secretary of state and the city and town clerks’ association.</p>
<p>The Senate is also debating a bill that would<a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/NH-Primary-Commission-25091617"> create a commission</a> to “celebrate and safeguard” New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary. The bill was approved by the House. Secretary of State Bill Gardner is opposed to the bill.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Under House Bill 944, paying or receiving payment for a completed<a href="https://www.wral.com/after-9th-district-scandal-bill-would-make-paying-for-absentee-ballot-request-forms-a-crime/18345252/"> absentee ballot request</a> form a Class 2 misdemeanor. The bill also would require county elections officials to keep a log of who submits absentee ballot requests and calls for appropriating $345,000 a year to pay for three more investigators and two more data analysts for the State Board of Elections to check on possible cases of election fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Secretary of State Frank LeRose (R) announced this week he will work with the Legislature to establish<a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/24/automatic-voter-registration-has-bipartisan-support-in-ohio/3562581002/"> automatic voter registration</a> when Ohioans submit their information through a variety of state agencies, not just the department of motor vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> By an 85-9 vote, the House has approved a bill to allow Monroe, Wilson and Williamson counties to participate in a pilot program to allow for “<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/23/tennessee-house-advances-bill-expand-convenience-voting-williamson-wilson-counties/3548642002/">convenience voting</a>” or vote centers. Currently only Rutherford County is participating in the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> The House has advanced a proposed charter change that will allow the city of Montpelier to include<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2019/04/19/house-advances-noncitizen-voting-montpelier-concerns-second-voter-list/"> noncitizens</a> on its voter rolls for local elections. “Local issues should be voted on by the local community,” Montpelier Mayor Anne Watson said. “And everyone who is part of that community should have the ability to participate in decisions that affect their community.” It’s estimated that fewer than a dozen people would be added to the local voter rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> All 38 county auditors have signed onto a letter seeking to pressure the state Legislature to<a href="https://tdn.com/news/local/county-auditor-joins-effort-to-get-legislature-to-pay-for/article_d8861dd0-d6c5-571c-ac62-4f9c62463088.html"> pay its “fair share” of election costs</a>. Currently the state is only required to pay a prorated share of the costs of the primary and general in odd-numbered years. “The state Legislature has decided to ‘dine and dash’ during even years, when the vast majority of their state offices are on the ballot. Despite being given multiple opportunities to do the right thing and change the law, the state instead sticks your cash-strapped county government with the bill,” Cowlitz County Auditor Carolyn Fundingsland said in a release.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Brian Hodge, a former Monroe County Sheriff’s Office deputy has been given five years of probation after being charged with witness tampering, conspiracy to commit voter fraud, five counts of vote buying and witness tampering. All those charges but one were dropped when he agreed to plea to a charge of conspiracy to commit<a href="https://www.citizentribune.com/news/state/wormy-hodge-receives-five-years-probation-in-vote-buying-case/article_69f6f058-c4f9-59f1-8726-75ec668d8591.html"> voter fraud</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Common Cause Wisconsin has filed a federal lawsuit arguing that state election officials are singling out college students by requiring their<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/23/common-cause-sues-over-wisconsins-student-voter-id-rules/3550692002/"> college-issued IDs</a> have certain elements in order to serve as a voter ID. &#8220;This suit asks whether it is constitutional for state law to single out a group of voters and require them to present or submit information that election officials and poll workers do not need and do not use,&#8221; the complaint says. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, a student may use their college-issued ID to vote if the card includes the student&#8217;s name, signature, photo, date the card was issued and the date the card expires.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> T<em>he San Jose Mercury News</em> has an interesting story this week about how a suspicious email to a Contra Costa County elections employee<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/24/russian-election-hacking-california-contra-costa-county/"> caused a scare about Russian hacking</a> that involved the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.
