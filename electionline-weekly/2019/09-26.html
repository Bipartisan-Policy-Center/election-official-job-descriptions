							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Disaster narrowly averted</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. to remain in Universal Postal Union</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Tammy Patrick, senior advisor Elections<br />
</span><a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democracy Fund</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Vietnam War, I started collecting stamps off the envelopes my uncles would send home while serving overseas. I loved carefully cutting the colorful stamps off of the envelope – edged in red and blue to denote Air Mail – and having their letters read to me off of the thin, onion-skin of the stationary. I understood early on that connections to home, no matter why you were away, are important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years since, I have devoted my professional career to breaking down the impediments voters may potentially face based on ability, language skills – and in the case of</span><a href="https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/uocava"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (UOCAVA) voters – time and distance from the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4237" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UPP-300x81.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="103" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UPP-300x81.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UPP-768x209.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UPP.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" />I first heard of the potential United States withdrawal from the</span><a href="http://www.upu.int/en.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Universal Postal Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while attending the National Postal Forum this spring. My immediate reaction was to think of the possible additional hurdles that military and overseas voters would subsequently have to overcome to effectively participate in the franchise. I knew that if the United States withdrew there would be additional challenges faced by millions of voters overseas—adding to the long list of existing barriers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking to state and local officials about the possible withdrawal over the summer at conferences across the country, the concern was palpable. What to tell voters? How much would it now cost to send and receive ballots if the only options were private carriers and companies? The answer was an increase from an average of around $7.00 per ballot to a range of $30-70.00 per ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would election officials legally be able to consider the time/date stamp on a return ballot packet as a “postmark”? Would electronic return channel utilization increase? What would that mean in terms of cyber security and increased vulnerabilities?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Deputy Post Master General Ronald Stroman and Election Mail Management Specialist Dan Bentley understand that tens of millions of American voters receive their ballot not by a poll worker, but from their postal carrier; and that delivering democracy is one of the USPS’s most critical functions. Thankfully the United States Postal Service (USPS) championed the need to consider election mail in the UPU withdrawal conversation at the very highest level of the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, September 25, at the Extraordinary Congress meeting of the UPU in Geneva, an</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/business/universal-postal-union-withdraw.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agreement was reached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to remedy the disparity in rates to the satisfaction of the United States so that we will remain in the Union.  There will be no interruption in mail delivery globally. Ballots mailed out last week to voters will have the ability to be returned by post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disaster narrowly averted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as details of the agreement unfold it will be important to understand the impact on prices for ballots.  CNBC</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/postal-compromise-close-as-us-pushes-global-mail-reforms-amazon-fedex-impact.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the bulk of the changes would apply to letters and packages, under 4.4 lbs., sent internationally. While a relatively small subset of global commerce, it captures military mail, absentee ballots, retail catalogs, trade journals and light e-commerce purchases.”  While we don’t anticipate that the increase will rival that of the prices private carriers, there may be changes to watch out for. Election officials should follow the</span><a href="https://www.fvap.gov/eo/overview/sending-ballots/preparing-mail"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Federal Voting Assistance Program’s guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on use of the proper postal indicia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important wake-up call—election officials can make absolutely no assumptions when it comes to the infrastructure we rely on to serve the public. We’ve learned the same lesson in regard to cybersecurity (and those jurisdictions who have experienced natural disasters)—but election offices in the best of times are under-resourced compared to other government agencies and departments, and are often expected to perform at a much higher level. Nothing less than perfect is the goal—to the voters, and to the election officials who serve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Alton Dillard of</span><a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Denver Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so eloquently said to me, “easier to be prepared than to get ready.” Moving forward, we must incorporate contingency plans for future scenarios, and leverage this moment to champion the resources needed to ensure we leave no voter behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I breathe a sigh of relief that we did not withdraw from the UPU.  My normal, eternal-optimism was tested, but I am thrilled that ballots will be able to be mailed out to and returned from voters around the globe—along with those very important letters home like those I received decades ago.</span></p>

							<h2>2019 Clearie Awards</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC Opens Submission Period in Fourth Annual Clearies</strong><br />
<em>Celebrating Best Practices in Election Administration</em></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking submissions for its fourth annual national Clearinghouse Awards. Dubbed the “Clearies” for short, the awards provide election offices an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that Act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</p>
<p>The Commission will present awards in the categories of outstanding innovations in elections, improving voting accessibility for voters with disabilities, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. It will also award a special award in 2019 recognizing the most original and creative “I Voted” sticker submitted for consideration. Entries from all sizes of jurisdictions, both large and small, are encouraged to submit their work. All entries must be received by Monday, November 25, 2019. The 2018 winners of the Clearie awards can be found<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-clearinghouse-award-winners-2018/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>“The EAC Clearie Awards celebrate the innovative and creative approaches that election officials use each day in their work to serve voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “These awards are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices that other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
<li>Creating positive Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Election officials utilize innovative and resourceful initiatives on Election Day. We want to hear about these outstanding best practices in EAC’s 2019 competition. By incorporating Election Day into the submission deadline, we are able to capture activities implemented throughout the 2018 and 2019 elections.</p>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>
<p>For more information about this year’s competition, please contact Patrick Leahy at pleahy@eac.gov.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m proud the financial services and the general government bill included a bipartisan amendment providing another $250 million from the administration to help states improve their defenses and shore up their voting systems,” McConnell said according to The Washington Post. “I’m proud to have helped develop this amendment and co-sponsor it in committee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Although at press time he hadn’t had a chance</strong> to meet</span><a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/krebs-says-obrien-will-be-an-ally-in-2020-election-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new National Security Advisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Robert O’Brien, CISA Director Christopher Krebs told Meritalk that he believes O’Brien will take security seriously and will allow CISA a great opportunity to continue improving cybersecurity efforts.</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut</strong>: The Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission vote 4-0 this week to open an investigation and issue subpoenas regarding</span><a href="https://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-bridgeport-seec-vote-20190923-rupukqyaw5dzdhr2cm7zknuaky-story.html?int=lat_digitaladshouse_bx-modal_acquisition-subscriber_ngux_display-ad-interstitial_bx-bonus-story_______"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allegations of absentee ballot irregularities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the recent Democratic primary in Bridgeport won by incumbent Mayor Joe Ganim. <em>Hearst Connecticut Media</em> first reported widespread problems that occurred in the primary, including absentee ballot votes that had been submitted by at least two people who were not Democrats and at least 10 others who voted even though their names did not appear on the state’s list of registered voters. Hearst also reported that at least two convicted felons, who were not eligible to vote, had cast absentee ballots. According to <em>The Hartford Courant</em>, the commission said it would move quickly because the general election is scheduled for Nov. 5, but officials conceded that investigations are time-consuming as investigators track down witnesses and obtain statements about what happened on primary day. In addition to the state-run investigation, three voters have</span><a href="https://www.wshu.org/post/lawsuit-calls-new-mayoral-primary-bridgeport#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed suit in Bridgeport Superior</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Court seeking a new election. “If election officials and people running campaigns are also under the hot seat, and they are aware that people are watching this time and to make sure it happens in a fair way, that we will get fair results and there won’t be issues of interference or absentee ballot abuse anymore,” Prerna Rao, who represents the voters told WSHU. </span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Automatic for the people!</strong> An update this week on two states’ efforts to bring automatic voter registration to their residents. On Tuesday, as part of National Voter Registration Day,</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/secretary-of-state-unveils-automatic-voter-registration.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced that the state had quietly launched its automatic voter registration system earlier this. Preliminary data from the Secretary of State suggests automatic voter registration already is increasing voter registration in Michigan. Through the first two weeks of implementation, Michigan processed 46,527 registration transactions, an average of 4,653 per business day. By comparison, in the first two full weeks of September 2017, Michigan processed 40,022 transactions, or about 4,002 per business day. In</span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/Technical-Philosophical-Issues-Behind-W-Va-Motor-Voter-Delays.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> West Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Donald Kersey, general counsel to Secretary of State Mac Warner, told legislators it will take the office another 14 to 18 months to implement automatic voter registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles, a law enacted in 2016. According to the <em>Charleston Gazette</em>, while Kersey cited technology as the holdup in implementing motor voter, a report from the Secretary of State’s Office provided to legislators also raises philosophical objections to AVR. The report states: “It is important that the Legislature is aware that the vast majority of county clerks are foundationally opposed to AVR. WVSOS supports the clerks’ position that this law has the unintended implication of being practically unnecessary in light of regular registration efforts currently taking place without AVR.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted to approve</strong> a new $1.1 million</span><a href="http://www.startribune.com/1-million-wisconsin-election-security-grant-program-eyed/561144412/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grant program for election security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the <em>Minneapolis Star-Journal</em>, all Wisconsin municipalities and counties could apply for up to $1,200 each to make security upgrades. The money could be used for such things as purchasing new computers, upgrading operating systems and paying for technical support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson recently announced</strong> that Ashiya Brown, an audit and database management expert in the Department of Health and Human Services, will serve as the state’s</span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/19/michigan-secretary-state-election-security-jocelyn-benson/2372772001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first-ever full-time elections security specialist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The security of our elections in Michigan has always been of paramount importance to all of my predecessors, and you&#8217;ve not seen evidence of the types of potential threats that have impacted systems in other states,&#8221; Benson told <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>. &#8220;But that said, the threats to our elections did not end in 2016, and they will continue to evolve, and we must be prepared.” The position will be &#8220;dedicated to coordinating Michigan’s overall election security plan, and working with state and federal partners to assess, train and communicate with our local election officials on election security best practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Not all sticker news is good news unfortunately!</strong> The Lycoming County, Pennsylvania Voter Services office has had to issue a warning to write-in campaigns who are considering handing out stickers to voters so voters can</span><a href="https://www.northcentralpa.com/features/on-the-pulse/sticker-campaigns-discouraged-for-lycoming-county-write-in-candidates/article_1daafbf2-dadd-11e9-b1ea-dff9457cc842.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affix those stickers to the county’s new paper ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Please do not affix stickers, labels, stamps, or other additional material to a ballot to cast a write-in vote,” according to a Voter Services </span><a href="http://www.lyco.org/Portals/1/VoterServices/Documents/Writeins.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “While not prohibited by law, the use of stickers is strongly discouraged because it can prevent individual ballots from being scanned or even damage the precinct scanning equipment.” The Pennsylvania Election Code, passed in 1937, allows for stickers to be placed on ballots, so it cannot be forbidden, however the office has taken a position against stickers because it may cause the machine to jam or the stickers may be removed during the scanning process.  </span></p>

							<h2>Report and Research Summaries</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah’s</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/audit/olag.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Office of the Legislative Auditor General</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released an</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/audit/19_09rpt.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> audit report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on same day voter registration in the state this month. The report, A Performance Audit of Same Day Voter Registration Controls, finds that there is “very little risk for fraudulent voting” due to the requirement that same day registrants cast provisional ballots and additional controls. The audit examined same day registrations in seven sample counties in 2018, identifying a small number of attempted double votes from the same individual (97 ballots of the total 781,204 cast, or 0.012 percent) and highlighting that all these attempted double votes were identified and appropriately rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://idhe.tufts.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Institute for Democracy and Higher Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Tufts University released data and reports on college student voting in the 2018 midterms last week. Summarizing data from the 2018 National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE), the national-level</span><a href="https://idhe.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/DemocracyCounts2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democracy Counts 2018: Increased Student and Institutional Engagement, examines the voting behavior of 10 million students at 1,031 colleges and universities across the country. Key findings include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national student voting rate in 2018 was 40.3 percent.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">College students turned out to vote at double the rate from the last midterms. Across all NSLVE campuses, the average institutional rate in 2018 was 39.1 percent (up nearly 20 percentage points from 19.7 percent in 2014).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women in college continued to vote at the highest rates in 2018, with Black women maintaining their position as the most active voters on campus, and Hispanic women making the most significant gains.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every racial/ethnic group of students had a higher voting rate in 2018 than in 2014.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest voting rate increase across racial/ethnic groups was among Hispanic students, up 22.5 percentage points (from 14 percent in 2014 to 36.5 percent in 2018).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.adcouncil.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ad Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.democracy.works/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democracy Works</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released a</span><a href="https://www.democracy.works/blog/researchresults"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on voter mobilization messaging this week. The report, Driving Voting Turnout in 2020: Research on Effective Messaging Strategies for Each Generation, examines attitudes toward and perceptions of voting among generational age groups and seeks to determine which message frames could be most effective at driving participation in 2020. The study explores five message frames: issues (“I vote because there are important issues that deserve my attention and action”); empowerment (“I matter as a member of society and, therefore, so does my vote”); identity (“I am a voter”); companionship (“I vote because I feel inspired by the people around me who take pride in voting”); and plan/ease (“voting is important, but the logistics of voting can be a hurdle to me”). Key findings include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messages that speak to issues have the broadest appeal across all generations, followed by messages of empowerment and identity.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gen Z (those born after 1996) is excited about voting and highly engaged in voting-related activities like following debates and sharing information about candidates. This generation responds best to issue messaging, with empowerment a close second.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite reports or perceptions that Americans are cynical about the state of politics or democracy today, most greatly value their right to vote and view voting as a civic duty.</span></li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> House Bill 40-70, which left the Joint Committee on Election Laws with a favorable review last week would change the</span><a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/state-lawmakers-vote-to-make-changes-to-election-officials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> way elections officials are appointed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth. Under the current law, the heads of the state’s two major political parties, Republican and Democrat, choose the candidate for that director position. But the bill lawmakers want to pass would give that power to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Governor to decide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oregon:</strong> According to <em>The Oregonian</em>, Secretary of State Bev Clarno’s office is considering asking the Legislature to make the secretary’s office</span><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/09/oregon-secretary-of-state-may-seek-to-make-the-office-nonpartisan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nonpartisan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana:</strong> A June 2020 trial date has been set in a federal lawsuit alleging that Allen County Sheriff David Gladieux</span><a href="https://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/courts/20190920/trial-set-for-june-in--16-inmate-voting-flap"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prevented hundreds of jail inmates from voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2016 election. According to <em>The Journal Gazette</em>, The class-action lawsuit filed in 2017 in U.S. District Court in Fort Wayne claims Gladieux “systematically disenfranchised hundreds of eligible voters held in the Allen County Jail during the 2016 general election by refusing to provide them absentee ballots or alternative access to the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michigan:</strong> Southfield, Michigan City Clerk Sherikia Hawkins has been charged with</span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/23/southfield-clerk-sherikia-hawkins-election/2419363001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six election fraud felonies in connection with the 2018 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>, allegedly altered 193 absentee voter records, but the changes did not have an impact on the election results in the city, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said. According to a Michigan State Police affidavit describing the crime, Oakland County elections officials discovered the issue during a post-election audit of Southfield&#8217;s election results. Hawkins was charged with falsifying returns or records; forgery of a public record; misconduct in office, and three counts of using a computer to commit a felony. The charges carry a maximum penalty of up to 14 years in prison and $30,000 in fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nebraska:</strong> In a seven-page opinion, Attorney General Doug Preston wrote that the appointment of election commissioner’s in three of the state’s largest counties was “</span><a href="https://www.knopnews2.com/content/news/Civic-Nebraska-applauds-AG-opinion-Nebraskas-appointed-election-commissioners-constitutionally-suspect-561283091.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutionally suspect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Election commissioners in three counties – Douglas, Lancaster, and Sarpy – are appointed by the governor, while county commissioners do the appointing in Buffalo, Cass, Hall, and Platte counties. All told, the seven counties make up a majority of the state’s voting population. The attorney general supported Civic Nebraska’s assertion that county election officials and chief deputy election commissioners are county officers, and therefore must be elected and not appointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Superior Court Judge David Anderson has set a bench trial date in the suit that challenges the 2017 law,</span><a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/judge-sets-date-for-sb-election-law-trial/article_b6154404-8c5e-5df7-b829-d09fe2c5d541.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The trail would begin on Dec. 2 and run for about two weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: Sometimes it takes a while for legal news to trickle out. Case in point, in late 2018 a group of current and former Rhode Island students sued the governor and Department of Education arguing that the state</span><a href="https://turnto10.com/i-team/schools-in-crisis/students-demand-stronger-civics-education-in-rhode-island-schools"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violates the students’ constitutional right to an adequate civics education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The state defendants have failed to provide the named plaintiffs and tens of thousands of other students in the state of Rhode Island an education that is adequate to prepare them to function properly as civics participants capable of voting, serving on a jury, understanding economic, social and political systems sufficiently to make informed choices, and to participate effectively in civics activities,&#8221; the complaint reads. The state attempted to have the suit dismissed arguing that it was a local matter, but in July the judge denied the state’s request allowing the case to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utah:</strong> San Juan County will pay</span><a href="http://www.sjrnews.com/view/full_story/27668269/article-San-Juan-County-agrees-to-%242-6-million-settlement-for-attorney-fees-for-seven-year-voting-rights-redistricting-case?instance=home_news_left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $2.6 million in legal fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make a settlement in the massive voting rights lawsuit between the county and the Navajo Nation.  The settlement was approved at a special meeting of the San Juan County Commission on September 24. The $2.6 million is for the Navajo Nation attorney fees.</span></p>

This Windows 10 upgrade is just the latest step being taken by ES&amp;S to enhance election systems prior to the 2020 elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kansas:</strong> Several Kansas counties reported that in early August their</span><a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article235261772.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> websites were hacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including two counties — Brown and Chautauqua — that were hosting primary elections that day. “This incident did not, in any way, interfere with the terms of conducting the election,” Sandy Carter, Brown County’s information technology director said in response to a reporter’s questions. “The election staff was able to continue with the process of the election without interruption.” Several other county elections sites were hacked as well, but those counties were not hosting primaries. All the counties used the same vendor for their sites, Thomas Reuters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oregon:</strong> Jackson County is joining a growing number of localities testing out the use of mobile voting for military and overseas voters.

Tom Wolf announced that more than 4,300 voters had applied for their absentee ballot in the first week of the system. “The success of letting people apply online for an absentee ballot proves that Pennsylvanians want voting to be more accessible,” Wolf said in a press release. “This was an important next step to modernize our elections and I hope it encourages more voters to participate in our democracy.” </span></p>

							<h2>Request for Information</h2>
														<p><strong>IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group Request for Formation</strong></p>
<p>On August 15, 2019, the IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group released a<a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b8fa6c_112b6b0bdc764533816b57dfdb3481b9.pdf"> paper</a> that detailed the commitment of voting systems manufacturers to the development and implementation of corporate Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Programs.</p>
<p>The white paper also noted the value of Crowd-Sourced CVD programs and discussed potential challenges in applying such programs to the elections industry and noted that the SIG would create a Request for Information to solicit feedback on how crowd-sourced CVD programs could be implemented in the elections industry.</p>
<p>The IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group seeks public input, comments and suggestions on the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to manage a crowd-sourced CVD program on systems that are designed to be closed, isolated, and disconnected from the Internet including stand-alone embedded systems?</li>
<li>How to ensure that those engaging in a crowd-sourced CVD program are not nefarious actors seeking sensitive information that can then be used in attacks against the elections’ infrastructure?</li>
<li>How best to ensure the confidentiality of the researcher findings so that vulnerability announcements are disclosed simultaneously with a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments and input should please be sent to cvd@it-isac.org by October 21, 2019</p>
