							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Fresh from the “Kitchen”: FVAP’s New Standardized UOCAVA Data</strong></p>
<p>By Doug Chapin<br />
Fors Marsh Group</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes I have experienced in my move to the<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/knowledge/news-blog/categories/blog/elections/"> Elections Research team</a> at Fors Marsh Group is the extent to which I get a close-up look at key research before it’s released. As I’ve told several people, it’s like the #electiongeek equivalent of transitioning from foodie to sous chef – going from a connoisseur of fine data to someone intimately familiar with the process of preparing and sharing it with the community.</p>
<p>That feeling is especially strong with regard to a new<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/info/news/2019/3/25/innovative-research-on-military-and-overseas-voters"> research note</a> our team developed, in partnership with the<a href="https://fvap.gov"> Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP) and the Council of State Governments’<a href="https://www.csg.org/ovi/"> Overseas Voting Initiative</a> (CSG OVI), looking at how transactional-level data about the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) voting process illuminates key trends in military and overseas voting.</p>
<p>That data, which was produced starting in 2016 as part of FVAP’s efforts to seek new and different ways to assess the UOCAVA voting experience, looks past the summary jurisdiction-level data reported in Section B of the Election Assistance Commission’s Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) to focus on voter-level transactions associated with requesting and returning a ballot. Participating states and jurisdictions (14 in 2016) produce data in accordance with an EAVS Section B (ESB) standard which, when combined with other data about the voting process, allows for rich and fascinating observations about how well (or not) the UOCAVA process works.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, using the 2016 ESB data, the new research note finds that:</p>
<ul>
<li>About two in three ballot requests (65%) were received at least 45 days before the election;</li>
<li>About one in 25 (4%) waited until the week before the election;</li>
<li>Voters who received their ballots earlier were more slightly more likely to return them with less chance of being rejected for inaccuracy or lateness; and, most interesting</li>
<li>Voters who received their ballots by mail were slightly more likely to return them than voters receiving ballots electronically.</li>
<li>You can see the relationship between days until the election and successful return of ballots in the following graphs – first, the likelihood of timely return:</li>
</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3790" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture2-300x239.png" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture2-300x239.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture2.png 764w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Obviously, there are many other factors involved in the likelihood of timely return and acceptance of UOCAVA ballots – including who the affected voters are and why they choose when and how to request and return ballots &#8211; but these data provide an insight into the military and overseas voting process that deserves attention from election officials and advocates alike. It’s consistent with an overall trend in the field to seek greater standardization of election data transfer; an exciting new approach that I know FVAP (as well as those of us at Fors Marsh and CSG OVI) are interested in continuing to explore.</p>
<p>We were honored to be a part of this process – which could not have happened without the support of FVAP’s David Beirne and focus and dedication of CSG’s Jared Marcotte and Fors Marsh’s Colin MacFarlane – and we look forward to learning more as the ESB data pool expands in 2018 and beyond!</p>
<p>Bottom line: this election data is delicious. We’ll make more.</p>

							<h2>2018 HAVA Spending Report</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC Releases First Expenditure Report Detailing Impact of 2018 HAVA Funds</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) today released a Grant Expenditure Report for Fiscal Year 2018 detailing how states and territories have spent $3,628,946,231 in federal funds made available through the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) from the time the legislation was ratified on October 29, 2002 until September 30, 2018. The report also examines how states and territories were able to begin spending an additional $380 million in 2018 HAVA Funds to great effect within just the first six months of those funds being made available to them.</p>
<p>From when the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2018 was signed into law on March 23, 2018 through September 30, 2018, states reported spending 8.1 percent of the $380 million allocated and have outlined plans to significantly increase spending ahead of the 2020 election. Since the initial election reform grants were made in the early 2000s States and territories report total expenditures of $3,400,037,361, or 85 percent of total federal funds and accrued interest, available under Sections 101, 102 and 251 of HAVA.</p>
<p>The EAC worked to efficiently and responsibly award the 2018 HAVA Funds, which were made available less than seven months before the Midterm Elections. To access the funds, eligible states and territories provided a budget and a state narrative outlining plans for how those funds will be used. States could technically begin spending funds once they received their notice of grant award on April 17, 2018. However, most states waited until funds had been transferred to their state election accounts and many states first had to get state legislative approval before spending funds.</p>
<p>“Last year, with the 2018 Midterm Elections fast approaching, election officials across the nation rose to the occasion, spending when appropriate, but also creating long-term multi-faceted plans to invest these vital funds in meaningful election administration improvements,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick.</p>
<p>“The 2018 HAVA Funds have been used to make a tangible difference in the efficiency, security, accessibility and integrity of American elections. Funds supported an array of activities, including innovations in cybersecurity for voter registration systems, procurement of voting equipment, and improvements to post-election audit procedures. That such an impact has already been felt by these funds is a shining example of the benefit of federal-regional partnerships and the tireless work of election administrators across the country. I am pleased the EAC can highlight those efforts in today’s report,” McCormick noted.</p>
<p>The 2018 HAVA Funds were used by states to improve their election systems in a number of innovative ways, including: 2</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong> has spent almost all of its funds already to establish cost-sharing agreements with the counties to replace aging voting equipment. The acquisitions ensure that a paper trail for ballots cast is present in all Arkansas counties and almost 70 percent of Arkansas voters are voting on a new integrated election equipment system. Of the initial $4,724,225 in funds available through federal appropriations, the required state match and interest, as of Sept. 30, 2018, Arkansas had only $44,305 in funds remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong> plans to use its $6,342,979 in 2018 HAVA Funds to enhance technology and security in the state’s election process, including work to improve risk-limiting audits and other audits of election-related systems in 2019 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware</strong> plans to purchase new voting equipment, including a new voting system that has a voter verifiable paper audit trail, an absentee voting system and an Election Management/Voter Registration system that will move elections from the state&#8217;s aging mainframe.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong> helped counties implement multi-factor authentication systems for accessing voting equipment and conducted cybersecurity training for all county officials during the state’s annual election administrators conference. Going forward, the state plans to acquire additional election technology, implement e-poll book vendor network security enhancements, deploy auditable voting systems and perform election night reporting security enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong> conducted cybersecurity training seminars for county auditors and staff and participated in a pilot program for a self-assessment cybersecurity tool. The Secretary of State’s Office also implemented two-factor authentication for access to the statewide voter registration system, purchased additional security protections for the state’s election night reporting system and partnered with the Department of Homeland Security to conduct two tabletop exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts</strong> made network security upgrades to its voter registration system, hired a network security engineer and conducted security training for election staff. The Secretary of State’s Office also plans to use funds to acquire new voting equipment, upgrade the state&#8217;s voter registration system and improve the cybersecurity of its election system.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong> hired a full-time IT security and compliance administrator whose responsibilities include implementing additional security practices to safeguard sensitive data and election systems, and protecting against cyber vulnerabilities. The state also purchased scan tabulation systems that feature ballot image capture and audit capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong> purchased a database platform for its Centralized Voter Registration system that encrypts all the data. The state also purchased a system for the Centralized Voter Registration System that monitors the system, protects it from ransomware, and protects sensitive data in the system. In addition, the state purchased a system that provides real time analysis of security threats, sends alerts if issues are detected and quarantines devices if there is abnormal activity.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong> used a portion of its 2018 HAVA Funds to replace and upgrade voting equipment, implement post-election audits, mitigate cyber vulnerabilities and provide required cybersecurity training for all town and city clerks in the spring of 2018, prior to the 2018 Midterm Elections.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong> spent part of its 2018 HAVA Funds on cybersecurity equipment. The state implemented advanced firewall protection for its centralized election system and installed an advanced threat detection and prevention appliance. The state also acquired a database storage device on the Voter Registration system that has back-up and recovery capabilities. All equipment and software, with the exception of the database storage device, was in place prior to the November 2018 election.</p>
<p><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> has used $399,400 of its funds to purchase new voting equipment and hire additional staff to increase the number of early voting centers across the District of Columbia, to train election officials and to produce voter education materials. The District of Columbia plans to use its remaining 2018 HAVA Funds to acquire additional equipment, increase maintenance and support, hire a full time cybersecurity expert, hire and train additional poll workers, continue voter education and outreach, and invest in technology to improve all aspects of voter registration and election administration.</p>
<p>A brief summary of how each state and territory has used their HAVA funds is available within the <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HAVAGrants18.pdf">FY18 Grant Expenditure Report</a>. States are required to submit another financial report in December 2019.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform is currently investigating three states over their elections practices. There is the ongoing look into what happened in Georgia during the 2018 Midterm elections and now the committee is also looking into Texas’ list maintenance and voter suppression in Ford County, Kansas. In letters sent to<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/03/28/texas-voter-roll-review-under-investigation-us-house-committee/"> Texas</a> officials, Reps. Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, requested documents and communications from the secretary of state and the state’s attorney general related to the review through which state officials tagged almost 100,000 registered voters as suspect voters. The committee is looking into Ford County,<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article228601489.html"> Kansas’</a> decision to move Dodge City’s only polling place about a mile outside the city.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week </h2>
														<p><strong>While more and more localities are considering ranked choice voting</strong>, half of the six Utah cities that were planning to pilot the voting system this year are now<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/03/28/six-utah-cities-signed-up/"> backing out of the pilot</a> citing issues with implementation and voter education. By a 4 to 1 vote, Lehi became the latest city to bail on the pilot. “We’ve trailblazed a lot of different things,” Lehi City Councilman Mike Southwick said at the council meeting according to The Salt Lake Tribune. “I’m just not convinced that this is something that we want to be in front of. I wouldn’t mind having another city being a guinea pig for it.” According to the paper, the only cities remaining in the 2019 pilot are Salem, Payson and Vineyard.</p>
<p><strong>This week, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission released two new language</strong> accessibility resources. The<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/language-access/"> EAC Clearinghouse Brief on Language Accessibility</a> aggregates existing resources on language accessibility and aims to help election officials and other election stakeholders understand language assistance requirements under the Voting Rights Act and how other jurisdictions have approached serving voters with language needs. The<a href="https://www.eac.gov/voters/national-mail-voter-registration-form/"> Five New Translations of the National Voter Registration Form</a> provides the NVRA form in Arabic, French, Hatian Creole, Portuguese and Russian. The new languages reflect the five most populous language communities in the U.S., among those with limited English proficiency and for whom the form was not previously translated.</p>
<p><strong>Summer reading season is almost upon us</strong> and Professor Josh Douglas has election geeks covered with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vote-US-Elections-Change-Future/dp/1633885100/">Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting</a> (Prometheus Books). Douglas tells the surprising and uplifting stories of numerous Democracy Champions who are finding ways to improve our election processes. The book offers the tale of how everyday Americans are working to take back our democracy, one community at a time, by expanding voter eligibility, easing registration rules, making voting more convenient, enhancing accessibility, taking back redistricting, fixing campaign finance, transforming civics education, and more.</p>

Based on interviews with election officials and cybersecurity experts, the report, A Procurement Guide for Better Election Cybersecurity, recommends seven key areas of focus: source code disclosure; robust security incident reporting; patching/software updates; security assessments/audits; regular penetration testing; risk-limiting audit support; and foreign nexus disclosure.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://texascivilrightsproject.org/"> Texas Civil Rights Project</a> released a<a href="https://texascivilrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-Election-Protection-Report.pdf"> report</a> last month that summarized findings from its election protection program monitoring the 2018 midterm elections in Texas. The report finds that voter registration in Texas rose to 79 percent of the citizen voting age population, the highest percentage in the state since 2004. The study finds that turnout in 2018 was 53 percent, representing an increase of 20 percent since the 2014 midterms, the sixth highest turnout increase in the nation. The report documents issues reported to the election protection coalition, including late poll openings, long lines at polling places, polling place problems on college campuses, early registration deadlines, noncompliance with the National Voter Registration Act, provisional ballot problems, voter intimidation, and voting machine malfunctions.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Senate Democrats have introduced their<a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/senate-dems-take-up-hr1-battle-cry"> version of HR 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Gov. Greg Ducey has signed a bill into law that will give voters up to five days after an election to<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2019/04/02/ducey-signs-bill-designed-to-fix-discrepancies-with-early-ballots/"> cure their signatures</a> on mail ballots.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Assemblyman Evan Low (D-San Diego) has introduced a bill to make<a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2019/03/31/california-lawmakers-consider-making-election-day-a-holiday-to-boost-turnout/"> Election Day a state holiday</a> in California. If approved, all state employees would have the day off and schools and state-run colleges and universities would be closed.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> State Sen. Jessie Danielson has introduced a bill that would allow for the use ballot marking software for voters who are<a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/04/01/blind-mail-ballot-bill/"> visually impaired</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Gov. Brian Kemp has signed House Bill 316 into law. Under the new law, the state will purchase new<a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-governor-inks-law-replace-voting-machines/xNXs0ByQAOvtXhd27kJdqO/"> touch-screen voting machines</a> with a paper ballot receipt.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> By a 95-2 vote, the Iowa House voted in favor of a constitutional amendment that would automatically<a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/felon-voting-rights-restoration-takes-first-step-constitutional-amendment-process#stream/0"> restore voting rights</a> to Iowans with felony convictions after they complete their sentence.</p>
<p>According to the Des Moines Register, a proposal that would have prevented the use of state-owned buildings for<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/29/iowa-legislature-house-senate-dog-cat-animal-abuse-eric-giddens-birth-control-vote-university-campus/3299672002/"> satellite voting sites</a> won’t move forward this legislative session. However,<a href="https://qctimes.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/election-law-changes-move-forward/article_01a0af0b-98ab-5396-a6d9-f01fdddde098.html"> additional aspects of the original legislation</a> including uniform poll closing times, and a controversial provision that would unregister college students who don’t commit to living in Iowa after graduation, are still moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Lawmakers reached a deal to<a href="https://www.leavenworthtimes.com/news/20190402/kansas-lawmakers-agree-to-bundle-election-bills/1"> bundle a handful of election-related bills</a>, including one that would require county clerks to attempt to contact voters whose advance ballots lack a valid signature.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Sen. Cheryl Kagan sponsored a bill that would have allowed Montgomery County to amend its system of voting to a ranked choice system in local elections, where voters mark their ballots by ranking the candidates in order of preference. The bill didn’t advance past the Ways and Means Committee, but Kagan pointed to the fact that it passed the county’s delegation as a sign that there is “growing momentum” for the alternative method of voting. “We’ve got time because we’re looking at 2022, and next year’s only 2020,” Kagan told Bethesda Magazine.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, House Bill 569 would repeal the requirement that a<a href="https://www.carrollcountytimes.com/news/local/cc-election-requirements-040519-story.html"> local board of elections employee</a> be a registered voter in Maryland. They would still have to be a registered voter, but could be registered to vote and live in another state.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>U.S. Supreme Court</strong>: The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh-in on a year’s long case out of New York and what is considered<a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Legal-deadline-is-issue-in-Troy-ballot-fraud-13723550.php"> timely for the filing of a lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The 13th Court of Appeals has<a href="http://www.kurv.com/ocana-wins-in-appeals-court-in-mission-mayoral-election-dispute/"> overturned a judge’s ruling</a> that voided the mayoral runoff election in Mission in which city councilman Armando O’cana ousted longtime mayor Norberto Salinas. The O’Cana campaign was accused of manipulating mail-in ballots and bribing voters.</p>
<p>Also in California, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman has ruled that Secretary of State Alex Padilla was not complying fully with the<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Judge-orders-California-to-open-voter-13739912.php"> National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a>. Elections officials were ordered to expand voter registration throughout the state to county welfare offices and student financial aid centers.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> At a meeting with Latin American advocates, Secretary of State David Whitely said that a deal to settle several lawsuits brought by civil rights groups over the state’s voter<a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Texas-settles-lawsuits-over-voter-purge-program-13732909.php"> list maintenance</a> program is about 99 percent done.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> A review of the Luzerne County voter rolls found that quite a few of the county’s voters are well over 100…although they really aren’t. When the county switched<a href="https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/glitch-in-county-voting-system-makes-many-older-than-they-really-are-1.2464340"> a new voter database</a> in 1998, due to some technical issues, some voters birth years had to be listed as 1900. That same switch in database also is why it appears that 105,718 voters all registered on the same day in 1998. The incorrect birthdates should have been caught during routine maintenance of the voter rolls, but neither the voters nor the elections office caught the discrepancy.</p>
