							<h2>In Focus This Week </h2>
														<p><strong>Paper or plastic (sorta)?<br />
</strong>States begin to push alternatives to paper for third party reg groups</p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>In a world of smartphones, tablets and online voter registration (OVR), there is one place where paper still reigns as king — third-party voter registration organizations.</p>
<p>Although some of the leaders in the field, like<a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/"> Rock the Vote</a>, no longer utilize paper applications, many organizations still do for a variety of reasons ranging from the lack of reliable Internet connections at events, mining the non-sensitive registrant data to conduct direct voter contact for get-out-the-vote efforts and in most cases, paper ballot applications are typically faster for registrants to use.</p>
<p>However, according to Jen Tolentino, director of policy and civic tech at Rock the Vote,  there are disadvantages to paper registrations, both for voter registration organizations and election administrators to paper applications, most top of mind is data entry and applicant errors (i.e. accidently skipping fields, difficult to read handwriting, etc.).</p>
<p>Now, a handful of states are coming up with solutions in an effort to streamline the process and maybe save a tree or two in the process.</p>
<p>“In states that take a connected voter registration approach…third parties are able to develop secure, paperless mobile applications that address many of the issues raised by paper and the challenges of OVR for third parties,” Tolentino said.</p>
<p>The states, that include California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Washington and Virginia either provide third-party organizations with unique URLs for online sign-ups or an application programming interface (API).</p>
<ul>
<li>California offers unique URLs and an API to pre-populate data to their website for select groups;</li>
<li>Colorado offers unique URLs and some non-sensitive registration data;</li>
<li>Pennsylvania offers an API and collected e-signatures for third-parties to build applications;</li>
<li>Virginia offers an API for third-parties to build applications and unique URLs; and</li>
<li>Washington offers unique URLs, data pre-population to website, and contact information</li>
</ul>
<p>“We like this service because we are guaranteed to get the application for each voter. And they get registered much faster than relying on the paper forms,” Lori Augino, director of elections for the<a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/"> Washington Secretary of State</a>’s Office, explained. “Plus, the accuracy is improved. Applicants standing outside at an event filling out a paper form are not always as careful. Applicants rarely make mistakes when entering their own information online. It saves money too. Processing online applications over the paper forms saves at least $1.25 per application.”</p>
<p>Augino said Washington’s system was designed to allow for maximum flexibility. They only need to be sure to issue a unique code that is appended to each URL so that the office knows that the registration source was a specific voter registration drive.</p>
<p>According to Kafia Hosh, communications officer with<a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections.aspx"> King County Elections</a>, the reaction from third-party groups has been positive, especially among the groups that have websites and social media.</p>
<p>“We are aware of 10 organizations that used the URL program in 2018,” Hosh explained. “Through our<a href="https://kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/education-and-outreach/voter-education-fund.aspx"> Voter Education Fund</a>, we inform community-based organizations about the URL program. In 2018, nine of these organizations used the URL program. And one organization that wasn’t a part of the Voter Education Fund also used the program.”</p>
<p>Hosh added that were some organizations that weren’t interested in using the URL program, stating that the communities they serve do not use online methods.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/"> California, the secretary of state’s office</a> not only provides unique URLs to outside third-party registration groups, they also provide those unique URLs to other governmental agencies. Colleges and universities throughout the state also used the unique URLs and are then able to participate the Ballot Bowl Voter Registration Competition.</p>
<p>For governmental agencies, the unique URLs allows the office to capture the number of online registrations submitted that were referred to the secretary of state from the outside agency. This allows for the secretary of state to report<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra"> NVRA</a> statistics to the legislature.</p>
<p>“In 2018, five counties adopted the<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act/"> Voter’s Choice Act</a>, moving to a vote center based election model. Every vote center was required to provide ‘same-day’ voter registration (known as conditional voter registration in state election law),” explained Sam Mahood, press secretary for the secretary of state’s office. “These counties used unique URLs to track online voter registrations that occurred at vote centers.”</p>
<p><strong>API<br />
</strong>According to Tolentino, while OVR is now widely available, making the process easier for voters to register themselves, third-party voter registration efforts often struggle to effectively leverage state websites. This leads to either a continued reliance on paper applications in the field or some voters beginning the process but never becoming fully registered from digital efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock the Vote is leading the effort to address the challenges facing voter registration for third parties, promoting the adoption of a secure, connected voter registration approach that would allow approved third parties to &#8220;drop off&#8221; complete, electronic voter registration applications.&#8221; Tolentino said.</p>
<p>This approach has already been implemented in Pennsylvania and Virginia and there is a common data format available for the electronic transfer of voter registration records. Tolentino said a connected voter registration approach would result in the following benefits:</p>
<p>Enable approved third-parties to develop seamless technology to securely register voters online and in the field, eliminating the majority of paper applications and the need for a constant internet connection;</p>
<p>Facilitate election administrators’ ability to easily audit voter registration applications, immediately identifying issues with specific applications and third-party groups;</p>
<ul>
<li>Take advantage of<a href="https://www.nist.gov/"> NIST</a>’s common data format for Voter Records Interchange to increase scalability and national adoption;</li>
<li>Eliminate duplicative data entry by third-party groups, local election administrators, and voters; and</li>
<li>Ensure all voter registration applications are complete and submitted in the requested format.</li>
</ul>
<p>California also offers an API, but at this time, only for Rock the Vote and one other third-party registration group. Washington is gearing up to launch its own API, VoteWA on May 28.</p>
<p>“The API allows for more fields to be prepopulated for the user,” Augino explained “For example, if a voter registration drive already has the applicant’s name and date of birth, they can prepopulate those fields for them so that they don’t have to re-enter that information. It’s even more user friendly for the voter. The URL for the API will be different because we will be using a different application and branding for our new voter tools.”</p>
<p>Obviously the use of unique URLs and APIs for third-party groups is still in the early stages and some states, while interested, are moving cautiously about the challenges they may face in implementation.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say that the secretary is skeptical about providing unique URLs to 3rd party OVR groups, just that he’s realistic about the challenges we could face in implementation,” explained Ben Petok, director of communications for the<a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/"> Minnesota secretary of state’s office</a>. “Not only would we need to programming to collect the information on who uses the URL, but would almost certainly need a change in state law to accommodate the data practice issues around use of unique URLs for this purpose.”</p>
<p>Tolentino noted that using unique URLs/APIs would actually help states eliminate problems with late and incorrect registration forms that some states, like Tennessee, are trying to correct legislatively.</p>
<p>Under<a href="https://www.nashvillepublicradio.org/post/tennessee-moves-closer-imposing-criminal-penalties-voter-registration-drives#stream/0"> HB1079/SB971</a> fines of up to $10,000 dollars would be imposed on third-party organizations that pay people to conduct registration drives, and turn in more than 500 incomplete forms. It would also require groups to submit the forms within 10 days.</p>
<p>“The bill in Tennessee would place a huge burden on many voter registration organizations and significantly thwart all on-the-ground efforts,” Tolentino said. “If Tennessee is committed to ensuring they only receive complete and accurate voter registration forms, there are technical enhancements the state could make without punishing voter registration groups who are working tirelessly to reach all voters across the state.”</p>

							<h2>2020 Candidates on Election Issues</h2>
														<p>Sen. Corey Booker (D-New Jersey) and a presidential candidate proposed a<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/439392-booker-calls-for-automatic-voter-registration-federal-election-day-holiday"> “new Voting Rights Act,”</a> while speaking at an event in Atlanta. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the new VRA would focus on a three-part goal of protecting voting rights, expanding voting access and making it easier to vote. Booker’s proposal would establish automatic registration as well as the expansion of voting by mail, early voting and same-day voter registration.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years, the right to vote for millions of Americans — disproportionately in communities of color —has been under assault,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;It is time for a new Voting Rights Act to finally put an end to systematic attempts to limit access to the ballot box and strip citizens of their constitutionally guaranteed right to vote.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week </h2>
														<p><strong>A U.S. House elections committee held a hearing</strong> about<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/tribes-denounce-north-dakota-id-law-in-congressional-hearing"> Native American voting rights</a> on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota this week. Witnesses at the hearing testified that Native American voters face poor access to polling sites, discrimination by poll workers and unfair ID requirements. “There continues to be barriers — interpersonal and systemic — at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across the state,” said activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa &amp; Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota according to The Associated Press. Much of the hearing focused on North Dakota’s new ID law which requires a “provable” street address, something many who live on Reservations don’t have. Some activists took issue with so much of the focus being on the North Dakota ID issue. “There are voter suppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren’t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it just so happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the national stage,” Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon testified.</p>
<p><strong>While litigation over bilingual ballots is still pending</strong>, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has asked Secretary of State Laurel Lee to adopt<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/2019/04/11/desantis-wants-secretary-of-state-to-ensure-access-to-spanish-language-ballots/"> rules that would standardize the requirements for offering bilingual ballots</a> in all 67 of the state’s counties. Currently, according to the Tampa Bay Times, the 46 counties that offer bilingual ballots in the Sunshine State all have different rules. “It is critically important that Spanish-speaking Floridians are able to exercise their right to vote without any language barriers,” DeSantis said in a statement. “Florida has a significant Spanish-speaking population and our state is home to many Puerto Ricans who moved here after the devastation of Hurricane Maria.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Election officials have told <em>The Register-Herald</em> that the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles</strong> has been<a href="https://www.register-herald.com/news/state_region/wv-division-of-motor-vehicles-is-losing-voter-registrations/article_dbf5b5c0-9b5d-5461-b841-947b5d34e5e5.html"> losing voter registrations</a>, but it’s unclear exactly how many and for how long this has been happening. Donald Kersey, the general counsel for the secretary of state’s office said that in a five-day test period in January that 37 registered to vote with the DMV, but those registrations did not reach the secretary of state’s office. Kersey told the paper it appears to be “a systematic error,” and he noted that during early voting before the 2018 general election, dozens of people said they had registered at local DMVs to vote, but the Secretary of State’s office had no record of it. “That’s a terrible experience, and if it’s your first time, you might not want to vote again because you had a bad experience,” he told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>The City of Atlanta recently opened a new green space</strong> that honors the memory of someone people refer to as the “<a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/atlanta-dedicates-new-park-to-godmother-of-voter-registration/85-f3aee2e7-9d5e-4965-89de-bde6e4aeebe1">Godmother of Voter Registration</a>.” The Department of Parks and Recreation dedicated the &#8220;Ella Mae Wade Brayboy Memorial Park&#8221; at the intersection of Burbank and Lena Streets near the Washington Park neighborhood in the city&#8217;s west side. According to WATL, Brayboy was one of the first black deputy registrars in Atlanta in 1964, where she helped restructure voter registration so that it woven into the community &#8211; through the Atlanta Public Library System. Over the course of her lifetime, historians say she helped register more than 20,000 black voters.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/"> Brennan Center</a> released a<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/avr-impact-state-voter-registration"> report</a> on automatic voter registration (AVR) last week. The report, AVR Impact on State Voter Registration, highlights that 15 states and the District of Columbia have enacted AVR as of March 2019, reflecting swift adoption of the policy since Oregon first passed the reform in 2014. The report documents the variations of AVR thus far adopted in implementing states, including where voter registration opt-out decisions take place (e.g. during a “front-end” point-of-service transaction or through a “back-end” post-transaction mailer) and the state agencies involved, typically the motor vehicle licensing agency.</p>
<p>Comparing registration rate increases in AVR-implementing jurisdictions to demographically similar non-implementing jurisdictions, the study concludes that AVR increased the number of registrants in AVR-implementing jurisdictions, ranging from 9 to 94 percent. According to the study, AVR-implementing jurisdictions experienced the following registration rate increases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alaska &#8211; 33.7%</li>
<li>California &#8211; 26.8%</li>
<li>Colorado &#8211; 16%</li>
<li>District of Columbia &#8211; 9.4%</li>
<li>Georgia &#8211; 93.7%</li>
<li>Oregon &#8211; 15.9%</li>
<li>Rhode Island &#8211; 47.4%</li>
<li>Vermont &#8211; 60.2%</li>

<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> A judge has ordered a<a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/court-orders-new-election-for-parts-of-parkville/27133194"> new election</a> for parts of Parkville after some voters were given the wrong ballots on Election Day. The new vote will take place on May 21.</p>

The items requested in the subpoena include copies of all proposals received, the names of all committee members who scored them, and copies of those evaluations.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: Judge Melissa E. Darigan has ruled that Watchdog RI does not have legal standing to appeal the state board of elections’ denial of a<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190414/400-fee-to-gain-ri-public-records-is-upheld-by-judge"> fee waiver</a>—$400—to for a public records request.</p>
