							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>What’s your brand?</strong><br />
<em>Basic brand identities and experiences are important for elections offices</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>The interlocking red and gold circles of MasterCard. Nike’s swoosh. McDonald’s golden arches.</p>
<p>Those are easily identifiable brands, but what about for state and local elections offices? Is your brand identifiable to voters in your jurisdiction? When a letter from your elections office arrives in the mail is it immediately identifiable to a voter as coming from the elections office?</p>
<p>Branding, which includes everything from a logo to fonts to certain color schemes to tone of voice can be as important for government agencies as it is for commercial businesses.</p>
<p>“Through consistency, you build familiarity and trust with what you offer,” explained Drew Davies, owner/designer at<a href="https://oxidedesign.com/"> Oxide Design Co</a>. which has worked with folks like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and The Pew Charitable Trusts. “While an elections office doesn’t have ‘competitors’ in the same way that a toy store may, you certainly want the general population to be able to immediately recognize you — and even have positive associations with your office.”</p>
<p>Davies said it’s important to have a set of basic brand identity guidelines, a brand guide, that contains all approved versions of the logo, simple instructions on how the logo should and should not be used, one or two specified brand typeface(s), and up to three specified brand colors. If there are other brand elements in place that should be used consistently, they should also be included —  a vision/mission statement, a tagline, even layout templates for recurring print pieces and/or digital marketing.</p>
<p>“This brand guide builds valuable consistency by keeping everyone playing by the same set of rules,” Davies said. “It doesn’t have to be ‘professionally designed’ or particularly long. It just has to list the brand identity elements and explain the rules clearly and simply.”</p>
<p>Davies said elections offices don’t necessarily need to hire branding firms to come up with logos and a complete brand. He said the simplest way to proceed is to create a simple logotype of the agency’s name. Think companies Sony, Progressive and The New York Times.</p>
<p>For a quick way to make a logotype recognizable, think about meaningful line breaks or visual emphasis on the key words in the name. Then, instead of re-typing the name in any given circumstance, always use the official logotype file. This type of logo, along with a clear and concise brand guide, can be created by anyone in an elections office — even if they don’t have any formal design training.</p>
<p>Davies said he regularly counsels clients that a bad logo, used consistently, is infinitely more valuable than even the best logo used inconsistently.</p>
<p>“Especially as a government agency, your job isn’t to differentiate yourself from competitors. It’s to consistently use a brand identity that conveys stability, trustworthiness, clarity, and simplicity,” Davies said. “People should be able to recognize you immediately, and trust that communications from you come from an official source.”</p>
<p>Consistent use of fonts and colors is also important for branding. Fonts matter, not just on ballots, but in all elections materials.</p>
<p>“In our research, for most of the materials produced by an elections office — forms, ballots, and the like — people read sans serif typefaces more easily and accurately,” Davies said.</p>
<p>“Sans serif” typefaces are the ones without the extra little bumps, or feet, on them; commonly used examples are Helvetica, Arial, and Roboto.</p>
<p>“We suggest selecting a single sans serif typeface and using only that font whenever possible. Using a single typeface throughout all of your materials will help to underscore the consistency and trustworthiness of your office,” he added.</p>
<p>Having unique or memorable colors isn’t particularly important for government agencies such as elections offices, Davies said, but it is notably more valuable to establish a color or two that convey trustworthiness and ease of use, and use them with draconian consistency.</p>
<p>“As I see it, there’s no reason those colors couldn’t be red and blue — after all, what’s more American than elections?” Davies added.</p>
<p>In addition to consistent use of logo, fonts and colors, it is also important to have a consistent voice.</p>
<p>“When an election office develops content for a website, or messaging for social media, or develops a paper notice, the writer is making word choices that convey the personality of the office,” explained Dana Chisnell, co-director of the<a href="https://civicdesign.org/"> Center for Civic Design</a> [a Democracy Fund grantee] “Is it official or officious? Is it friendly or causal? What does the voice and tone assume about the reader?”</p>
<p>Chisnell said every office should develop a style guide. A simple one would answer the question, “If this text were being said by a person, what would that person be like? What tone would they take?”</p>
<p>“…[I]t’s not only the logo. It’s how you present yourself to the world. Is it a unified personality? Or does everyone do what they want?” Chisnell said.</p>
<p><strong>Brand Identity vs. Brand Experience<br />
</strong>Matthew Quint, director,<a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/globalbrands/"> Center on Global Brand Leadership</a> at the Columbia Business School said that while brand identity is important for elections officials brand experience may actually ultimately be more important.</p>
<p>Quint said a strong, consistent logo, font, color scheme are important to convey a county elections office’s brand, but ultimately what it’s like when a voter shows up at their polling place may have a greater impact. Brand identity vs. brand experience.</p>
<p>“What is it like when I show up at my polling to vote. Is it well organized. Is it clear what’s on the ballot. Are the instructions for how to vote clear. Is the room too warm/cold. Are the people friendly?” Quint said.</p>
<p>Quint, who grew up visiting polling places in New York with his mother who was volunteer for the League of Women Voters said that Election Day experience is so important to convey the confidence and trustworthiness that elections officials want to.</p>
<p>Relying on voters and volunteers for help and feedback is crucial to a brand experience Quint said noting that electoral systems are viewed by people as a community event so use that to bolster an elections office brand experience.</p>
<p>“Think about the experience,” Quit said. “Imagine yourself as a voter. What’s it like for you? Get voters and volunteers to provide feedback about what worked and what could be done better.”</p>
<p>(<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This week’s story marks the third piece in our series on the important role that communications play in an elections office. Previously we’ve heard from Alton Dillard of the Denver County Clerk and Recorder’s Office on<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/02-21/"> Communications 101</a> and from Kurt Sampsel of the Center for Technology and Civic Life on  <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/02-28/">What makes an effective elections website</a>.

							<h2>VVSG Public Comment Period</h2>
														<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) four sitting Commissioners unanimously voted to publish the proposed<a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf?fbclid=IwAR33Zx8yw13uW7T6uoJr8wZwYFOswqIC7tdbjHOfavjGuZATR366h28H-48"> Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 (VVSG) Principles and Guidelines</a> in the<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/"> Federal Register</a> for a 90 day public comment period, after which comments and feedback on the proposed document will be compiled and presented to the Commissioners for discussion and consideration.</p>
<p>“Today’s unanimous vote demonstrates the Commissioners’ shared commitment to taking this next important step in consideration of the proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines. The EAC looks forward to holding hearings on these Principles and Guidelines soon and we encourage the public to provide their feedback on the proposed guidelines,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks, who joined Vice Chair Christy McCormick, Commissioner Ben Hovland and Commissioner Donald Palmer in supporting the measure.</p>
<p>The proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines will be published in the Federal Register in accordance with sections 222(a)(1) and 222(d) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. They will appear in the Federal Register for a period of 90 days. Separately, upon the completion of the VVSG 2.0’s accompanying Requirements developed by NIST and the EAC, those accompanying Requirements will also be subject to public review and comment, including distribution to the EAC’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), Standards Board and Board of Advisors. This review and comment period will take place prior to consideration and implementation by the Commission.</p>
<p>VVSG are a set of Principles, Guidelines and Requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems meet required standards. Some factors examined under these tests include functionality, accessibility, accuracy, auditability and security capabilities.</p>
<p>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandates that EAC develop and maintain these requirements as well as testing and certifying voting systems. On December 13, 2005, the EAC unanimously adopted the 2005 VVSG, which significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities for individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. The 2005 guidelines updated and augmented the 2002 Voting System Standards, as required by HAVA, to address advancements in election practices and computer technologies. These guidelines were again updated by the EAC’s Commissioners on March 31, 2015. These guidelines are voluntary. States may decide to adopt them entirely or in part prior to the effective date.</p>
<p>The structure of the new VVSG reflects modifications proposed by the election community, EAC, NIST and the TGDC, which is comprised of election officials, voting system manufacturers, disability experts, cyber security experts, technology experts, and other key election stakeholders. The new guidelines are a high level set of principles that will be supplemented by accompanying documents that detail specific requirements for how systems can meet the new guidelines and obtain certification. The supplemental documents will also detail assertions for how the accredited test laboratories will validate that a system complies with those requirements.</p>
<p>Last Spring, the EAC convened its advisory boards to review and comment on the adoption of the newest version of the voluntary guidelines, VVSG 2.0. Both Boards recommended that the EAC adopt VVSG 2.0. Today’s unanimous Commissioner vote occurred less than two weeks after a quorum of Commissioners was restored at the EAC.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>This week, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) announced the creation</strong> of an<a href="https://www.upmatters.com/news/local-news/secretary-benson-forms-election-security-commission/1864238415"> Election Security Commission</a> that will recommend reforms and strategies to secure Michigan’s elections. The commission includes 18 local and national experts on cybersecurity and election security with some familiar national-level names like former Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams, Matt Masterson from CISA, Jennifer Morrell a risk limiting audit consultant and Josh Franklin, formerly of NIST. The commission will be co-chaired by David Becker of the Center for Election Innovation and Research and J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan. “The security of our elections is critical to the security of our democracy,” Benson said. “I am grateful that many of our nation’s top election security experts have joined forces with our local election officials to develop a plan that will ensure Michigan’s elections are secured against all known and emerging threats.” The commission’s first meeting will be held in April and will deliver a set of recommendations to the secretary of state’s office by the end of 2019. The commission is funded through a HAVA 2 grant.</p>

Last week, in a scathing letter, Secretary of State Connie Lawson<a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-slams-demands-resignation-of-porter-election-officials-in-voting/article_c7a2958e-c653-5feb-bb57-ed9cff111fe2.html"> chastised the county elections officials</a> for allowing personal conflicts to impact the administration of the election. &#8220;Even though each was aware of potential problems leading up to the election, personality conflicts, vindictive behavior and personal pride prevented any action from being taken,&#8221; Lawson wrote in her letter according to the Northwest Times. &#8220;Not only did these individuals put a heavy burden on dedicated employees within county government who were attempting to execute their responsibilities properly, they failed to meet the expectations and needs of Porter County voters.&#8221; Lawson’s letter accompanied an audit of the elections office and included<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-porter-election-report-friday-st-0316-story.html"> 18 recommendations for improving the process</a> moving forward. “I was pleasantly surprised by some of these because we actually are on the same track,” Clerk Jessica Bailey said. This week, Election Board President JJ Stankiewicz was<a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/update-election-official-resigns-amid-calls-from-local-state-officials/article_648934d5-1736-5f42-9e25-9ebe98ef8c41.html"> forced to resign</a> after video surfaced of Stankiewicz in a shouting match with Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>Hanover, Massachusetts Town Clerk Catherine Harder-Berneir is taking the unusual step</strong> of<a href="https://hanover.wickedlocal.com/news/20190320/stronghanover-town-clerk-announces-temporary-town-clerksstrong"> recusing herself from conducting the upcoming May election</a> because she is on the ballot seeking re-election. Instead, she has enlisted the help of Narice Casper, Marshfield town clerk and Andrew Dowd, Northborough town clerk to serve as temporary clerks on Election Day. “As the elected town clerk of Hanover, I am running for re-election in 2019, and have already qualified for the ballot. Despite the fact that there is an exemption in the law that permits town clerks to perform election-related functions, I understand that I will be a walking campaign sign on Election Day, and that my presence inside the polls on Election Day could be construed by some to be a conflict of interest. Therefore, I will enter the polls briefly during the day only to vote, as any other resident of the town would. Otherwise, I will remain outside the 150-foot no-electioneering line all morning, afternoon, and evening.”</p>
<p><strong>What if you held an election and people showed up to vote</strong>, but there was no one for them vote for on the ballot? That was the case this week in the small village of Poland in New York. No one stepped up to run for the village mayor’s position, but the village held the election anyway. Whoever<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/business/2019/03/ford-reshuffles-investment-plan-in-michigan-to-spend-900m-create-900-jobs.html"> gets the most write-in votes will ultimately win</a> the $2,5000-per year job. “It sounds very rare. Very weird,” said Onondaga County Board of Elections Commissioner Michele Sardo. While it is rare, John Conklin, spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections told <em>Syracuse.com</em> that it has happened before in other villages.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Updates</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/">Nonprofit VOTE</a> and the<a href="http://www.electproject.org/"> U.S. Elections Project</a> released a<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/america-goes-to-the-polls-2018/"> report on turnout in the 2018 midterm elections</a> this week. The report, America Goes to the Polls: Voter Turnout and Election Policy in the 50 States, finds that voter turnout was 50.3 percent in 2018, the highest midterm turnout since 1914 and the largest increase from a previous midterm in U.S. history. The report highlights that every state except Alaska and Louisiana saw an increase in midterm turnout when compared to 2014. Despite the record turnout nationwide, the study finds that the vast differences in turnout was largely driven by election-related policies and explores the turnout variation among states with same-day registration, vote-by-mail, automatic voter registration, early voter registration deadlines, and other policies.</p>

The report, The Internet’s Challenge to Democracy: Framing the Problem and Assessing Reforms, explores problems exacerbated by internet freedom, including disinformation, hate speech, incitement, and foreign interference in elections, and offers a framework for better understanding such problems and assessing potential reforms.</p>
