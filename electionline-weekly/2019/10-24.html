							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election audits are here to stay</strong><br />
<em>What’s next for the Election Validation Project</em></p>
<p>By Jennifer Morrell<br />
The Democracy Fund</p>
<p>Eighteen months ago, the<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/increasing-trust-in-elections-democracy-funds-election-validation-project"> Election Validation Project</a> began with the idea that guidelines with simplified information and checklists could assist election officials in implementing risk-limiting audits (RLAs). Well, that vision has seen a fair amount of success! During that year and a half, we have: (1) seen more states adopt RLAs as their method for conducting a post-election tabulation audit, (2) dozens of RLA pilots have taken place, and (3) a<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/publications/knowing-its-right"> two-part guide</a> to risk-limiting audits was published with over a thousand copies distributed and its contents presented to election officials at state and national conferences throughout the year. In addition,<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/courses/post-election-audits"> professional development courses</a>, including two videos to help election officials communicate the value of<a href="https://vimeo.com/355338057"> post-election audits</a> and the<a href="https://vimeo.com/356476339"> three methods for conducting an RLA</a>, were developed in collaboration with the<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/"> Center for Technology and Civic Life</a>.</p>
<p>Auditing how votes are tabulated plays an essential role in validating the outcome of an election, but it is only one of several elements in the election system that should be examined. Turning to 2020, the Election Validation Project (EVP) wants to continue to draw on the expertise and knowledge of others who are researching and designing tools to help foster an audit-centric election culture. Some of that collaboration is beginning to take shape and will result in additional “Knowing It’s Right” guides for 2020.</p>
<p>One of the things I love most about election audits is that it provides a formal way for local election officials to validate the integrity of an election. While some of these concepts may take years to perfect, there are things election officials can start thinking about and doing now to put them squarely on the path towards robust election audits. Highlighted here is a brief description of future election audits that the EVP plans to support. My hope is that we can broaden the circles of collaboration to include state and local election officials willing to pilot, inform guidelines, and act as mentors to others working to improve the way they administer and validate their elections.</p>
<p><strong>1. Ballot Reconciliation and Chain of Custody Audits:</strong> On its face, ballot accounting is a relatively simple concept. It is reconciling the total number of ballots issued to the total number of ballots cast. Many election offices do an exceptional job of ensuring this happens correctly after each election, while some struggle to get poll workers to complete the forms accurately and completely. Honestly, some find it all a bit overwhelming and superfluous to the many tasks that need to be completed at the end of a long election day. Similarly, the chain of custody logs provides a record of who had possession of voting equipment, ballots, ballot boxes, etcetera, from the time those items left the election office until they are returned to the custody of the election official.</p>
<p>Ballot accounting audits, ballot reconciliation and chain of custody, are the foundation for all post-election tabulation audits and are vital to the integrity of your election. The next installment of the “<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/publications/knowing-its-right">Knowing It’s Right</a>” series is a guide focused on designing a ballot accounting process that can be audited after every election. The biggest challenge is creating forms that are easy for poll workers and staff to understand and complete accurately. An initial assessment of your ballot accounting practice can begin during your next post-election feedback session.</p>
<ul>
<li>Document how many reconciliation forms or chain of custody logs came back filled out incorrectly or incompletely.</li>
<li>Use that information to inform future changes to forms, instructions, and training.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the forms are completed and collected, it&#8217;s easy to assume your work is done. One of the most overlooked areas I&#8217;ve seen when consulting with election officials on risk-limiting audits is a formal assessment or audit of the ballot accounting records. Some questions to ask when you start thinking about ballot accounting from an audit perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has someone been assigned to review each reconciliation form to ensure ballots issued equals ballots cast?</li>
<li>Has someone been assigned to review the seal numbers, signatures, and dates on all chain of custody logs?</li>
<li>If significant issues or reconciliation problems are noticed, how are they documented and to whose attention do you bring them?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Resource Allocation Audits:</strong> Imagine a tool that you can customize to your method of voting (by-mail, early, in-person, vote centers, etc.) that uses a voter’s historic behavior of where they voted and the day and time, to help determine the number of polling locations, check-in stations, poll workers, and voting equipment you need in order to minimize wait times. Now imagine if that same tool could help you construct a 3D model of your polling location to visually examine the layout of equipment and traffic flows in order to spot potential bottlenecks that could slow down the voter’s time in the system.</p>
<p>And what if you could use that tool to perform an audit by taking data from your election and comparing it to the locations, supplies, people, and equipment that were actually deployed to determine how well the demand was met and where any gaps might be? This is what we are calling a resource allocation audit.</p>
<p>For me, this idea started with the work done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology as part of the<a href="http://web.mit.edu/vtp/"> VTP Toolkit</a>. Now, a team of engineers from the University of Rhode Island led by<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/rhode-island/2019/10/15/long-wait-polls-some-university-rhode-island-students-want-build-app-solve-that-problem/AKMyZQAoWkJcmdmvDeG90H/story.html?event=event25"> Gretchen Macht</a> wants to turn this idea into a universal resource planning and auditing tool. Collaborating on the project is<a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/administrative-decision-making-barriers-to-political-participation-39a74b80e7cf"> Bridgett King</a> from Auburn University, who is also using simulation and visualization software to understand how inputs affect in-person voting. What can you do right now?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure vote history data accurately reflects when, where, and how voters voted. This means collecting the date, time, and place for in-person voting and the date and way mail-ballots are received (dropbox or USPS).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Voter Database Audits:</strong> The voter databases maintained by state and local election jurisdictions are as critical to the integrity of our elections as the voting equipment that ballots are cast and counted on. Election officials often refer to it as the voter registration database or VRDB, despite the fact that it usually contains much more than the information used to register a voter.</p>
<p>Election officials across the country are working to<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/securing-voter-registration-systems.aspx"> secure the voter registration system</a> from external threats, and many have developed contingency plans should they lose access to the database or if the data becomes compromised in some way. But any false changes, additions, or deletions, whether from human error or fraudulent activity, could sow confusion and frustration amongst voters and lead to distrust in the outcome of an election. Routine audits, systematic scans of the VRDB to check for anomalous changes and detect duplicate records provides many benefits.</p>
<p>It requires tracking the voter records over a period of time to understand what routine list maintenance looks like in order to detect unusual activity such as a large number of records being deleted or added or changes to party affiliation or addresses that are confined to a particular demographic, party or geographic area. These anomalies would then be flagged for further investigation.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this is a<a href="https://turnout.rocks/our-blog/exploring-voter-registration-auditing-methods/"> complex and challenging problem</a> to solve. The data is constantly changing and being updated. It will require leveraging computing technologies developed around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics. As promising as these technologies might be, they will not solve all of the challenges. Varying list maintenance practices and differences in data quality from one state to another presents a significant hurdle. So, this endeavor will not be complete without a conversation about standards and the common data format.</p>
<p>Stepping up to the challenge is<a href="http://vote.caltech.edu/working-papers/134"> research</a> being done by a team at the<a href="https://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2019/05/13/how-to-avoid-an-election-meltdown-in-2020-improve-voter-registration-database-security-and-monitoring/"> California Institute of Technology</a> in partnership election officials in<a href="https://monitoringtheelection.us/"> California and Oregon</a>. In addition, the non-profit organization Protect Democracy is exploring how this research could be incorporated into a software application. Protect Democracy&#8217;s <a href="https://voteshield.us/">VoteShield</a> software is freely available to state and local election administrators in 19 states. The tool was <a href="https://www.govtech.com/security/Nonprofits-Free-App-Flags-Suspicious-Changes-to-Voter-Rolls.html">used by Iowa during the 2018 election</a>, and flags anomalous changes to voter records using publicly available data.</p>
<p>As this research, tools, and associated best practices evolve, election officials can participate by taking part in pilot projects. What else can you do now?</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the discussion about what VRDB transactions should be monitored in your state.</li>
<li>Which data fields would have the most impact on your voters and your election process if they were compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, good list maintenance practices are the foundation of VRDB audits. ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center) plays a critical role in helping states meet the challenge of maintaining accurate voter registration records.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you one of the 29 states that is a member of<a href="https://ericstates.org/"> ERIC</a>?</li>
<li>If not, now is an excellent time to collaborate with officials in your state on a path to membership.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Geospatial Audits:</strong> In some ways, geospatial audits go hand-in-hand with VRDB audits, but their visual, geometric properties make them unique. Geospatial audits focus on getting the right ballot to the right voter by examining the precinct and district assignments identified for each voter.</p>
<p>The starting point for this type of audit begins with augmenting street range libraries and written definitions of voting districts with a geographic information system (GIS) that allows election officials to “pin” the location of a voter to a map. This type of addressing allows election officials to layer district boundary maps to ensure boundaries are correctly identified and voters are placed in their correct location. This work is especially important after significant changes are made to boundary maps, like redistricting. Some election offices are lucky enough to have a GIS system already integrated into their VRDB.</p>
<ul>
<li>If that is not the case for your office or your state, consider integrating a GIS system as a priority in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research on this type of audit has been done by<a href="https://esra.wisc.edu/papers/AM.pdf"> Michael McDonald and Brian Amos</a> from the University of Florida and geospatial audits are included as one of the five best practices in the<a href="http://elections.nsgic.org/"> NSGIC Geo-Enabled Elections</a> project, led by Jamie Chesser. Two things you can do right now:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/gis-election/">Start a conversation</a> in your state about GIS in elections</li>
<li>Read the recently released “<a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/BestPractices-ES.pdf">Best Practices for Geo-Enabling Elections</a>.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Senate Republicans have blocked a bill</strong>—the<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/466985-senate-republicans-block-two-election-security-bills"> Election Security Act</a>—that would have given states $1 billion for election security efforts and require backup paper ballots.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, Sen. Joe Kennedy (R-Louisiana) blocked the passage of the bill saying the level of funding was excessive given the $380 million appropriated last year.</p>
<p>“We had no problems in 2018,” Kennedy said, referring to last year&#8217;s midterm elections. “If I thought for a second that our voting system was in jeopardy, I would be joining with my good friend, the senator. But I’m not much for just spending taxpayer money with a $22 trillion deficit just to be spent.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah</strong> are expressing concerns that San Juan County may have<a href="https://www.kuer.org/post/san-juan-county-may-have-failed-notify-navajo-residents-about-election-aclu-says#stream/0"> failed to adequately notify Navajo voters</a> about an upcoming special election on November 5. Niki Venugopal, a voting outreach coordinator for the ACLU of Utah told KUER that it appears the county may be violating a legal settlement it made last year with the ACLU. “There was a lot of general confusion,” she said. “It appears some people received their ballots in the mail really early,” she said, “And it seems like the translated materials weren’t available at the time they received them.”</p>
<p><strong>After a successful launch of vote centers</strong> during the May primary, officials in Harris County are working to make sure the higher turnout general election goes as smoothly. The county announced this week that Clear Channel is donating 56 billboards in four languages to spread the word about the<a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/harris-county-unveils-billboards-to-promote-easier-election-day-voting/285-b5ba6428-c3e3-4a8b-9e73-b50b45405333"> county’s new vote center system</a>. Registered voters will have more than 700 polling sites to choose from on Election Day. That includes the 52 early voting sites, up from 46 in 2018. Also, the move to vote centers is forcing the county to<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/neighborhood/article/The-most-unusual-polling-locations-in-Houston-for-14545246.php#photo-15850323"> get creative</a> about where those sites are located. Some of the new early voting sites include a funeral home, a Starbucks and an ice skating complex.</p>
<p><strong>These are the kind of elections-related stories we live for.</strong> Crosscut has a super fascinating piece about Washington’s<a href="https://crosscut.com/2019/10/these-ballot-boxes-keep-your-vote-safe-fire-rain-and-rampaging-suvs"> steel ballot drop boxes</a> and how they came to be. According to the article, the efforts to strengthen the ballot boxes date back to 2010, shortly before Washington lawmakers started requiring all counties to move to a vote-by-mail system. Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson first reached out to a local metal fabrication company. After a few months of exchanging ideas, the county and the company came up with a ballot box composed of quarter-inch-thick steel weighing about 600 pounds. (The newer, larger versions weigh about 1,000 pounds.) The metal is welded or folded at each corner, leaving no seams that can be pried. The company now has about 540 in the field across seven states. Olson said his company never would have thought of making ballot boxes until Pierce County elections officials reached out. He said new orders for the ballot boxes — a product line the company has dubbed Vote Armor — are now rolling in from California.</p>

Board of Elections announced that voters in the District of Columbia will be receiving custom “I Voted” stickers beginning in 2020.<a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/10/23/d-c-s-new-i-voted-stickers-feature-frederick-douglass/"> The new stickers will feature Frederick Douglass</a>. Following the Civil War, Douglass moved to the District of Columbia and became an advocate for D.C. voting rights. “[W]hat have the people of the District done that they should be excluded from the privileges of the ballot box? Where, when and how did they incur the penalty of taxation without representation?” he reportedly said in 1895 according to WAMU. “Frederick Douglass was, historically, an advocate for D.C. voting rights and so we thought he was the right choice for our stickers,” Rachel Coll, a spokeswoman for the election board told WAMU. Coll says the District’s new Douglass stickers will be available alongside the existing stock of traditional stickers at polling places for the June 2020 primary and next November’s general election.</p>

														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Dems sent the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/house-dems-advances-bill-to-restore-parts-of-voting-rights-act/"> Voting Rights Advancement Act</a> to the house floor this week. The bill would restore provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, reauthorized by Congress with strong bipartisan support in 2006. The bill would require states with a history of racial discrimination to seek approval from the Justice Department before implementing changes to voter laws.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> An effort to give Bibb County employees<a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/local/bibb-county-commissioners-voting-county-employees-paid-time-off/93-79dae723-8665-4007-a239-99d4cf2e4b48"> time off to vote</a> has failed. One proposal would  have given employees a full day off each year civil engagement or wellness. A second proposal would have given all county employees a paid holiday for election day.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Red Wing city council will vote on October 28 whether or not put the use of<a href="https://www.postbulletin.com/news/politics/red-wing-city-council-set-to-vote-on-placing-ranked/article_7829108e-f1e7-11e9-b0b4-cf23c8ad3453.html"> ranked choice voting</a> before voters on the 2020 ballot.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The Mount Airy board of commissioners has voted to<a href="https://www.mtairynews.com/news/79244/city-moving-elections-to-even-years"> move the city’s elections</a> to even-numbered beginning in 2022. The proposal was approved 4-0 and must now be approved by the General Assembly. “I would like to move our elections to even years so we will be with the rest of the world,” Commissioner Jon Cawley said according to <em>The Mount Airy News.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Legislation was unveiled this week that would<a href="https://www.phillytrib.com/news/state_and_region/voting-reform-package-emerges-in-pennsylvania-capitol/article_76280f47-7854-5d06-a93a-07461b4f073d.html"> overhaul how residents cast a ballot</a>. Under its provisions, voters would no longer have the single-choice option on a ballot to simply select a political party’s candidate for each office. The bill would also move the voter registration deadline to 15 (from 30) days before an election and it would allow for no-excuse absentee voting.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The Austin city council is considering plan that would make<a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/city-council-is-looking-into-paid-voting-day-holiday/"> Election Day a paid holiday</a> for city employees. If the plan is approved, it would go into effect in November 2020.</p>

														<p><strong>Florida:</strong> In a 55-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle said<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/10/18/judge-gives-partial-victory-florida-felons-voting-right/4028514002/"> people cannot be denied the right to vote if they are “genuinely unable” to pay financial obligations</a>. But he issued a preliminary injunction that applied only to plaintiffs in the case – and not more broadly to other felons who might be affected. (The) state can condition restoration of a felon’s right to vote on payment of fines and restitution the felon is able to pay,” Hinkle wrote. “When a felon claims inability to pay, the state need not just take the felon’s word for it. The state may properly place the burden of establishing inability to pay on the felon and, to that end, may put in place an appropriate administrative process. That this places a greater burden on the felon claiming inability to pay than on felons with no unpaid obligations is unavoidable and not improper.”</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The nonprofit Indiana Vote by Mail and five voters filed a federal lawsuit seeking the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/hoosiers-sue-to-replace-paperless-indiana-voting-machines/"> decertification of voting machines</a> they claim are vulnerable to hacking and do not leave a verifiable paper trail, in hopes of replacing the machines ahead of the 2020 election. According to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>, the complaint specifically targets the paperless system that uses direct-recording electronic, or DRE, machines, which do not have a “voter-verified paper audit trail” providing a viewable record that a ballot was counted accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota has filed suit against Secretary of State Steve Simon in order to<a href="https://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2019/10/21/aclu-minnesota-sues-state-restore-voting-rights-felons/4057871002/"> restore the voting rights for people with felonies</a> who have served their prison time or have received probation instead of incarceration. According to the lawsuit, filed in Ramsey County District Court, the state constitution gives all Minnesotans the right to vote, including felons after their civil rights have been restored. But state law restores the right to vote for felons only by court order or the completion of a sentence. The suit accuses state law of violating the state constitution, and seeks to restore voting rights for people who are convicted of a felony but are actively serving probation, and for people who received probation instead of prison or jail time.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> Following up on his official opinion that current<a href="https://columbustelegram.com/news/local/ag-takes-argument-over-appointed-election-commissioners-to-state-s/article_9c979699-a8ac-53ac-855d-35a3f5a33ef7.html"> appointment, rather than election, of election commissioners</a> in Lancaster, Douglas and five other counties is &#8220;constitutionally suspect,&#8221; Attorney General Doug Peterson has taken the issue to the Nebraska Supreme Court. The court, in turn, said Thursday that the application would be accepted subject to an agreed stipulation of facts in the case by Peterson and Secretary of State Bob Evnen, the state&#8217;s chief elections officer.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal judge to<a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/New-Hampshire-ACLU-requests-freeze-of-controversial-voter-law-amid-confusion-29562479"> put a hold on the implementation of HB1264</a> ahead of the 2020 primary. HB 1264, which passed in 2018 and has been in effect since June 2019, modifies New Hampshire’s election laws to effectively make casting a ballot in an election an act of residency.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: U.S. District Judge William J. Martini has denied a motion for a new trial in the case of developer Frank Raia who was found guilty of<a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/judge-denies-new-vote-by-mail-fraud-trial-for-hobokens-raia-sentencing-set-for-nov/"> fraud</a> in a vote-by-mail scheme. Raia will be sentenced in about three-and-a-half week.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Beverly Kendall, who was fired as the Miami County board of elections director has<a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/fired-miami-county-elections-director-sues-get-back-pay-job/1eYwBc3vK4lbKLjvPsmd9H/"> filed suit against the BOE</a> and members Dave Fisher and Robert Long individually. Kendall’s suit claims the board violated the public meetings law when it fired her in January and the members defamed her by blaming her for votes that weren’t counted in November 2018. According to the <em>Dayton Daily  News</em>, Kendall seeks an order finding the board&#8217;s action violated the open meetings act and asks for job reinstatement along with compensatory and punitive damages of more than $25,000 each.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, as counsel for Secretary of State Mac Warner, filed a<a href="https://www.journal-news.net/news/secretary-of-state-attorney-general-file-brief-in-harpers-ferry/article_c3f695fb-da68-5f9b-9d77-9b4c2bdeb0d8.html"> friend of the court brief</a> with Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Debra McLaughlin Thursday in support of a petition filed by two candidates in the Harpers Ferry municipal election held June 11. Deputy Attorney General Curtis Capehart, on behalf of Warner, said the Harpers Ferry Town Council, acting as a board of canvassers, refused to consider six provisional ballots cast during the election. Of those provisional ballots, four were cast by residents of Washington Street in Harpers Ferry who had registered to vote through the state Division of Motor Vehicles. Due to a mistake in the DMV addressing system, the voters were registered as residents of nearby Bolivar instead of Harpers Ferry.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Security</strong>: Microsoft has launched a<a href="https://threatpost.com/microsoft-election-security-bug-bounties/149347/"> bug-bounty program</a> aimed at its ElectionGuard product. The bounty program invites security researchers (“whether full-time cybersecurity professionals, part-time hobbyists or students”) to probe ElectionGuard for high-impact vulnerabilities and share them with Microsoft under Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD). Eligible submissions with a “clear, concise proof of concept” (PoC) are eligible for awards ranging from $500 to $15,000 depending on the severity of the bug found.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Several rural townships in Missaukee and Osceola counties may have difficulty implementing the state’s new election day registration law because the townships<a href="https://www.cadillacnews.com/news/lack-of-internet-access-could-lead-to-election-day-hiccup/article_9f1e315e-61e4-529d-932c-1746cb4b3148.html"> don’t have internet access</a> and some don’t even have strong enough cell service to set up a hotspot in order to access the state’s Qualified Voter File. “We’re having to come up with some creative ideas,” Missaukee County Clerk Jessica Nielsen told <em>Cadillac News</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> While there is a growing list of states and counties allowing military and overseas voters to cast their ballots using blockchain, Utah County will now allow<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3446836/utah-county-moves-to-expand-mobile-voting-through-blockchain.html"> voters with disabilities to use the blockchain-based technology</a> to cast a ballot from their smartphones. &#8220;I made the decision to utilize it for our disabled community after that,&#8221; Amelia Gardner, Utah County Clerk and Auditor told <em>Computer World</em>. &#8220;It was used twice in West Virginia for overseas voters, twice in Denver for overseas voters; so, in addition to my use of it in the municipal primary, that gave us five solid examples of clean audits coming back showing the votes were true.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>New Clearie Award Category</h2>
														<p><strong>Honoring an elections tradition</strong><br />
<em>EAC 2019 &#8220;I Voted&#8221; stickers Clearie Award</em></p>
<p>By Patrick Leahy</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/10-10/#tab-10">EAC Clearinghouse Awards competition</a> will accept submissions for a special new category: original and creative “I voted” stickers. The EAC announced this category in September when it launched the 2019 Clearies. Below are additional details about our fun new contest. We hope you will reach out and submit your own homegrown stickers!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="324" height="324" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" />In states and counties across the U.S., “I Voted” stickers promote civic duty and pride. They rise above partisan divides and honor those who have worked for equal voting rights. The stickers come in a variety of designs, shapes, and colors. Each tells a story. Here at the EAC, we wanted to recognize and highlight this meaningful American tradition by casting a spotlight on the creativity and originality of particular designs.</p>
<p>Started in the early 1980s, the “I Voted” sticker has helped both voters and election officials celebrate Election Day. The stickers allow voters to express civic pride and encourage fellow friends, family, and coworkers to participate. In many communities, election officials organize public competitions to select the jurisdiction’s sticker, furthering a sense of unity. Other localities invite K-12 students, our nation’s future voters, to design entries. The stickers and their various social media versions have become part of the fabric of our democracy.</p>
<p>During the past four years, the EAC has received dozens of entries in our Clearinghouse Awards competition. Also known as the Clearies for short, the effort honors innovative best practices in election administration. Under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), the Clearies helps meet the EAC’s charge to serve as a clearinghouse of election administration information.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the Clearies have grown from one category to four. This year’s awards retain three previous categories: Outstanding Innovations in Elections, Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities, and Best Practices in Recruiting, Training, and Retaining Poll Workers. We are pleased to add the newest category of Most Original and creative “I Voted” Sticker to the 2019 contest.</p>
<p>Evaluated in four areas, all submissions will be scored in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creativity – Imaginative concept and presentation</li>
<li>Originality – Demonstration of innovative design</li>
<li>Artistic Aesthetics – Overall graphics and artistry</li>
<li>Local flair – Recognition of particular audience, place, or concept</li>
</ul>
<p>The EAC’s four Commissioners, Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Benjamin Hovland, Commissioner Thomas Hicks, and Commissioner Donald Palmer, will judge the submissions.</p>
<p>It is our hope to present multiple awards. Winners receive the EAC Clearie plaque and recognition from the EAC. The competition submission period is currently open and you should email your sticker along with a brief description to <a href="mailto:Clearinghouse@eac.gov">Clearinghouse@eac.gov</a>. Please include a point of contact and note “Sticker Competition” in the subject line. The deadline for this year’s competition is Monday, November 25.</p>
<p>Each voter who dons the “I Voted” sticker communicates a sense of pride in having fulfilled their civic duty, and the stickers can have a more personal significance as well. I’d like to share my recent personal voting experience and “I Voted” story.</p>
<p>As an individual who is blind and who advised on HAVA while working for the Congress, I understand just how important voting rights are. During the 2018 midterms, I experienced firsthand the benefits of HAVA. The elections technology worked perfectly to ensure my vote was private and independent. Thanks to HAVA and great poll workers, it constituted my most seamless voting experience yet. As I left the polling place, I was presented with my “I Voted” sticker. I took great pride in it. In fact, I still display the sticker on my home bookshelf. To this day, it serves as a reminder of the vote and those who contributed so much to make it possible.</p>
<p>We hope you will share your stickers with us and with the elections community. Please reach out with any questions. We look forward to receiving your entries for the 2019 Clearinghouse Awards!</p>
