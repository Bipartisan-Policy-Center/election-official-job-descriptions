														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Day 2019</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened, what didn’t and what’s next?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4575" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Although there are still elections to be held in 2019 — Oklahoma on Nov. 12, Louisiana on Nov. 16 and scattering of others including one on New Year’s Even in Richland County, South Carolina — for all intents and purposes the 2019 election season came to an end on November 5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many counties testing out new voting equipment and a number of new election laws in place, more eyes than normal seemed to be on the 2019 election and although there are ballots still to be counted and results to be certified, by-and-large the election proved relatively smooth and served as battle preparation for 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, just because it was a relatively smooth election doesn’t mean it was without it’s bumps, snafus, glitches, and arrests (?!). Although we are happy to note that there was not one reported incident of a</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/08-15/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> car crashing into a polling place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see a complete round-up of what happened on Election Day, be sure to check out the Daily News posts from</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/news/2019/11-06/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> November 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/news/2019/11-07/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> November 7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but in the meantime, here’s a snapshot of Election Day 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voting Machines</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counties in several states rolled out new voting equipment and the results were  mixed bag, although if you were to read some of the local news headlines you might assume it was a colossal meltdown — it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the biggest problems seemed to occur in York County and Northampton County, Pennsylvania. In</span><a href="https://www.witf.org/2019/11/05/york-county-apologizes-for-voting-problems-state-gop-rips-breakdown-of-electoral-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> York County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the problem appeared to be using the incorrect stock for ballots and in</span><a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-northampton-voting-machine-problems-press-conference-20191106-dzvfo37dlnaajmsrc5rmbgdg4u-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Northampton County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the vendor is still working to determine what the issue was/is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Pennsylvania, one side effect of new paper ballots is the seeming lack of privacy one has while filling them out and casting them. In</span><a href="https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/06/elections-2019-new-york-enfield-runs-out-ballots/4176305002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Berks County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters lamented that there were not curtained booths to use when casting a ballot. Debbie Olivieri, the county&#8217;s director of elections said she would look into ways to make voting more private before 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also scattered problems in</span><a href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/problems-reported-at-of-st-joseph-county-polling-sites-as/article_92f82461-f867-5327-a4b5-89c7013bb52b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/problem-with-new-election-equipment-delays-voting-georgia-counties/vxltEshk0grck0uJiWA5RM/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20191106/franklin-county-officials-say-minor-glitches-hit-otherwise-smooth-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.heraldbulletin.com/news/new-voting-machines-cause-few-problems/article_7e5bc2a8-002e-11ea-9c33-5f754b867be3.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> South Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/Midland-County-faces-issues-with-voting-machines-564570271.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with new voting machines. The problems largely seemed to stem from two issues a learning curve for poll workers with the new equipment and a learning curve for voters. And by-and-large voters seemed to like the new systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Night</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting machine and technology problems were not limited to Election Day, they also bled over into Election Night in some spots. In</span><a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/your-local-election-hq/virginia-election-results-delayed-due-to-system-crash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a lot of eyes watching, the state’s election website went down till about 9pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/elections/medical-emergency-shuts-down-ulster-county-board-of-elections-some/article_52a9daca-0054-11ea-9f10-0b300eb777b1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ulster County, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it wasn’t technology that delayed the results, but a medical emergency at the county board of elections around 11:30 p.m. that pushed the completion of vote tallying to Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harris-County-clerk-blames-secretary-of-state-for-14813693.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Debra Trautman is blaming a last-minute directive from the secretary of state’s office for delaying the county’s voting results up to 12 hours. Instead of transmitting the results electronically from polling places, the directive required that local law enforcement officials escort ballot boxes to a central counting location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/your-local-election-hq/travis-county-new-machines-worked-but-election-code-delayed-total-count/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Travis County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election results were delayed till about 3:45 a.m. after poll workers were forced to re-count ballot cards from polling places because there was a difference between the number of voters who checked in and the number of ballots in the boxes. Turns out some voters left with their paper ballot instead of casting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ranked Choice Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 has been a big year for ranked choice voting. During Tuesday’s elections the alternative voting method was in use in 11 jurisdictions including</span><a href="https://kvia.com/your-voice-your-vote/new-mexico-politics/2019/11/06/las-cruces-mayor-ken-miyagishima-defeats-9-challengers-in-ranked-choice-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Las Cruces, New Mexico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.macombdaily.com/news/eastpointe-voters-choose-familiar-faces-in-new-voting-method/article_3e0309c4-00c3-11ea-90d7-8b0b79999920.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eastpointe, Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the first time. Although voters had mixed views about the system, neither jurisdiction reported any problems with tabulating the ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked choice was also on the ballot in three places —Easthampton and Lowell, Massachusetts and New York City. In</span><a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2019/11/05/more-lowell-voters-support-hybrid-electoral-system-over-ranked-choice-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lowell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 51 percent of the voters disapproved of moving to ranked choice voting. In</span><a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/11/easthampton-approves-ranked-choice-voting-4-year-term-for-mayor-voters-cast-ballots-in-candidate-races.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Easthampton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the vote for ranked-choice voting for the mayoral race was 2,297 to 1,855 and the vote for ranked-choice voting for single winner district races was 2,306 to 1,840. And in</span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/politics/new-york-city-adopts-ranked-choice-voting-system-for-some-races/5673139/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will become the largest jurisdiction in the country to implement ranked choice, voters approved a charter amendment that will allow ranked choice to be used in primaries and special elections beginning in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Absentee/Vote-By-Mail</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first election with no-excuse absentee voting in both Michigan and Virginia. In</span><a href="https://www.wilx.com/content/news/MI-Absentee-voting-makes-huge-difference--564582241.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, clerks in</span><a href="https://www.theoaklandpress.com/news/oakland-county-clerks-process-record-breaking-amount-of-absentee-ballot/article_732ede2c-fff4-11e9-9e34-4fc3fa81d6ea.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oakland County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> processed a record-number of absentee ballots. In</span><a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2019/11/06/how-expanded-absentee-voting-affected-turnout-lansing-east-lansing/4176369002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> East Lansing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 32 percent of ballots cast were absentee compared to 20 percent in 2015.</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2019/11/kalamazoo-sees-absentee-ballot-spike-in-first-local-election-since-changes-to-state-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kalamazoo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also saw a spike in absentee voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new vote-by-mail law in</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/murphy-new-vbm-law-appears-to-be-in-a-good-place/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New Jersey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certainly seemed to drive up the number of people casting ballots via that method, but there were no reports of major problems with mail-ballots as there had been in the past.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/md-municipal-elections-rockville-votes-by-mail-bowie-elects-1st-black-mayor/2019/11/06/cda34d06-ffeb-11e9-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockville, Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became the first jurisdiction in the state to conduct an election entirely by mail and the election saw a record turnout. More than 12,200 ballots were cast this year, vs. 6,468 in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Secretary of State Races</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Michael-Adams-elected-as-Kentucky-secretary-of-state-564534361.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kentucky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican Michael Adams (52.3 percent) defeated Democrat Heather French Henry (47.7 percent) to take over the top elections spot in the commonwealth. Adams has previously served on the state’s board of elections.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wapt.com/article/mississippi-voters-will-choose-new-secretary-of-state/29702286"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new secretary of state will be Republican Michael Watson (59.1 percent) who defeated Democrat Johnny Dupree (40.9 percent). Watson is a lawyer and previously served in the state Legislature.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut:</strong> Pens at some Greenwich polling places began</span><a href="https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/Pens-at-Greenwich-polling-places-running-out-of-14811382.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> running out of ink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around mid-day. The town sent out reinforcements with some districts getting as many as a dozen extra pens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana:</strong> An</span><a href="https://www.newsandtribune.com/news/some-sellersburg-voters-cast-ballots-outdoors-after-electrical-fire-at/article_36e686d6-0049-11ea-9345-a3834927b94f.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electrical fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a polling place forced voters to cast their ballots outdoors at one Clark County polling place. The fire was caused when poll workers turned on the heat in the VFW post that serves as the polling site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> A Louisville-area polling place was forced to stay open later after it was put on</span><a href="https://www.wdrb.com/community/lockdown-prompts-extended-voting-at-jefferson-county-polling-location/article_94912594-000c-11ea-8c9d-abcd3d7981c1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lockdown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when a stolen car was found near the school serving as a voting site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> A voter in Quincy faced scrutiny from poll workers after they realized he was wearing</span><a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/05/donald-trump-keep-america-great-gear-not-welcome-at-quincy-polls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MAGA-related clothing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Quincy City Clerk Nicole Crispo admitted the poll worker might have been a little overzealous, since the president wasn’t appearing on Tuesday’s ballot, but said she “stands by her poll worker’s decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other poll worker news, two</span><a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/medford/2-poll-workers-arrested-election-day-medford"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll workers were arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Medford for disorderly conduct, assault and battery on an officer and resisting arrest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> Well, you’ve got to appreciate their civic duty at least. All day long on Tuesday the Glendale Christian Church in Springfield that usually serves as a polling place had to explain to people showing up to vote that there was in fact</span><a href="https://www.ky3.com/content/news/CONFUSION-AT-THE-POLLS-Voters-show-to-polling-places-with-no-election-564508651.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey:</strong> It wouldn’t be an Election Day without a</span><a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/2019/11/05/nj-election-manchester-power-outage-doesnt-deter-voters/4164913002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> power outage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> somewhere and this year’s “lucky winner” was in Ocean County where a pole fire caused the outage around 5 a.m. that lasted till about 10 a.m. Back-up generators were provided and voted proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: Voters in the Town of Enfield almost lost out on their chance to vote after the town called the county to let them know that the polling site was down to its last 10 ballots around 6pm. The county sent out a worker with more ballots, but the worker</span><a href="https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/06/elections-2019-new-york-enfield-runs-out-ballots/4176305002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the worker didn’t end up arriving with additional ballots till around 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A configuration error made by state board of elections staff as they prepared the</span><a href="https://wcti12.com/news/state-news/voter-tools-portion-of-the-nc-board-of-elections-website-crash-after-configuration-error"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for anticipated increases in web traffic throughout Election Day temporarily knocked the Voter Search section of the site offline Tuesday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> Heather Jones, a polling location supervisor in Montgomery County, was</span><a href="https://www.wdtn.com/top-stories/election-board-montgomery-county-polling-supervisor-removed-by-police/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> removed by police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday for allegedly not fixing polling tablet and other issues, according to the Board of Elections.</span></p>

							<h2>Bipartisan Policy Center Study</h2>
														<p><em><strong>The 2018 Voting Experience</strong></em><br />
<em>Polling place lines</em></p>
<p>The U.S. voting experience is a constantly changing playing field. Voters cast ballots by mail, in person at early voting sites, and through apps available to members of the military. But most voters nationwide still go to polling places on Election Day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3308" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin-300x176.jpeg" alt="" width="346" height="203" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin-300x176.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" />When turnout rises with no corresponding change in polling place capacity, voters become more likely to see long lines. Turnout during the 2018 midterm election was up 38 percent over 2014 and neared presidential election-level rates. Big increases in 2020 over 2016 will stretch additional polling places beyond their service limits.</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center in 2018 conducted the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/the-2018-voting-experience/"> largest ever observational study</a> of wait times in polling places. The study spanned 3,119 precincts, 211 jurisdictions, and 11 states, accounting for 10.5 million votes cast—9 percent of nationwide turnout. Jurisdiction size ranged from Metz Township, Michigan, with 230 registered voters, to San Diego County, California, with nearly 3 million registered voters.</p>
<p>This research—conducted with our partners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—provides the type of fine-grained analysis of voters’ reality as they waited to cast ballots that survey data cannot replicate.</p>
<p>The bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration in 2014 established a 30-minute benchmark for acceptable in-person wait times to vote. The good news is that in 2018, the average wait time to vote was 8.9 minutes, well within the acceptable limit. The bad news is that nearly 5% of precincts averaged greater than 30-minute wait times throughout Election Day.</p>
<p>And the distribution of those lengthy wait times is not even. Precincts with a high percentage of minority voters, more renters, and lower incomes saw significantly longer wait times. In precincts with 10 percent or less minority voters, the average wait time was 5.1 minutes; in precincts with 90 percent or more minority voters, the average wait climbed to 32.4 minutes.</p>
<p>The study shows that lines are far more common at the beginning of the day. 69% of precincts in our study experienced their longest lines within the first hour of voting, with the lines declining after that. The data also show that if long lines are not resolved within the first two hours of poll opening, long lines are likely to occur for the entire day.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/the-2018-voting-experience/"> BPC/MIT Polling Place Line Study</a> provides evidence to policymakers that long lines can be studied—and brought under control—by using approaches and tools that businesses have been employing for decades. Doing so starts with the collection of vital information during the voting process through our program and the will to make necessary changes to improve the voting experience.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This week the Department of Justice</strong>, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Security Agency, CISA, the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence</span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/joint-statement-from-doj-dod-dhs-dni-fbi-nsa-and-cisa-on-ensuring-security-of-2020-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released a joint statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reaffirming their commitment to securing the 2020 elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an unprecedented level of coordination, the U.S. government is working with all 50 states and U.S. territories, local officials, and private sector partners to identify threats, broadly share information, and protect the democratic process. We remain firm in our commitment to quickly share timely and actionable information, provide support and services, and to defend against any threats to our democracy,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While at this time we have no evidence of a compromise or disruption to election infrastructure that would enable adversaries to prevent voting, change vote counts, or disrupt the ability to tally votes, we continue to vigilantly monitor any threats to U.S. elections,” the statement also said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CISA Director Chris Krebs spoke with CBS This Morning</strong> about</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-presidential-election-homeland-security-official-says-russian-foreign-interference-threat-remains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the work his agency is doing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to secure the 2020 elections.</span></p>

On Election Day 2020, the floor will have officials from the intelligence community, Defense Department, FBI and state and local partners, Krebs said, adding, &#8220;Everybody will be in here sharing information in real time.&#8221;</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>With just days to go before Election Day</strong>, North Carolina State Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell approved</span><a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2019/11/01/additional-ids-approved-for-voting-in-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 49 additional types of student and employee photo IDs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would qualify to cast a ballot in the Tarheel State. They 49 new ID types join more than 80 student, employee and tribal IDs already approved for voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Even the best laid plans of mice and men</strong> to get to the polls on Election Day can sometimes get toppled by an</span><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/philly-hospital-patient-emergency-absentee-ballots-20191101.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unexpected trip to the hospital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But patients at some Philadelphia-area hospitals are getting a bit of help casting their ballot. The program, started last year by Kimmel Medical College students at Thomas Jefferson University, allows voters to text a number provided to them on their meal trays and someone will help them fill out an emergency ballot. “Just because you are in the hospital setting does not mean that you should be taken out of the day-to-day events of the world,” Kathryn Linder, 29, a third-year medical student who started JeffVotes told the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>. “It gives them a sense that they are very much still part of the community while they’re hospitalized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We learn about new, cool things every day</strong> and this is one of them. Residents of South Berwick, Maine are joining residents of their sister city in Tuskegee, Ala., to recognize the 200th birthdays of both states with a joint project that is focused on registering voters and interviewing 200 people in their communities about why it’s important to vote. The project, called “</span><a href="https://www.fosters.com/news/20191103/together-we-vote-south-berwick-sister-city-engage-in-joint-project"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together We Vote – Two Communities, One Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, will culminate with a booklet and video featuring the citizens of the two towns, which became sister cities in 2017. According to <em>Foster’s Daily</em>, video interviews will begin in South Berwick on Election Day and will continue through the fall until 100 people have been interviewed. In Tuskegee, videographers will also do 100 interviews in the months ahead. “We wanted to come up with a way to celebrate together with Tuskegee and also to focus on election year and the importance of voting in our democracy,” John Klossner, of South Berwick, who is one of the many volunteers doing interviews for the project told the paper.</span></p>

Sounds great right? However it turns out that the sites, which had names and appearances to make one think they were legitimate news sources turned out to be owned by one entity called Metrics Media and many of the stories had a conservative bent to them. &#8220;The big issue is the extent to which they have gone to try to confuse about this being the site of a local newspaper,&#8221; said Matt Grossmann, director of Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research. Rachel Davis Mersey, executive director of the Media Leadership Center at Northwestern University&#8217;s Medill School of Journalism to the paper that while the stories aren’t necessarily “fake news” but “information with a perspective.” So what does this all have to do with elections? Well we here at electionline do our very best to bring you real news without a perspective, but given the proliferation of sites like these sometimes it’s difficult.

An election can’t be overturned based solely on unusual vote counts in the lieutenant governor’s race — tens of thousands fewer than in every other statewide election — the court wrote in its 94-page decision upholding a lower court’s dismissal of the case. Specific evidence of illegal or improper votes is required, it said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Georgia, The Democratic Party filed a lawsuit Wednesday over Georgia&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/06/us/ap-us-absentee-ballot-lawsuit-georgia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> handling of absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year after some ballots were rejected for minor reasons such as signatures not exactly matching those on file with the state. According to the federal lawsuit, absentee voters are not notified of problems with their ballots in a standard way or given enough time to correct them. It asks that a judge require state elections officials to notify voters of missing signatures within one day of receiving a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Abdihakim Amin Essa, 22 of Minneapolis has been charged with</span><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/10/31/minneapolis-man-charged-with-falsifying-13-absentee-ballots-ahead-of-2018-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13 counts of felony voting fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Essa is accused of falsifying 13 applications for absentee ballots and tried to cast one himself—he is not a U.S. citizen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: In a 26-page ruling, Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge David A. Anderson has thrown out part of a lawsuit challenging the state’s</span><a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/judge-dismisses-some-not-all-of-voter-registration-lawsuit/article_942e9288-ca39-57ff-b39c-2df73713dfd1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new, tighter voter registration procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. n the ruling, Anderson dismissed the charge that the new law, yet to be enforced, would contradict the state constitution’s use of “domicile” as a qualification for voting. It also dismissed part of a second claim that the law’s language should be voided for vagueness. “Therefore the Legislature has the authority to define the meaning of domicile,” Anderson wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York City ordered a civil rights lawsuit filed as a result of the</span><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Troy-ballot-fraud-lawsuit-heads-back-to-federal-14814749.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decade-old ballot fraud case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back to U.S. District Court in Albany to be heard, setting up a potential trial. The appeals court issued the order following up on the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 20 ruling that Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner Edward G. McDonough had filed the lawsuit against Special Prosecutor Trey Smith and other defendants in 2015 in a timely matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> A federal judge has sided with the Campaign Legal Center that will</span><a href="https://radio.wosu.org/post/ruling-means-newly-jailed-voters-can-cast-absentee-ballots-ohio#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand election access to all voters in jail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In November of 2018, two Ohio voters were jailed before the election, but after the deadline to request an absentee ballot, they were denied a ballot and the Campaign Legal Center sued on their behalf. The secretary of state’s office said it is reviewing the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia:</strong> Federal judge Rossie Alston ordered Fairfax County to</span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/judge-rules-on-dispute-over-george-mason-voter-registrations/291-56cf9209-0b88-4028-9958-6a085d2d14d1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accept the voter registration of about 170 George Mason University students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose registrations had previously been rejected. Alston said the registrations must be accepted provided the students supplement their application by providing the registrar their dorm address by a Saturday deadline. If they miss the deadline they will be able to cast a provisional ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: 23rd Judicial Circuit Judge Debra McLaughlin concluded in a 15-page order filed with Jefferson County Circuit Clerk that</span><a href="https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/judge-orders-provisional-ballots-to-be-counted-in-harpers-ferry/article_32fbe162-c460-5860-b5cd-e4315288d3c0.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> four provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not counted in the town’s June 11 municipal election must now be counted. There is no word on whether or not Harpers Ferry will appeal the ruling.</span></p>

The opportunity was made possible through the efforts of the Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) at the McCourt School of Public Policy; GU Votes, a GU Politics student-led voter registration initiative; Georgetown’s Office of Federal Relations; and the University Registrar. Developed in partnership with the Andrew Goodman Foundation, the new system allows students to register to vote from their home state or DC, request an absentee ballot, sign up for election updates, check their registration status and learn more about the 2020 candidates. The goal is to achieve 100% eligible student voter registration.</span></p>

<em>Celebrating best practices in election administration</em></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking submissions for its fourth annual national <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Clearinghouse Awards. Dubbed the “Clearies” for short, the awards provide election offices an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that Act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</p>
<p>The Commission will present awards in the categories of outstanding innovations in elections, improving voting accessibility for voters with disabilities, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. It will also award a special award in 2019 recognizing the most original and creative “I Voted” sticker submitted for consideration. Entries from all sizes of jurisdictions, both large and small, are encouraged to submit their work. All entries must be received by Monday, November 25, 2019. The 2018 winners of the Clearie awards can be found<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-clearinghouse-award-winners-2018/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>“The EAC Clearie Awards celebrate the innovative and creative approaches that election officials use each day in their work to serve voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “These awards are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices that other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
<li>Creating positive Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Election officials utilize innovative and resourceful initiatives on Election Day. We want to hear about these outstanding best practices in EAC’s 2019 competition. By incorporating Election Day into the submission deadline, we are able to capture activities implemented throughout the 2018 and 2019 elections.</p>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>
<p>For more information about this year’s competition, please contact Patrick Leahy at pleahy@eac.gov.</p>
