							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Sometimes simple questions yield big results</strong><br />
<em>Nebraska wins NASED Innovators award for Albert sensor work</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>When voters began heading to the polls in 2016, less than half of states had an<a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/albert"> Albert sensor</a> — an Intrusion Detection System that provides enhanced monitoring capabilities and notifications of malicious activity — on their statewide voter registration databases.</p>
<p>Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia and two territories have the election security measure at work. But there’s something a bit different about the Albert sensor in Nebraska and four other states.</p>
<p>Thanks to an award-winning partnership between the<a href="http://www.sos.ne.gov/dyindex.html"> Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office</a>, their vendor<a href="https://www.essvote.com/"> ES&amp;S</a> and the<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/"> Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center</a> (EI-ISAC), the Cornhusker State and four others are now using an Albert sensor that is not the typical physical hardware placed at the state level, but software that is placed in the voter registration environment at a private elections vendor.</p>
<p>According to Wayne Bena, director of elections for the state of Nebraska, the whole thing came about from a simple question.</p>
<p>When the EI-ISAC, made available an Albert sensor to each state to protect voter registration systems, Nebraska already had sensors covering the state network but the voter registration system was housed separately on the network of the state’s vendor.</p>
<p>“During a conference call with CIS a simple question was asked, ‘Can the Albert sensor be used to protect the voter registration system housed outside the state’s network?’” Bena said. “This question started the process to clear any administrative hurdles that allowed this sensor to be the first one placed on the voter registration environment of a private elections vendor.”</p>
<p>For Ben Spear, director of the EI-ISAC, while the question was unexpected, it was one they welcomed.</p>
<p>“We don’t see why not, as long as the vendor is amenable and we can fit within their network design,” Spear said.</p>
<p>Bena credits the “amazing work” of the state’s vendor and the<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/"> Department of Homeland Security</a>/<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/CISA">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> to make the project a reality.</p>
<p>“Much of the work that was done by the secretary of state’s office was to work on contracts and memorandums of understanding that took into account the uniqueness of this arrangement,” Bena explained. “The Secretary of State’s office takes great pride that this project has been now replicated in four states and territories.”</p>
<p>The conversation started in May 2018 and approved in June 2018. The process of figuring out how this would work and testing different options took most of the summer and the sensor was online in October 2018.</p>
<p>“Using virtualization to support multiple jurisdictions at a vendor site laid the groundwork for future Albert enhancements that will help improve the ability of state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to secure their networks in local, hosted, and cloud environments,” Spear said.</p>
<p>While there are currently no Albert sensors in the cloud, Spear said it’s a work in progress.</p>
<p>“What we have done with Nebraska and ES&amp;S has allowed us to get a head start on how this would work in the cloud,” Spear said. “We’re hoping to have that available by the end of 2019.”</p>
<p>Bena believes the project shows the great work that can be done by state and federal government collaborating with the private sector to protect the U.S. elections. And Matt Masterson, DHS senior cybersecurity advisor, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), couldn’t agree more.</p>
<p>“The work that Ben and his team did with Wayne to figure this out was significant because other states hadn’t really thought about this,” said Matt Masterson, DHS senior cybersecurity advisor, CISA. “It’s certainly impactful and leading to innovation beyond it.”</p>
<p>Being “the first” at something, or an innovator can be a bit scary at times, but Bena said the secretary’s office was confident in their partners and the process.</p>
<p>“We were confident in the technology and knew while this was the first installation of a virtual server, if testing would not have gone as planned, there were additional security measures in place to protect the system,” Bena said.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Election Directors</a> (NASED) recently honored Nebraska’s work with the inaugural Innovators Award.</p>
<p>“Nebraska paved the way for states to deploy Albert sensors to election vendors. Their work with their vendor, DHS, and the EI-ISAC to implement a virtual Albert sensor is a prime example of the kinds of collaboration that state election officials are undertaking to secure our elections,” said Keith Ingram, NASED president and director of elections, Texas Secretary of State.</p>
<p>The NASED Innovators Award highlights innovative training procedures, technologies, partnerships, and practices from the 50 states, District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories. The Award is presented at the NASED Summer Conference in odd years. The winning submission is determined by the NASED Awards Committee, which can decide not to present an award in a given year. Submissions are evaluated on four criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficacy – How effective was the submission at achieving the stated goal or solving the problem? How did you measure the impact?</li>
<li>Sustainability – Is this a long-term solution or will changes be needed for it to continue? Is this a program that you expect to be used regularly in your state? Will costs go down over time or will this require significant on-going investment?</li>
<li>Replicability – Is this a solution that you will use again? Would other state or local jurisdictions be able to use it?</li>
<li>Creativity – Is this a unique approach or solution?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Local Albert Use</strong><br />
Recently,<a href="https://dos.myflorida.com/"> Florida</a> became the first, and so far only, state to have all of its counties—67—with a locally-based Albert sensor to monitor their websites for potential threats.</p>
<p>Masterson noted that while the first priority was to get Albert sensors in all 50 states, DC and the territories, now that that goal has been met, EI-ISAC and CISA are ready to help counties get their own Albert sensor, whether it’s through a concentrated effort like in Florida or individual counties and local election jurisdictions reaching out.</p>
<p>“To go from an environment where we literally had states accusing us of hacking them, to let them letting us put a physical device on their systems is a tremendous credit to how seriously they are taking this threat,” Masterson said.</p>
<p><strong>Join the EI-ISAC</strong><br />
If you haven’t <a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration">joined the EI-ISAC</a>, there is still plenty of time and operators are standing by…so-to-speak.</p>
<p>To-date, all 50 states, the District and the territories are members of the EI-ISAC. There are 1,800 local election administrators in 49 states that belong. Thirteen states have 100 percent local membership and 26 states have greater than 50 percent local membership. There are also  19 vendors that are members of the EI-ISAC.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>On Wednesday, former Special Counsel</strong> Robert Mueller testified before two committees on Capitol Hill. While many of the headline grabbing questions and answers surrounded the president, what caught our ear was how Mueller concluded his opening statement:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And let me say one more thing. Over the course of my career, I’ve seen a number of</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/politics/robert-mueller-testimony-eric-swalwell-voter-interference-cnntv/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenges to our democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Russian government’s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious. As I said on May 29, this deserves the attention of every American.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Congress took note as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And whether you are a Republican defending the President or Democrat wanting this President to be held accountable, we should be worried that in future elections, whether it&#8217;s Russia or other countries who have similar capability, that this could create a mess of our democracy,” Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-California) told CNN. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many elections we can weather something like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the hearings, Senate Democrats tried unsuccessfully to get</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/454612-senate-democrats-will-try-to-force-vote-on-election-security-after-mueller"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimous consent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on multiple bills addressing election security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>S</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400;">helby Pierson has been appointed</strong> by Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to serve as the nation’s</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743567568/director-of-national-intelligence-dan-coats-appoints-new-election-security-czar"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first election security czar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Election security is an enduring challenge and a top priority for the IC,&#8221; said Coats according to NPR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In order to build on our successful approach to the 2018 elections, the IC must properly align its resources to bring the strongest level of support to this critical issue. There is no one more qualified to serve as the very first election threats executive than Shelby Pierson, whose knowledge and experience make her the right person to lead this critical mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coats is also directing other agencies within the spy services to appoint their own executives responsible for election security efforts.</span></p>
<p><strong>During<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-security/fbi-director-wray-russia-intent-on-interfering-with-u-s-vote-idUSKCN1UI1XW"> testimony</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> before</strong> the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, FBI Director Christopher Wray reiterated the concern from election security officials about the 2020 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections,” Wray said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.</span></p>

							<h2>2020 Candiates on Election Issues</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NPR has a break down</strong> on where the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/25/744587413/threats-to-u-s-elections-arent-going-away-what-have-the-2020-democrats-proposed"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The outlet noted that while most candidates have not dedicated more than a few sentences to the top, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) have addressed the situation more in-depth, especially Klobuchar who has co-sponsored several bipartisan bills on the topic.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This week the New Jersey Council on Local Mandates</strong>, an independent state board that decides the constitutionality of laws that may impose “unfunded mandates” on local governments, heard arguments from the New Jersey Association of Counties that the state’s</span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/n-j-county-governments-seek-to-invalidate-unfunded-vote-by-mail-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote-by-mail law is an unfunded mandate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The vote-by-mail ballots and the vote-by-mail expenses have proven to be very costly for our county clerks in preparing,” John Donnadio, executive director of the association argued before the council. According to WHYY, in their rebuttal the state argued that clerks are just doing what they were already doing. “The county clerks are doing the same thing they would have done: They’re providing mail-in ballots to voters who want mail-in ballots,” said Deputy New Jersey Attorney General George Cohen. “The only difference is many [voters] don’t have to request it, and the county clerks are relieved of the obligation of having to review thousands and thousands of mail-in ballot applications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Office News</strong>: Lots of news about elections offices this week including in</span><a href="https://missoulian.com/news/local/county-approves-million-buy-sell-agreement-for-new-elections-office/article_fe26b77c-6708-54b5-82ea-098d99e60249.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Missoula County, Montana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the county commission approved a $2.75 million buy-sell agreement under which the county will gain a 7,711-square-foot office building and a 7,700-square-foot warehouse that will mostly be used for the county elections office. “We’re really looking for a great increase in convenience and efficiency in managing all of our elections,” Missoula County Commissioner Josh Slotnick told The Missoulian. In</span><a href="https://www.hometownstations.com/news/commissioners-soon-to-take-bids-for-remodel-of-new-allen/article_b4d7ba94-a9b2-11e9-a731-8b6fd0f90472.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allen County, Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, county commissioners are preparing to take bids to remodel the old law library at the Third District Court of Appeals Building to house the board of elections. And in</span><a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/politics_and_government/elections/potential-liquor-board-move-sparks-concern-from-board-of-elections/article_8819ae82-7523-51c3-91cd-3599ca996722.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frederick County, Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the county board of elections is upset about a proposal from the county executive that would move the county liquor board into the same building as the election board. Frederick County Election Director Stuart Harvey sent out a press release Tuesday arguing that such a move could compromise election security and produce operational problems if the liquor board were to move into the space at the rear of the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What’s the price for history?</strong> Apparently it’s $685.50 in Indiana County, Pennsylvania because that’s what a company paid for the</span><a href="https://www.indianagazette.com/news/historic-election-house-sells-at-auction-for/article_f3506a05-ee40-56b3-add9-1968eee684b6.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> historic Election House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has served as the polling place for West Mahoning Township for 130 years. The site, which was last used in November 2018 before it was struck by a car does not meet any modern-day requirements for a polling location and so while the county tried to interest a museum into taking the Election House off their hands, ultimately it was sold at auction. “I’ve become very attached to that building which has been a voting precinct in Indiana County (since 1892) … and I hate to see a building like that just disappear from our inventory,” Commissioner Rodney Ruddock told the <em>Indiana Gazette</em>. No word on what the company that purchased the house will do with it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In other historical election news</strong>, the Lake County, Indiana board of elections has donated</span><a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/depression-era-voter-registration-books-donated-to-crown-point-library/article_336cd3e9-c4e4-5e2a-a607-1fb76af70b1a.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depression-era voter registration records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Crown Point Community Library. The registration records were discovered accidentally in the basement of a local American Legion post. American Legion members discovered the 85-year-old books inside of an old beer box and turned them over to the board of elections. According to <em>The Times</em>, the books contain the voter registration information for primary elections in Lake County in 1934. Each corresponds to a geographical division used at the time: Gary, Hammond, Whiting, East Chicago, Crown Point-Hobart and township residents. “It’s really significant from the time period,” archivist Jeanene Letcher said of the discovery. “I’m looking forward to digging into the records to see what they contain and the names they contain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Any port in a storm right?</strong> Well in this case, the port is a horse mat. Washington County, Arkansas is</span><a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2019/jul/23/washington-county-improving-vote-center/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working to make their polling places more accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are turning to mats designed for horse stalls to help polling places that have grass or gravel parking lots be more accessible for voters with disabilities. &#8220;We did some research, and one of the things we looked at is outdoor festivals and how they accommodated the ADA,&#8221; Elections Coordinator Jennifer Price told the county election commission according to the <em>Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette</em>.  The solution Price said she found is to use mats to create parking areas and pathways. &#8220;We&#8217;re using these horse stall mats we get from Tractor Supply stores,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;If we&#8217;ve got a gravel parking lot, we create a space with traffic cones and place the mats so they can park and get out of vehicles and then get to the polling place. They&#8217;re flexible but heavy enough they stay in place and they are the right width for what we need.&#8221;</span></p>

The report, The Administration of Voter Registration in Pennsylvania, provides a summary of statistics and initiatives that support voter registration in the commonwealth in 2018. Topics covered in the report include registration by party, list maintenance, registration at agencies designated by the National Voter Registration Act, and online voter registration. Online voter registration statistics include data on registrations processed via the commonwealth’s Web API, which supports online voter registration for individuals engaged by third-party organizations.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Legislation that will allow counties to</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/new-law-allows-county-board-of-elections-to-expand-to-six-seats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand board of elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from four to six members has been signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy. The bill, sponsored by Assemblywomen Shanique Speight (D-Newark) and Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Trenton) and State Sen. James Beach (D-Voorhees), requires that county freeholder boards authorize the additional Board of Elections members – one from each party. The Assembly approved the measure 71-4, and the Senate 26-11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill signed into law by Murphy requires election notices to include information about where a voter can find their</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/calabrese-pinkin-sumter-praise-enactment-of-polling-place-notice-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polling place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The Jefferson County commission has, for now, tabled consideration of</span><a href="https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Jefferson-Co-tables-talk-of-funding-an-election-14106626.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating a full-time elections administrator position</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to budgetary constraints. According to the <em>Beaumont Enterprise</em>, If the county wants to pursue the creation of an election administrator’s office next year, it needs to be included in the budget before it’s passed. “Obviously we’d have to determine a salary, but more importantly determine, Is this feasible?” Commissioner Brent Weaver asked according to the paper. “Is this something that is needed for our county in the future? What are the duties and responsibilities? How would this person be chosen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Lawmakers are considering a proposal that would restore the</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/democratic-lawmakers-reintroduce-bill-lift-voting-restrictions-felons"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to those released from incarceration immediately upon their release even if terms of their sentence must still be met through parole/probation.</span></p>

And Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge David R. Anderson made it clear that once the trial is completed he won’t issue a final ruling until after the February presidential primary.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: By a 2 to 1 vote, a panel of state judges ruled that a lawsuit challenging the state’s new</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/voter-id-lawsuit-will-go-forward-but-no-preliminary-injunction/18520735/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter ID law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may move forward, but they did not grant a preliminary injunction to delay the law while the legal case plays out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> A federal court has ruled that Texas</span><a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/court-says-texas-can-make-voting-maps-over-grave-concerns"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can change voting maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without supervision despite “grave concerns” and findings that Republicans used racial gerrymandering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia:</strong> J. Christian Adams, who served on the president’s voter fraud task force, has reached a</span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/j-christian-adams-pilf-settlement_n_5d309002e4b0419fd3298ee6"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settlement agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with four voters who sued Adams after he and his organization the Public Interest Legal Foundation produced reports in 2016 and 2017 alleging to show thousands of cases of voter fraud.  As part of the settlement, Adams must apologize to the plaintiffs and his group also agreed to remove the personal information of the accused from the reports and add a statement to the front of them acknowledging that they falsely accused people of being noncitizens. Adams and his group agreed to redact personal information for any future reports they produce on noncitizen registration in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Milwaukee resident Brandon Baker has pleaded guilty to two gun charges and drug-related charges which stem from an incident on Election Day when he threatened go into a polling place to “air it out,” which police understood to mean opening fire in the polling place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Iowa:</strong> The secretary of state’s office confirmed this week that the state’s 14-year-old</span><a href="https://ktiv.com/2019/07/19/iowa-will-keep-voter-registration-system-for-2020-elections-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — I-Voters — will remain in place through the 2020 election cycle. Spokesman Kevin Hall told <em>The Associated Press</em> the office is still in the information-gathering phase of the project. He says the state plans to solicit information from potential vendors soon and later move forward with a bidding process. Hall told the <em>AP</em> the project will cost millions and “we owe it to the voters of Iowa to build it responsibly with the future of elections and security in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utah:</strong> Utah County announced this week that they would be the latest jurisdiction to pilot</span><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/07/23/utah-county-launches/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blockchain voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their military and overseas voters. According to <em>The Salt Lake Tribune</em>, about 58 voters will be able to take advantage of the program during the municipal primaries. “It’s not a ton [of people] but it is enough that it helps with efficiency and manpower,” Utah County Clerk Amelia Powers told the paper. “Even one voter overseas deserves to be able to cast their ballot anonymously and safely.” Like West Virginia and Denver, Utah County will be working with Voatz to provide the service.</span></p>
