														<p><strong>Election security at your fingertips</strong><br />
<em>Florida counties use biometrics to enhance security</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline</p>
<p>In 2018, the federal government<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2018/06-14/"> authorized $380 million</a> in grants for states to improve their election security. Since then, elections officials have been finding a<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2018/08/21/state--territories-plan-to-spend-majority-of-hava-grant-funds-on-election-security-system-upgrades/"> variety of ways</a> to spend their funding to secure the franchise.</p>
<p>While some states kept the HAVA II funding at the state level, in other states like Florida the money has trickled down to the counties. Two Florida counties —<a href="https://www.votebrevard.com/"> Brevard</a> and<a href="https://www.colliervotes.com/"> Collier</a> — are choosing to enhance their elections security through biometrics.</p>
<p>Once the thing of science fiction movies, biometric authentication has moved mainstream with it being used by banks, airport security, hospitals, business for time and attendance tracking and now even elections offices.</p>
<p>So what exactly is biometrics? Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual, say a fingerprint, to verify that they are who they say they are. Typically, biometric authentication is used to manage access to physical and digital resources such as buildings, rooms and computers.</p>
<p>Brevard and Collier are using biometrics authentication as one step in multi-factor authentication for employees and in Brevard, for seasonal staff as well.</p>
<p>“Multi-factor authentication is considered a best practice by the Center for Internet Security and the National Institute of Technology, and it is a pre-emptive measure to improve our office’s security posture,” explained Kimberly Dale, communications director for the Brevard County Supervisor of Elections Office. “Biometric authentication is intended to act as a second factor to supplement strong password security requirements for our users to log in to their workstations and email and help safeguard data.”</p>
<p>Both counties have contracted with<a href="https://www.bio-key.com/"> BIO-Key</a> to provide the biometrics equipment and software. The company has worked internationally in elections, but their work with Brevard and Collier is their first foray into U.S. elections.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting. We’ve done quite a bit internationally on the election front where they’ve been using biometrics for voter security, actually securing a vote cast,” explained Michael W. DePasquale, chairman and CEO of BIO-Key. “They reached out to us because they had received the money and were looking for a very straight forward multi-factor authentication tool.”</p>
<p>DePasquale explained that the system is fairly simple to set up and use, which seemed to appeal to both counties because it didn’t take a lot of extra time from their busy schedules. He noted that the system is in use everywhere from nursery schools for attendance taking to high schools for lunch programs. But it’s the work the company is now doing with elections offices that has him excited.</p>
<div id="attachment_3620" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3620" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3620" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BIOKey-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BIOKey-300x215.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BIOKey.jpg 566w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3620" class="wp-caption-text">BIO-Key&#8217;s finger-scanning device.</p></div>
<p>How it works: Essentially anyone using the system has two-four fingerprints scanned into the system—multiple fingerprints in case you get a cut DePasquale notes—and then those fingerprints are connected to a user name and password. A small fingerprint scanner is attached to computer through a USB port and then when an employee signs in, they also scan their fingerprint for access.</p>
<p>“We see the opportunity to really make an impact here and to really make a difference and secure the infrastructure for what is one of our most precious benefits as an American,” DePasquale said.</p>
<p>Collier County began using biometric authentication in 2018 with the plan to have it rolled out to staff in all departments by 2020. Trish Robertson, elections communications coordinator for the supervisor of elections office said that set up and implementation time has been minimal and it cost the county under $10,000 for the equipment and the licensing.</p>
<p>Brevard has used about $6,000 of its HAVA 2 funds for the system.</p>
<p>“BIO-Key is able to provide a hardware solution, the fingerprint readers, along with a software solution, ID Director for Windows, which integrates with our current IT environment, and the use of biometrics is convenient for our staff to utilize. Ease of use was an important factor in our decision,” Dale in Brevard County explained. “After a demonstration of the software, the decision was made. Other alternatives examined were Duo, YubiKey, and Microsoft’s Windows Hello for Business, but these did not present themselves as user-friendly as BIO-Key.”</p>
<p>Although the counties will be using biometric authentication with staff and seasonal workers, it won’t be used at the polling place on Election Day.</p>
<p>“We do use e-poll books (EViDs), [but] [w]e do not plan to use the dual-authentication system with our election workers using the EViDs,” Robertson in Collier County explained. “They are required to enter their initials for any of the work they do on the EViDs so every transaction done on the EViD is tracked.”</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>The House Oversight Committee held a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/debate-over-election-reform-bill-gets-heated-in-house/"> hearing on HR 1</a> this week and the rhetoric was heated. Rep. Clay Higgins (Louisiana) said the bill “resembles Russian government policy” which drew a strong response from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland). “Voting is crucial, and I don’t give a damn how you look at it,” Cummings said, voice booming. “There are efforts to stop people from voting. That’s not right.”</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California) sent a “Dear Colleague” letter on Monday letting colleagues know of her intention to move HR 1 forward in the month of February. However, according to <em>Roll Call</em>, her spokesman Drew Hammill said she didn’t necessarily mean a<a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/house-will-vote-on-h-r-1-government-overhaul-package-this-month-pelosi-says"> floor vote</a> in February.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security sent a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/no-evidence-vote-hacking-election/"> report to the president</a> this week saying that there was “no evidence to date” that any foreign government had a material impact on voting machines or election infrastructure during the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
<p>According to a statement from acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker and Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, there is “no evidence to date that any identified activities of a foreign government or foreign agent had a material impact on the integrity or security of election infrastructure or political/campaign infrastructure used in the 2018 midterm election.”</p>
<p>The report to the president remains confidential.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>This week, The Democracy Fund released early results</strong> from a 2018 survey of local election officials. <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019_Elec_LEOSurveyBrief_v02-3.pdf">LEO Views on Voter Education and Access</a>: Perspectives from local election officials on their roles ( found, among other things, that compared to when they first started, most of the local election officials surveyed say that it is easier today for people to register and vote, and easier for them as election officials to administer registration and voting processes. Eighty-two percent either “somewhat” or “strongly agree” with the statement, “Compared to when I started, it is easier today for voters&#8230;to register to vote.” Nearly as many believe that it is easier for voters to find their polling place. Seventy-seven percent believe that it is easier for voters to choose to vote early in person or by mail. About as many also believe that it is easier for voters to vote, regardless of the mode of voting. Early results also found that an overwhelming majority of local election officials enjoy educating voters and demonstrate a commitment to conducting voter education and outreach. Local election officials also feel constrained by time and resources when planning for voter education and outreach activities and express the need for more funding.</p>
<p><strong>The North Carolina State Board of Elections</strong> has told county boards of elections that a request from U.S. Customs and Immigration (ICE) to hand over millions of voter records has been reduced to<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/article225626810.html"> 789 voter records</a>. Eastern North Carolina counties will turn over records of 289 voters, and the State Board of Elections will send 500 voters’ registration records, a memo to the counties said. According to the News &amp; Observer, a spokesman for the SBOE wouldn’t say how the 789 voters were selected.</p>
<p><strong>The best Super Bowl LIII commercial</strong> may not actually have aired during the Super Bowl at all. In honor of the annual adfest that also includes a football game, the Contra Costa County, California Elections released their own ad on YouTube touting the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me4AOYJ0E-c"> benefits of vote-by-mail</a>. We think it’s pretty great and there is even a meet cute at the end!</p>
<p><strong>Oregon Secretary of State Dennis Richardson announced this week</strong> he would<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/secretary-of-state-dennis-richardson-undergoing-cancer-treatment-scales-back-hours.html"> further scale back his hours</a> as he continues his battle with brain cancer. “Beginning this week, I will be scaling back my in-office hours to be able to rest and give my treatment every opportunity to succeed,” Richardson wrote in an email. “I will, of course, continue to be in frequent and regular contact with my staff that has been doing incredible work since the day we took office over two years ago. I will also continue to be the decision-maker on all important issues.” We wish Secretary Richardson well on his fight.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p><a href="https://lwvky.org/">The League of Women Voters of Kentucky</a> released a<a href="https://lwvky.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/final-2019-felon-voting-report-1-2019-pdf.pdf"> report on felony disenfranchisement in the commonwealth</a> in January. The report finds that Kentucky is one of three states that permanently disenfranchises persons with felony convictions from voting. The report highlights that 312,046 Kentuckians are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction, an increase of 67 percent since 2006, and that the rate of felony disenfranchisement in Kentucky is three times the national average.</p>
<p><a href="https://turnout.rocks/">The Turnout, LLC</a> issued a report on<a href="https://turnout.rocks/our-blog/mitigating-risks-uocava-voting/"> UOCAVA electronic ballot transmission</a> on February 4. The report’s recommendations seek to mitigate security risks regarding electronic transmission, including steps election officials can take related to ballot receipt verification, faxing and e-mailing of ballots, and ballot return portals.</p>
<p>The National States Geographic Information Council’s (NSGIC’s)<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/"> Geo-Enabled Elections</a> initiative released a<a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/Election_Director_Report.pdf"> report</a> summarizing its recent survey of 23 state election directors on geographic information systems (GIS) in elections. Among its findings, the report notes that while few of the surveyed states’ voter registration systems currently support geospatial information, most think that their systems will do so in the next five years. The report further explores voter address management practices, electoral jurisdiction and administration boundary data management, and transitioning to GIS.</p>
<p><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/">Freedom House</a> released its annual Freedom in the World report on February 4:<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat"> Democracy in Retreat: Freedom in the World 2019</a>. The report evaluates the state of freedom in 195 countries and 14 territories during 2018. While the report continues to score the United States as “free,” it finds a gradual erosion of democracy in the U.S. over the past eight years, highlighting attacks on the legitimacy of elections. The U.S. receives a score of 10 out of 12 for questions related to the electoral process.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://spsa.net/"> Southern Political Science Association</a> (SPSA) held its annual conference from January 17 to 19 in Austin. The<a href="https://spsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-SPSA-Preliminary-Program-6.0.pdf"> program</a> included several papers on election administration topics, one of which is summarized below.

The paper explores the role that variation in the applications of election administration can have on voter confidence, leveraging data from the Elections Performance Index (EPI) and the Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE). The paper finds that allowance of provisional ballots corresponds with an increase in voter confidence, while rejection of provisional ballots, rejection of absentee ballots, and longer wait times correspond with a decrease in voter confidence. Other variables examined by the study do not have a significant relationship.</li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Sen. J.D. Mesnard has introduced SB1484 that would allow anyone to call for a recount of any election as long as they can pay for the costs of the<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2019/02/05/bill-gives-recounts-to-anyone-who-can-pay/"> recount</a>.</p>
<p>A bill that would prohibit voters from<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2019/02/06/bill-banning-early-ballot-drop-offs-appears-doomed/"> dropping off early ballots at polling places</a> on Election Day appears to be headed for defeat. Although it was approved on a voice vote, it still needs a roll call vote and according to local media sources, there aren’t enough votes for a roll call passage.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> A bill that would have moved Hawaii to a top-two primary system will not receive a committee hearing and is effectively dead. A bill to move the entire state to a<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/02/effort-to-pump-up-voter-interest-in-elections-goes-nowhere-in-legislature/"> vote-by-mail</a> system is moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The House Elections Committee has voted down a proposal that would have allowed for<a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/house-republicans-block-no-excuse-absentee-voting.php"> no-excuse absentee voting</a>. According to Indiana Public Radio, House Elections Committee Chair Tim Wesco (R-Osceola) says the state should encourage in-person voting, whenever possible. “Absentee voting should, frankly, be discouraged, although allowed – that’s my personal position,” Wesco said.</p>
<p>The House Elections and Apportionment Committee heard testimony on behalf  House Bill 1311 that would move the deadline for<a href="https://www.goshennews.com/news/local_news/committee-considers-earlier-absentee-voting-deadline/article_a77bc7f7-9869-57ac-9fb1-7bd5a1c68d1a.html"> absentee ballots</a> from eight days before an election to 12 days.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The House Judiciary Committee has advanced Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal to automatically<a href="https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Panel-approves-Gov-Reynolds-bill-to-restore-felon-voting-rights-505169791.html"> restore voting rights to felons</a> after they’ve completed the terms of their sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Because the town of Mount Airy lies in both Carroll and Frederick counties, and there are Mount Airy ZIP codes in Howard and Montgomery counties, the town gets a handful of voters who think they are at the right polling place but are not and so the town council has unanimously approved the use of<a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/politics_and_government/elections/mount-airy-approves-provisional-ballot-ordinance/article_1b99e227-c31b-5e86-9e8a-3e8b76b864bd.html"> provisional ballots</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Rep. Jennifer Schultz (DFL-Duluth) has introduced a bill that would implement<a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4565815-duluth-lawmaker-advocates-bill-register-more-voters"> automatic voter registration</a> in Minnesota. Voters applying for a license, state ID or learner’s permit would have the option to opt-out.</p>
<p>Rep. Samantha Vang has introduced a bill that would change<a href="https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2019/02/lawmaker-looks-to-eliminate-one-of-minnesotas-peculiar-and-possibly-illegal-election-rules/"> who is allowed to help voters</a> who need assistance casting a ballot. Currently there are numerous restrictions on who may help a voter cast a ballot including no one person may help more than three people. Vang’s bill seeks to change that provision of the existing law.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Under Senate Bill 2806, it would get a bit easier for students to cast<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/31/msleg-bill-would-make-voting-easier-miss-college-students/2733678002/"> absentee ballots</a>. Under provisions of the proposed legislation, students would not need to get their absentee ballot notarized and they would be able to make one request for an absentee ballot for all elections in a calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> House Bill 26 and Senate Bill 109 would change the state’s open primary system to a<a href="http://www.dailystarjournal.com/news/local/house-senate-bills-would-change-primary-election-system-in-missouri/article_759371fa-92c9-565e-9e45-3ceb05dce8dc.html"> closed primary system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: A bill proposed by Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) would<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/05/new-bill-would-allow-nycha-to-register-voters/"> automatically register voters</a> when they deal with government agencies including public housing authorities. Voters would be automatically registered unless they declined within 21 days of receiving written notification from the board of elections.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: By a 78-13 vote, the House has defeated a bill that would have allowed college students to use<a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4564741-north-dakota-house-shoots-down-student-ids-voting"> university-issued IDs</a> to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: Sen. Gayle L. Goldin has introduced a bill that would allow<a href="https://www.thenewportbuzz.com/ri-senator-introduces-bills-to-give-17-yr-olds-the-right-to-vote-paid-time-off-to-vote-and-repeal-voter-id-law/17868"> 17-year-olds</a> to vote in primaries as long as they 18 by the time of the general election.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Rep. Pam Snyder (D-Jefferson) has introduced a bill that would allow for<a href="https://observer-reporter.com/news/localnews/snyder-introduces-bill-to-allow-early-voting/article_88dc13f2-2a25-11e9-afa5-d3e998c1fb71.html"> early voting</a> in the commonwealth and would eliminate the need to have an excuse in order to cast an absentee ballot.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Under House Bill 1178, the window for<a href="https://kelo.com/news/articles/2019/jan/31/republican-legislators-want-to-shorten-sds-early-voting/"> early voting</a> would go from 46 days to 14 days.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> According to <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and leaders of the agency that oversees the<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-dmv-voter-registration-election-results-settlement-20190205-story.html"> DMV</a> agreed to settle a federal lawsuit brought by advocacy groups including the League of Women Voters of California and the American Civil Liberties Union. The settlement, in part, states that Padilla’s office will “take steps to ensure that every vote is counted” if ballots were rejected and will provide “guidance to elections officials in the relevant jurisdiction(s) on how to count the affected ballots and, if appropriate, recertify election results.”</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Lawyers for the state have settled with the American Civil Liberties Union and the secretary of state’s office will pay the ACLU $20,000 for legal fees stemming from the fight over the state’s<a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article225263100.html"> proof-of-citizenship law</a>.</p>
<p>Also in Kansas, District Judge David Huber has ruled in favor of voting rights advocate Davis Hammet of Loud Light how had asked Johnson County election officials for the names those who cast a provisional ballot in the August 2018 and why their ballots were tossed. Huber ruled that the refusal to provide the names violated the<a href="http://www.ottawaherald.com/news/20190131/court-orders-kansas-elections-officer-to-disclose-records-on-dismissed-ballots/1"> Kansas Open Records Act</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The New Mexico Supreme Court has shot down a case brought by voters who argued it is unconstitutional to bar independents from casting ballots in<a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/new-mexico-supreme-court-primaries-will-stay-closed/article_4c255fc6-dad8-5fc6-93d1-ed0ed9b7712a.html"> party primaries</a>. In the order, the state’s highest court left that decision up to the Legislature.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> According to <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>, groups in Columbus and half a dozen other Ohio communities have filed suit in federal court after<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190204/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-stop-elections-boards-from-blocking-ballot-initiatives"> their efforts to place initiatives on local ballots</a> were blocked by elections boards. They’re hoping the federal court will do what state courts have not to date — rule that Ohio’s process for reviewing and potentially barring citizen-led initiatives from ballots is unconstitutional. The suit names Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, his predecessor and current Lieutenant Gov. Jon Husted, and the elections boards in each community, including all four Franklin County members.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: <em>The Providence Journal</em> has filed suit against Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea, alleging she<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190131/providence-journal-sues-secretary-of-state-for-access-to-full-voter-database"> violated the state’s open-records law</a> by denying the newspaper’s request for a digital copy of the Rhode Island voter database, with full names and birth dates of each voter.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Bernice Annette Garza, 44, has been charged with<a href="http://www.kurv.com/starr-county-woman-accused-of-using-deceased-persons-name-to-vote/"> voter impersonation</a>, illegal voting and providing false information. Garza, who was previously the director of the Crime Victims Unit of the Starr County District Attorney’s Office is accused of using the identity of a dead woman to cast a ballot in 2016.</p>
<p>The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in a case over Texas’s<a href="http://www.texasstandard.org/stories/news-roundup-fifth-circuit-court-hears-arguments-in-texas-motor-voter-case/"> motor voter law</a>. Under current law, the state only updates the voter registration of people who update their information in-person at a Department of Public Safety Office. Voters who update their licenses online are not able to update their voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Voting machine manufacturers Electronic Systems &amp; Software and Dominion Voting Systems are appealing a Wisconsin judge’s ruling allowing former Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s experts to comment on their<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/voting-machine-makers-appeal-wisconsin-nondisclosure-ruling/"> review of the state’s election software</a>.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Elections Administrator Linda Lamone announced this week that the state will use Intelishift, a Virginia-based data center, and its subsidiary, The Sidus Group, through Dec. 31 to<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-dpw-elections-data-20190204-story.html"> host the state’s election data</a>. The Sidus Group was previously a division of ByteGrid LLC which the FBI announced had ties to a Russian oligarch. According to <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>, neither Intelishift or ByteGrid responded to a request for comment on the transfer of ownership of The Sidus Group. “The State Board of Election is in the process of confirming with our federal government partners the corporate and financial background of Intelishift,” Lamone said in a statement according to the paper.</p>
