							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Comms 101</strong><br />
<em>Transparency is key to instilling confidence</em></p>
<p>By Alton P. Dillard II, communications director<br />
<a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-office-of-the-clerk-and-recorder.html">Office of the Clerk and Recorder-City and County of Denver</a></p>
<p>(<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This week we kick off a series of stories about the relevance of effective communications in elections. In addition to Alton’s story today, in future weeks we’ll cover websites, branding and more.)</p>
<p>The November 2006 General Election started out like any other Election Day, but as late morning approached, it became apparent that something was wrong.</p>
<p>With rumors swirling that there were “voting machine failures,” lines began to grow at our vote centers and before long, news helicopters were circling, injunctions were filed to keep the polls open past 7 p.m., and a delegation of our congresswoman and state representatives marched into our then-director’s office demanding answers.</p>
<p>A quick eyeball of a couple of vote centers showed that the voting machines were actually working, but that people weren’t able to get them to the voting machines at all because the e-poll books weren’t working. Lines stretched for blocks and hours.</p>
<p>I was on camera for almost a week straight trying to explain all of this, while having no information about the root cause of the issue. This was the front end of the debacle.</p>
<p>The back end of the debacle was the fact that there was a programming error so our scanners couldn’t’ read the ballot styles if they were fed in a mixed batch. Imagine standing in a room with boxes of ballots stacked to the ceiling and being told they would have to be manually sorted by ballot style prior to being fed into scanners. We laid out a bunch of bins and literally spent the following days sorting “three,” “seven,” “here’s a four.”</p>
<p>It was brutal, but the 2006 election also strengthened our bond and our organizational resolve to never put the voters over ourselves through this experience again and in a 2007 special election voters approved a measure to eliminate the 3-person election commission and create an elected clerk and recorder like other Colorado counties.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2019 and the<a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html"> Denver Elections Division</a> is recognized nationally and internationally as one of the top elections offices in existence because of the outstanding work done by our team of very talented professionals behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I’m considered the Dean of the Delegation of Elections Communicators in Colorado because I’ve specialized in election communications for 13 years. I’m also a former U.S. Senate press secretary who cut his crisis communication teeth when the senator I worked for switched parties midway through his term.</p>
<p>Those skills served me well when under the three-person election commission structure in 2006 the e-poll book failure resulted in blocks-long lines and thousands of people being turned away without voting. I was the public face of that debacle even though I was an outside consultant at the time.</p>
<p>In Colorado, a lot of our 64 county clerks are their own spokespeople, their own public face.</p>
<p>If we are honest with ourselves, the world of elections administration has been a panicky place since Florida 2000. In the current environment where all it takes are the words “hack,” or “line” to stampede the herd, it is imperative to have effective communications with your voters.</p>
<p>Regardless of the size of your jurisdiction, transparency is key to instilling confidence in how you administer elections. With the scrutiny elections officials are under, elections administration can no longer take place “behind the curtain.”</p>
<p>Ask yourself, is our election office set up for transparency for voters, watchers and media? Does your physical layout accommodate the highest level of transparency allowed by law? Do watchers and official observers have the access required to do their jobs? Does your elections office conduct tours for voters, elected officials, candidates, media and external stakeholders? The perception of lack of transparency in the voting process is one of the quickest ways to draw negative coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Local Media<br />
</strong>Denver is the state capital, but it’s also a Top 20 media market. We are literally a five-minute drive from five television stations and we garner a lot of print, radio and web publication coverage too.</p>
<p>In our current elections environment, it is imperative to have good relationships with the media. If your jurisdiction is in a larger media market, make sure to know the reporters that cover you, but also make sure you meet with the people who deploy those reporters.</p>
<p>Prior to every major election, I meet with the news directors, web content editors, producers, assignment desk editors, and editors at every local television state and newspaper. We also conduct a media tour before every election make sure media gets their questions answered so we can make sure that current and consistent information is being put out. Media tours allow TV stations to update their file footage. Nothing drives me crazier than seeing 400Cs in new stories when we haven&#8217;t used those in nearly five years. Even if the media in your jurisdiction is a small mom and pop newspaper, it is important to keep them informed.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media<br />
</strong>With social media, I can’t stress this enough. Go there, but only if you have the bandwidth to do so. Social media is only effective if you are prepared to treat it as two &#8211; way communications tool. You must be prepared to respond to voter inquiries and shoot down misinformation nearly 24-7, especially in live election mode. Incorrect information from your followers that sits on your social media feeds overnight because they aren’t checked until the next morning becomes a tough bell to unring.</p>
<p>The Denver Elections Division uses social media to let voters know everything from voting locations and hours, where we are deploying Haul-N-Votes, our mobile voting center, vote center wait times, the status and candidate and issue petitions, etc.  We also post videos of our ballot processing rooms, our post-election risk limited audit and canvass process and we encourage voters to snap selfies in front of our branded backdrop or a 24-hour ballot drop-off box and hashtag us to let us know they voted.</p>
<p>Because the general public doesn’t always differentiate between politics and election administration, we make it clear that our only concern is that people vote, not who or what they vote for. That keeps us from being tagged into political discussions for the most part.</p>
<p><strong>External Stakeholders<br />
</strong>It is also important to bring your external stakeholders to the table to help serve as your eyes and ears in the community you serve. We have an Elections Advisory Committee that consists of members from a cross section of the community. Local political party chairs, voting activists and advocates, League of Women Voters, Common Cause, Disability Law Colorado, Mayoral Commissions representing communities of color and the community of persons with disabilities and local elected officials are some of the interests that make up the membership of our EAC.</p>
<p>Denver is a<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/language-minority-citizens"> Section 203 County</a> under the United States Voting Rights Act due to our percentage of monolingual Spanish speakers.  We have ACCESO, a Spanish language advisory board that is codified in the same manner as a mayoral commission. We discuss everything from community outreach to the accuracy of the translations for our election materials with that group.</p>
<p>If it makes sense for your jurisdiction, consider hiring a professional communicator to lighten your load if you haven’t already. The first time I presented on media relations at the<a href="https://www.clerkandrecorder.org/"> Colorado County Clerks Association</a> Conference a few years ago everyone in my session was looking at me like I had two heads and asked me “does the media really cover you that much?” These days, I serve on the CCCA’s Public Information Committee along with Public Information Officers from other counties.</p>
<p>By the way, it’s okay to humblebrag as you tell your story. If you come up with an innovation that makes it easier for your customers to participate in the voting process while saving taxpayer money, tell your story. Have a 90-year-old election judge who has been voting since 1952? Tell her story. Putting some human faces on the voting process humanizes the process which will serve you well when things are going smoothly and even those occasions when they aren’t. Tell your story.</p>

							<h2>VVSG Public Comment</h2>
														<p>The <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>’s (EAC) four sitting commissioners unanimously voted to publish the proposed<a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf?fbclid=IwAR33Zx8yw13uW7T6uoJr8wZwYFOswqIC7tdbjHOfavjGuZATR366h28H-48"> Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 (VVSG) Principles and Guidelines</a> in the<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/"> Federal Register</a> for a 90 day public comment period, after which comments and feedback on the proposed document will be compiled and presented to the commissioners for discussion and consideration. [As of press time, the VVSG had not yet been posted in the Register, but it will be any day now.]</p>
<p>“Today’s unanimous vote demonstrates the Commissioners’ shared commitment to taking this next important step in consideration of the proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines. The EAC looks forward to holding hearings on these Principles and Guidelines soon and we encourage the public to provide their feedback on the proposed guidelines,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks, who joined Vice Chair Christy McCormick, Commissioner Ben Hovland and Commissioner Donald Palmer in supporting the measure.</p>
<p>The proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines will be published in the Federal Register in accordance with sections 222(a)(1) and 222(d) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. They will appear in the Federal Register for a period of 90 days. Separately, upon the completion of the VVSG 2.0’s accompanying Requirements developed by NIST and the EAC, those accompanying Requirements will also be subject to public review and comment, including distribution to the EAC’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), Standards Board and Board of Advisors. This review and comment period will take place prior to consideration and implementation by the commission.</p>
<p>VVSG are a set of Principles, Guidelines and Requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems meet required standards. Some factors examined under these tests include functionality, accessibility, accuracy, auditability and security capabilities.</p>
<p>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandates that EAC develop and maintain these requirements as well as testing and certifying voting systems. On December 13, 2005, the EAC unanimously adopted the 2005 VVSG, which significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities for individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. The 2005 guidelines updated and augmented the 2002 Voting System Standards, as required by HAVA, to address advancements in election practices and computer technologies. These guidelines were again updated by the EAC’s commissioners on March 31, 2015. These guidelines are voluntary. States may decide to adopt them entirely or in part prior to the effective date.</p>
<p>The structure of the new VVSG reflects modifications proposed by the election community, EAC, NIST and the TGDC, which is comprised of election officials, voting system manufacturers, disability experts, cyber security experts, technology experts, and other key election stakeholders. The new guidelines are a high level set of principles that will be supplemented by accompanying documents that detail specific requirements for how systems can meet the new guidelines and obtain certification. The supplemental documents will also detail assertions for how the accredited test laboratories will validate that a system complies with those requirements.</p>
<p>Last Spring, the EAC convened its advisory boards to review and comment on the adoption of the newest version of the voluntary guidelines, VVSG 2.0. Both Boards recommended that the EAC adopt VVSG 2.0. Today’s unanimous commissioner vote occurred less than two weeks after a quorum of commissioners was restored at the EAC.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>Last week<em> The Daily Beast</em> reported that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was<a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2019/02/14/dhs-cisa-foreign-influence.aspx"> scaling back on the work it is doing in election security</a>. The day after the report, which quoted numerous anonymous Department of Homeland Security officials, CISA Director Chris Krebs held a conference call with reporters to clarify the report. According to FCW, Krebs didn&#8217;t deny that personnel levels for the task forces were reduced. He characterized the task forces as temporary vehicles to address an emerging threat while CISA worked to hire staff and build more permanent institutional capacity to tackle the issue.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>NC9:</strong> The North Carolina Board of Elections held a hearing this week to get to the bottom of<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article226333780.html"> what happened</a> in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District and determine whether or not a new election needs to be held. &#8220;The evidence will show that a<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/18/694429029/north-carolina-to-decide-as-early-as-monday-if-new-house-election-is-needed"> coordinated, unlawful, and substantially-resourced absentee ballot scheme</a> operated during the 2018 general election,&#8221; North Carolina State Board of Elections Executive Director Kim Strach, said in her opening statement  Numerous voters testified that they<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article226263495.html"> turned over their ballots</a>, completed and blank, to a political operative. During the hearing two poll workers admitted to<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article226456615.html"> tallying early voting results</a> on the Saturday in advance of the election. While the hearing was initially only set to last for two days, it continued into Wednesday where John Harris, the son of Republican candidate Mark Harris testified that he repeatedly told his father about his concerns about the political operative hired to run the<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article226492265.html"> absentee ballot campaign</a> in Bladen County.</p>
<p><strong>If you see something, say something</strong>. Last November one Hamden, Connecticut voter noticed that a candidate he was eager to vote for was not on the ballot he was handed. His inquiry set in motion an investigation that discovered from 2012 to 2018 voters in about 25 houses along a one-mile section of one street were most likely<a href="https://www.ctpost.com/politics/article/Election-glitch-uncovers-longstanding-error-in-13611655.php"> issued the wrong ballot in every election</a>. Following the discovery, Secretary of State Denise Merrill has announced plans to introduce legislation to<a href="https://www.ctpost.com/politics/article/Hamden-mix-up-sparks-call-for-audit-of-all-13616543.php"> audit the election records</a> of all Connecticut towns to make sure this was not happening elsewhere. “It was certainly a wake-up call,” Merrill told the Connecticut Post. “It may be a bigger problem than we realized.”</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster has<a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/gov-mcmaster-could-remove-elections-board-in-sc-s-capital/article_8a014248-3079-11e9-9a2f-736ca01e60d0.html"> removed all four members of the Richland County Elections Board</a></strong>. The move comes after it was discovered that 1,040 votes were not counted in November and the county director of elections resigned. “South Carolinians’ confidence in the lawful and professional oversight of elections must never be jeopardized,” McMaster said after issuing an executive order for the removal. “The repeated actions and behavior of these officials are wholly unacceptable and cannot be tolerated,” McMaster’s message said according to the Post and Courier. “To regain and maintain Richland County voters’ confidence at the ballot box, the entire board must be replaced with new leadership.” The Richland County legislative delegation will send new appointments to the governor for final approval.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee Elections Coordinator Mark Goins has issued a memorandum opinion</strong> that says Shelby County elections commission<a href="https://dailymemphian.com/article/3129/Tennessee-elections-coordinator-rules-out-instant-runoff-voting-for-2019-Memphis-elections"> may not use instant runoff voting</a> in October’s Memphis elections. According to the Daily Memphian, the opinion concludes that the election commission cannot implement IRV under existing law. “Even if instant-runoff voting were authorized by state law, questions remain whether the proposed procedures would comply with Article 2, Section 7 of Memphis City Charter, although the coordinator cannot authoritatively interpret the charter,” Goins ruled. Goins’ formal order is the same as what he advised the election commission in September 201. The state elections coordinator’s directives are considered the final word for election commissions unless or until they are challenged in court and the Shelby County Election Commission has announced that it<a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2019/02/20/shelby-county-instant-runoff-voting-memphis/2928065002/"> will not challenge the ruling</a>.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE)<a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr"> Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights</a> (ODIHR) released the<a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/411251"> final report</a> of its limited election observation mission (LEOM) for the 2018 U.S. mid-term elections last week. The LEOM assessed compliance of the election process with OSCE commitments and other international obligations and standards for democratic elections, as well as with national legislation. The report puts forwards 37 recommendations, including 9 priority recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to ensure the right and opportunity to vote of all citizens, Congress should, without further delay, establish the formula for determining jurisdictions to be subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, in line with the ruling in Shelby County v. Holder.</li>
<li>Citizens resident in the District of Columbia and U.S. overseas territories should be provided with full representation rights in Congress.</li>
<li>Restrictions on voting rights for persons with criminal convictions should be reviewed to ensure that all limitations are proportionate and that rights be restored upon completion of sentences. Guidance should be clearly and systematically communicated to those affected by any limitations. Pre-trial detainees should be afforded with the means to vote.</li>
<li>States should consider establishing independent bodies to draw district boundaries. Districting should respect the equality of the vote, not discriminate against any group, and be free from political influence. Districts should be determined well in advance of an election, following broad public consultations and allowing adequate time for potential judicial review.</li>
<li>Federal legislation should be amended to require disclosure of the sources of funding of all non-profit organizations that engage in campaign activities.</li>
<li>States should review their laws and practices to ensure that deprivation of the right to vote for persons with intellectual disabilities or those under guardianship is based on individualized assessment and not subject to blanket disenfranchisement. Data on guardianship and deprivation of voting rights should be collated on an ongoing basis to ensure oversight.</li>
<li>Effective measures should be taken to ensure the safety of journalists and media, including protection against threats, intimidation, and violence.</li>
<li>The federal and state governments should provide sufficient and sustainable funding mechanisms to replace aging voting equipment and to improve cyber security.</li>
<li>Legislation should be amended to guarantee access to international observers invited by the U.S. authorities for all stages of the electoral process, to ensure full compliance with OSCE commitments.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://voatz.com/">Voatz</a> released a<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/FormSearch/Elections/Informational/West-Virginia-Mobile-Voting-White-Paper-NASS-Submission.pdf"> white paper on West Virginia’s UOCAVA mobile voting pilot project</a> earlier this month. The paper describes Secretary of State Mac Warner’s goals for the project, lessons learned, and how the system worked. In the 24 counties included in the 2018 general election pilot, among the 183 individuals submitted Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) forms requesting “email or online” ballot delivery, 160 (87 percent) completed the mobile application download, 147 completed the authentication process, and 144 submitted a ballot, all of which were accepted and counted.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://civicyouth.org/"> Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement</a> (CIRCLE) released a report on voter participation among low income youth in October 2018:<a href="https://civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/guide_election_participation_low_income_youth.pdf"> Expanding the Electorate: How Simple Changes in Election Administration Can Improve Voter Participation Among Low-Income Youth</a>. CIRCLE partnered with Opportunity Youth United to conduct a survey of socioeconomically disadvantaged young persons across six states (Arizona, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Washington). The survey finds that: time, transportation, and other logistical challenges deter youth from voting; confusion over voter identification and voter disenfranchisement is widespread; polling places can intimidate young people; and lack of election information is a persistent problem. To support voting among low-income youth, the report recommends: expanding access to essential information, such as precinct locations, voting schedules, and identification requirements; understanding that young people move a lot; recruiting young, paid poll workers; and supporting a culture of voting.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The Government Administration and Elections Committee heard testimony on several bills including bills that would<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2019/02/15/lawmakers-take-up-bills-to-strengthen-felons-voting-rights-change-inmate-count-practice/"> restore voting rights</a> to convicted felons on parole, no longer require those formerly incarcerated to pay all fines to regain their voting rights and grant voting rights to some currently serving prison time.</p>
<p>The committee is also considering a bill that would make the Tuesday after the first Monday in November a<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/politics/State-to-Consider-Making-Election-Day-a-State-Holiday-505883641.html"> holiday</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Under House Bill 316, the state’s aging voting system would be replaced with<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/bill-replace-georgia-voting-machines-introduced/hFjDG3asWfmxI7ugnJMSIO/"> touchscreen machines</a> that print ballots before they are counted. The bill follows the recommendations of the voting commission appointed by then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp.

It would also enroll Georgia in<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-could-join-effort-cancel-more-out-state-voter-registrations/5Nht3ZSZTtwkbGXt6Z0HaO/"> ERIC</a>.</p>

<p>Sen.

<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: This week the House approved two voter registration bills. Under one bill, residents would be<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1282869/amid-procedural-fights-house-passes-voter-registration-bill.html"> automatically registered</a> to vote when conducting business at the DMV.

According to WCPO, The motion specifically proposes that city administration provide an ordinance to include general election day as an official city holiday, &#8220;for the purpose of allowing city employees the opportunity to fully participate in the democratic process &#8212; including, but not limited to, casting a ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Sen. Shemia Fagan has introduced a bill that would<a href="https://www.eastoregonian.com/news/local/effort-underway-to-lower-voting-age-in-oregon-to/article_d2b36c9e-33d2-11e9-afcd-977cd270c4e6.html"> lower the state’s voting age</a> to 16. The bill would be a change to the state’s constitution which would ultimately require the measure to be put before the voters. “It’s time to lower the voting age in Oregon and to give our young people a chance to participate in the ballot, about their decisions that affect their homes, their clean air, their future, their schools and as we’ve seen, their very lives,” Fagan said according to East Oregonian.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Under HB1273 and SB 1500 voters would be required to register for a specific political party then only be permitted to vote in said party’s<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/tennessee-elections-bill-close-primaries-require-voter-registration-party-advances/2926847002/"> primary</a>.</p>

The Senate passed unanimously approved the measure as well.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The General Assembly has approved a bill that would allow<a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/general-assembly-approves-bill-to-allow-some-no-excuse-absentee/article_d7d278a9-e707-5c67-aa26-8424ef8feccb.html"> no-excuse absentee voting</a> but only starting on the second Saturday before an election and ending at 5 p.m. on the Saturday immediately preceding the election.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> The Libertarian Party of Alabama has sued Secretary of State John Merrill because Merrill’s office is<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/02/libertarian-party-sues-john-merrill-over-34000-charge-for-voter-list.html"> charging the party about $34,000 for a voter list</a> provided to the Democratic and Republican parties for free. According to <em>Alabama.com</em>, Merrill said he is following state law in applying the charge, which he said is based on one cent per voter name.</p>
<p>Also in Alabama, former Gordon Mayor Elbert Melton has been convicted of<a href="https://www.oanow.com/apwire/news/state/ex-mayor-convicted-of-voter-fraud-sentenced-to-year-in/article_0512f0e4-7bf9-5432-ae31-a7bf09840532.html"> voter fraud</a> and sentenced to one year in jail with two years of probation.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The U.S. Department of Justice and Connecticut have reached a memorandum of understanding that calls for state election officials to coordinate with the state Public Health Department to<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Feds-Connecticut-Reach-Deal-on-Identifying-Voters-Who-Died-505909131.html"> remove dead people</a> from the statewide voter database.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has sided with a lower court and ruled that a Florida law requiring<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-mail-in-signature-court-ruling-20190215-story.html"> voters’ signatures on mail-in ballots</a> to match the signatures on file with elections officials imposes “a serious burden on the right to vote.” In the 2-1 ruling Justice Robin Rosenbaum wrote, “Florida allows each county to apply its own standards and procedures for executing the signature-match requirement, virtually guaranteeing a crazy quilt of enforcement of the requirement from county to county.”</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate has ruled that secretary of state candidate Carl Nett<a href="https://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Judge-Carl-Nett-cant-use-Trump-nickname-on-ballot-506001731.html"> may not use a nickname on the ballot</a>. Nett wanted to use Trump as a nickname. According to WKYT, The state allows candidates to have a nickname printed on the ballot but only if they submit an affidavit under oath attesting it is his or her real nickname, and they are not using it to gain an advantage. The court ruled Nett doesn&#8217;t have a legal right to use the nickname, and his constitutional rights aren&#8217;t being violated.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Minnesota Voters Alliance sued the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis in federal court claiming that city codes requiring the cities to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/landlords-claim-twin-cities-voter-law-violates-their-free-speech/"> provide voter registration information to tenants</a> violates the landlord’s First Amendment right to free speech and forces them to carry the government’s “ideological message” to tenants.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Chief U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III has granted class certification in a lawsuit filed on behalf of five men who say the<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2019/02/15/felony-voting-ban-lawsuit-could-now-affect-30000-disenfranchised-mississippians/"> state stripped them of their voting rights</a> by using laws they say violate the Constitution. According to <em>Mississippi Today</em>, the judge’s rulings on the suit could now affect not just the five named plaintiffs, but any person who is convicted of a disqualifying crime and who has completed the term of incarceration, supervised release, parole and/or probation for the conviction.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> This week, District Judge Fred Biery heard part of a legal challenge to the state’s<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/02/19/state-lawyers-defend-handling-texas-voter-citizenship-review/"> noncitizen list</a>. During arguments on behalf of the government, Assistant Attorney General Chris Hilton seemed to blame local elections officials for sending out notices to voters insisting that the list from the secretary of state’s office was just an advisory.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> David Kitowski, 70 of Wausau had been charged with<a href="https://waow.com/news/2019/02/19/case-dismissed-in-wausau-voter-fraud-case/"> voter fraud</a> for mailing in ballots on behalf of his dead mother in the April and August 2018 elections. At a competency hearing it was established that Kitowski would not be found competent to stand trial and the charges were dismissed.</p>
