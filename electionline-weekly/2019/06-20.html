							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Elaine Manlove</strong><br />
<em>Life’s a beach for outgoing Delaware elections commissioner</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3990" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Delaware-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Delaware-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Delaware-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Delaware.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For two decades, Elaine Manlove has worked in elections in Delaware. She started out as director of the <a href="https://electionsncc.delaware.gov/">Department of Elections in New Castle County</a> for eight years and for the past 12 years she’s been <a href="https://elections.delaware.gov/index.shtml">The First State’s Election Commissioner</a>. June 30th will be her last day.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the EAC, I want to congratulate Elaine Manlove on her retirement and thank her for her leadership and dedication to running excellent elections in Delaware,” said <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “I also want to extend special thanks and appreciation for her service to the EAC Standards Board over many years. She will be missed and we wish her all the best in her next adventure!”</p>
<p>It was while Manlove was in office that Delaware set the wheels in motion for what many now call automatic voter registration. The state created a system that allows voters to have registration information transmitted in real-time from the Division of Motor Vehicles to each county elections office.</p>
<p>“Elaine and I have spent many years together in the wonderful world of election administration,” said <a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2018/index.html">Maryland</a> Administrator of Elections Linda Lamone. “Throughout that time she has been a valued ally and neighbor. Elaine graciously worked with the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration to help it move towards electronic transmission of voter registration data to the Maryland State Board of Elections.</p>
<p>During her tenure Delaware became second state to join <a href="https://ericstates.org/">ERIC</a> and Manlove also served on the ERIC board.</p>
<p>In addition, Delaware recently implemented <a href="https://ivote.de.gov/">iVOTE.DE.GOV</a>, a voter portal allowing citizens to complete voter registration applications online, update their voter registration information, request an absentee ballot, track that ballot once it has been returned and find who represents them as well as their polling place.</p>
<p>“We’ve all benefitted from the work Elaine did in Delaware and we’ve all enjoyed Elaine’s sharp sense of humor and joie de vivre,” said Keith Ingram, president of the <a href="https://www.nased.org/">National Association of State Election Directors</a> and director of elections for the Texas secretary of state. “The voters of Delaware – and NASED – have been lucky to have her!”</p>
<p>Thanks for everything Elaine! We’ll miss you. Enjoy the beach!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why have you decided to retire at this time?<br />
</strong></em>First of all, I’m old and it’s time for someone else to take over.  My term ends in 2020, but I don’t think it’s fair to the next person to be on the learning curve in a Presidential Election year.  In addition, I have grandchildren and I would like to spend more time with them. Also, I live at the beach and never get to sit on the beach during the week!</p>
<p><em><strong>What are you most proud of during your tenure as Delaware Election Commissioner?<br />
</strong></em>I have a great IT team and because of them, we were able to solve a problem that I thought was unique to Delaware – not getting everything from DMV.  We developed what we call e-signature so that all voter registrations and declinations would come electronically from DMV to the Elections office in real time.  We saw it only as a solution to our problem and we never envisioned that it would morph into Automatic Voter Registration. I still think e-signature is better because voters have completed everything when they leave DMV.  We don’t have to send out follow up information which is an added expense and not always effective. On the e-signature platform, we built online voter registration and also eliminated all paper applications that come to our offices by scanning in the signed application and electronically linking it to the application in the system.  These changes dramatically improved the way we do business.</p>
<p>More recently, there was a huge task on my to-do list that had been on my radar for some time and was finally completed on my way out the door!  We purchased a new voting system, electronic poll books, a new absentee system and are moving our voter registration system from the state’s aging mainframe.  Delaware is no longer one of five states without a paper trail!!</p>
<p><em><strong>With all due respect to Oregon, Delaware under your leadership really lead the way for automatic voter registration. What are your thoughts on how far we&#8217;ve come on AVR and how far we still have to go?<br />
</strong></em>As I said, I believe Delaware was the frontrunner in AVR even if we don’t automatically register everyone.  Motor voter is federal law but we need to make it easy for everyone and that starts with DMV. DMV is the touch point for most citizens and it often seems like they are the point of contact for anything and everything that government needs to get to citizens.  I know e-signature makes it easier for the staff at DMV. It’s just a win-win: a cost saver, a time-saver, and a simple and efficient way to register citizens to vote. I would love to sit down with every DMV director in the country and explain that this makes it easier for their agencies.  The amazing DMV Director that worked with us saw that right away!</p>
<p><em><strong>How would you recommend getting elections officials in smaller or more remote jurisdictions to get involved in the conversation of where modernization is going nationally?<br />
</strong></em>I believe organizations like The Election Center are critical to smaller jurisdictions.  When I started in Elections 20 years ago, I knew absolutely nothing about how the election system worked.  I had been a political volunteer and my only involvement was getting “my team” to the polling place. I never thought about who hired those poll workers or how those machines got to the polling place.  I learned first from the team in my office, but then also from other election officials around the country. For instance, I copied Student Poll Workers from Connie Schmidt. I learned as much during lunchtime discussions at events as I did during the formal sessions.  Election officials are happy to share what works for them and I was happy to take what would work in Delaware.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there anything that you weren&#8217;t able to accomplish during your years of service that you wish you had?<br />
</strong></em>I wish I had been able to upgrade more of the staff members in our offices.  Unfortunately, the world thinks we work only 2 days every other year. Our staffers no longer file papers – everything is electronic so a different skill-set is required.  I have worked on many upgrades but there are many more that need to be done.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could design the perfect elections system, what would it look like?<br />
</strong></em>I think it would look like what Delaware just purchased.  We have always voted on a full-face ballot – first the old lever machines, then a full-faced DRE.  Our new system has a full-faced ballot as well as a paper trail. It’s the best of both worlds – no culture shock of handing a Delaware voter a piece of paper and telling them to fill in the circle!!  Also, electronic poll books have been on my wish list since the initial HAVA funding. We now have them!</p>
<p><em><strong>Any words of advice for someone just getting started in the elections business?</strong></em><br />
Learn from those around you – first in your own office.  I was fortunate to start with a great team in New Castle County who were already ahead of the curve.  Also, interact with your peers. I learned so much from people who are doing my job in other states. It’s invaluable – no need to make mistakes that someone else already has!  And be open and honest with the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s next for you, other than sleep in in on Election Day?<br />
</strong></em>It will be a little scary not to have firm deadlines!  I plan to spend much more time with my family, do more traveling and be able to sit on the beach and read a book whenever I want!  I do hope to keep in touch with my “Elections” friends. It’s been a way of life for me for 20 years and one I know I will miss!</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Led by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, 22 Democratic state attorneys general sent a letter to the leaders from each party of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Rules Committee demanding that they</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/449099-state-attorneys-general-demand-that-congress-take-action-on-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work together to bolster election security in the states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our state and local election officials are on the front-lines of the fight to protect our election infrastructure, but they lack the resources necessary to combat a sophisticated foreign adversary like Russia,” they wrote according to <em>The Hill</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <em>The Hill</em>, the letter also asked that Congress “support the establishment of cybersecurity and audit standards for election systems,” and argued that the federal government needs to keep state election officials informed about suspected breaches and other security intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-slams-mcconnell-blocking-election-security-legislation-n1018836"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> war of words over election security legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continued this week when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell (R-Kentucky) for his failure to move any of the legislation forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Republican Senate, Leader McConnell just stands there and twiddles their thumbs and almost says, ‘Come on Putin, let it happen,&#8217;” said Schumer, who added that any leader in Congress who doesn’t work to protect the nation’s elections is “abdicating their responsibilities to our grand democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer said that Democrats have a three-pronged strategy to</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/politics/lisa-murkowski-mcconnell-oppose-election-security-proposals/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get the legislation moving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Press McConnell to allow debate on legislation that’s been introduced by holding standalone votes on those bills;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Press McConnell to allow votes on amendments for the 2020 defense policy bill; and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push for election security funding as part of negotiations for a two-year deal to life spending ceilings.</span></li>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R)</strong> are</span><a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190618/ohio-and-michigan-secretaries-of-state-come-together-to-encourage-civility"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joining forces in a quest for civility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The freshman secretaries will work with the National Institute for Civil Discourse and co-chair a civility task force. At the upcoming National Association of Secretaries of State meeting they plan to invite other secretaries to join them. “Civility is not just about being nicer to each other. That’s part of it,” LaRose said according to The Columbus Dispatch. “But it’s about creating the opportunity to govern. &#8230; We want to lead the way and we want to encourage our fellow secretaries of state to lead the way in speaking out against misinformation and some of the partisan hyperbole around elections administration.” Secretaries of state who sign on to the task force will be able to decide how they pursue civility in their own state, but LaRose said he has some ideas, including offering reporters a chance to watch a mock election to better understand election security and running “mythbusting” operations that seek to dispel inaccurate claims about elections. “My hope is we can rise above the level of discourse our politics has oftentimes has sunk to and at the moment of this uniquely contentious presidential election cycle lead the way to collaboration and restoring the public’s faith in democracy,” Benson said according to the paper. No word yet though on whether the civility will be put aside for just a few hours on Nov. 30 when the Buckeyes take on the Wolverines on the gridiron.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It seems like just about every year</strong> in electionline Weekly’s annual In &amp; Out list we make a joke about lever voting machines finally being out. Well, this year may finally be the last year we can make that joke because the town of Middletown, Connecticut has retired its</span><a href="https://www.middletownpress.com/middletown/article/Middletown-retires-its-last-working-14006614.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last working lever voting machine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The people who invented those must have been brilliant,” Bobby Russo who used to service the city’s lever-voting machines said to the Middletown Press. Like many of his generation, Russo looks fondly on the lever-voting machine days. “When they voted, and heard the bell go off, you would hear that ‘Bing!’ And they knew that they voted,” Russo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It is estimated that approximately 300,000 women in Utah</strong> who are eligible to voter aren’t registered. In recognition of the centennial celebration of Suffrage and the 150th anniversary of suffrage in Utah, the Utah League of Women Voters and Voterise have partnered together in</span><a href="https://www.kpcw.org/post/300000-utah-women-are-eligible-vote-arent-registered#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effort to get 20,000 more women registered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the November 2020 election. The groups plan to recruit 1,000 ambassadors and train them in voter registration techniques.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Well this is certainly going to be featured</strong> in a future “Polling Place Profile” in electionline Weekly. The Barton County, Kansas commission recently approved to pave the parking lot at the</span><a href="https://www.gbtribune.com/news/local-news/bsco-firing-range-double-voting-site/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sheriff’s Firing Range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so the building may be used as a polling place. When discussing the project, Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Schwartz confirmed that the firing range would not be used during voting times. And during the time of voting it would not be used as a firing range,” Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Schartz commented. “Exactly right,” County Clerk Donna Zimmerman said according to the Great Bend Tribune.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It’s not the heat, it’s the humidity!</strong> Or in the case of a polling place, in August, in Meridian, Mississippi it will be both</span><a href="https://www.meridianstar.com/news/local_news/county-city-look-for-ways-to-cool-frank-cochran-center/article_4de98ed5-ab25-51ef-8c68-f7b61d2ac282.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if something isn’t done to fix the site’s air conditioning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “My poll workers almost had a heat stroke [in 2018],” said Election Commission Gloria Dancy. “It’s an emergency. That’s the reason I’m here today. I can’t ask these people to go in that building in August.” Supervisor Joe Norwood acknowledged the problem. “We have to do whatever we have to do — whether it’s moving in portable air conditioners (or) something of that nature, we’re going to make it happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A hearty get well</strong> to Ionia County, Michigan Clerk</span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/06/13/second-county-clerk-hurt-motorcycle/39580807/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Janae Cooper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who broke her leg while riding a motorcycle.</span></p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/"> Congressional Research Service</a> (CRS) released a<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45770"> report</a> and accompanying<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10981"> “in-focus” brief</a> on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) last week. The report, The U.S. Election Assistance Commission: Overview and Selected Issues for Congress, provides an overview of the EAC’s duties, structure, and funding over time, as well as a brief history of the agency. The report further summarizes recent relevant legislative activity, including proposals to terminate the agency, expand its authority, and change the way it works, teeing up issues for the current Congress to consider.</p>
<p>CRS is a part of the Library of Congress, providing legislative research and analysis for congressional committees and Members of Congress. In September 2018, CRS<a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2018/09/trending-congressional-research-service-reports-now-available-online/"> began</a> making its reports available to the public online.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.usccr.gov/"> U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a> released a<a href="https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2019/06-13-Collateral-Consequences.pdf"> briefing report</a> last week on collateral consequences imposed on persons with criminal convictions. The report, Collateral Consequences: The Crossroads of Punishment, Redemption, and the Effects on Communities, includes a chapter on voting and civic participation. The chapter explores policy variation on voting rights restoration among the states, estimates of those disenfranchised today and in recent years, the history of felony disenfranchisement in the country, arguments for and against the practice, and legal challenges.</p>
<p>The report’s recommendations relevant to election administration and policy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The United States Department of Justice should issue guidance sharing best practices related to collateral consequences of criminal convictions, clarifying at minimum the following points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>States should consider restoration of the right to vote to all people who have been released from incarceration or are on probation/parole and are currently disenfranchised because of criminal convictions. Denying the right to vote does not serve the public safety or interest.</li>
<li>States should notify people disenfranchised because of a criminal conviction when their right to vote is or can be restored, if restored automatically when that occurs, or what steps they must undertake to restore their right to vote. In states where the right to vote is restored upon release from incarceration or completion of supervision, an opportunity to register to vote and assistance to complete the process should be included as part of the completion of the exit process from prison, parole, or probation.</li>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Louisiana:</strong> <em>The Associated Press</em> reports this week that what little money lawmakers had put aside to</span><a href="https://www.businessreport.com/newsletters/voting-machines-stalled"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchase new statewide voting equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been reshuffled and moved elsewhere in what the AP called “an election-year legislative scramble to boost spending on education, public safety and health care.” Lawmakers previously had put $2 million in state financing into a voting technology fund, as a down payment on a machine replacement expected to cost tens of millions of dollars, now even that money is gone. Work will begin anew in 2020 to find the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill into law that will allow for</span><a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/automatic-voter-registration-bill-signed-into-law/28107865"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Maine will automatically register voters who do business with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles by 2022 under the bill, which has a one-time cost of $140,000 in federal funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Maine, this week the House joined the Senate in approving a bill that would allow the state to expand the use of</span><a href="https://www.wabi.tv/content/news/Lawmakers-pass-ranked-choice-voting-for--511530302.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to presidential primary and general elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> By an 11-2 vote, the Springfield City Council approved an ordinance that, if funded, would mean that</span><a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2019/06/springfield-city-council-approves-postcards-touting-election-day-but-funding-in-question.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> postcards will be sent to all Springfield voters ahead of municipal elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to remind them of the upcoming election. Under the ordinance, registered voters will receive a city notice no later than 20 days prior to a municipal election that will include the date of the election, the polling location of the household, and the elective offices that will appear on the ballot. However, Mayor Domenic J. Sarno has</span><a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/06/springfield-mayor-domenic-sarno-vetoes-ordinance-calling-for-election-reminder-postcards.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ordinance comparing to public campaign financing.</span></p>

The bill also moves forward automatic voter registration, which was approved by voters in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The Albuquerque city council has rejected a bill to amend a city ordinance to allow for the implementation of</span><a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1329804/city-council-turns-down-move-to-use-rankedchoice-voting-ex-but-voters-may-get-their-say-on-the-issue-in-november.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The bill would make voter registration an “opt-out” option when interacting with state agencies and the Department of Motor Vehicles. The bill next moves to the full Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oregon:</strong> Senate Bill 861 is on its way to the full Ways and Means Committee after a subcommittee approved it this week.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The State Government Committee has advanced Senate Bill 422 that would create an</span><a href="https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20190619/state-senate-committee-passes-sen-vogels-election-law-advisory-board-bill-in-party-line-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election law advisory board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would identify statutory language that can be repealed or modified collaborating with agencies and political subdivisions to study election-related issues, studying new election technology, evaluating the electoral process, identifying best practices to ensure voting integrity and efficiency, publishing an annual report on the Pennsylvania Department of State’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Although</span><a href="http://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2019/06/spending-authorized-for-automatic-voter-registration-project-with-counties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was approved several years ago, there was never any money in place to implement it. Now the Legislature, by an 87-9 vote has approved Senate Bill 1015 that gives the secretary of state’s office authority to spend $1.5 million for technology improvements that will allow for AVR.</span></p>
