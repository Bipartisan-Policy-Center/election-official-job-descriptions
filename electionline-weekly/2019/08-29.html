							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>End of summer doesn’t mean end of reading</strong><br />
<em>Book recommendations to prepare for the centennial of suffrage</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>This week marks the 99th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment which ultimately gave women the right to vote.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer, in electionline Weekly and the Daily News, we’ve been highlighting what groups have been doing to celebrate the upcoming centennial of suffrage. In<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/05-30/"> May</a> we highlighted several national exhibits focusing on the centennial. In<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/06-06/"> June</a> we asked the nation’s top female election officials to talk about what suffrage means to them.</p>
<p>This week, although summer reading season unofficially ends this weekend, we thought we would highlight a handful of books about suffrage that you can add to your reading list.</p>
<p>From Elaine Weiss’” The Woman’s Hour”, which reads like a page turning novel about the race to get the last state necessary — Tennessee — to ratify the 19th Amendment, to Faye E. Dudden’s “Fighting Chance” which looks at the divide between white and black suffragists to Sen. Kristen Gilibrand’s “Bold and Brave,” a book for young adults, we’ve tried to offer you a little bit of everything. And just for kicks we’ve also included information about “The Woman Suffrage Cook Book” because old recipes are fun to explore.</p>
<p>Happy  reading!</p>

<p>Nashville, August 1920. Thirty-five states have approved the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote; one last state&#8211;Tennessee&#8211;is needed for women&#8217;s voting rights to be the law of the land. The suffragists face vicious opposition from politicians, clergy, corporations, and racists who don&#8217;t want black women voting. And then there are the &#8220;Antis&#8221;&#8211;women who oppose their own enfranchisement, fearing suffrage will bring about the nation&#8217;s moral collapse. And in one hot summer, they all converge for a confrontation, replete with booze and blackmail, betrayal and courage. Following a handful of remarkable women who led their respective forces into battle, The Woman&#8217;s Hour is the gripping story of how America&#8217;s women won their own freedom, and the opening campaign in the great twentieth-century battles for civil rights.</p>

March 5, 2019</p>
<p>Comprised of historical texts spanning two centuries, The Women&#8217;s Suffrage Movement is a comprehensive and singular volume with a distinctive focus on incorporating race, class, and gender, and illuminating minority voices. This one-of-a-kind intersectional anthology features the writings of the most well-known suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, alongside accounts of those often overlooked because of their race, from Native American women to African American suffragists like Ida B. Wells and the three Forten sisters. At a time of enormous political and social upheaval, there could be no more important book than one that recognizes a group of exemplary women&#8211;in their own words&#8211;as they paved the way for future generations. The editor and introducer, Sally Roesch Wagner, is a pre-eminent scholar of the diverse backbone of the women&#8217;s suffrage movement, the founding director of the Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation, and serves on the New York State Women&#8217;s Suffrage Commission.</p>

Oxford University Press<br />
Reprint edition (April 1, 2014)</p>
<p>The advocates of woman suffrage and black suffrage came to a bitter falling-out in the midst of Reconstruction, when Elizabeth Cady Stanton opposed the Fifteenth Amendment for granting black men the right to vote but not women. How did these two causes, so long allied, come to this? This book offers answers to this question and reveals that racism was not the only cause, but that the outcome also depended heavily on money and political maneuver. The book shows that Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, believing they had a fighting chance to win woman suffrage after the Civil War, tried but failed to exploit windows of political opportunity, especially in Kansas. When they became most desperate, they succeeded only in selling out their long-held commitment to black rights and their invaluable friendship and alliance with Frederick Douglass.</p>

Rosalyn Terborg-Penn<br />
Indiana University Press<br />
Second Printing edition (May 22, 1998)</p>
<p>This comprehensive look at the African American women who fought for the right to vote analyzes the women’s own stories and examines why they joined and how they participated in the U.S. women’s suffrage movement. Terborg-Penn shows how every political and racial effort to keep African American women disfranchised met with their active resistance until black women finally achieved full citizenship.</p>

Susan Ware<br />
Belknap Press: An Imprint of Harvard University Press<br />
May 6, 2019</p>
<p>For far too long, the history of how American women won the right to vote has been told as the tale of a few iconic leaders, all white and native-born. But Susan Ware uncovered a much broader and more diverse story waiting to be told. Why They Marched is a tribute to the many women who worked tirelessly in communities across the nation, out of the spotlight, protesting, petitioning, and insisting on their right to full citizenship.</p>
<p>Ware tells her story through the lives of nineteen activists, most of whom have long been overlooked. We meet Mary Church Terrell, a multilingual African American woman; Rose Schneiderman, a labor activist building coalitions on New York’s Lower East Side; Claiborne Catlin, who toured the Massachusetts countryside on horseback to drum up support for the cause; Mary Johnston, an aristocratic novelist bucking the Southern ruling elite; Emmeline W. Wells, a Mormon woman in a polygamous marriage determined to make her voice heard; and others who helped harness a groundswell of popular support. We also see the many places where the suffrage movement unfolded―in church parlors, meeting rooms, and the halls of Congress, but also on college campuses and even at the top of Mount Rainier. Few corners of the United States were untouched by suffrage activism.</p>
<p>Ware’s deeply moving stories provide a fresh account of one of the most significant moments of political mobilization in American history. The dramatic, often joyous experiences of these women resonate powerfully today, as a new generation of young women demands to be heard.</p>

<p>The United States of America is almost 250 years old, but American women won the right to vote less than a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>And when the controversial nineteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution-the one granting suffrage to women-was finally ratified in 1920, it passed by a mere one-vote margin.</p>
<p>The amendment only succeeded because a courageous group of women had been relentlessly demanding the right to vote for more than seventy years. The leaders of the suffrage movement are heroes who were fearless in the face of ridicule, arrest, imprisonment, and even torture. Many of them devoted themselves to the cause knowing they wouldn&#8217;t live to cast a ballot.</p>
<p>The story of women&#8217;s suffrage is epic, frustrating, and as complex as the women who fought for it. Illustrated with portraits, period cartoons, and other images, Roses and Radicals celebrates this captivating yet overlooked piece of American history and the women who made it happen.</p>

<p>For nearly 150 years, American women did not have the right to vote. On August 18, 1920, they won that right, when the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified at last. To achieve that victory, some of the fiercest, most passionate women in history marched, protested, and sometimes even broke the law—for more than eight decades.</p>
<p>From Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who founded the suffrage movement at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, to Sojourner Truth and her famous “Ain’t I a Woman?” speech, to Alice Paul, arrested and force-fed in prison, this is the story of the American women’s suffrage movement and the private lives that fueled its leaders’ dedication. Votes for Women! explores suffragists’ often powerful, sometimes difficult relationship with the intersecting temperance and abolition campaigns, and includes an unflinching look at some of the uglier moments in women’s fight for the vote.</p>

Knopf Books for Young Readers<br />
November 13, 2018</p>
<p>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was inspired by her own great-grandmother, grandmother, and mother to be bold and brave&#8211;to stand up and fight for what she believes in. But who inspired them? The long chain of women before them who spoke out for what&#8217;s right&#8211;women who taught each generation that followed how to be bold and brave.</p>
<p>Here are the stories of ten leaders who strove to win the right to vote for American women&#8211;a journey that took more than seventy years of passionate commitment. From well-known figures, such as Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth to lesser known women such as Alice Paul and Mary Church Terrell, these are heroes who dreamed big and never gave up. Senator Gillibrand highlights an important and pithy lesson from each woman&#8217;s life&#8211;from &#8220;dare to be different&#8221; to &#8220;fight together.&#8221;</p>

Hattie Burr, editor<br />
Applewood Books<br />
Originally published in 1886; Facsimile edition (January 29, 2019)</p>
<p>Originally published in 1886, this collection of recipes and miscellaneous tips and tricks is a volume published almost entirely by women for women. The book was launched to raise funds for the women’s suffrage movement and to communicate―in the shared, common language of a cookbook―that a woman’s place at the polls was not a replacement for her place at the home.</p>
<p>Included in the long list of contributors are the names of housewives, doctors, political writers, and prominent suffragists like Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and Frances Willard. Contained in this volume are not just the instructions for preparing classics like “Rebel Soup,” “Election Cake,” or “Gravy as Mother Did it,” but also tips for plain living and high thinking. The final pages include a section entitled, “Eminent Opinions on Woman Suffrage.” The collective effort in compiling, publishing, and distributing this ground-breaking cookbook bolstered practical skills for the women involved, and affirmed their ability to juggle civic and domestic duties almost as delicately as juggling eggs.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>According to CNN, the Department of Homeland Security</strong> is<a href="http://www.wicz.com/story/40965109/dhs-moves-to-defend-city-and-state-voter-registration-databases-from-ransomware-attacks"> creating a program</a> to keep voter registration databases from being infected with ransomware. The program, which will consist of outreach to state and local government officials, will launch in roughly a month, an agency spokesman confirmed. &#8220;Recent history has shown that state and county governments and those who support them are targets for ransomware attacks. Voter registration databases could be an attractive target for these attacks,&#8221; Chris Krebs, DHS&#8217;s top cyber official, said in a statement provided to CNN.</p>
<p>The effort to counter ransomware-style cyberattacks aimed at the election<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/us-officials-fear-ransomware-attack-against-2020-election.html"> runs parallel to a larger intelligence community directive</a> to determine the most likely vectors of digital attack in the November 2020 election, current and former U.S. officials told CNBC.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that states and municipalities limit the availability of information about electoral systems or administrative processes and secure their websites and databases that could be exploited,” the FBI said in a statement, supporting the Homeland Security initiative.</p>
<p><strong>A new poll out from USA Today/Suffolk University</strong> found that 40 percent of registered voters are<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/democrats-republicans-doubtful-2020-election-outcome-1476641"> concerned about the integrity of the results of the 2020 election</a>. Asked how they would feel if their preferred candidate were to lose next year&#8217;s election, 20 percent of those polled said they would be “not very confident” that the 2020 election “had been conducted in a fair-and-square way.&#8221; Eighteen percent said they would be “not at all confident&#8221; if their candidate lost</p>

<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Tuesday was primary runoff day in The Magnolia State and things did not go according to plan in a few locations. In<a href="https://wreg.com/2019/08/27/voting-machine-malfunctions-at-lafayette-county-precinct/"> Lafayette County</a>, voters complained about DRE machines not allowing them to select their candidates. A county tech determined it was a<a href="https://www.djournal.com/news/voting-issues-being-addressed-at-two-area-precincts/article_2cc49529-f73f-51dd-9417-232ea2ac7ea8.html"> calibration issue</a> and the machines in question was back in service within 30 minutes. Voters in<a href="https://www.wcbi.com/calhoun-county-precinct-faces-ballot-issue/"> Calhoun County</a> complained of similar problems, but a county technician could not find any problems, still the county chose to remove the machine in question from service.

The “party lock” on the ES&amp;S machines was not working according to Pete Perry, Hinds County Republican Party chairman.

														<p><strong>Harris County, Texas has one of the largest Vietnamese populations</strong> with about 91,000 people and for the first time the county is offering<a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2019/08/22/343602/harris-county-offers-first-ever-voter-registrar-training-in-vietnamese-and-chinese/"> deputy voter registrar training in Vietnamese</a>. According to Houston Public Media, more than 25 people attended the the first training in Vietnamese. “We have a large Vietnamese community and there’s a lot of language barriers. To be able to have it in Vietnamese, really helps a great deal to really understand the importance of voter registration,” said Janette Diep, executive director of the Vietnamese-American non-profit Boat People SOS, which hosted the training. Diep told HPM that she’s seen how language barriers can get in the way of voter registration. “A lot of times they [Vietnamese-Americans] get the card in English and they’re afraid to fill it out because it might be incorrect and then they don’t submit it. With this, when you have someone to assist you and to also hand it in to the registrar’s office, means this person’s going to be registered and they’re going to get a voter card,” said Diep. The county also began offering voter registration training in Chinese for the first time.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Atlanta-Journal Constitution</strong></em>, through the Georgia Open Records Act, has received 15,500 pages of documents detailing the 2018 election and<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/mystery-missing-votes-deepens-congress-investigates-georgia/x4OTY0ylxfA0Z0Rg6wjkyN/"> potential voting irregularities</a> that may have resulted in 80,000 fewer votes in the race for lieutenant governor. The documents were also turned over to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. According to the paper, while the secretary of state’s office has not opened an investigation into the election, the Georgia Supreme Court is considering a challenge to the lieutenant governor’s race. The decline in votes showed up on ballots cast on the state’s electronic voting machines in 101 of Georgia’s 159 counties. On paper absentee ballots, there wasn’t a significant decline in votes cast for lieutenant governor. “Was this completely voter behavior and confusion, or was there something in the machine software or hardware to cause this to happen?” Chris Brill, a senior data analyst for TargetSmart told the paper. “I’ve never seen a drop-off pattern like this, ever.”</p>

The pelican is wearing a crown with an image of the state on it.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> The California Assembly has approved a bill that would lower the state’s<a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/california-assembly-approves-measure-to-lower-voting-age-to-17/103-928489a7-0407-4c31-a712-9bd367db05de"> voting age</a> to 17. The bill, which would ultimately put the idea before the voters in 2020, goes next to the Senate however the legislative clock is winding down with the session set to end on September 13.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Late on Monday the Maine Senate voted to extend<a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2019/08/26/politics/janet-mills-will-decide-on-bill-to-switch-maine-to-ranked-choice-voting-in-presidential-races/"> ranked choice voting</a> to the presidential primary and general election. In June, the Legislature voted to move from party-run caucuses to state-run primaries, but failed to approve ranked choice voting at that time. It was approved at the end of a one-day special session. It’s unclear if Gov. Janet Miller will sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>Also in Maine Fair Elections Portland fell 76 signatures short in their effort to get a question before the voters that would expand the use of<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/08/28/ranked-choice-voting-referendum-again-fails-to-qualify-for-portland-ballot/"> ranked choice voting</a> to all offices in Portland.</p>

When lawmakers reformed the law they intended to alter it to include voters in 2017 and 2018 and instead they inadvertently eliminated everyone on the list before 2016—about 172,000 voters. On Monday the Senate approved<a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2019/08/nj-hustles-to-solve-problem-with-mail-in-ballots-ahead-of-november-election.html"> emergency legislation</a> to authorize spending $2 million to fix the problem.

A conservative group, the American Civil Rights Union, sued Snipes’ office in 2016, claiming it was violating the National Voter Registration Act by not properly making efforts to remove ineligible voters from its lists.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The Seventh Circuit Tuesday upheld an order<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/7th-circuit-affirms-order-blocking-indiana-voter-purge-law/"> blocking Indiana from removing voters</a> from electoral rolls by using a Kansas’ Interstate Crosscheck program, which has been criticized for allegedly targeting minorities and canceling registrations without voters’ consent.  “Registering to vote in another state is not the same as a request for removal from Indiana’s voting rolls,” U.S. Circuit Judge Diane Wood said in a 35-page<a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Indianavoting.pdf"> ruling</a> according to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>. “Indiana equates double registration with double voting. But the two are quite different.”</p>

<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> According to analysis by the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>, a vendor who works with the county boards of elections mistakenly flagged more than 1,600 people for purging from the voter registration rolls. The paper’s analysis found that 1,641 of flagged voters had actually cast a ballot in 2015. That number, according to the paper, also includes 110 people who voted in the 2018 mid-terms. The secretary of state’s office discovered a problem with counties that use DIMS, a system serviced by ES&amp;S.</p>
