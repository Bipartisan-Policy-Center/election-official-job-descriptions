														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Sally Williams</strong><br />
<em>Michigan’s first female director of elections set to retire</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4905" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-17-at-2.45.23-PM-204x300.png" alt="" width="204" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-17-at-2.45.23-PM-204x300.png 204w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-17-at-2.45.23-PM-768x1130.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-17-at-2.45.23-PM-696x1024.png 696w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-17-at-2.45.23-PM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" />While the dawn of 2020 will mean a lot of different things to different people, for Michigan’s Sally Williams it will mean the first day in more than 30 years that she has not been an employee of the state’s Bureau of Elections.</p>
<p>Although Williams has only been director since<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/06/sally_williams_named_new_state.html"> 2017</a>, she’s been with the office for 34 years. Before being appointed director she served as the director of the Election Liaison Division where she worked closely with county and local clerks in administering elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am tremendously grateful for the leadership and commitment Sally Williams has demonstrated throughout her entire 34 years of service to the Department of State, including most recently serving as the first woman to lead our Bureau of Elections,” said<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/"> Secretary of State</a> Jocelyn Benson in a<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1640_9150-512278--,00.html"> statement</a>. “Her tireless work ethic and dedication to integrity are apparent in everything she does. All who have the opportunity to work with her are better for it.”</p>
<p>Williams wasn’t just busy in her home state of Michigan she was also active in the elections community serving in numerous capacities including as a board member of<a href="https://ericstates.org/who-we-are/"> ERIC</a> and the<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Election Directors</a> and chair of the United State Postal Service Committee, a division of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s<a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/standards-board/"> Standards Board</a>.</p>
<p>“Sally has been a valued member of the elections community since long before she became Michigan’s Director of Elections,” said Keith Ingram, NASED president and director of elections, Texas. “She’s brought important insight and experience to the NASED Board and the entire organization over the last few years, to the benefit of voters across the country.  We’ll miss her perspective, but definitely understand the appeal of escaping those tough Michigan winters!”</p>
<p>Enjoy your retirement and the warm weather Sally!</p>
<p><em><strong>You&#8217;ve been with the secretary of state&#8217;s office for a long time, why have you decided to retire now?</strong></em><br />
I’ve always found that the right things in life find you.  Be it the right job, the right partner, the right place to live or just the right course in life.  I’ve had a few things come to fruition this year (both personally and professionally) that all pointed to me taking the step to retirement now.</p>
<p>That said, this has not been a quick or easy decision for me.  I couldn’t in good conscience leave my role without being fully comfortable that my office was strong and completely ready to carry on without me.  The staff makeup at the Michigan Bureau of Elections is larger now than it’s been in years, made up of both experienced veterans and newer faces (many who have come to us from our local election offices) – who are all extremely bright, hard-working and fully engaged.  Additionally, we have a new administration and new Election Director who came in with extensive election-related background and a keen focus on election administration. Everyone here is well-equipped and ready, which makes me ready too.</p>
<p>From a personal standpoint &#8211; I’ve worked full time, at a full-tilt pace for over 34 years.  I’ve raised three grown kids and have proudly watched them launch into the professional world themselves.  Through all of this, I’ve rarely taken more time off than just a long weekend (other than the requisite 6-week maternity leave).  As election administrators, we all live and breathe our jobs, 24/7. As rewarding and important as it is, I’m honestly just ready to take it down a notch and focus on fully enjoying life.</p>
<p>In the end, a major deciding factor was finding a perfect retirement property in Southwest Florida where we’ll be retreating during much of Michigan’s cold season &#8211; near parents who we’ve not seen much in recent years, perfect for us and in our price range – something we just couldn’t pass up.  While I know 2020 will be an extraordinary election year, we all know there’s no quiet time in the world of election administration and no perfect time to go. For me, it just all added up to now.</p>
<p><em><strong>As the suffrage centennial approaches, any advice for women seeking to make a career in election administration?<br />
</strong></em>I couldn’t be more proud about being appointed Michigan’s first female Election Director.  My entire management team consists of women and I’ve worked with numerous smart, strong, hard-working and high-achieving women all through our election structure and throughout my entire career.  There are many wonderful groups to get involved with to learn about this profession and the key issues involved. It’s also heartening to see some true academic curriculums emerging in the field of election administration.  My advice is that you can do anything with a strong commitment and work ethic, especially in this critical field.</p>
<p>It’s certainly worth mentioning though that there are so many talented individuals in this field, both men and women alike. I was mentored by the best in<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2017/06-29/"> Chris Thomas</a>, who taught, encouraged, and supported me for many years.  What I’ll miss most about my job and the field of election administration is the universal and unwavering commitment I’ve seen from all involved – doing all they can to support one another and continuously fighting so hard to ensure integrity in all that we do.</p>
<p><em><strong>I</strong><strong>f you could build the &#8220;perfect&#8221; voting system, what would it look like?<br />
</strong></em>Well there’s a challenging question.  (And the one that took me longest to answer…)</p>
<p>How about some key goals?  Auditable, trusted, and tested; reliable; easy to use by any voter and any election official in any environment; configurable for in-precinct voting, absentee/by mail/from home and centralized count sites; adaptable over time with regard to new approaches to tabulation methodologies (as long as they comply with all of these other goals); and of course as SECURE as can be.  There are many opinions and preferences out there with regard to the optimal system, and these concepts don’t all line up with one another. I think in the long run, there needs to be wide-ranging continued discussion and collaboration; as well as a very cautious approach to the ongoing evolution of voting systems, that includes input and acceptance by voters, election officials, experts (from several fields), and election security and integrity advocates.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are you most proud of during your time in Michigan Elections?<br />
</strong></em>It goes without saying, but the most important part of administering elections is doing so with complete impartiality.  Political environments present challenges to that concept – but in Michigan, we have always taken great pride in the fact that our office has been able to operate with full neutrality, and this has continued to be my most critical objective.</p>
<p>From there, I’m just very proud of our staff and all that we’ve achieved over the last couple of years – complete replacement of our voting systems, complete re-write of our statewide voter registration system, modernizing our approach to training and communicating with our locals, implementing several  major election law and constitutional changes, and more. Also, being a large decentralized state makes it quite challenging to implement large-scale change smoothly. Another major focus for me has been to involve and work closely with our local election officials in everything we do. We have many who are happy to step up and work hand-in-hand with us as we tackle these challenges, and I’ve loved watching my staff and our local officials work so closely together in so many ways.  Not to say that this always goes perfectly &#8211; change is a reality, and it’s never easy. Even if we don’t always agree on the best way to achieve a goal, we work hard to hear every perspective, approach problem solving professionally and productively, and in the end, make decisions based on the most important consideration of all – doing what’s best for the voter. There’s a great sense of team here in Michigan, and I’d like to think I was a big part of building that sense of community.</p>
<p><strong><em>In 2018, Michigan approved Prop. 3 and we&#8217;ve already seen some impacts of the new law in the 2019 election cycle. How do you think that will impact Michigan in 2020?</em><br />
</strong>Michigan’s Prop 3 of 2018 was a constitutional amendment that brought many welcome changes that are already proving beneficial to voters – chief among them, the elimination of voter registration deadlines and mandated reasons to vote absentee/by mail/from home, and implementation of Automatic Voter Registration for customers conducting driver’s license transactions with our Secretary of State branch offices (our DMV). All of this entailed many detailed changes to our voter registration system and election administration processes. From there, there’s been a continual need to train, communicate and reinforce all the changes to voters and local election officials in conjunction with each election.  I was very thankful that we could tackle these challenges in the odd year (now with three post-Prop 3 elections under our belt). We’ve also had a great deal of help from national partners, resulting in a very smooth implementation thus far. We’ve also seen the overall goals of this proposal achieved – greater voter participation, especially with our younger voters. We’re ready to keep this going in 2020, and will be anxious to see the impacts in a statewide presidential year, especially with respect to our overall expected increases in the number of registered voters, overall voter turnout, youth voting and those voting absentee/by mail/from home.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any parting words of advice for your successor?</strong></em><br />
I have to say I’m thrilled to see Jonathan Brater as my successor.  He comes into this role very well prepared and ready. We’ve worked together all year on numerous issues and changes, especially with respect to implementing last year’s constitutional amendment changes.  He is smart, thoughtful, highly productive and has both the voter’s and the staff’s best interest at heart. He is getting to know our local election officials and knows and values the relationships we have with them.  He’ll also be a great representative for Michigan nationally. He has been wonderful to work with, and I really don’t think he needs much advice! But he knows I’m here for him if he needs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Other than sleeping in on Election Day, what&#8217;s next for you?<br />
</strong></em>I’m sure dialing back will be a big adjustment for me after all these years, so in some ways I guess I’ll be in a period of reinvention.  My overall hope is to spend more time on myself, become more active and in shape &#8211; as from an aches and pains perspective I’ve been feeling quite a bit older than my years!  Then just spending time with family and exploring and developing our new space down south.</p>
<p>I’ll also be keeping up with everything in the elections world from afar – as once you’re into this field of election geekdom, who can really stay away?  For those I’ve worked with, thank you so much for your mentorship, support and innate ability to make this world of elections what it TRULY is – solid, intact, transparent, secure, and best of all, fun.  I will always look back on this time with a smile, a great deal of pride, and a sense of kinship with you all that will never leave me. I’ll be watching all of you with pride and hope for the most smooth-running election in one of the busiest years ever.  And if you get to SW Florida in the cold months, or beautiful Michigan in the warmer months, please look me up!</p>

							<h2>Alison Lundergan Grimes Exit Interview</h2>
														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Alison Lundergan Grimes</strong><br />
<em>Kentucky’s outgoing secretary of state looking forward to family time</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4906" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-1.30.02-PM-215x300.png" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-1.30.02-PM-215x300.png 215w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-1.30.02-PM.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" />Alison Lundergan Grimes was elected as Kentucky’s 76th secretary of state in 2011 and re-elected in 2015.</p>
<p>During her tenure in the secretary of state’s office she oversaw the implementation of online voter registration in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Grimes’ recommendations for improving the state’s military voting procedures were signed into law as Kentucky’s first-ever Military Heroes Voting Initiative.</p>
<p>She also created an address confidentially program for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault so they could register and vote without fear for their safety.</p>
<p>Earlier this year electionline asked all the women running elections at the state level what suffrage means to them. This was Secretary Grimes’ response:</p>
<p>“As Secretary of State, I’ve worked hard to ensure all eligible citizens have access to our ballot box and vote. Sadly, the struggle which began 100 years ago to ensure the basic inalienable rights of women, continues today.”</p>
<p>“Suffrage describes a moment in time where a movement for equality began.  Personally, I’m reminded of my grandmothers. They saw the right to vote be realized.”</p>
<p>“While women can now get an education, own property, vote, hold office, get a job and practice our faith – equality doesn’t exist.  As long as ‘firsts’ continue – like being the first statewide elected official to have a child in office – the movement is not finished and little girls everywhere rely on our fortitude to stand up and speak out.”</p>
<p>Grimes received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she served as a trustee to the Board of Directors. She obtained her law degree, graduating with honors, from American University, Washington College of Law, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><em><strong>What will you miss most about being secretary of state?</strong></em><br />
As Secretary of State my administration has been able to break down barriers to the ballot box, grow the economy, give back to our military and veteran community and generate a lifetime of engagement of all ages. These historic achievements were possible because of the most dedicated and talented staff in state government. I will miss working with them, most of all. I am confident that their legacy and our friendships will live on beyond this office.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you feel was your greatest accomplishment as secretary of state and why?</strong></em><br />
My administration has expanded the role of the office; positively impacting the lives of every Kentuckian. Elections matter and play a role in protecting victims of domestic violence, assisting our veterans, fighting for the legalization of medical marijuana, growing our economy, protecting those that are disabled and the fight for public education. My greatest accomplishment though, has to be consistently traveling to every one of our 120 counties and giving residents an opportunity to be listened to. It is those conversations and relationships that have been the foundation of every accomplishment during my tenure.</p>
<p><em><strong>What was the most difficult time/issue you faced as secretary?</strong></em><br />
Whether sitting across from a veteran suffering from PTSD looking for addiction relief or defending our democracy against foreign interference in our elections, this job comes with many challenges. It is so rewarding though when you’re able to see these challenges through and see the positive impact this office has had on folks across the Commonwealth and the Nation.</p>
<p><em><strong>As an expert in the field of election, what do you feel is the most pressing issue facing elections officials?<br />
</strong></em>The most pressing issue facing election officials is the erosion of trust in our democracy and lack of long-term reliable funding for the protection of our elections. We must update equipment that is over two decades old and continue training local election officials.</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s next for you, besides being able to sleep in on election days?</strong></em><br />
Who can sleep in on Election Day?! I look forward to catching up on much-needed time with my new son and continuing to #GetUpGetOutGetLoud to make a difference with folks across this Commonwealth and this Nation.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Outgoing Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann did not respond to our request for an Exit Interview. If we hear from him we’ll run it in our next available issue.)</em></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Federal Funding</strong>: Congress has included</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/474739-425m-allocated-for-election-security-in-government-funding-deal"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $425 million in new funding for election security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of a spending package that was expected to pass before the holiday recess. Under the appropriations deal, states would be required to match 20 percent of the federal funds. The funds would be distributed through the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advocates:</strong> Two security experts have</span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90438514/17-ways-to-stay-warm-this-winter"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently quit Verified Voting in protest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to <em>Fast Company</em>, Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech professor who sat on Verified Voter’s advisory board and Phillip Stark, a professor of statistics at UC Berkely have both recently resigned claim that the organization is giving election officials false confidence in voting machines. “Verified Voting will always be grateful for the years of service Philip Stark and Richard DeMillo gave to this organization and continue to give to these important issues, including Philip’s critical contributions on risk-limiting audits. With a serious issue like election security comes many passionate voices and differences of opinions.

According to KJZZ, the handbook is designed to help protect candidates and those involved in elections from cyber hackers. The handbook has 10 tips for securing mobile devices, websites and email accounts where candidates or parties could be vulnerable. “There’s things like multi-factor authentication for all of your accounts, if you log in on an unrecognized device it’ll send you a code on a recognized device so you can verify your identity,&#8221; Hobbs said. </span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: Supreme Court Judge Richard Rich Jr. has</span><a href="http://www.wicz.com/story/41464008/judge-denies-battistis-request-for-a-vote-recount-in-broome-das-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied a request for a full manual recount</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Broome County district attorney race that was decided by just 55 votes. Rich wrote that the complaints “lack merit” and he dismissed claims that the voting machine could have been hacked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> According to county officials and the vendor, the issue with voting machines in</span><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/northampton-county-pennsylvania-voting-machines-20191212.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Northampton County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the November elections were the result of the machines being improperly set up. The machines weren’t prepared to read the results of the specific ballot design used in Northampton County, and dozens of machines had touchscreens that weren’t properly calibrated. According to the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, Adam Carbullido, an executive at Election Systems &amp; Software, the Omaha, Neb.-based vendor of the ExpressVote XL machines used in Northampton County, said in a statement that the company “takes full accountability” for the mistakes and is reconfiguring the county’s machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> For weeks officials in</span><a href="https://www.mrt.com/news/article/New-ballot-box-contains-836-votes-both-sides-to-14910922.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Midland County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been trying to figure out why there was an 832-vote discrepancy in a bond election. Late last week an unopened ballot box was discovered in a the county annex. This week the ballot box was opened and it contained 836 ballots from November.  According to the <em>Midland Reporter-Telegram</em>, The box was found by an employee who was organizing shelves and discovered that the box was not empty, as the Election’s Office had originally believed. “The county was the custodian of records for this election, and it was their obligation to get the recount committee all the ballots for the recount,” Texas Director of Election Keith Ingram said. “This was human error on the chain of custody.” The state will retrain elections officials prior to the 2020 election cycle.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A review by <em>The Associated Press</em> has found</strong> that thousands of Ohio voters were</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/12/16/us/ap-us-absentee-applications-ohio.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held up in their efforts to get absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the 2018 election because of missing or mismatched signatures on absentee applications. Figures provided to the AP through public information requests to Ohio’s 88 county boards of elections show 21 counties rejected more than 6,500 absentee ballot applications because a signature was either missing or didn’t match what was on file. Another five counties reported rejecting about 850 applications combined, for various reasons that the boards didn’t specify. The few counties that tracked what happened to applications after they were rejected said issues were largely addressed before or on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Earlier this month, The New Jersey Council on Local Mandates</strong> unanimously denied a request from the state to reconsider its ruling that</span><a href="https://www.capemaycountyherald.com/news/government/article_40149b3a-1dbd-11ea-b545-33c285c4c5e5.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> severely limited vote-by-mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stating that it does not have the power “to revive or resurrect a law that has been declared to be an unfunded mandate,” the council, speaking of the state’s request, found “the motion to be without merit and denies the request.” According to The Cape May Herald the ruling ends the automatic issuing of mail-in ballots those who requested on in a previous election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Following pushback from parents and educators</strong>, this week the office of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio presented a slate of</span><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-proposes-2020-early-voting-sites-spare-children"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 53 sites available for early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and none of them are schools. “We’ve discussed before that there are alternatives and we provided this list to move from the theoretical to the actual,” Ayirini Fonseca-Sabune, the city’s Chief Democracy Officer, told Gothamist/WNYC. In addition to security concerns, parents and educators lamented the loss of facilities that included school gyms and cafeterias for more than week. The list includes eight sites in the Bronx, 21 in Brooklyn, 14 in Manhattan and 10 in Staten Island. There were no sites proposed for Queens because it was the only borough that did not use any city public schools for early voting.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arizona:</strong> Rep. Kelly Townsend (R) has pre-filed a bill that would restrict what</span><a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1353181/arizona-lawmaker-wants-ban-student-ids-utility-bills-voter-id"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forms of ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are acceptable in order to cast a ballot. It would disallow the use of student IDs and utility bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> Sen. Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel) has introduced Senate Bill 57 that would make</span><a href="https://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/index.php/news/local-news/21321-california-state-senator-introduces-bill-that-would-make-voter-registration-an-opt-in-process-at-the-dmv"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration an opt-in process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the DMV instead of the current system of opting out. The Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee will consider the bill on January 7, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Colorado:</strong> Voters in Colorado will consider a ballot measure in 2020 would prohibit communities from</span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/12/12/colorado-citizenship-initiative-76-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing noncitizens to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in local elections. According to <em>The Denver Post,</em> the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office validated 137,362 signatures, more than the required 124,632 — 2 percent of voters in every state Senate district — to put Initiative 76 on the ballot. Because it’s a constitutional amendment, it must pass with 55 percent of the vote or more to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> By a 3-2 party line vote, a Senate committee has</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/senate-committee-rebuffs-effort-for-nonviolent-georgia-felons-vote/rjWO7jHh5vpy4DPpPCqlwK/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted against restoring the voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the state’s approximately 250,000 nonviolent felons who are still on parole/probation or are still paying off fines. The Senate unanimously approved studying felon voting rights earlier this year, but the committee opposed proposing legislation that would permit some of them to vote while they reintegrate into society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Last week, Gov. Charlie Baker vetoed language in the state’s spending bill that would have rolled back the effective date for</span><a href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20191216/baker-veto-means-auto-voter-registration-go-for-jan-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and specified changes to the opt-out procedures. According the State House News Service, the Legislature tucked into its budget bill language that would have delayed implementation from Jan. 1, 2020 to April 1, 2020, after the March 3 presidential primary. “The proposed sections would delay implementation until April 1, 2020, rendering AVR unavailable for the 2020 presidential primary, and, more importantly, would significantly change voter registration procedures a mere 18 days before our go-live date to implement this important law,” Baker wrote in his veto message. “I cannot approve sections that would jeopardize the success of a program and require a substantial change to the voter registration process in the middle of an election cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: By a 21-17 vote the Senate has approved a bill that would</span><a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2019/12/16/nj-approves-bill-give-voting-rights-those-parole-probation/4385202002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reinstate voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those currently on parole or probation. The bill was previously approved by the House in 48-24 vote. Governor Phil Murphy (D)</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/475101-new-jersey-governor-signs-voting-rights-restoration-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the legislation into law on Wednesday restoring the voting rights to more than 80,000 residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: State Sen. Chris Jacobs has introduced legislation that would require first-time voters to provide</span><a href="https://www.wnypapers.com/news/article/current/2019/12/16/139495/jacobs-introduces-reforms-to-prevent-voter-fraud-due-to-green-light-law"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proof-of-citizenship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when registering to vote. Jacobs said the legislation is in response to a new law providing drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is proposing legislation that would require an</span><a href="https://wbng.com/2019/12/16/gov-cuomo-proposes-legislation-demanding-automatic-manual-recount-of-close-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic recount</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in close races. The bill would require an automatic recount in all statewide races where the margin of victory is 0.2 percent; require an automatic recount in all other elections where the margin of victory for the candidate or measure it 0.5 percent; and ensure that recounts are completed manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vermont:</strong> Voters in Burlington in 2020 will not be voting on a measure to move the city to a</span><a href="https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Ranked-choice-voting-misses-deadline-to-be-in-March-2020-ballot-566301141.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system, but they will vote on a measure that would allow</span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2019/12/17/burlington-council-puts-noncitizen-voting-measure-on-march-ballot-%EF%BB%BF/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> documented immigrants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cast a ballot in local city elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Members of the Joint Judiciary Committee voted this week to recommend a bill to each chamber that would allow voters with certain physical disabilities to</span><a href="https://www.wvpublic.org/post/judiciary-committee-will-recommend-electronic-absentee-voting-bill-people-disabilities"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cast absentee ballots electronically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

According to <em>Capitol Media Services</em> Doreen McPaul, attorney general for the tribe, says Secretary of State Katie Hobbs agreed to allow people who forgot to sign their early ballot envelopes an opportunity to “cure” the defect. Arizona AG Mark Brnovich argues that Hobbs had no legal authority to do that and wants it changed in the manual, but in a letter to Brnovich, McPaul noted that the change to the election procedure manual ended a 2018 lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Steve Jones denied a</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/judge-allows-georgia-purge-309k-voter-registrations-overnight/fVBSMzCLR7ontBc3RpjyrJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last-minute attempt to stop the purge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 300,000 voters from the state’s voter rolls. According to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, in his ruling Jones said he could still order election officials to reinstate canceled voters long before their registrations would be needed in an election. Jones will reconsider the issue during a court hearing at press time. “It appears that any voter registration cancellations can be undone at a later date,” Jones wrote in his order. “The court’s ruling is based largely on defense counsel’s statement (at today’s hearing) that any voter registration that is canceled today can be restored within 24 to 48 hours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland:</strong> Indiana-based Public Interest Legal Foundation has sued the State Board of Elections to obtain</span><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-voter-lawsuit-20191216-quqbt3r4pfe6xoc3huvi5qjhxi-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> access to the state’s voter data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Maryland voter data is only available to residents of the state and so the group is suing to get access.  “This is stuff the state would have sold me if I lived across the street,” Logan Churchwell, the foundation’s director of communications and research told <em>The Baltimore Sun.</em> “We only asked for what was for sale to anyone else in the state.” State elections officials could not be reached for comment Monday, but they have defended Maryland’s law for obtaining voter lists in other court cases.</span></p>

The Flemings were sentenced to 60 days in prison, each sentence suspended for one year for good behavior.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Pennsylvania is facing another lawsuit over its certification of a voting machine bought by Philadelphia, Northampton County and others. The lawsuit was filed by a pair of election security advocacy organizations and 13 registered voters who live in Philadelphia or Northampton County. The lawsuit asks the state Commonwealth Court to block Pennsylvania’s</span><a href="https://apnews.com/961ea8b5fc5593bc1bd08c8689e3170c"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certification of the ExpressVote XL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> touchscreen system made by Election Systems &amp; Software.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy has ordered that the registrations of 234,000</span><a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/judge-wisconsin-voter-registrations-should-be-tossed/article_c56e8862-09d8-5f30-95ee-a58772a78627.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters be removed from the rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they may have moved. Plaintiffs argued that the state should remove the voters within 30 days of not receiving a response to a post card mailed from the election commission. Malloy denied a request by Elections Commission attorneys to put his decision on hold. He ordered the commission to follow the law requiring voters who didn’t respond to be deactivated. “I can’t tell them how to do that. They’re going to have to figure that out,” Malloy said according to the <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em>. On Monday, the Election Commission</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/elections-panel-split-next-steps-after-voter-purge-ruling"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deadlocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how to address the judge’s ruling.

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
