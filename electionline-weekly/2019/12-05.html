							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>There’s an algorithm for that</strong><br />
<em>Caltech, Orange Co., CA partnership reviews voter rolls</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>With the eyes of the world closely watching preparations for the 2020 U.S. election cycle, state and local elections officials have been finding all sorts of new and unique ways to ensure that their election systems are secure and that their data is ready to go for what is sure to be a high turnout event.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3788" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg 261w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-768x884.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups.jpg 869w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" />One of those unique collaborations happened between the<a href="https://www.ocvote.com/"> Orange County, California Registrar of Voters</a> office and<a href="https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/r-m-michael-alvarez"> R. Michael Alvarez</a> and his team at Caltech.</p>
<p>Alvarez and his students began discussing a pilot project with Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley in the fall of 2017. A series of meetings and conversations in spring 2018 got them to the point where they understood what Kelley wanted the methodology to accomplish.</p>
<p>From there the team created algorithms that would look into the county’s 1.5 million voting records. The algorithms would focus on the issue of duplicates as well as statistical anomalies. The algorithms took daily snapshots of the data from April 2018 to May of 2019 and in August of 2019 the<a href="http://vote.caltech.edu/working-papers/134"> findings were released</a>.</p>
<p>“It was important to me to have a third party, especially academic, reviewing our data to provide a second set of eyes and to validate the list maintenance (or not) of what we were doing,” Kelley said.</p>
<p>Alvarez said one of the central motivations for the project with Orange County was to develop fast, independent, and transparent ways to conduct end-to-end election administration performance audits.</p>
<p>“[B]ecause of concerns in 2016 and 2018 regarding the security of critical voter registration systems, we decided to see if we could develop a methodology that could provide fast and accurate auditing of voter registration data,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>Letting anyone poke around voter data can be a bit nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>“I think I was resigned to allowing the process to unfold,” Kelley said. “I knew I was opening ourselves up to critical scrutiny but I was willing to take that chance to ensure our data and process was sound.”</p>
<p>For the Caltech team, the findings of the algorithms were a bit surprising.</p>
<p>“The most surprising finding — especially for academic researchers — was finding how volatile voter registration data in a large and complex election jurisdiction can be.  Voter registration systems undergo many internal list maintenance operations, and we have been struck by how rapidly the information they contain can change,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>As someone who works in the data on a daily basis, Kelley said that he wasn’t really surprised by the algorithms findings.</p>
<p>“They focused on the duplicate issue which we’ve been working on with the state. But overall what they found and reported on was expected,” Kelley said.</p>
<p>Kelley said the registrar’s office will continue to use the algorithms throughout the 2020 election cycle and would encourage other states or counties to conduct similar programs.</p>
<p>“It provides a critical review of data without the bias of internal review,” Kelley said. “It’s very important.”</p>
<p>Alvarez said he and his team are happy to discuss collaborations with any counties or states.</p>
<p>“Our team is happy to work directly with any election officials who may want to explore voter registration database auditing, or any other type of election performance auditing,” he said “We are also happy to collaborate with local colleges or universities, and to help support their efforts to collaborate with election officials in their area.”</p>
<p>Alvarez said one thing that he really likes about this project is building strong collaborations with election officials</p>
<p>“As you know, there has been some distrust between academics and election officials, and this is a great example of a type of project where we have been able to build strong, positive, and productive partnerships,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>Caltech is continuing to work with Orange County and is conducting a similar pilot program in<a href="https://lavote.net/home/voting-elections"> Los Angeles County</a>’s voter data rolls which include more than four million registered voters.</p>
<p><strong>Not just voter registration data</strong><br />
The approach Alvarez and his team have taken for auditing voter registration data can be used for other types of administrative data, in particular administrative data that is dynamic&#8212;that is, it naturally changes every day&#8212;and has many different points of access.</p>
<p>“In the elections space, we are most actively interested in extending this approach to the transactions data associated with voting by mail, where we believe that this methodology can help find potential anomalies and thus help mitigate potential problems in voting by mail jurisdictions,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>Case-in-point Alvarez and his team are also working with Paul Gronke and the<a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/earlyvoting/"> Reed College’s Early Voting Information Center</a> on a pilot project.</p>
<p>“We launched a pilot project earlier this year to examine how our approach for election performance auditing might scale statewide in Oregon, focusing on voter registration database auditing,” Alvarez explained. “Scaling our methodology statewide presents challenges, in particular auditing across counties that may have very different voter registration workflows. We worked closely with the<a href="https://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx"> Oregon Secretary of State’s office</a> and Reed College in this pilot project.”</p>
<p>Caltech has also built methodologies for auditing and studying other aspects of an election administration process, ranging from tracking vote-by-mail trends to forensic audits of voter turnout and cast ballot statistics.</p>

														<p><strong>INCOMING!</strong><br />
<em>Voter registration application data</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick<br />
The Democracy Fund</p>
<p>Registration is the first step in voting for most voters. What steps can election officials, technology directors, and voter registration managers take to identify potentially problematic registration applications?</p>
<p>This list provides a quick checklist of some items to monitor as applications are made to initiate or update a voter’s registration status. None of these alone indicate that there is an attack, a breech, or malfeasance; these could however be the “check engine light” of your VR system and somethings to have on your radar.</p>
<p>Additionally, what can be done as an applicant completes their information to aid them in successfully registering? We can secure the systems AND enhance their usability with vigilance and thoughtful architecture.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4839" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clock-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clock-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clock-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clock-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clock-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Detect Frequency</strong><br />
<strong>What are the timelines of submissions?</strong> The volume of applications hitting the system will vary depending on where you are in the election cycle with a large spike at the deadline to register. There can be variation over the timeline—a spike in September on National Voter Registration Day or as a result of a social media platform’s registration push that may seem like an anomaly if you are not expecting it.  Understanding, and anticipating, when large volumes of records may be hitting the system will allow for election officials to differentiate between legitimate activity and potential denial of service attacks or other ill-intended actions. This is where partnerships and collaborations become critical.</p>
<p>As we head into the primaries and voters may be adding or changing political parties, knowing what those trends tend to be in your jurisdiction (particularly if you have a closed primary and a voter’s ability to participate hinges upon having a party designated) could prove critical. Are eligible electors suddenly removing their party and, thus, making themselves ineligible?</p>
<p><strong>What are the submissions’ timing?</strong> With online voter registration (or automated voter registration) there may be large files that are downloaded in batches from DMVs or NVRA agencies.  Monitoring for tranches of forms being submitted all at once and at odd times that are contrary to your typical data flows is something to look at, especially if you have a real-time connection.  Is it rare to get submissions on a Saturday night? How about Wednesday? Knowing historical trends will help to know if there are activities that need to be looked at.</p>
<p><strong>Detect Location/Source</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4843" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GIS-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GIS-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GIS-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GIS.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>Where are the applications for?</strong> In addition to the timing of applications, where they are for is equally important.  Many jurisdictions know what addresses are single-family or multi-family dwellings and have thresholds on the number of applications that can be submitted in a given timeframe for a single address.</p>
<p>If voters are unable to register at commercial addresses or mailboxes for residency requirement reasons, systems should know what those addresses are (especially for those that give the appearance of a brick and mortar building rather than a “POB” designation). Conversely, there are thousands of addresses that do not get mail delivery at the residential address, USPS calls them R777 addresses, and THOSE addresses have to have a mailing address associated with it or mail will be returned as undeliverable.   These R777 addresses are identified by their zip code and election officials should check with their mailing vendor or USPS Election Mail Specialist for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the applications coming from? </strong>Many systems will track the IP that is generating the application. Some caveats to this sort of system control is to make sure that you first identify all of the legally-required NVRA agency ISPs and locations with the potential for a lot of traffic such as political party headquarters or public libraries.  There may be an inclination to block foreign IP addresses but remember that there are between 3 and 5 million eligible Americans living overseas and serving in the military who may only be able to participate if they register remotely.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4841" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/checkmark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="167" />Detect Inaccuracies</strong><br />
<strong>Is your system “smart”?</strong> When people move they may not always get their address correct.  Does the application process verify the address as valid prior to submission? Does it have the capacity to offer potential correct options if a street name is misspelled or to go as far as to populate a zip code based on the house number, street descriptor, and directional?</p>
<p><strong>What prevents an application from getting on the rolls?</strong> Knowing what the most common failings are in successful submission is the first step in making your system more user-friendly and better serving the electorate.  Mandatory fields should be noted and an application not able to be submitted without their completion.</p>
<p><strong>Are addresses attributed to the proper district(s)?</strong> Voters will only get the right ballot if the address is placed in the appropriate district. A system that monitors the correctness of the street address (or<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/"> GIS coordinates</a>) to the appropriate geo-political district further enhances the integrity of the process by providing additional assurance that voters are only presented with candidates representing the district within which they live.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using common data formats (CDFs)?</strong> Data matching and analysis is easier when a common format is used. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently published the<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1500-102.pdf"> Voter Records Interchange (VRI)</a> specification that can dramatically ease the ability to streamline data input and review that data for inaccuracies.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>A group of 39 Democratic senators sent a letter</strong> to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees urging the panels to<a href="https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/40323-senators-advocate-for-increased-election-security-funding-in-2020-budget/"> better fund election security</a>.</p>
<p>The senators requested funding for election security grants and for the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) in the Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking at an event sponsored by security tech firm</strong>, U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Thomas Hicks said that<a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/u-s-election-security-light-years-ahead-of-2016-eac-official-says/"> the U.S. is “light years” ahead</a> of where it was in 2016, but also emphasized there’s plenty more to do to ensure good security for the 2020 election cycle.</p>
<p>Hicks said the situation in the 2016 cycle was characterized by “agencies not talking to each other … we were in silos.” He said that changed with elections were classified as critical infrastructure. “now if something happens, we know exactly who to call across thousands of jurisdictions … We can communicate better,” he said.</p>

							<h2>2019 Election Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Four candidates<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/four-fulton-county-election-challenges-represent-uptick-2019/CNgyYpfskJbwyvVugQtKcN/"> contested the results</a> of their respective elections in Fulton County this year and that’s most election complaints the county has seen from candidates in six years. “That is a significant increase,” Richard Barron, Fulton’s director of registration and elections told <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> of the four challenges filed in 2019. “I think it shows a lack of trust in the results of the system.”</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The state’s Supreme Court has appointed judges to hear<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/mississippi/articles/2019-12-01/mississippi-judges-appointed-to-hear-8-election-challenges"> challenges in eight local elections</a>. According to the <em>Associated Press</em>, county supervisor races are being challenged in Jasper, Leflore, Madison, Monroe and Washington counties. Elections for chancery clerk and circuit clerk are disputed in Quitman County. The sheriff’s race is being challenged in Yalobusha County.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Proving, yet again, that every vote counts, especially in local elections, five races in<a href="https://www.whio.com/news/local/automatic-recount-scheduled-for-races-ohio-county/D5ft4zxZrHbeJ69F23jGRL/"> Montgomery County</a> are headed to automatic recounts. Rhine McLin, board of elections chairwoman, told WHIO it’s the first time in her tenure that so many races have been so close.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Tied races are decided in a lot of different ways and in<a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/may-the-luckiest-person-win-local-election-decided-by-odd-ritual-from-the-1930s/1012841920"> Washington County</a>, Pennsylvania it’s by pulling a number ball (1-16) out of a bag. Whoever pulls the highest number wins. The county has been deciding tied races this way since the 1930s.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: In the Garden State, Judge Julio Mendez has granted recounts for two candidates in<a href="https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/judge-mendez-grants-election-recounts-in-atlantic-city-pleasantville/article_13935d1f-ca62-51b8-a1a1-ed9c982cdbe9.html"> Atlantic County</a> who where ahead at the polls Nov. 5, but lost after hundreds of mail-in ballots were counted. In<a href="https://morristowngreen.com/2019/12/02/morris-township-dems-seek-another-recount-in-gluegate-election/"> Morris County</a> lawyers for a losing candidate are asking the state to order a recount of 42 provisional ballots that were rejected because their envelopes weren’t sealed. “In multiple cases, the voter attempted to seal the ballot but was unable to do so because of issues with the glue. In some instances, those voters were instructed to give the unsealed ballot to the poll worker, who placed it in the bag given to the poll workers by the Board of Elections,” the attorney wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> We’ll know more on December 9, but it looks like a race for Fairfield council in<a href="https://www.kxly.com/news/fairfield-council-position-could-be-headed-for-tie-breaker/1145719512"> Spokane County</a> could end up tied with the winner being drawn from a milk bottle…yes, milk bottle. State law requires the drawing of lots for ties and in Spokane, numbered balls are put into a milk bottle and whichever ball comes out is the winner. How did the county start using a milk bottle? &#8220;Because our bingo ball dispenser broke,&#8221; Auditor Vicki Dalton told KXLY. Until it stopped working, the county had used a battery-operated mini bingo ball dispenser which would spit out one ball at a time. When it broke, the milk bottle took its place. &#8220;I truly have no idea where the milk bottle came from, no idea whatsoever,&#8221; said Dalton.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Start of a trend?</strong> During the November 5 election, three Vanderburgh County, Indiana voters refused to use the county’s electronic voting machines citing<a href="https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/2019/11/24/vanderburgh-will-counter-voters-who-refuse-to-use-machines/4264210002/"> security concerns</a>. The three voters were given paper provisional ballots that were eventually counted. County Clerk Carla Hayden told the Courier &amp; Press that she will seek changes to the state to prevent voters from doing this in the future. Provisional ballots are only permissible under seven criteria, not wanting to use the electronic voting machines is not one of the seven. &#8220;We’re instructed by the clerk to do everything we can to ensure that somebody gets to vote,&#8221; said Don Gibbs, the poll worker who handed out the provisionals. &#8220;We were never instructed to say, ‘Well, you&#8217;ve got to use the electronic machine or you don’t vote.’ That’s why you have the provisional ballots.  The bigger responsibility is to help ensure somebody gets to vote.&#8221; Hayden, a member of the state clerks association&#8217;s legislative committee, said she will approach local legislators. It&#8217;s not enough, she said, that a voter&#8217;s refusal to use machines isn&#8217;t among the seven criteria for issuing provisional ballots. &#8220;We need specificity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><strong>Suffrage News</strong>: New York City’s Central Park is getting its very first statue that will honor real-life women —<a href="https://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/sculptor-crafting-first-women-s-statue-for-central-park/article_6c7935ae-e07e-5b75-a067-c0cbea18b2ed.html"> Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth</a>. The sculpture, which will debut on August 26, 2020, will be located on the park’s Literary Walk. The Girl Scouts, foundations and private donors raised the $1.5 million for the statue. According to The Associated Press, of the 23 statues of historical figures in the 840-acre, 166-year-old public park, none honors actual women. There are statues of three female fictional characters: Alice in Wonderland, Mother Goose and William Shakespeare’s Juliet, who appears with Romeo. “It’s fitting that the first statue of real women in Central Park depicts three New York women who dedicated their lives to fighting for women’s rights,” said Pam Elam, president of Monumental Women, in a written statement last month after the project received approval from a city commission.</p>
<p><strong>The History Channel has a fun look</strong> back at<a href="https://www.history.com/news/colonial-america-election-day-parties"> Election Day in colonial times</a>.

Palmucci was first appointed to the county board of elections in 2006 and subsequently reappointed numerous time. &#8220;Today, I am mourning the loss of my dear friend and colleague, Joanne Palmucci.  She was very dedicated to her job and worked to do her best in that regard. In fact, she was returning home from a trip to Florida last evening for a special elections meeting,&#8221; Mercer County Clerk Paula Sollami Covello told the publication. &#8220;She was also an exceptional cook and a very generous person. She threw sensational dinner parties and fundraisers. I will miss her greatly. I loved her spirit because she really took her job very seriously even though it was a part-time job. Her staff is devastated, but they’re carrying on.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: In an interview this week, House Administration Committee Chair Zoe Lofgren (D-California) said that she believes the House will take up a bill, before year’s end, that would lay the foundation for the restoration of the full<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/house-democrats-to-vote-on-restoration-of-voting-rights-act-this-month-190706108.html"> Voting Rights Act</a> that was altered by the 2013 Supreme Court ruling in Shelby v. Holder.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> SB 1014, proposed by Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, would require that any changes in the<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2019/11/22/proposed-law-takes-away-elections-manual-changes-from-sos/"> formal election manual</a> be approved by the Governor’s Regulatory Review Council. That means there would be formal public hearings. What it also means is that the council would be able to quash any changes that members believe go outside the legal authority of the secretary of state.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, State Rep. Kelly Townsend has pre-filed a bill that would limit the number of acceptable<a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-bill-would-ban-bank-docs-and-utility-bills-for-voter-id-11402513"> forms of ID</a> in order to cast a ballot. Townsends would eliminate the use of student IDs as well as the use non-photo documents like bank statements and utility bills.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Ron DeSantis has approved a proposal from Bay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Anderson to allow the county, which is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Michael in 2018, to use<a href="https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/voting-supersites-approved-for-2020-elections/"> vote centers</a> in the 2020 election cycle. “I have six identified fully which would be nine days for the presidential primary and then the primary will be another nine days but when we hit the general, they’ll be open for 14 days. These sites will allow us that we will open them but we will not close until election night,” Andersen told WMBB.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Under a bipartisan proposal from by Republican House Speaker David Osborne and Democratic House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins, an<a href="https://wfpl.org/legislative-leaders-propose-bill-to-overhaul-election-challenge-rules/"> automatic recount</a> would be triggered if election results show a candidate winning by less than half of a percentage point. The change would require a constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>Another proposal up for consideration in the 2020 General Assembly would expand the list of those allowed to cast<a href="https://www.winchestersun.com/2019/12/04/proposal-would-expand-list-of-those-eligible-for-absentee-ballots/"> absentee ballots</a> to include those employed in roles that are deemed “essential services personnel”.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The Oakland County board of commissioners approved a resolution — along party lines — designating<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2019/11/25/oakland-county-workers-get-election-day-paid-holiday/4301991002/"> Election Day a paid holiday</a> for Oakland County employees.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Red Wing city council has decided to suspend the push toward putting<a href="https://www.rivertowns.net/news/government-and-politics/4788520-Red-Wing-suspends-push-for-ranked-choice-voting"> ranked choice voting</a> on the 2020 ballot.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: By a 46-23 vote, the Assembly has approved a bill that will<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/assembly-passes-bill-granting-voting-rights-to-persons-on-parole-probation/"> reinstate voting rights</a> to those on parole or probation. The bill would not extend voting rights to those incarcerated and would provide criminal penalties for those incarcerated persons who cast a ballot. A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> A bill that would essentially create<a href="https://www.wtrf.com/news/ohio/voter-verification-and-registration-bill-hearing-delayed-at-sponsors-request/"> automatic voter registration</a> in the Buckeye State has been temporarily put on hold. The bill was scheduled for a hearing this week, but the bipartisan sponsors of the bill have requested a delay in the hearing in order to hear from more interested parties.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Following a slew of voter complaints on Election Day, a speedy bill seeking to alleviate the<a href="https://papost.org/2019/11/21/last-minute-bill-amendment-addresses-scanner-privacy-issues-at-the-polls/"> privacy problems</a> is on its way to Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk. In addition to requiring counties to provide voters with more privacy to cast their ballot, the bill also would do away with ballot stubs which caused problems with York County’s new voting system.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> By a 9-3 vote the Burlington city council passed a resolution that seeks to adopt<a href="https://www.wcax.com/content/news/City-council-passes-ranked-choice-voting-resolution-565722571.html"> ranked choice voting</a> in all mayoral, city councilor and school commissioner elections. The resolution now heads to the Charter Change Committee for a vote on whether to put the question on the March 2020 ballot to be approved by voters. The state Legislature will get the final say.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The Port Angeles city council voted 4-2 against adopting a resolution to consider adopting<a href="https://www.myclallamcounty.com/2019/12/04/pa-council-votes-against-ranked-choice-voting-resolution/"> ranked choice voting</a>. Two weeks before the vote, the city council asked city staff to create the resolution. Councilman Mike French said he doesn’t think voters here have a clear enough understanding of ranked-choice voting to be adopting the resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Gov. Tony Evers recently signed a bill into law that will<a href="https://www.wpr.org/gov-tony-evers-approves-poll-access-protections-voters-disabilities"> make voting more accessible</a> to people with disabilities. Voters with speech-affecting disabilities will no longer be required to state their name and address at a polling place. They will now be able to use written identification instead or an election official or trusted person can say the voter’s name and address for them.</p>
<p>Also in Wisconsin, by a 5 to 1 vote, the Wisconsin Elections Commission has voted to direct staff to start talking to lawmakers about the process for when they should<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/02/amid-lawsuit-election-officials-ask-rules-purging-voter-rolls/2586239001/"> purge voter rolls</a>. According to the <em>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</em>, the commissioners want clearer rules about how to treat voters who may have moved — either with a law that spells out those rules or a law that gives the commission the power to set those rules on its own.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Priorities USA and Voto Latino have filed a complaint alleging that the state’s<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/472116-democratic-group-challenges-arizona-absentee-ballot-deadline"> absentee ballot deadline</a> — 7 p.m. on Election Day — puts an undue burden on voters and takes away rights to procedural due process.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The legal battle over<a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/federal-judge-hammers-state-on-felons-rights"> Amendment 4</a>, and whether or not felons have to complete financial restitution before regaining their voting rights continued this week with a contentious hearing before U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle over whether or not the entire amendment was void because of the lack severability with regard to the restitution issues.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Priorities USA has filed another lawsuit in Michigan, this one against secretary of state Jocelyn Benson that challenges<a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/lawsuit-says-michigan-voting-laws-hurt-young-voters"> two provisions</a> in the state’s voting laws: restrictions on documents that demonstrate residency and restrictions on automatic voter registration for people younger than 17-and-a-half.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The Fifth Circuit heard arguments this week in a challenge to a Mississippi law that<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/fifth-circuit-takes-up-voting-rights-for-mississippi-felons/"> permanently blocks certain felons from voting</a> unless they can get their rights restored through a process their attorney says is basically nonexistent. According to Courthouse News Service, a lawyer for the plaintiff’s told the judges that the state’s permanent disenfranchisement law is preventing 29,000 Mississippians who have already served their sentences from voting.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> The state of Missouri has agreed to<a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-settles-federal-lawsuit-by-agreeing-to-make-motor-voter/article_4a565b17-0a3b-58be-bf7c-21e46ef9acfe.html"> make online voter registration easier</a> in order to settle a lawsuit alleging the state was violating the federal National Voter Registration Act. As part of the settlement reached Thursday, the Department of Revenue will redirect residents to the secretary of state’s voter registration website when they change their address through the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue also agreed to changes to in-person and by-mail change-of-address transactions. The suit was brought by the League of Women Voters and the A. Philip Randolph Institute.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Opening arguments began this week in the legal battle over<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/trial-begins-on-challenge-to-law-revamping-nh-voting-registration-requirements/30110335"> Senate Bill 3</a> which requires those registering to vote within 30 days of an election to provide documentation proving that they live where they say they do. Plaintiffs argue that the law imposes unnecessary burdens on the registration process, especially for college students, the elderly and homeless people. The state attorney general’s office counters that the law simply requires people registering to vote to substantiate that they are domiciled in the state.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit from a coalition of advocacy groups against the Rensselaer County Board of Elections over a proposal to share<a href="https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/11/26/lawsuit-against-proposed-county-policy-to-share-voter-data-with-ice-tossed-by-federal-judge/"> voter registration data</a> with federal immigration authorities, saying both parties shouldn’t have acted so quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Court papers filed by former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and several supporters accuse Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration of violating their year-old agreement in Philadelphia’s federal court by certifying the ExpressVote XL<a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/11/26/philadelphia-voting-machines-challenged-federal-court-2020-presidential-election/"> touchscreen system</a> made Election Systems &amp; Software. The filing is asking the court to force the state to rescind its certification of the machines.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: The S.C. Democratic Party and two national Democratic campaign organizations have sued the state Election Commission over a longstanding state law that requires prospective voters to<a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/democrats-sue-over-sc-s-social-security-number-requirement-for/article_eef51dae-0f22-11ea-9648-a3c9665f5c89.html"> submit their full Social Security number</a> in order to register. According to <em>The Post and Courier</em>, the groups argue the requirement has an unconstitutional chilling effect on potential voters who are concerned about sharing Social Security numbers, something that is mandated in only four states nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Pamela Moses of Memphis faces 12 counts of<a href="https://wreg.com/2019/11/21/local-activist-arrested-charged-with-illegally-voting/"> illegal registration or voting</a>, one count of falsifying an election document and perjury. According to an indictment returned by a grand jury, Moses voted in several elections dating back to 2016 knowing that she was a convicted felon and disqualified from voting. The indictment also alleges she made a false entry on her voter registration information on Sept. 3 this year.</p>
<p>Also in Tennessee, Shelby Advocates for Valid Election (SAVE) have<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/tennessee-voting-machines-challenged-at-sixth-circuit/"> appealed</a> a judge’s September dismissal of their suit against the state and the use of<a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/top-stories/appeal-filed-over-voting-machine-lawsuit/1011530838"> electronic voting machines</a>. The group&#8217;s recent lawsuit claimed that touchscreen voting machines are not secure because they don&#8217;t produce a voter-verifiable paper trail. A district judge dismissed the suit in September because he said it failed to show that any harm has been caused by these machines. Now the group is appealing the decision and pushing for hand marked paper ballots. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re after, hand marked ballots is basis. If someone can hack a machine, they can put in ransom ware and hold an election at ransom,&#8221; said plaintiff Mike Kernell.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Former Austin Assistant City Manager Terrell Blodgett, Texas Young Democrats (TYD) and Texas College Democrats are suing the secretary of state’s office over House Bill 1888 that bans local governments from setting up<a href="https://www.kut.org/post/young-democrats-and-former-austin-official-sue-over-texas-ban-temporary-voting-locations"> temporary polling locations</a>—or any polling location that isn’t open throughout all of early voting, this includes mobile voting sites at senior communities.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Twenty-third Judicial Circuit Judge Debra McLaughlin, who had ordered<a href="https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/circuit-judge-grants-stay-in-harpers-ferry-municipal-election-dispute/article_c7bca7e9-8587-5db1-9e60-750b159c62dd.html"> provisional ballots</a> in the Harpers Ferry June 11 municipal election be counted as part of a recount on Nov. 6, ruled that those who have challenged that decision have until Dec. 6 to “perfect” their appeal before the state’s high court. According to the <em>Herald-Mail</em>, the state Supreme Court of Appeals has been asked to expedite a review of the case, but McLaughlin ruled she would lift a stay that she has granted in the case if the appeal isn’t perfected with the high court by Dec. 6.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin asked Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy to let it<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/25/league-women-voters-seeks-join-lawsuit-over-purge-voter-rolls/4298000002/"> intervene in a lawsuit</a> brought by conservatives that could force up to 234,000 voters off the rolls. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 5.</p>

														<p><strong>Audits:</strong> DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced recently that is partnering with nonprofit VotingWorks on the<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/471577-dhs-cyber-agency-invests-in-election-auditing-tool-to-secure-2020"> open-source software tool Arlo</a> that is provided to state and local election officials for free. “Heading into 2020, we’re exploring all possible ways that we can support state and local election officials while also ensuring that Americans across the country can confidently cast their votes,” CISA Director Christopher Krebs said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> This week the Arizona secretary of state’s office launched the Arizona Voter Information Portal to help residents keep track of their registration and find other election-related information. The portal, which can be accessed at<a href="https://my.arizona.vote/PortalList.aspx"> My.Arizona.Vote</a>, is in conjunction with the new Arizona Voter Information Database. The secretary of state’s office and recorders and elections directors in the state’s 15 counties have completed their transition to the new database after years of testing and preparation, the release said.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Secretary of State Alex Padilla has launched a new website,<a href="http://www.howtovoteforpresident.sos.ca.gov"> www.HowToVoteForPresident.sos.ca.gov</a> to help Californians understand which candidates they are able to vote for under the state’s primary rules. Padilla noted that the site is particularly important for those voters who choose No Party Preference.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> The state has launched the<a href="https://www.duncanbanner.com/community/new-state-voter-portal-ready-for-citizens/article_fe579b16-0cb9-11ea-aae0-af058efd13dd.html"> OK Voter Portal</a> that allows voters to: verify registration status, view voting districts, find their polling place, view a sample ballot, change address or party affiliation, respond to address confirmation notices and request and check the status of absentee ballots. “The OK Voter Portal is a one-stop-shop for voters. It’s convenient, mobile-friendly, and most importantly, it’s safe and secure,” said Paul Ziriax, state election board secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Pierce County announced this week that after a successful pilot of the Votaz<a href="https://thesubtimes.com/2019/12/04/pierce-county-to-continue-mobile-voting-after-successful-military-pilot/"> mobile voting system</a> for military and overseas voters during local elections in 2019 that the county will continue to use the voting system moving forward. Pierce County had an excellent experience with the Voatz pilot. We intend to continue offering mobile voting as an option for overseas voters. Pierce County sees this as a safe and secure alternative for UOCAVA voters. We also see future potential for voters with disabilities– especially those who are blind or have difficulty handling paper and pens. A secure mobile voting app could be an important accommodation,” Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson said according to <em>The Suburban Times.</em></p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Using a nine-point criteria, the League of Women Voters of Texas review all of the<a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas-politics/report-finds-20-of-texas-counties-are-following-best-website-security-practices/"> county elections websites</a> and found that 20 percent are following best security practices. According to KXAN, largely the state’s metro area counties scored highest with Hays County coming out on top overall. “What we find is just like Texas is a huge state, and there are many counties with a lot of resources, and counties with very few resources,” League of Women Voters of Texas president, Grace Chimene, said. “You can tell by looking at their election websites what they have available to them.”</p>
