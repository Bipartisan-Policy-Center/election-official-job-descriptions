														<p><strong>CSG issues new report on military and overseas voting</strong><br />
<em>Report examines sustainability of balloting solutions for voters</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4883" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-11.13.40-AM-232x300.png" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-11.13.40-AM-232x300.png 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-11.13.40-AM-768x994.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-11.13.40-AM-791x1024.png 791w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-11.13.40-AM.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />This week, the <a href="http://ovi.csg.org/">Overseas Voting Initiative</a> (OVI) of the<a href="https://www.csg.org/"> Council of State Governments</a> issued a report on the sustainability of balloting solutions for military and overseas voters.</p>
<p><a href="http://ovi.csg.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/OVI-Report_FINAL_web.pdf">Examining the Sustainability of Balloting Solutions for Military and Overseas Voting</a> summarizes efforts to better understand why UOCAVA ballot delivery and return solutions have not been as sustainable as intended. In many cases these solutions appear financially burdensome to state and local election jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The report was presented last week during the<a href="https://www.csg.org/2019nationalconference/"> CSG National Conference</a> in San Juan, Puerto Rico by a panel of election officials who serve as members of the OVI Working Group. The OVI Working Group studies voting challenges related to voters covered under Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA, in an effort to improve the voting process for this group of voters and the election officials who serve them.</p>
<p>The report was developed through the work of OVI’s Sustainability of UOCAVA Balloting Solutions Subgroup, or SUBSS, and highlights trends and associated research areas in UOCAVA ballot delivery and ballot return and how to make these solutions more sustainable going forward.</p>
<p>“This report examines why ballot delivery and return solutions for military and overseas voters have not been as sustainable as intended for state and local election jurisdictions,” said Taylor Lansdale, OVI program manager for CSG. “Fostering UOCAVA solutions that will assist jurisdictions regardless of federal funding is critical, as is keeping pace with changing security requirements. There is a need for legislation that reflects evolving technology and jurisdictional needs and the excellent work undertaken by our OVI members in this report sets the stage for additional research in this critical area.”</p>
<p>The report found that a number of barriers prevent UOCAVA solutions from long-term sustainability including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relatively small customer base at the local election jurisdiction level makes them expensive on a per voter basis.</li>
<li>System maintenance costs have increased, and the complexity and lack of scalability in UOCAVA solutions preclude a one-size-fits-all approach in small jurisdictions with limited technical resources.</li>
<li>Greater cybersecurity requirements as a result of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s designation of election technology as critical U.S. infrastructure are difficult to implement at all levels.</li>
<li>On-site technical resources to maintain some of these solutions is not affordable for all jurisdictions.</li>
<li>A challenge for integrating UOCAVA technologies with other voting and voter registration systems in a jurisdiction is maintaining interoperability as these solutions are upgraded and replaced.</li>
<li>The expectations of voters to have the most intuitive web-based tools and the most comprehensive information at their fingertips continues to outpace the level of change and reinvestment for election officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>“I’m very pleased with the initial work that has gone into this report and the OVI Working Group’s view of the importance of this effort and their commitment to further study the sustainability of UOCAVA balloting solutions for delivery and return,” said FVAP Director David Beirne. “There have been many trends in UOCAVA solutions over the past several years with many new technologies being piloted and implemented by states, and this work will be critical to shaping the future of voting for military and overseas voters. I look forward to the group’s forthcoming research and case studies that will no doubt aid their election community colleagues and UOCAVA voters.”</p>
<p><strong>About Overseas Voting Initiative</strong><br />
In 2014, The Council of State Governments launched<a href="http://ovi.csg.org/"> Overseas Voting Initiative</a>, a four-year, $3.2 million program, with the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program to improve the return rate of overseas absentee ballots. After the success of the initial program, in 2018 FVAP collaborated with CSG on a $3.9 million, five-year effort to help uniformed services personnel and other U.S. citizens overseas vote in federal elections. As part of this effort, OVI maintains a working group that examines two distinct areas pertinent to military and overseas voting: The Sustainability of UOCAVA Balloting Solutions and Data Standardization and Implementation. Through OVI, CSG continues to provide state policymakers, state and local election officials and other election community stakeholders with research and best practice guides to ensure the men and women of the U.S. military and Americans living overseas can enjoy the same right to vote as citizens living in the U.S. OVI is housed in the CSG Center of Innovation.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> During a briefing on the state’s<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2019/12/deadline-looming-for-ohios-county-elections-boards-to-complete-new-state-security-requirements-for-2020.html"> cyber readiness for 2020</a>, Secretary of State Frank LaRose noted that 52 of the state’s 88 counties are at least half done in completing a state-mandated security check-list. Only 13 counties have installed Albert Sensors. “The vast majority of you are going to get this done,” LaRose said according to <em>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>. “A few of you will need some help and encouragement. But my goal is at the end of January, you will all be completed with the security directive, and we will be able to say to the voters that Ohio is the best prepared state in the nation from a very real and credible threat.” LaRose did note that the state has the authority to enforce compliance if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Under a new state law, all counties much undergo an<a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas-politics/some-texas-counties-schedule-on-mandatory-election-security-assessments/"> election security assessment</a> by the end of the year, but according to data from the secretary of state’s office, 59 counties have completed the assessment, eight are in progress, 119 are in the queue and 68 have yet to even being the process. “We want to make sure that we have the counties assessed as soon as possible, the remediation process is as far advanced as possible before the general election in 2020,” Keith Ingram, director of the elections division of the Texas Secretary of State’s office told KXAN.</p>

Three days of hand counting led to a final tally of 22,492 for Mejia and 22,491 for her opponent. In<a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/news/20191210/single-vote-determines-winners-in-two-out-of-four-summit-county-election-recounts"> Summit County, Ohio</a>, where four races resulted in a recount, two of those races ended with a one-vote difference.

<p><strong>Texas:</strong> At press time, officials in Midland County, Texas were hoping to figure out where 820 missing ballots went. At the beginning of the week officials had<a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/politics/elections/ballot-discrepancy-narrowed-down/513-bebbd7c5-73a5-47c7-ac3a-56c75ad6c5a6"> narrowed the discrepancy</a> down to one voting center inside a county annex. The elections office spent all last week comparing voter check-in cards to totals reported at each of the voting centers. On Thursday, election official will unseal each of the ballot boxes used in the November election and rescan all the ballots. As<a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/politics/elections/midland-ballot-count/513-03344348-9190-4c92-a65d-ac2cf09ed1e0"> per the court order</a>, any stray document or tally sheets found in ballot boxes will be put into sealed-confidential folders.  The county will compare ballot totals with the machine and recount committee totals. Elections Administrator Deborah Land believes the machines have given the right total all along. “I have faith in those machines,” she told NewsWest9. “I believe the issue is with the recount committee. They were in that room for a long time and were very tired. It’s likely they could have made an error.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>With misinformation as much of a concern as election hacking</strong>, a story from the <em>Louisville Courier-Journal</em> shows the battle elections officials are facing. According to emails obtained by the paper,<a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2019/12/05/kentucky-election-twitter-rebuffed-request-remove-misinformation/2596517001/"> Twitter officials refused requests from Kentucky election officials</a> and the National Association of State Election Directors  to remove tweets that were spreading misinformation about shredded ballots following the November election. While Twitter permanently suspended the account that put out the false information, the social media juggernaut did nothing to take down the tweets that were screenshot and passed around by numerous users. “The use of &#8216;dis or misinformation&#8217; to disrupt free and fair elections is unacceptable in any format,&#8221; wrote Jared Dearing, executive director of the Kentucky Board of Elections, in an emailed statement to the paper. &#8220;It is the continued hope of the State Board of Elections that social media companies do everything in their power to minimize the distribution of this disruptive and often malicious content.” For their part, Twitter said &#8220;We continue to critically examine additional safeguards we can implement to protect the conversation occurring on Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/dec/06/faulkner-county-doubles-fee-to-code-spe/"> cost of running a special election</a></strong> in Faulkner County, Arkansas just got a bit more expensive — but not for the county elections office. The county election commission recently voted to increase the cost of programming special election ballots for school boards and municipalities from $500 to $1000. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had five special elections this year,&#8221; said Teresa Horton election coordinator according to the <em>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</em>. &#8220;It can get very expensive for the county and we&#8217;ve only been charging them $500 for the ballot programming.&#8221; Horton told the paper Faulkner County is one of only seven counties in the state that program the ballots in-house. The other counties hire outside contractors who can charge about $5,000 per election.</p>
<p><strong>A long-running election tradition in New Hampshire</strong> is most likely no more. Tiny Dixville Notch, which for more than half a century, has been the first jurisdiction<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/12/07/tiny-dixville-notch-midnight-tradition-may-disappear/xrZflhuS4Ws2gPtxDDvbiM/story.html"> to cast a ballot in the presidential primaries at midnight on primary day</a>, no longer has enough residents to meet the legal threshold to host a polling place. “It is what it is,” Tom Tillotson, one of four residents of Dixville Notch, the town moderator and son of the creator of the midnight voting concept in the unincorporated town told <em>The Boston Globe</em>. “This is obviously not what I wanted to see happen.” The town needs at least five official residents to qualify for a polling place, but currently only has four. All is not lost though for the residents of Dixville Notch. If they cannot lure one more person to live in the area by late January, the four remaining residents will be assigned to cast ballots in Millsfield, which also allows people to vote beginning at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Ex-Felon Voting Rights:</strong> Beginning this week, felons in<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/11/iowa-simplifying-felon-voting-rights-application-process-kim-reynolds/4402835002/"> Iowa</a> who discharged their sentence from an Iowa prison or complete their parole will be given a nearly completed application to restore their voting rights. According to the <em>Des Moines Register</em>, Iowa Department of Corrections Director Beth Skinner said her department will roll out a system Thursday to auto-complete 12 of the 14 questions on the voting rights restoration application. An officer will then work with the inmate to complete the last two questions as part of their discharge from the correctional system, Skinner told the paper. In<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article238192224.html"> Kentucky</a>, new Governor Andy Beshear (D) was expected to file an executive order at press time that will restore the voting rights to around 100,000 formerly incarcerated Kentuckians. And in<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article238243869.html"> Florida</a>, at their annual meeting this week, the state’s supervisors of elections cast doubt on whether or not the ongoing battle over Amendment 4 would be done in time for the 2020 election cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Local elections officials are excellent penny pinchers</strong> — and we mean that in a good way — and the latest story out of Will County, Illinois is no exception. Illinois law requires that voters receive new voter registration cards every two years. Obviously printing and mailing costs can add up, but Will County Clerk Lauren Staley Ferry is going to be<a href="https://patch.com/illinois/bolingbrook/county-clerk-lauren-staley-ferry-s-redesign-voter-registration"> able to save her county thousands of dollars</a> in the long run by simply redesigning the voter registration cards so they are smaller with streamlined information. The smaller cards mean that postage will drop $.28 per card. Staley Ferry’s redesign will save the county $161,000 in postage costs over the next two years. &#8220;I cannot begin to tell you how thrilled we were to crunch these numbers and present this savings to our local taxpayers,&#8221; Staley Ferry told <em>The Patch</em>. &#8220;The information on these sleek, new Voter Registration Cards has been simplified and reorganized to serve our voters in the most efficient manner possible. I will continue looking for ways to improve our services while significantly reducing costs.&#8221;</p>

He was 59. According to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, Valparaiso police have said there were no signs or indicators of foul play. Election board colleagues told the Tribune that Welter was a calming and profession force following a tumultuous time for the board. “He was definitely a calming force. He came in with a job that needed to be done,” Clerk Jessica Bailey told the paper. “He came in and was open minded.” Election board member David Bengs echoed those sentiments. “We enjoyed working with him. I think I speak on behalf of the board in saying that,” Bengs said. “It’s just a shock. He was just a good person to work with. It was totally unexpected, just a shame.”</p>

According to the <em>Santa Fe New Mexican</em>, in the past city employees have received up to two hours off in order to cast a ballot but there are concerns that will not be enough time in 2020. “This will allow employees time to get to the polls to cast their votes and will minimize the challenges of scheduling conflicts during regular work shifts,” Bernadette Salazar, the city’s human resources director, wrote in a memo to Mayor Alan Webber and the City Council.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has signed legislation into law that should streamline the<a href="https://www.mytwintiers.com/ny-news-2/cuomo-signs-legislation-to-streamline-absentee-voting-process/"> absentee voting</a> process. Under the new law, the ballots used to vote absentee will be the same ballots that are used on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> Looks like voters in Burlington won’t be voting on whether or not to move the city to a<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2019/12/10/proponents-irked-ranked-choice-voting-missed-burlington-ballot-deadline/"> ranked choice voting</a> system after the Charter Change Committee failed to take up the resolution — approved by 9-2 vote by the full city council last week — at its meeting this week. Given the delay, the resolution will not make it back to the full council by December 16 and it will therefore miss the deadline to get on the March 2020 ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:,</strong> State Rep. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) and State Senator Mark Miller (D-Monona) introduced a proposal to implement<a href="https://www.wclo.com/2019/12/11/spreitzer-introduces-ranked-choice-voting-bill/"> ranked-choice voting</a> for most Wisconsin elections.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Steve Jones has ruled that former secretary of state and current Gov. Brian Kemp (R)<a href="https://www.gpbnews.org/post/judge-kemp-must-answer-questions-about-time-secretary-state"> must answer some questions</a> about his time as secretary as part a lawsuit challenging how elections are administered. The lawsuit, filed by Kemp&#8217;s gubernatorial rival Stacey Abrams&#8217; Fair Fight and other groups, seeks to reform the state&#8217;s election system after a contentious 2018 election that saw problems at the polls, allegations of voter suppression and increased scrutiny over outdated voting machines.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas has reached a settlement that will suspend the use of the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/multistate-voter-database-suspended-in-lawsuit-settlement/2019/12/10/a8518bee-1b8e-11ea-977a-15a6710ed6da_story.html"> Interstate Crosscheck program</a> “for the foreseeable future.” The settlement includes a list of safeguards the state has agreed to implement to protect voter’s personal information before the program can resume. Kansas has agreed not to resume operating Crosscheck until all security upgrades recommended by the Department of Homeland Security have been implemented and industry standard encryption practices are adopted. It also requires participating states to agree to a penalty of expulsion from the program for any negligent, reckless or intentional disclosure of information.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Last week, a three-judge panel of the Kentucky Court of Appeals denied a petition for a<a href="https://www.nkytribune.com/2019/12/kentucky-court-of-appeals-rules-in-favor-of-secretary-of-state-grimes-on-seizure-of-computer-from-office/"> writ of prohibition</a> against an independent counsel over the seizure of a computer from the office of Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The Public Interest Legal Foundation has sued Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey as well as the city’s Elections Director George Azzouz claiming that the city is woefully behind on<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/advocacy-group-attacks-detroits-voting-rolls/"> removing deceased residents</a> from the voter rolls.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: New York State Republican chair Nick Langworthy and two voters have filed a lawsuit against Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state&#8217;s Board of Elections over the<a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/politics/langworthy-sues-cuomo-new-york-board-of-elections-over-27th-district/71-1f2aa8b3-2e42-423c-9143-120fc30ffdd5"> lack of a special election</a> to fill the congressional seat vacated by Chris Collins. The lawsuit states that &#8220;approximately 750,000 residents similarly situated within the congressional district are being denied their right to representation in the U.S. Congress and are being further denied their right to vote for a representative.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Eighteen people voted in Ohio as well as in another state in the November 2018 general election according to Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Ten of them voted in another state before Ohio, and the other eight voted in Ohio first, LaRose said. “According to state law, the criminal act is the second vote,” says a news release from LaRose, which says the cases of the 10 who voted second in Ohio are being<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2019/12/18-people-illegally-voted-both-in-ohio-and-other-states-in-2018-election-secretary-of-state.html"> referred to prosecutors</a> here for review.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Circuit Court Judge Jocelyn Newman has upheld the state Republican Party’s<a href="https://triblive.com/news/politics-election/judge-south-carolina-gop-can-cancel-its-2020-primary/"> decision not to hold a 2020 presidential primary</a>. Earlier this year, former South Carolina congressman Bob Inglis sued state Republicans, saying the party’s decision to skip a primary deprives him and others “of the ability to vote for the candidate of their choice in South Carolina’s famous (and particularly influential) ‘First in the South’ primary.”</p>
