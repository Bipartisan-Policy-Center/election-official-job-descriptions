														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Brian Hancock</strong><br />
<em>After 35 years in the public sector, Hancock retires</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3811" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brian_Portrait-03.11.09-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brian_Portrait-03.11.09-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brian_Portrait-03.11.09.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Earlier this year, after 35 years working for the federal government, Brian Hancock retired.</p>
<p>As most of you know, at the time of his retirement, Hancock was the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>’s (EAC) Testing &amp; Certification Director. He was the first and only director of the program that was mandated by the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/HAVA.html"> Help America Vote Act</a>.</p>
<p>While at the EAC, Hancock oversaw the development of three sets of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (the current iteration is ending its public comment period) and according to the EAC, led the Testing and Certification team to complete 52 campaigns to certify in full, or modify, voting systems.</p>
<p>“I can say without a doubt that no one has dedicated more of his life to the American election system than Brian Hancock,” Doug Chapin, director of election research for<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/"> Fors Marsh Group</a> wrote in a recent<a href="https://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/2019/03/01/eac-testing-and-certification-director-brian-hancock-retires/"> blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Before joining the EAC, Hancock was on the staff on the staff of the<a href="https://www.fec.gov/"> Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) including 13 years as an elections research specialist in the FEC’s Office of Election Administration.</p>
<p>Although Hancock has retired from government service, he hasn’t gone far. He is currently the director of infrastructure policy and product development at<a href="https://unisynvoting.com/"> Unisyn Voting Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>We recently asked Hancock to partake in one of our exit interviews to get his thoughts on the past, present and future of voting technology.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why did you decide to retire from the EAC at this time?<br />
</strong></em>Thanks Mindy. I do need to preface my remarks by noting that these answers represent my personal thoughts and are not based on nor intended to describe the current state of affairs of the Testing and Certification program or the EAC in general.</p>
<p>Well, 35 years doing anything is quite a long time….   Seriously, the commute from home to the EAC offices in Silver Spring was wearing on both my nerves and my vehicle, the government shutdown gave me some additional time to think about my future and what my priorities should be, and, finally, it seemed like the EAC was moving in a new direction for certification, and I thought it best that someone new be around to help guide those changes.</p>
<p><em><strong>From the FEC to the EAC you&#8217;ve been in testing and certification for a long time. How have things changed with testing and certification from those FEC days to now and how would you like to see them continue to evolve?<br />
</strong></em>At the FEC, as you might remember, we did not actually do the testing and certification. FEC worked with NIST and the election community to develop the first 2 Voting System Standards (in 1990 and 2002).  At that point, NASED ran what they called a voluntary qualification program for those early electronic systems. FEC staff usually attended the NASED voting system meetings as sort of ad hoc advisors, but the decision making was done solely by NASED. Obviously HAVA changed all that and the EAC was tasked with developing the first truly national (though still voluntary), testing and certification program.  We developed the program to very closely mirror what is now ISO /IEC 17011:2017, the International Standard for accrediting conformity assessment bodies.</p>
<p>Elections are a dynamic environment that poses a constant challenge for any certification body, and we certainly had our share of challenges over the years. We were not perfect, but I think we did our best to find solutions to issues that were acceptable to all parties (vendor, State, LEO, voters, etc.) Moving forward, the EAC adopting the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines and the new internal certification process will be huge. Aside from that, I think the industry as a whole needs to do a better job of developing processes for allowing jurisdictions to implement critical security patches, as well as look at some more innovative solutions to speed the certification process such as manufacturer declaration of conformity.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you believe the impact of the 2016 election (and changed threat environment) will be to the industry and marketplace.<br />
</strong></em>2016 changed forever the way the election community looks at system security. Election officials have always been concerned about security, but 2016 really drove home the notion that cyber security needed to be addressed directly, and that nation-state actors were keenly interested in disrupting our election process. This new reality will take constant vigilance and cooperation between Federal State and local officials. We’ve made huge strides in these areas since 2016, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could design the perfect voting system, what would it look like?<br />
</strong></em>Wow. Loaded question in so many ways. I guess what I would say is that I have not yet seen such a system and like perfection anywhere, it’s probably more of a goal than a reality. I do think that Dean Logan has provided a good road map for system development with his new LA County voting system. I don’t believe that the product itself is the really innovative part, but his process was certainly unique and we can all learn from it. Dean and his team took a people centric approach to designing the system. They asked what the public and what the poll workers in LA wanted and needed from their new voting system, and used the answers to these questions as the groundwork for his system.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think the general public will ever be able to cast a vote online?<br />
</strong></em>Absolutely! Will they do it in my lifetime? Doubtful.  Unless someone is really close to solving the problem of securing the internet, we have a long way to go before on-line voting is a reality.</p>
<p>The last thing I wanted to say is a big thank you to all the folks who worked with me and for me in the EAC Testing and Certification Division from 2005 to 2019! Without those great folks, whatever success we had would not have been possible.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>Department of Homeland Security<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kirstjen-nielsen-resigning-dhs-secretary-expected-to-offer-resignation-today-live-updates-2019-04-07/"> Kirstjen Nielsen</a> has resigned effective immediately. How that may impact the administration cybersecurity efforts remains to be seen, but <em>The Washington Post</em> has an article expressing<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/04/08/the-cybersecurity-202-nielsen-departure-could-deal-a-blow-to-trump-administration-s-cybersecurity-efforts/5caa48b71b326b0f7f38f347/?utm_term=.b4f5b0a7838c"> the concerns of cyber experts</a> since Nielsen was one of the last civilians at the top ranks of DHS with extensive cybersecurity expertise.</p>
<p>“Hopefully whoever runs DHS will prioritize its vital cybersecurity mission, but it makes a difference if the person at the top has a background in cyber and knows from experience how important it is rather than just being told,” former State Department cyber coordinator Chris Painter told the Post. “DHS is spread thin among multiple priorities as it is, and without a clear mandate from department leadership that cybersecurity is a prime mission, their efforts risk being sidelined.”</p>
<p>According to <em>Politico</em>, the founder of Craigslist and the Global Cyber Alliance are teaming up to provide free cyber defense toolkits to election officials, nonprofit election rights groups and the media modeled after the ones GCA recently<a href="https://gcatoolkit.org/smallbusiness/"> pioneered</a> for small businesses. Craig Newmark Philanthropies is offering GCA more than $1 million for the project, and GCA is netting $1.5 million from other sources, the groups are<a href="https://www.globalcyberalliance.org/global-cyber-alliance-receives-over-1m-gift-from-craig-newmark-philanthropies-to-bolster-cybersecurity-of-media-and-elections/"> announced</a> this week.</p>

							<h2>2020 Candidates on Election Issues</h2>
														<p>Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (I), a candidate for president in 2020 recently told a crowd in Iowa that he believes<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-convicted-felons-voting-rights-prison-reform-iowa-states-1388374"> convicted felons should have the right to vote</a> and not just after they have completed the terms of their service, but also while they are still incarcerated.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my state, what we do is separate. You’re paying a price, you committed a crime, you’re in jail. That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; Sanders said according to <em>Newsweek</em>. &#8220;But you’re still living in American society, and you have a right to vote. I believe in that, yes, I do. I think that is absolutely the direction we should go,&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the <em>Huffington Post</em>,<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/2020-democrats-felon-disenfranchisement_n_5cae58dde4b09a1eabf75616"> no other 2020 candidates</a> have taken up the issue, although several campaigns said their first focus is on restoring voting rights to those formerly incarcerated.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Earlier this year, Ohio boards of elections sent out last-chance postcards</strong> to those in danger of being purged from the voter rolls. In March, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose launched the “Fresh Start Campaign,”<a href="https://www.ohio.com/news/20190410/130k-in-taxpayer-money-to-sign-up-540-ohio-voters---was-it-worth-it/1"> an effort to reach out the thousands of voters who had been purged</a> from the state’s voter rolls due to inactivity. The program sent out letters to t264,516 voters at a cost of $130,512. At this time, 540 people have re-registered to vote. “Every vote matters, and that’s why our ‘Fresh Start Campaign’ left no stone unturned,” LaRose said in a statement. “Moving forward, we’re working on finding ways to modernize our system so Ohioans can update their registration whenever they interact with state government. By doing so, we’ll be fulfilling our obligation to state and federal law to ensure election integrity, all while minimizing the impact to infrequent voters.”</p>
<p><strong>Work continues in Butte County, California</strong> to determine where all the registered voters<a href="https://www.chicoer.com/2019/04/08/voter-postcards-tracing-camp-fire-survivor-locations/"> displaced by the devastating Camp Fire are now living</a> and where they may be at the time of the next election. The registrar of voters office is sending out thousands of postcards asking about residents’ plans. “If they haven’t made up their mind, that’s OK. We understand,” Candace Grubbs, Butte County clerk-recorder and registrar of voters told the <em>Enterprise-Record</em>. Grubbs said that 19,000 post cards are going out that asking voters about their intentions so the county can get the right ballot information to them. “People have scattered so our job is to find these people. We’re trying to determine who’s coming back and who isn’t,” said Grubbs. “Their residence determines the election they can vote in.”</p>
<p><strong>To the approximately 53 percent of registered voters in America who didn’t vote in the 2018 election</strong>, let us tell you about Howard Meador of Norman, Oklahoma. On his way into his polling place on April 2 Meador took a nasty tumble and ended up with gash on his face and cuts on his arms. Before the local paramedics were about to take Meador to the hospital, one of them happened to ask him if he had gotten a chance to vote yet and when Meador said no,  they<a href="https://www.normantranscript.com/news/local_news/norman-man-requires-medical-attention-after-fall-still-votes-in/article_73bfff62-5fa0-556c-8924-008b3aaee6e4.html"> put him on a gurney and took him inside so he could vote</a>. Polling place volunteers were ready to help him get checked in and the paramedics even helped him get his ID out to show the check-in clerk. After watching his ballot go into the scanner, Meador headed to the hospital to get checked out (he’s fine). “I just think everybody ought to do that [vote],” Howard told <em>The Norman Transcript</em>. “Here’s a town of over 100,000 people, and if we get 20,000 people out to vote, that’s bad. I’ve always voted. I always try to make it. If I couldn’t be here, I’d mail it in or something.” Three cheers to Norman Meador for fulfilling his civic duty no matter what and three cheers to the Norman Fire Department and EMSSTAT and the poll workers for making sure Meador was able to vote!</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://www.ocvote.com/"> Orange County, California Registrar of Voters office</a> released a<a href="https://www.ocvote.com/media/pressrelease/?id=587"> report on its 2018 risk-limiting audit pilot project</a> this week. To compare the use of statistically based audit techniques and traditional post-election audits, the report highlights Orange County’s experience concurrently conducting California’s traditional 1 percent manual tally and a risk-limiting audit pilot. To serve as an example to jurisdictions considering risk-limiting audits, Orange County conducted two risk-limiting audit pilots in 2018 using its legacy voting system. The report concludes that: a risk-limiting audits could be conducted with slight adjustments using a legacy voting system; the ballot polling method was an appropriate method for the county; creating a ballot-sheet manifest without a compatible voting system presented challenges; and simultaneously conducting a risk-limiting audit and a 1 percent manual tally taxed scarce resources during the post-election period.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/"> Brookings Institution</a> released a<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-filer-voter-experiment-how-effective-is-voter-registration-at-tax-time/"> report on voter registration via tax filing</a> last week. The study, The Filer Voter experiment: How effective is voter registration at tax time?, tests whether voter registration at tax time could be an effective, low-cost policy mechanism to increase voter registration and turnout, and to improve the representativeness of the voting population. Using randomized control trials at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) centers in Cleveland, OH and Dallas, TX in the spring of 2018, the study finds that the “Filer Voter” program significantly increased registration rates among the initially unregistered. Those provided the opportunity to register during their visit to a VITA center (the treatment group) registered to vote at a rate of 8.8 percent, compared to only 3.9 percent of those who were not provided the opportunity (the control group).</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, introduced an updated version of their<a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/senators-reintroduce-bill-to-combat-election-interference/"> Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines Act</a> (DETER Act), which they said promises “swift and severe consequences” to Russia and other “foreign actors” if they attack U.S. political candidates, campaigns, or voting infrastructure. Last year’s version of the bill, S. 2785, made it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but not through the full Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The House has approved a bill that would place<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2019/04/08/house-approves-new-emergency-voting-restrictions/"> new restrictions on emergency voting</a>. Under the bill, voters would be required to sign statements affirming that they have genuine, unavoidable emergencies that prevent them from voting on Election Day. Falsely claiming an emergency would be a class 4 felony, which carries a penalty of 1.5 to 3 years. Voters casting emergency ballots would also be required to show identification, which is required for in-person voting on Election Day but not for early voting, which verifies voters’ identities by checking their signatures. SB1090 would also give exclusive authority over the locations of emergency voting centers to county boards of supervisors.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Senate Bill 573 is headed to the governor’s desk. If signed into law, it would allow minors convicted as adults to<a href="https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/knwa/new-law-to-restore-voting-rights-to-minors-convicted-as-felons-1/1900958332"> regain their voting rights</a> after completing all terms of their sentence including parole.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Assembly Bill 177 has been approved the Assembly Committee on Governmental Organization by a 13-6 vote. Under AB 177, state agencies and schools would be required to give their employees<a href="https://sanjosespotlight.com/assemblyman-evan-lows-election-day-holiday-bill-moves-ahead/"> Election Day off from work</a> — and schools would close — so voters can head to the polls. The bill must get approval from the Committee on Appropriations before it moves to the full Assembly and Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> At least 31 county clerks are opposing<a href="https://www.montrosepress.com/news/clerks-see-snag-in-elections-bill/article_757cb2de-5677-11e9-85b9-a357b16945b8.html"> House Bill 1278</a> that, among other things, expands the number of vote centers, changes the hours for vote centers to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., increases the number of weekend days they must be open and expands the number of ballot dropboxes a county must have.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a bill that mirrors House legislation attempting to set guidelines for the<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Senate-panel-OKs-felon-voting-rights-bill-with-13751377.php"> restoration of voting rights for ex-felons</a>. Like its House counterpart, the bill requires not only that eligible felons complete their prison sentences but also that they satisfy all fines, fees and victim restitution.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> The House has approved<a href="http://bigislandnow.com/2019/04/09/hawaii-house-passes-85-more-senate-bills/"> a series of election-related bills</a> that now return to the Senate for consideration. If the Senate does not agree to amendments made by the House, the bills will be negotiated in conference committees. The approved bills include one that would allow for the use of ranked choice voting in special elections to fill vacant seats, automatic voter registration and mandatory recounts in close races.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> Gov. Brad Little (R) has signed legislation into law that makes sure Idaho public schools are available as<a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/46524752/bill-ensuring-voters-can-use-public-schools-signed-into-law"> polling places</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> A senate committee added<a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/iowa-senate-adds-controversial-election-law-changes-bipartisan-house-proposal#stream/0"> numerous election law changes</a> to a House bill that would ensure mail-in ballots are counted in a consistent manner across the state. Some of the added changes include a controversial measure that would put students who don’t commit to living in Iowa after graduation on the inactive voter list. The bill would also phase out the bipartisan provisions approved by the House for mail ballot uniformity by 2023.</p>
<p>Although a constitutional amendment to automatically<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/04/felon-voting-rights-constitutional-amendment-setback-iowa-senate-gov-kim-reynolds-funnel-statehouse/3364741002/"> restore the voting rights</a> to ex-felons was approve 95-2 by the House, the bill failed to make “the funnel” in the Senate and will not advance in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The Legislature has approved a bill that would allow counties to move to a<a href="https://www.kmuw.org/post/kansas-legislature-approves-open-polling-option-future-elections"> vote center system</a> if they choose to. If signed into law, the secretary of state’s office would establish rules and regulations before counties may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> The secretary of state’s office has come out in opposition to a bill that would<a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/secretary-of-state-opposes-voter-registration-bill-despite-bipartisan-support/article_a4b86a7c-571a-11e9-8e6f-ef5f91374cc5.html"> automatically register</a> Show Me state residents to vote when doing business with the department of motor vehicles. “The secretary of state feels that voting is a decision to be taken very seriously,” said Nikolas Shores, legislative liaison for the Missouri secretary of state according to the Missourian. “Not to say that automatic voter registration doesn’t do that, but our concern is that by doing it automatically it may reduce the responsibility that comes with voting.” The bill has bipartisan support in the House committee.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Assembly Bill 345 would institute<a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2019/apr/11/same-day-registration-extended-deadlines-democrats/"> same-day voter registration</a>, allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 at the time of the general election to vote in the primary and extend online voter registration deadlines.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Mohave County Attorney Matt Smith is requesting $8K in county fund to investigate allegations of unspecified<a href="https://www.knau.org/post/voter-fraud-alleged-colorado-city"> voter fraud</a> during 2018 municipal elections in Colorado City.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> A coalition of groups has asked a federal judge to require 32 Florida counties to offer<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-spanish-language-ballots-judge-20190408-story.html"> Spanish-language ballots</a> and other election materials, the latest move in a legal battle that started last year. The request, filed Friday in federal court in Gainesville, seeks a preliminary injunction requiring Spanish-language ballots and materials for elections starting Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker has issued a six-page ruling dismissing a lawsuit filed in November against supervisors of elections in an effort to force them to<a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/judge-sides-with-supervisors-on-ballot-images"> preserve digital ballot images</a>. Walker wrote that provisions in the law &#8220;do not indicate Congress’ intent to create a private right or remedy. Instead, the enforcement mechanism appears to rest with the Attorney General of the United States or his representative.&#8221;  Walker also rejected constitutional equal-protection arguments raised by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Say Cheese! Apparently Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has agreed to settle a lawsuit over a ban on<a href="https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2019/04/08/deal-reached-on-lawsuit-over-michigan-ban-on-ballot-selfies/"> ballot selfies</a>. According to The Associated Press, lawyers won’t talk about the deal until details are filed in federal court on May 8. But a court filing last week suggests there will be an easing of the ban. The state said it wanted to avoid “any confusion” in polling places and wait until after local elections are held on May 7.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A state appellate court has ruled Morris County Clerk Ann Grossi should print<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ballots-mailed-must-be-bilingual-new-jersey-court-says/"> bilingual mail ballots</a> in Dover, with a population that is about 70 percent Hispanic. The ruling overturns a ruling last June by Superior Court Judge Stuart Minkowitz. “Considering the statutory scheme as a whole, it is clear that the Legislature has expressed a strong policy interest in protecting Spanish-speaking voters from being disenfranchised,” the unsigned 14-page opinion states.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office has subpoenaed James O’Keefe, the leader of  political activist organization Project Veritas, to testify before a grand jury after video of an Atkinson man admitting to<a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/ag-subpoenas-james-o-keefe-after-nh-man-admits-voting/article_7585bbed-1f7f-559a-bfd9-c96dafd9a900.html"> double voting</a> in 2018 was published online.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Simone Thrasher, 23 of Salem a former paid circulator registered with Oregon Elections Division, is accused of<a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/crime/2019/04/05/salem-woman-election-fraud-identity-theft/3369814002/"> making false statements, oaths or affidavits</a> on several signature sheets submitted in December 2015.  She also used the personal identification of at least 15 people on the petitions with the intent to deceive and defraud, according to court records.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Richard Douglas Dohmen, 68, of James City, was indicted by a grand jury in the Williamsburg-James City County Circuit Court on March 20 on charges of<a href="https://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-richard-dohmen-indicted-0409-story.html"> forging public records with the intent to defraud and making a false statement</a>, according to the indictments. He allegedly tried to cast two ballots in October 2018.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> conducted a four-month review of nearly 1,300 pages of documents and interviewed state employees and other individuals who worked on the California Department of Motor Vehicles’<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-motor-voter-problems-investigation-20190409-story.html"> automated voter registration system</a>. According to the paper, the emails present a picture of a project bogged down by personnel clashes, technological hurdles and a persistent belief among those involved that top officials were demanding they make the “motor voter” program operational before the June 5 primary, so that it could boost the number of ballots cast.</p>
