							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Officials from vote-by-mail states gather for conference</strong><br />
<em>First-of-its-kind conference focuses on lessons learned and future of &#8216;pajama voting&#8217;</em></p>
<p>By Lynn Bartels<br />
Special to electionline<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-large wp-image-4180" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Scenic-1024x644.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="403" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Scenic-1024x644.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Scenic-300x189.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Scenic-768x483.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Oregon, Washington and Colorado are officially the nation’s three mail-in ballot states but <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/">Washington Secretary of State</a> Kim Wyman says actually there are more.</p>
<p>“When 60 percent of your voters request an absentee ballot, you’re a mail ballot state, you just don’t know it yet,” she said.</p>
<p>Wyman was among the election officials who spoke at the three-day Western States Election Conference that began July 7 in Stevenson, Wash., at Skamania Lodge. Participants took in views of the stunning Columbia River Gorge in between plenty of talk about best practices of what some voters call “pajama voting.”</p>
<p>“It’s really nice to be in a room full of people who love mail ballots,” Wyman said.</p>
<div id="attachment_4179" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4179" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-4179" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-Oregon-clerk-CO-clerk-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-Oregon-clerk-CO-clerk-300x223.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-Oregon-clerk-CO-clerk-768x571.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-Oregon-clerk-CO-clerk-1024x762.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4179" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The elections conference grew out of talks with Nancy Blankenship, clerk for Deschutes County, Ore., and Hillary Hall, clerk for Boulder County, Colo.</em></p></div>
<p>The conference grew out of talks between former <a href="https://www.bouldercounty.org/departments/clerk-and-recorder/">Boulder County, Colo.</a>, Clerk Hillary Hall and Nancy Blankenship, clerk of <a href="https://www.deschutes.org/clerk">Deschutes County, Ore</a>., former president of the <a href="https://oacclerks.org/oacc/">Oregon Association of County Clerks</a>. Blankenship then recruited two fellow Oregon clerks, <a href="https://www.co.lincoln.or.us/clerk">Lincoln County’s</a> Dana Jenkins and <a href="https://www.co.tillamook.or.us/gov/Clerk/default.htm">Tillamook County’s</a> Tassi O’Neal, who were involved several years ago when Oregon and Washington held a conference to discuss mail ballots.</p>
<p>“We’re super excited to be here,” Pam Anderson, executive director of the <a href="https://www.clerkandrecorder.org/">Colorado County Clerks Association</a>, said when she kicked off the conference.</p>
<p>“We share a lot of similar things in our mail-in model. The question is where are we going next.”</p>
<p>Sessions dealt with a variety of topics, from voting for the disabled to ballot envelope design to cyber security.</p>
<p>Oregon clerks Jenkins and O’Neal, Wyman and Anderson provided the history of their state’s path to mail-in ballots, a move that has made them top among states in voter turnout. The Oregon clerks said along the way proposals at times failed because Democrats believed mail ballots would benefit Republicans and vice versa.</p>
<p>The difference and similarities of the systems were highlighted.</p>
<p>Oregon and Washington pay for postage, although there are concerns that postal closures and resignations of long-time postal workers could have an impact on ballot returns. Colorado does not, instead choosing to invest in 24-hour drop boxes that are emptied by county election workers on a regular basis.</p>
<div id="attachment_4181" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4181" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-4181" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mail-WA-SOS-Pam-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mail-WA-SOS-Pam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mail-WA-SOS-Pam-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mail-WA-SOS-Pam-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4181" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Pam Anderson, the executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, center, is with Mark Neary, assistant secretary of state in Washington, and WA Secretary of State Kim Wyman.</em></p></div>
<p>Colorado also has a hybrid system, with clerks opening a required number of Voter Service and Polling Centers before the election. Coloradans can vote in person, register to vote, request a new ballot and such at those centers. The Colorado clerks at the conference were vocal about wanting to reduce the number of centers, especially in rural counties where they are not heavily utilized, driving up the costs to process the ballots.</p>
<p>During one exercise, election officials moved about the room and sat at tables with those whose counties have roughly the same number of voters. They shared best practices with each other and then with the entire room.</p>
<p>One of the themes that emerged, no matter the population of the county: Legislators don’t always take into account the expertise of election officials or their needs before passing bills.</p>
<p>Professor <a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/paul-gronke/">Paul Gronke</a>, who teaches political science at Reed College in Portland, Ore., said it was eye-opening to find out that many county clerks not only conduct elections, but also might handle motor vehicle registrations or driver’s licenses, record documents, issue passports, take minutes for county commissioners and more.</p>
<p>Amber McReynolds, executive director of the <a href="https://www.voteathome.org/">National Vote at Home Institute</a>, touted the West’s success when it comes to election innovation. She said some states offer no early voting and an excuse is required to vote absentee.</p>
<p>“Election policy must be about who votes, not who wins,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_4182" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4182" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-4182" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-DHS-alone-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="147" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-DHS-alone-300x147.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mail-DHS-alone.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4182" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Matt Crane with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said elections offices these days look like IT offices because of all the security.</em></p></div>
<p>Matt Crane, with the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, discussed what his agency is focused on, including offering cyber security assistance for smaller counties that want help. And he talked about times have changed for local election officials.</p>
<p>“A typical county election office looks more like an IT office,” he said.</p>
<p>Blankenship and Hall, the Washington and Colorado clerks who first discussed the idea of a conference, said they were thrilled with the outcome.</p>
<p>Said Blankenship: “This, democracy, is such an important part of our daily life.”</p>
<p>“We’re still the new kids,” Hall said. “The idea was to get together with people who have been doing mail-in ballots for a while. My hope is that as more states adopt mail-in ballot we hold more conferences and learn from each other.”</p>
<p>One state moving to a mail-in ballot system is another Western neighbor, Utah. The state of Hawaii is also in the implementation queue.</p>
<p>The 2020 presidential election came up frequently but many local elected officials thought Secretary Wyman said it best when she mentioned school board races and other contests.</p>
<p>“This country is going to have a very high profile election next year,” she said, “but other elections matter just as much.”</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>By 225-184 vote, the House has approved the<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/450737-house-passes-sweeping-democrat-backed-election-security-bill"> Securing America’s Federal Elections (SAFE) Act</a>. would authorize $600 million for the Election Assistance Commission, which would be allocated to states to enhance their security ahead of 2020 and includes language that would ban voting machines from being connected to the internet and being produced in foreign countries. In addition to the $600 million, the bill would provide $175 million biannually for “sustainment” funds aimed at maintaining election infrastructure. It would also create a $5 million grant program administered by the National Science Foundation to research accessible paper ballot verification methods to address the needs of voters with disabilities and voters who speak English as their second language.</p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, FBI Director Christopher Wray and other Administration security officials testified before Congress in<a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/07/10/trump-officials-to-brief-congress-on-election-security"> two closed-door presentations</a> this week. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., called the briefing helpful and said it reinforced the importance of remaining vigilant against outside threats to U.S. elections. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, said the FBI and other law enforcement “definitely upped their game in 2018, but the Russians and others will be back.” National security officials said in a statement Wednesday that election security is a top priority and that officials are taking a “whole-of-government approach” to securing the 2020 elections, along with state, local and private sector partners.</p>
<p>Despite the Administration’s admission that there is an ongoing threat to elections, Senators who participated in the closed-door session did not indicate they would do anything to move forward with election security legislation approved by the House.</p>
<p>“Federal involvement in the process, from our national security agencies, particularly the Department of Homeland Security, I think [it&#8217;s] added a significant element in 2018. And that will be even greater in 2020,” Sen. Roy Blount (R-Missouri) said according to <em>Roll Call.</em></p>
<p>Blunt also said there’s general agreement that a paper backup for election systems is a key element of election security going forward.</p>
<p>“I think we’d all like to see every state move toward a paper ballot backup system where you’d have some piece of paper to count, if there was any question about the election count itself,” he told reporters after the briefing.</p>

							<h2>2019 Election Udpates</h2>
														<p>Two weeks after New  Yorkers went to the polls at least two races remain undecided. In<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/nyregion/katz-caban-recount-queens-da.html"> Queens</a>, a closely watched race for District Attorney is now under a recount. Following the initial vote count it appeared that Tiffany Caban had won, but following a count of provisional ballots candidate Melinda Katz was ahead by 20 ballots. The flip in results has some activists<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/nyregion/recount-caban-katz-queens-da.html?module=inline"> crying foul</a>. The recount began on Tuesday and with more than 91,000 ballots to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/queens-district-attorney-primary-could-take-weeks-to-call-11562711763"> count by hand</a>, it could be several weeks before there is an official result.</p>
<p>In the race for Watertown mayor it’s still unclear who will be on the ballot in November. Under city law, the top two vote getters move on to November. Problem is, there are two candidates<a href="https://www.wrvo.org/post/unprecedented-primary-tie-remains-unresolved-watertown"> tied for second place</a>. &#8220;This is absolutely unprecedented,&#8221; Jude Seymour, the Republican Elections Commissioner for Jefferson County told WRVO. Because Watertown’s elections are governed by the city and not the state, there are no statutes in place for how to deal with a tie. An attorney for the city is recommending that<a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2019/07/09/watertowns-lawyer-weighs-mayoral-ballot-controversy/"> all three candidates</a> be placed on the November ballot.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Update on PA Voting Equipment</strong>: Earlier this year Gov. Tom Wolf (D) required that all 67 Pennsylvania counties replace their voting equipment with a paper-based system. Wolf asked the Legislature for $75 million to help counties offset the costs. Last week, the Legislature approved a<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pa-house-plans-funding-for-voting-machine-bill-with-conditions/"> funding package of $90 million</a>, but the legislation also included<a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-budget-voting-changes-20190628-obsl4tpnq5aldfo42svgrz7zw4-story.html"> other provisions</a> like eliminating straight-party voting. The bill also would have extended the absentee ballot deadline. The bill was approved mostly along party lines. Wolf<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/07/gov-wolf-vetoes-voting-machine-funding-bill.html"> vetoed the bill</a> early this week saying that while he supported the funding portion of the measure he did not support the elimination of straight-party voting. According to PennLive, he also cited his objections to language inserted in the bill that would impose legislative review on any future action by the Department of State &#8211; which oversees the administration of elections statewide &#8211; to decertify Pennsylvania’s voting machines en masse. On Tuesday, Wolf announced that he is ordering a<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/07/wolf-orders-bond-issue-to-help-counties-buy-voting-machines.html"> bond issue to help the counties</a> cover the costs of the new voting machines. The bond issue would help counties recover up to 60 percent of their costs for new equipment.</p>
<p><strong>The Maryland State Board of Elections will soon allow Marylanders</strong> registering to vote to<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-voter-gender-20190705-story.html"> choose “X” or “unspecified” for their gender</a> on voter registration forms. According to <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>, the move comes as state Motor Vehicle Administration prepares to offer the third option for gender on driver’s licenses and state identification cards, in response to a new state law. The state’s elections board voted unanimously at its meeting last week to authorize the elections staff to make the necessary changes, David J. McManus Jr., the board chairman told <em>The Sun</em>. There was no opposition, and no one raised concerns, he said. Elections officials will continue to use the paper applications that they already have on hand, but the next batch that’s printed will include gender options of “F,” “M” and “X.” The online voter registration system is likely to be updated sooner, McManus said. “There’s no fiscal impact to it,” McManus said. “It’s just a form and we will add one little piece for it.”</p>
<p><strong>An April Florida Supreme Court ruling means that constitutional officers in six counties</strong> will now be a<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/07/10/choice-leon-county-elections-chief-now-political-party-contest/1694850001/"> partisan elected position</a> including the supervisor of elections in Leon County. “It has been determined that the provisions in the Leon County Charter establishing non-partisan elections for the Supervisor of Elections have been rendered unenforceable by operation of law,” the Leon County Supervisor of Elections office said in a Wednesday email. Additionally, the opinion requires that elections supervisor candidates maintain their party affiliation for at least a year prior to qualifying. “I want to stress that although the Supervisor of Elections is now required to be elected by a partisan process, this office will continue to function in a wholly non-partisan manner as it always has been,” Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley said. .</p>
<p><strong>The National Association of Secretaries of State</strong> (NASS) recently held their annual conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico and while there inducted the<a href="https://www.nass.org/node/1689"> newest executive board</a>. Leading NASS for the 2019-2020 term will be Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate. In addition to Pate, Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico will serve as the president-elect, Kyle Ardoin of Louisiana will serve as treasurer and William Gardner of New Hampshire as secretary. &#8220;It is a tremendous honor to lead this bipartisan group of state election officials as we enter the 2020 election cycle. I&#8217;m thankful for their trust in me as we work together to share best practices and ensure clean and fair elections across the country,” Pate said.</p>
<p><strong>Good News!</strong> In a recent interview with the <em>Shreveport Times</em> covering a variety of issues, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said that the state will work to bring back it’s very popular Blue Dog<a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2019/06/27/voting-machines-felon-registration-i-voted-stickers/1577405001/"> “I Voted” stickers</a> which were cut in 2018 due to budgetary reasons. “If the voters want stickers, well by gosh, we’re going to find a way to get those stickers,” Ardoin told the paper.</p>

														<p><strong>California:</strong> A bill requiring an audit of California’s<a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/06/26/motor-voter-audit-dies-in-committee/"> Motor Voter program</a> has died in a Senate committee.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> Gov. John Carney has signed House Bill 38 into law. Under the new<a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2019/06/30/governor-carney-signs-early-voting-legislation/"> early voting</a> law, voters in The First State will be able to cast their ballots at polling places up to 10 days before Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has signed a bill into law that would require felons released from prison to<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/06/28/ron-desantis-signs-amendment-4-bill-limiting-felon-voting/"> pay all required restitution</a> before their voting rights are restored.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Gov. Chris Sununu (R) has vetoed a bill that would have allowed for limited release of certain<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/gov-sununu-issues-10-new-vetoes#stream/0"> data in the state’s centralized voter registration database</a>, pursuant to a court order when necessary “to protect the right to vote from infringement.”</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Sen. Joseph Addabbo has introduced a bill that would require all voting machines to<a href="https://ridgewoodpost.com/addabbo-bill-proposes-notifying-voters-when-they-vote-for-candidates-who-have-dropped-out-of-a-race"> notify voters</a> if they have chosen a candidate listed on the ballot who has officially withdrawn from the race prior to election day. It would also allow the voter a chance to switch their vote, if they choose to do so.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The Senate has<a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2019/07/09/absentee-ballot-bill-passes-nc-senate/"> approved</a> a bill that would eliminate a statewide<a href="https://www.wral.com/bill-addressing-absentee-ballot-mischief-advances-in-senate/18485822/"> absentee ballot request</a> form that can be mass copied, filled out and turned in to local county boards. Instead, individual voters would have to write personal requests, as they used to do, to receive a ballot. The person fills out the ballot, gets witness signatures and sends it in an envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that will<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/07/oregon-lawmakers-approve-paid-postage-for-ballots.html"> cover postage for ballots</a>. Under the measure, ballot return envelopes would include pre-paid postage in the form of a “business reply mail” envelope. It means the ballots can be mailed from anywhere in the United States without needing a stamp. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Kate Brown, who has expressed strong support for the legislation.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> An indictment unsealed in Los Angeles charged nine people accused of participating in voting fraud schemes — in which homeless people were allegedly<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Indictments-Charge-Widespread-Voting-Fraud-Scheme-in-Los-Angeles-511971752.html"> offered cash or cigarettes in exchange for forged signatures on initiative petitions and voter registration forms</a>. According to NBC, Prosecutors have accused the group of 14 felonies for a variety of alleged acts during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, including charges of circulating an initiative with forged or fictitious names, signing fictitious names, registering fictitious persons, and making payment for signatures, according to the indictment. None of the defendants faces all of the charges.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Arguing an omnibus elections bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis makes the case moot, lawyers for the state are asking a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit challenging how Florida elections officials handle<a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/07/02/state-wants-ballot-signature-lawsuit-tossed/"> mismatched signatures</a> on mail-in and provisional ballots.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, Lawyers representing voting-rights and civil-rights groups, as well as more than a dozen Floridians who’ve been convicted of felonies, filed three lawsuits in federal court, immediately after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law an omnibus elections measure (SB 7066) that included the implementation of<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/07/02/voting-rights-law-draws-court-fight-registration-push/1627293001/"> Amendment 4</a>. The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a fourth lawsuit. The legal challenges, combined into one case by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, allege the legislation unconstitutionally “creates two classes of citizens,” depending on their ability to pay financial obligations that many don’t even know about.</p>
<p>In documents filed this week, plaintiffs in a long-running dispute over campus early voting sites argued that language slipped into SB7066 that requires college campus early voting sites to have “sufficient non-permitted parking” will create an<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article232439002.html"> unconstitutional burden on young voters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg  this week ordered election officials to allow computer experts to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/judge-allows-outside-inspection-georgia-voting-system/dKJsagtRo3VULtKlM7e6mM/"> review databases</a> used to configure ballots and tabulate votes. The ruling comes in a lawsuit by election integrity advocates who doubt the accuracy of the state’s voting machines.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, a lawsuit over<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/new-protections-for-georgia-absentee-ballots-settles-lawsuits/vhRcux8zJydbpwDq9xvqLO/"> rejected absentee ballots</a> has been dismissed following the passage of House Bill 316 that will change how absentee ballots are reviewed. “The parties agree that the above-cited provisions make further litigation of this matter unnecessary,” according to a joint stipulation for dismissal last month.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Westmoreland County Judge Harry F. Small approved a new<a href="https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/westmoreland-county-judge-oks-new-voting-districts-in-upper-burrell/"> voter precinct plan</a> for Upper Burrell that will more evenly divide the number of voters between the township’s two precincts.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Klaus Michael Adam, 77, a Killeen municipal election judge, was indicted by the Bell County Grand Jury on the charge of criminal attempt<a href="http://kdhnews.com/news/local/killeen-election-judge-indicted-by-county-jury/article_ea1e88a6-99e8-11e9-b20f-ff5ab9632606.html"> illegal voting</a>.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: After a federal court ruled that the president could not<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/07/merrill-says-his-twitter-case-different-from-trumps.html"> block users from his Twitter account</a>, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, who has also been sued by users that he has blocked, said that there is a key difference between his situation and the president’s. Merrill said that because he does not use @JohnHMerrill, the account he has been sued about, for official business the ruling against the president does not apply. “I do answer questions when people raise them and I have interacted with constituents when they initiated it,” Merrill said according to <em>AL.com</em>. “That’s responding to inquiries. That’s not me promoting something or introducing something for the first time from the office of the Secretary of State.” That’s a point of contention in the lawsuit filed against Merrill by the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama on behalf of three blocked Twitter users. The plaintiffs claim Merrill does use the account for official business.</p>
