							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony, Clearie</strong><br />
<em>2019 Clearie submission deadline is Nov. 25</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony, Clearie.</p>
<p>Clearie?</p>
<p>While the Clearies — the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2019/09/10/eac-opens-submission-period-in-fourth-annual-competition-for-clearinghouse-awards-celebrating-best-practices-in-election-administration-clearinghouse-awards/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Clearinghouse Awards</a> — may not have the accompanying awards show glitz, glamor and overly long acceptance speeches, if you’re an election official winning a Clearie Award is the industry’s equivalent of winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar or Tony.</p>
<p>“It was wonderful to shine the spotlight on our team members who did this work and have their accomplishments acknowledged by a broader community,” said Sophie Lehman, elections service manager in the<a href="https://www.contracostacore.us/"> Contra Costa County, California</a> elections office. “It’s great to see them receive wider recognition from an audience of their peers. It also opens opportunities for our team members to meet and collaborate with their colleagues across jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Contra Costa County won a 2018 Clearie Award for their<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/contra-costa-county-ca-2018-clearinghouse-award-winner/"> APPLE class and kit</a>, a program that provides instruction on establishing and maintaining accessible polling places that resulted in a better voter experience and freed up office staff for other Election Day activities.</p>
<p>“Because it was so successful, we wanted other jurisdictions to see how poll workers were able to take full ownership of accessibility at their polling place,” Lehman said.</p>
<p>Following the win in 2018, the county has now had elections officials from other jurisdiction request their kits and attend their classes.</p>
<p>This year marks the fourth year for the Clearies, with the deadline for submission on Monday, November 25.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png" alt="" width="223" height="223" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />At inception, the competition featured one category to recognize exemplary election worker programs. In 2017, the awards expanded to include categories for outstanding innovations in elections and improving accessibility for voters with disabilities. This year, the Clearies will recognize award recipient in four categories, including a new national “I Voted” sticker competition.</p>
<p>“As my fellow commissioners and I travel across the country, we see firsthand the can-do spirit of election officials and the practical solutions they bring to even the smallest of election day tasks, EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick said. “The Clearies provide us with the opportunity to recognize these best practices, acknowledge entrants, and focus attention within the elections community to successful new programs.”</p>
<p>When the Clearies began in 2016, the EAC received around 15 entries. Over the past three years, the number of submissions increased. The EAC now receives between 35 and 45 submissions annually from jurisdictions large and small across the country. In 2018, seven of the awardees hailed from counties and townships across the U.S.</p>
<p>“Often, some of the best ideas in election administration come from the local level. We want to celebrate those successes,” McCormick said. “Whether, a small county, large state, or local township, we want to hear from you about your programs that have produced positive results.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/Elections/index2.html">Montgomery County, Maryland</a> was a 2018 winner for its<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/montgomery-county-md-2018-clearinghouse-award-winner/"> Future Voter Initiative</a>, a program designed to get students as young as sixth grade involved in the voting process. Margaret Jurgensen, executive director of the county board of elections said it was a morale boost to the staff and an acknowledgement of developing a unique program that serves the voting community.</p>
<p>Jurgensen noted that not only was winning a Clearie a great experience for her staff, but that the board of elections was able to learn a lot about what other counties are doing.</p>
<p>“Learning from our peers of the creative solutions that are out there is so important. Maybe your specific program won’t work exactly but may inspire another jurisdiction to modify and adapt to serve their community,” Jurgensen said. “Everyone in elections desires to encourage voter participation and the numerous ideas out there are very much can help to meet the goal to allow all qualified citizens the right to vote.”</p>
<p>Even though the deadline for the 2019 Clearies is just days away, there is still time to enter.</p>
<p>“We purposely keep the Clearies entry process simple and straightforward,” McCormick said. “Applicants from all jurisdiction sizes are encouraged to submit their work. And since we recognize that this is a very busy time of year, submissions can be as simple as a half-page narrative or as complex as a series of documents and videos.”</p>
<p>If you needed any more encouragement, past-winner Contra Costa County, who is submitting a program for this year’s awards too has some advice.</p>
<p>“Do it!&#8221; Lehman said. &#8220;We want to know what you’re doing so we can borrow and adapt your brilliant ideas!”</p>
<p>All<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2019/09/10/eac-opens-submission-period-in-fourth-annual-competition-for-clearinghouse-awards-celebrating-best-practices-in-election-administration-clearinghouse-awards/"> submissions</a> should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>The House Science, Space and Technology Committee</strong> unanimously approved the<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/470506-bipartisan-bill-to-secure-election-tech-advances-to-house-floor"> Election Technology Research Act</a> that would authorize the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation to conduct research on ways to secure voting technology.  The legislation would also establish a Center of Excellence in Election Systems that would test the security and accessibility of voting machines and research methods to certify voting system technology.</p>
<p><strong>This week a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee</strong> subcommittee on<a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/house-panel-zeroes-in-on-election-security-ahead-of-2020/"> Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation</a> featured<a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2019/11/20/election-security-hearing-johnson.aspx"> testimony</a> from officials in the Federal government, academia, and the private sector, but mainly targeted efforts the private sector is making to protect U.S. elections infrastructure and political campaigns from malicious actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easier and more comfortable for us to see this problem as a threat from the outside, from foreign influence operations. And, indeed, they remain a grave national security threat,&#8221; Richard Stengel, fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, wrote in his opening statement. &#8220;But the scale and range of domestic disinformation &#8212; created and spread by Americans to other Americans &#8212; dwarfs any foreign threat or troll factory. Our foreign adversaries seek to engage Americans and do so, but our homegrown disinformation overwhelms what our adversaries produce.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>2020 Candidates on Election Issues</h2>
														<p><strong>Sen.<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/470978-klobuchar-unveils-plan-to-secure-elections-as-president"> Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minnesota),</strong> a 2020 presidential candidate, this week published a strategy for how she, if elected, would secure the U.S. election infrastructure both from cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, key parts of the strategy include Klobuchar’s intention to issue an executive order that would bolster government-wide cybersecurity efforts, and launch a “cabinet-level taskforce” that would coordinate across federal agencies and with state and local governments to better address cyber threats to elections.</p>
<p>Klobuchar would also require states to use paper ballots as a way to prevent cyber tampering with the vote, and set “strong cybersecurity standards” for voting infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>In the lead up this week’s Democratic debate</strong>, candidate<a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-2020-yang-would-lower-voting-age-ban-voter-requirements/k2vCmrm5tzoxiCnSf8GyTL/"> Andrew Yang</a> said that he would lower the voting age for federal elections to 16, ban voter ID requirements and restrict late changes to polling sites. According to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the entrepreneur said he would implement automatic and same-day voter registration, require states adopt early voting and boost funding to election security. He also said he supports a law that requires all states to integrate mail-in ballots to their voting process and limit purges of the voting rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Former New York City Mayor<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471343-bloomberg-to-spend-millions-on-voter-registration-campaign-targeting"> Michael Bloomberg</a></strong>, who may or may not be a candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination is apparently set to spend an estimated $15 million to $20 million to finance a voter registration campaign. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the voter registration effort, which will begin early next year, is set to target 500,000 voters from groups that traditionally support Democratic candidates, including African Americans, Latinos, Asians, young voters and those living in some rural communities. The drive will start in the states of Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin but could expand to other states.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Pulaski County, Arkansas Judge Barry Hyde sent a letter this week</strong> to the county’s election commission saying that his office will begin<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/21/elections-panelists-lose-power-to-hire-/?news-politics"> managing the office’s personnel</a>. According to the <em>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</em>, the move comes after weeks of tension between the county and the commission and after allegations of an “abusive” work environment created by one of the election commissioners. &#8220;I have also been made aware that informal attempts to resolve these concerns have been fruitless,&#8221; he wrote to commissioners. &#8220;Conduct creating an abusive work environment is not, and will not be, tolerated.&#8221; Hyde did not name the commission in question and Commissioner Kristi McKinnon said she had no idea what Hyde was referring to. &#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t know. It seems to be coming out of left field,&#8221; she said in a short interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve come in here, and we&#8217;ve made a lot of changes, and that can be uncomfortable for some people.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Montana State-Tribal Relations Interim Committee</strong> met recently to discuss ways to<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/advocates-push-for-greater-voter-access-on-montana-s-reservations/article_23a3b622-9e82-539d-9404-07ec924a1ac1.html"> break down barriers to voting on the state’s Indian reservations</a>. While activists agree that satellite voting on reservations — something mandated by a 2014 lawsuit settlement — has helped there are still limitations to satellite voting. According to the <em>Billings Gazette</em>, some counties simply don’t have the staff to work the satellite voting offices. Dulcie Bear Don’t Walk is the election administrator for Big Horn County and the only elections employee. The Northern Cheyenne government would like a satellite office open on the reservation five days a week. “I physically cannot provide five days a week,” she told the paper. “Unlike all of the other (counties) that have satellite offices, my county is unique in the fact that I have two reservations within the boundaries. So that means I have to provide two satellite offices. Everyone else only has to do one.”</p>
<p><strong>A new memorial to the suffragists</strong> recently broke ground in Lorton, Virginia and is set to open on August 26, 2020, the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment. Lorton is about an hour outside of the District of Columbia and the site of the Occoquan Workhouse where suffragists were imprisoned during the fight to win the right to vote. The<a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/11/14/womens-suffrage-memorial-breaks-ground-in-northern-virginia/"> Turning Point Suffragist Memorial</a> will include 19 learning stations. The site also will feature a meditation garden, walking paths and an early 20th century rail car where visitors can “experience how the suffragists traveled throughout the country advocating for voting rights for all women,” according to the memorial’s<a href="https://suffragistmemorial.org/suffragist-memorial-design/"> website</a>.</p>

Things did not look so good in April when she was first diagnosed.  “I turned being scared into ‘I’m proving them wrong,’” Souza-Young told <em>The Herald News</em>. “I’m headstrong. I decided, ‘I’m going down fighting.’” She started chemotherapy and has since undergone 14 treatments, typically every other week, and continues to hold her full-time job in the elections office. “It gave me an outlet,” Souza-Young said. “I love my job.” Keep up the good fight Kelly!</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved Act 328 which amends the law for election pages to allow<a href="https://wcel.nwaonline.com/news/2019/nov/20/new-law-allows-students-to-work-polls-2/"> high school students</a> to be more involved in the election process. Before students were very limited on what they could do to help at polling centers on election day.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> This week the Portland City Council voted to send a measure to the voters during the March 3 primary. Voters will be asked whether to amend the city charter to allow<a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/portland-voters-to-decide-expansion-of-ranked-choice-voting/29838136"> ranked choice voting</a> for city council and school board elections in addition the mayoral and citywide elections where it already happens.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The New Jersey Council on Local Mandates has<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/little-known-nj-council-invalidates-states-expansive-vote-by-mail-law/"> invalidated the state’s new vote-by-mail laws</a> which require county clerks to automatically send mail-in ballots to anyone who registered to vote by mail in any 2016 election. The council said the laws amounted to a new legal requirement that lacked adequate funding. “In the absence of any funding of the mandate, we find and determine that the challenged laws constitute unfunded mandates,” the council wrote according to WHYY. The council’s ruling came in response to a complaint from the New Jersey Association of Counties, which had estimated that the new law would cost county clerks around $5 million to implement.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Assemblyman Andy Goodell (R-Jamestown) has introduced a bill that would<a href="https://www.post-journal.com/news/local-news/2019/11/voter-registration-bill-is-introduced-by-goodell/"> allow taxpayers to register to vote</a> when they file their state income tax returns, pay their property taxes or file the paperwork to purchase a new home.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel Lee have jointly appealed a Oct. 18 ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In his ruling last month, Hinkle wrote that Florida<a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/11/15/federal-judges-ruling-on-felon-voting-rights-appealed-by-florida-officials/"> cannot deny the right to vote</a> to felons who have served their sentences and are “genuinely unable” to pay legal financial obligations. He issued a preliminary injunction, however, that applied only to 17 plaintiffs in the case — and not more broadly to other felons who might be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Priorities USA has filed yet another lawsuit in Michigan this one against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson over<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/11/15/dem-group-files-third-voting-rights-lawsuit-one-targeting-benson/4205028002/"> automatic voter registration</a>. According to <em>The Detroit News</em>, The lawsuit argues that the treatment by Michigan&#8217;s automatic registration law of people under the age of 17 ½ and the Legislature’s limits on proof of residency at the time of registration constitute undue burdens on voters&#8217; constitutional rights.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance has filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann (R) alleging that the state’s voter<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/18/lawsuit-mississippi-voter-registration-law-unconstitutional/4229063002/"> registration requirements are more stringent for naturalized citizens</a> than people born in the U.S.—a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. State law says any naturalized citizen must show their naturalization certificate or similar proof to a circuit clerk, &#8220;otherwise he or she shall not be allowed to register to vote.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> A legal challenge to the constitutionality of<a href="https://www.omaha.com/news/state_and_regional/case-challenging-legality-of-appointing-election-commissioners-is-moved-to/article_0f50bf5f-c49d-5777-8b99-b50c1a845731.html"> appointing election commissioners</a> for some Nebraska counties has been moved to a lower court. Attorney General Doug Peterson filed the case in Lancaster County District Court after it was rejected by the Nebraska Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Andrew Goodman Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes voting and civic engagement among young people have filed suit against the state’s<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/20/lawsuit-says-student-id-voting-restrictions-violate-26th-amendment/4247766002/"> voter ID law</a> that limits what student IDs may be used to cast a ballot. The suit alleges limiting student IDs is a violation of the 26th Amendment and seeks to block the restrictions for the 2020 election.</p>
