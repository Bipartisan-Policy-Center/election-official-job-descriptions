														<p><strong>Excel on steroids</strong><br />
<em>Harford County, Md. BOE uses Smartsheets to keep office running smoothly</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Keeping track of all the moving parts not only in an elections office, but also on Election Day can be a daunting task. Efficient project management from Election Day  to human resources is critical to the success of an elections office.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4394" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HarCoLogo-300x300.png" alt="" width="341" height="341" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HarCoLogo-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HarCoLogo-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HarCoLogo.png 749w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" />The<a href="https://harfordvotes.info/"> Harford County, Maryland board of elections</a> recently received the<a href="https://iaogo.org/honors/igos-awards/"> iGO Innovator Award</a> for the county’s use of<a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/"> Smartsheets</a> to create a more efficient elections office. The Innovator Award is awarded to individuals in the Elections, Recorders, Clerks and Treasurers division in honor of their unique achievements and best practices in their respective fields.</p>
<p>Smartsheets is a web-based project management program that can be accessed from any computer or smartphone with a free downloadable app. Use of the mobile app is free and the county pays a yearly fee for six licenses for the desktop version. Sheets can be shared with anyone even if they don’t have a license.</p>
<p>The county made the initial switch to Smartsheets in 2013, starting small with 10 to 20 sheets. Over the first year, that grew to about 100 sheets. The county is now up to 394 sheets.</p>
<p>“We first put all of our procedures on Smartsheets for easy access, then we added the election timelines for each department,” explained Project Manager Stephanie Taylor. “We then added time keeping so we could have one universal calendar and with Smartsheet automation process it requires very little up keep. After that if someone had an idea that would help the office work in a more efficient way we would work it out in Smartsheets.”</p>
<p>The county didn’t employ an additional staff to implement the sheets, but Taylor and another board employee Justin Wall started watching the training video’s on Smartsheet’s website also attended a workshop held by Smartsheets. Three additional employees have since attended similar workshops.</p>
<p>“I call Smartsheets ‘Excel on steroids’,” Taylor said. “If you know how to use Excel you will know how to use the basics of Smartsheets and then expand your knowledge and use from there.”</p>
<p>The county uses the Smartsheets to keep track of everything from the progress of logic and accuracy testing, post-election maintenance, allocation of equipment, supplies and signs to polling places, spare equipment, status of equipment maintenance, repairs, delivery and pickup dates, times, loads, facility contact or where to deliver at the facility.</p>
<p>More recently, the county has begun using Smartsheets for time management.</p>
<p>“We have a sheet for leave, meetings, training, outreach and the state’s election calendar,” Taylor explained. “We have taken all of these sheets and published them to our Google calendar. Managers can pick and choose what alerts and notifications they want to receive to plan and monitor events and progress. We have a one stop shop to manage and view 11 calendars.”</p>
<p>The county even uses Smartsheets for their 800 or so election judges.</p>
<p>“By using the webforms, we have saved thousands upon thousands of dollars in postage, manpower and supplies, plus we get immediate feedback from our judges,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>And the uses don’t stop just in Harford County’s offices either. The Harford County BOE created an election equipment trouble shooting guide that covers just about everything that can go wrong with the equipment on election day. They have shared this with all the equipment techs in the state.</p>
<p>“In the past we would spend anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour trying to find the right person to call to find out how to fix the problem. Meanwhile you have a growing line of voters waiting to use the voting equipment. By using this trouble shooting guide, we can resolve the issue in a timely manner,” Taylor explained.</p>
<p>With everyone concerned about cybersecurity these days, Taylor said Smartsheets is very proactive with cybersecurity and they also do free weekly back-ups in an Excel format. No voter information is kept in Smartsheets.</p>
<p>According to Taylor, some of the benefits of moving to the Smartsheet system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are better organized, have saved money and everyone in the office knows what is going on at any given moment.</li>
<li>If an employee is out for whatever reason someone else can step in and perform duties because everything has been documented in Smartsheets.</li>
<li>Not everyone needs a license to use Smartsheets.</li>
<li>If you update something on one sheet that also appears on another sheet you can link the two sheets together. By doing so, you only need to update one sheet and the second sheet will automatically be updated.</li>
<li>Multiple people can be working in the same sheet at the same time.</li>
<li>You do not have multiple copies saved in different locations like you do when you use Excel.</li>
<li>If you have a task that is assigned to someone, you can set up automatic email notifications/reminders to be sent to the employee responsible for that task.</li>
<li>Once the task is complete the sheet can be set up in a way that an email notification can be sent to your employer so they can keep track of what is going on in the office.</li>
<li>You can schedule automatic free weekly backups of all your sheets.</li>
<li>Anyone can do it and you don’t have to recreate the wheel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taylor isn’t sure what other ways Smartsheets could be used, but she’s open to suggestions.</p>
<p>“If you can come up with a good idea please let me know,” Taylor said. “I love to figure out new ways to use it.”</p>

							<h2>Clearie Awards</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC Opens Submission Period in Fourth Annual Clearie Awards</strong><br />
<em>Celebrating Best Practices in Election Administration</em></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking submissions for its fourth annual national Clearinghouse Awards. Dubbed the “Clearies” for short, the awards provide election offices an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that Act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</p>
<p>The Commission will present awards in the categories of outstanding innovations in elections, improving voting accessibility for voters with disabilities, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. It will also award a special award in 2019 recognizing the most original and creative “I Voted” sticker submitted for consideration. Entries from all sizes of jurisdictions, both large and small, are encouraged to submit their work. All entries must be received by Monday, November 25, 2019. The 2018 winners of the Clearie awards can be found<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-clearinghouse-award-winners-2018/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>“The EAC Clearie Awards celebrate the innovative and creative approaches that election officials use each day in their work to serve voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “These awards are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices that other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
<li>Creating positive Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Election officials utilize innovative and resourceful initiatives on Election Day. We want to hear about these outstanding best practices in EAC’s 2019 competition. By incorporating Election Day into the submission deadline, we are able to capture activities implemented throughout the 2018 and 2019 elections.</p>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>
<p>For more information about this year’s competition, please contact Patrick Leahy at pleahy@eac.gov.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at an Intelligence and National Security Summit Jeanette Manfra, assistant director for cybersecurity, said</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/voting-machine-makers-give-u-s-access-in-fight-against-hackers"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting machine and election systems vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have given the Homeland Security Department access to engineering details and operations so the U.S. can identify potential vulnerabilities hackers might exploit heading into the 2020 election. Makers of voting machines and election systems are cooperating voluntarily, representing a breakthrough for the government, Manfra said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’ve made a lot of progress with the vendors of those systems,” Manfra said. “We know what makes up the systems and how it actually works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress is now back in session after their summer recess and according  <em>The Hill</em>, Democrats in both chambers plan prioritize election security this fall.  In a letter to colleagues, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) wrote that the House may take up</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/460176-house-senate-democrats-to-prioritize-election-security-this-fall"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> additional legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to strengthen election security” in the next work period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate letter, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-New York) also announced his plans to prioritize election security legislation according to <em>The Hill.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American people have also called for greater action to secure our elections,” Schumer wrote. “Leader McConnell has blocked efforts by Senate Democrats to pass common sense election security legislation. We must continue our push to protect our elections at the federal, state, and local levels, especially in the upcoming Senate appropriations process.” </span></p>

The state board of elections denied the request. And as often the case in special elections, some voters not eligible to vote in the special election showed up at the polls attempting to vote and were none-too-happy when they learned they were ineligible. “</span><a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article234944657.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know before you go</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Kristin Mavromatis, spokeswoman for the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections told the Charlotte Observer. “There is some onus on the voter (for knowing their district).”</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/in-wake-of-fraud-scandal-voting-by-mail-dropped-by-two-thirds-in-9th-district/18627262/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vote-by-mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District special election was down by two-thirds from 2018.</span></p>

Chapman Catt, an Iowan, was a leader in the suffrage movement. “I am pleased with the implementation of the Carrie Chapman Catt Award to encourage 17- and 18-year-olds to vote. Carrie would have loved that,” said Dianne Bystrom, former director of the Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University. “Also, with the record numbers of women running for and getting elected to public office and it is important for students to learn about the women’s suffrage movement and their participation in politics.” Bystrom worked with the Secretary of State’s Office to add a women’s suffrage section to the Elections 101 curriculum Secretary Pate offers to schools and civic groups.</span></p>

As a result of the January 2019 RLA pilot activities in three municipalities, the working group recommends that Rhode Island: implement a ballot-level comparison RLA, establish objective criteria for which races will be audited; conduct a centralized audit; consult local election officials; conduct a practice audit; use Arlo audit software; appoint an ongoing expert advisory council; initiate rulemaking; develop schedule with milestones; and endorse vendor recommendations.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> The Senate is considering Assembly Bill 1701 that would “…provide that a voter or any other person</span><a href="https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/polling-places-would-allow-smartphones-and-other-handheld-devices-under-new-legislation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may not be prohibited from using an electronic device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a smartphone, tablet, or other handheld device, at a polling place provided that the use of the device does not result in a violation of other provisions of law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly has approved a bill that would</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/bill-to-restore-vote-to-california-parolees-clears-assembly-hurdle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restore the voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to more than 48,000 Californians who are currently on parole or probation. If approved by the Senate, the measure would go before voters in 2020. The Senate has until the end of this week to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Legislature has approved a bill that if signed by the governor, would allow for</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/election-day-voter-registration-clears-california-legislature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election day registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If signed it would take effect in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has signed</span><a href="https://hanfordsentinel.com/assemblymember-salas-s-voter-integrity-bills-signed-into-law/article_aa655c6e-cd55-5bd5-8a29-66fdd5bd61fa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AB 17 and AB 299</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law. AB 17, also known as the “Voter Protection Act,” addresses voter intimidation and protects free and fair elections by prohibiting an employer from requiring that an employee bring their vote by mail ballot to work. AB 299 will ensure that election information is up-to-date by requiring county election officials to update the Secretary of State with the most recent vote by mail information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> A bill under consideration would require all state forms to that require someone to note their gender to choose X as opposed just male or female. This would include</span><a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/09/10/bill-would-require-gender-x-option-on-all-state-documents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration forms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Gov. Chris Sununu have vetoed a bill that would have allowed for</span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/sununu-vetoes-bill-expand-absentee-voting-nh#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to New Hampshire Public Radio the governor said the change would have gone against New Hampshire&#8217;s tradition of in-person voter participation and would have created logistical challenges for election workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The Legislature’s Interim Rules Committee has clarified several state election rules including</span><a href="https://www.jamestownsun.com/news/government-and-politics/4653473-Legislators-clean-up-elections-rules-ahead-of-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changes to the state voter registration form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, the forms will include a disclaimer that should a registrant leave their political affiliation unanswered, they will automatically be registered as their previous party, or as independent or unaffiliated if they were not previously registered to vote.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is asking a federal judge for a delay in a lawsuit seeking to restore former felons’ voting rights. Lawyers for the state asked for the lawsuit to be delayed until the state’s Supreme Court weighs in on</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/09/11/florida-governor-seeks-delay-in-landmark-voting-rights-case-1183570"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amendment 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “A stay, like a dismissal, would promote judicial economy and federal-state comity,” the state wrote. “If the Florida Supreme Court agrees that the phrase ‘all terms of sentence‘ encompasses financial obligations imposed as part of the sentence, this might well alter the course of the pending federal proceeding, or at the least, require plaintiffs to amend their complaints.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The names of about 200 voters have been referred to the New Hampshire attorney general’s office for</span><a href="https://www.fosters.com/news/20190909/200-voters-with-no-photo-id-referred-to-nh-ag"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after they either cast ballots or registered without providing photo identification in 2018, according to <em>Fosters Daily.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Calling Tennessee’s controversial</span><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/09/09/tennessee-voter-registration-lawsuit-move-forward-judge-rules/2264073001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new voter registration law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “punitive regulatory scheme,” Judge Aleta Trauger issued a ruling Monday that denies the state&#8217;s motion to dismiss two lawsuits filed by several civil rights and voter registration organizations, which came promptly after Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill into law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> This week, an appeals court weighed whether or not to</span><a href="https://beta.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/09/11/texas-court-weighs-whether-year-sentence-illegal-voting-is-legitimate-or-threat-democracy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturn the conviction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tarrant County resident Crystal Mason who was sentenced to five years in prison for voting in the 2016 presidential election even though she was still on probation. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel heard the three-prong oral arguments: (1) Mason did not vote in the 2016 election because her provisional ballot was never counted. (2) The prosecution failed to prove that Mason knew she was ineligible to vote. (3) The conditions of her release from federal prison did not amount to “supervision” under Texas law, meaning Mason would have been eligible to vote.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Brandon Baker, 20, of Milwaukee has been sentenced to</span><a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/09/09/probation-plus-jail-time-for-milwaukee-man-prosecutors-say-threatened-to-air-out-polling-place/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serve four years’ probation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and seven months jail time, with time served, after he plead carrying a concealed weapon and drug charges. On Election Day 2018 Baker had threatened to “air out” a Milwaukee polling place.</span></p>

Each post card includes a unique code that voters can use to submit their email address to the board. The board currently has about 300,000 voters’ emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Gov. Tom Wolf announced this week that residents will now be able to</span><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-apply-absentee-ballot-online-20190909.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> apply for absentee ballots online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of mailing in a written request.
