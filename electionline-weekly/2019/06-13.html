														<p><strong>2019 elections legislation in review<br />
</strong><em>With many Legislatures now done, what happened in 2019</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Although there’s no catchy Alice Cooper<a href="https://youtu.be/vmewc2Uqon4"> song</a> to mark the season, many state Legislatures have finished or are finishing up their work for 2019.</p>
<p>It was a busy year for<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/elections-legislation-database.aspx"> election legislation</a> with thousands of bills being filed. Bills covered everything from ex-felon voting rights to voter ID to same day registration to what to wear the polls and whether or not you can bring a weapon with you, not matter what you’re wearing.</p>
<p>While some state Legislatures are still in session and there are others that don’t adjourn, we thought now would be a good time to take a look at some of the elections legislation that was on the table this year.  This is just a snapshot of what was happening in the states this year. It’s always good to bookmark the<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/elections-legislation-database.aspx"> State Elections Legislation Database</a> brought you by our good friends at the<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/"> National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3859" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3859" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3859 size-medium" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TN-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TN-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TN-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TN-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3859" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The TN Legislature put limitations on 3rd-party voter reg groups.</em></p></div>
<p>Automatic voter registration. Election day registration. Same day registration. Limits on third-party voter registration groups. There were countless bills regarding some aspect of voter registration this year. After Republican lawmakers threatened a filibuster, a bill that would have allowed automatic voter registration in<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/news/search/registration/"> Connecticut</a> failed at the end of the session. A bill in<a href="https://salinapost.com/2019/02/22/kansas-house-panel-rejects-same-day-voter-registration-bill/"> Kansas</a> for same day registration never got past the committee level.<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/11/motor-voter-bill-moves-one-step-closer-to-law-in-maine/"> Maine</a> is poised to become the 18th state to allow automatic voter registration. The<a href="https://knpr.org/headline/2019-04/same-day-voter-registration-passes-senate-panel"> Nevada</a> Legislature has approved same day registration. In<a href="https://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/governor-signs-senate-bill-672-same-day-voter-registration/5294328/"> New Mexico</a>, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed Senate Bill 672 into law that allows for election day registration. The<a href="https://www.wrvo.org/post/senate-considers-automatic-voter-registration"> New York</a> Senate is currently considering automatic voter registration.  <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/24/automatic-voter-registration-has-bipartisan-support-in-ohio/3562581002/">Ohio</a> Secretary of State Frank LaRose is working with legislative Republicans and Democrats on automatic voter registration. A bill in<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article226505135.html"> South Carolina</a> that would have extended the voter registration deadline initially passed the House before ultimately failing. The voter registration-related bill that probably generated the most headlines this year was in<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/29/controversial-tennessee-voter-registration-bill-heads-bill-lee-desk-governor/3622601002/"> Tennessee</a> where the governor has now signed a bill into law that will criminalize elements of the third-party voter registration process. The<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/02/14/rekindle-love-affair/"> Utah</a> Legislature has designated February 14 at Women’s Voter Registration Day.  <a href="https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Northam-rejects-Wilt-voter-bill-for-2nd-year-507683771.html">Virginia</a> Gov. Ralph Northam vetoed a bill that would have required people assisting others to sign up to vote to provide their own information on the paper registration forms.</p>
<p><strong>Vote At Home</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3874" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3874" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3874 size-medium" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3874" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Hawaii will move to a vote by mail system in 2020.</em></p></div>
<p>Paid postage, all vote-by-mail elections, uniform bar code usage and signature cures were just some of the vote at home legislation that was considered this year. The<a href="https://yubanet.com/california/no-stamp-no-problem-all-vote-by-mail-ballots-now-come-with-prepaid-postage-return-envelopes/"> California</a> Assembly has approved a bill that will cover the cost of return postage for all mail ballots.<a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/06/04/d-c-to-consider-expanding-voting-access-to-incarcerated-felons-vote-by-mail/"> District of Columbia</a> Councilmember Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward One) has introduced a bill that will send a mail ballot to every voter in DC and, at press time, would keep Election Day precinct-based polling places. Following issues with signatures in the 2018 election, the<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-florida-election-changes-20190321-story.html"> Florida</a> Legislature has approved a bill that will allow vote at home voters to cure their signatures if a problem is discovered at the supervisor of elections office. Beginning in 2020,<a href="https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2019/05/02/hawaii-news/mail-in-voting-bill-okd/"> Hawaii</a> will become a vote-by-mail state. In<a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/bipartisan-bill-uniformly-count-mail-ballots-advances#stream/0"> Iowa</a>, all counties are required to pay for and use the same barcode system so mail ballots are treated equally statewide.<a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/new-kansas-law-boosts-voter-protections-for-mail-in-ballots-laura-kelly/27169487"> Kansas</a> Gov. Laura Kelly has signed a bill that requires election officials to notify voters before their mail-in ballots are thrown out because of signature problems. Lawmakers in<a href="https://www.gillettenewsrecord.com/news/wyoming/article_a70cf1ef-8742-5fc8-b092-387063c1c924.html"> Pennsylvania</a> are currently considering a bill that would allow voters in the commonwealth to cast their ballot by mail. Lawmakers in<a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-ballot-paid-postage-voting-legislation-support/"> Oregon</a> are considering postage-paid vote at home ballots. Following in the footsteps of King County, the<a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2019/03/bill-to-make-prepaid-postage-on-return-ballot-envelopes-permanent-sails-out-of-senate.html"> Washington</a> Legislature has approved a bill that will provide postage-paid return envelopes to voters. In<a href="https://www.gillettenewsrecord.com/news/wyoming/article_a70cf1ef-8742-5fc8-b092-387063c1c924.html"> Wyoming</a>, a bill that was supported by the county clerks and would have allowed counties to choose to vote-by-mail failed.</p>
<p><strong>Ranked Choice Voting</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_4046" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4046" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4046 size-medium" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MD-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MD-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MD-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MD-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4046" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The MD Assembly denied Montgomery County&#8217;s push for ranked choice.</em></p></div>
<p>Following Maine’s successful deployment of ranked choice voting in 2018, a number of state Legislatures considered bills that would mirror Maine&#8217;s, but none of those bills really gained much traction. The states include<a href="https://www.kitv.com/story/40056290/house-republicans-unanimously-oppose-ranked-choice-voting"> Hawaii</a>,  <a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/ranked-choice-voting-ballots-election-23461789">New Hampshire</a>,<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2019/03/20/ranked-choice-voting-proposed-in-nj-411871"> New Jersey</a>,<a href="https://newbostonpost.com/around-new-england/vermont-eyeing-ranked-choice-voting-but-response-tepid-so-far/"> Vermont</a>,<a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/content/news/Ranked-choice-voting-bill-tabled-504817741.html"> Virginia</a> and<a href="https://kgab.com/ranked-choice-voting-bill-proposed-in-wyoming-legislature/"> Wyoming</a>. Although<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maine-runs-another-setback-expand-ranked-choice-voting-system"> Maine</a> successfully used ranked choice in 2018, efforts to expand the voting system to more elections did not have enough support to move forward. In Maryland, one bill that would allowed the city of<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-lierman-ranked-choice-20190215-story.html"> Baltimore</a> to use ranked choice voting was pulled and another bill that would have allowed<a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/politics/ranked-choice-voting-tenants-rights-bills-fail-to-advance/"> Montgomery County</a> to use the system failed in the General Assembly. It should be noted that while RCV didn’t have a successful year at the state level, a number of local jurisdictions considered moving to a ranked system.</p>

<p><strong>Ex-Felon Voting Rights</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3584" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3584" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3584 size-medium" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iowa-statehouse-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-3584" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Iowa Legislature failed to enfranchise ex-felons this year.</em></p></div>

Ron DeSantis has signed a bill into law that would require ex-felons to pay all fines and fees before their rights may be restored.  In<a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/06/12/inmates-will-soon-be-able-to-vote-from-jail/"> Illinois</a>, SB2090, which is awaiting the governor’s signature, would allow anyone who is being held, but not yet convicted, to cast a ballot. It would also allow a county with a population of more than 3 million to set up a temporary polling place in a county jail. Despite support from the governor and overwhelming support from the public, a bill in<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/04/felon-voting-rights-constitutional-amendment-setback-iowa-senate-gov-kim-reynolds-funnel-statehouse/3364741002/"> Iowa</a> that would have lifted the permanent ban on voting rights for ex-felons failed. Lawmakers in<a href="https://lex18.com/news/covering-kentucky/2019/02/25/lawmakers-to-debate-restoring-voting-rights-to-felons/"> Kentucky</a> are still considering a bill that would lift the permanent ban on voting rights for ex-felons. Efforts in<a href="https://www.nola.com/politics/2019/05/efforts-to-change-louisiana-voting-rights-of-parolees-probationers-go-nowhere.html"> Louisiana</a> to change the voting rights for parolees and probationers went nowhere this year. At least 18 bills were filed in<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/20/felon-voting-rights-restoration-efforts-die-mississippi-legislature/3210745002/"> Mississippi</a> that would have reformed felony voting rights restoration and none of them advanced.<a href="https://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/politics/voting-rights-restored-for-ex-felons/"> Nevada</a> Gov.

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>The National Governors Association announced last week the six states that will participate in the organization’s latest<a href="https://www.nga.org/news/press-releases/states-get-assistance-on-election-cybersecurity/"> cybersecurity policy academy</a>.</p>
<p>Officials from Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho,<a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-joins-nationwide-election-security-academy/510930302/"> Minnesota</a>,<a href="https://mynews4.com/news/local/nevada-joins-five-other-states-in-national-policy-academy-on-election-cybersecurity"> Nevada</a> and Virginia will spend the next six months studying election security to come up with plans and practices to protect the integrity of their voting systems ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>The 2019 academy will focus more closely on issues related to election security, from building protections around voter registration databases to developing better communications between agencies. Participants will include governors’ office staffers, election directors and statewide cabinet agencies, the NGA said.</p>
<p>After being accused of being a one-man roadblock to election security legislation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) said this week that the Senate will have an<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/447980-mcconnell-senate-will-have-election-security-briefing"> election security briefing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We intend to have a briefing on election security,&#8221; McConnell told reporters during a weekly press conference according to The Hill, all the while not responding to questions about whether the upper chamber will take up any election security legislation.</p>
<p>Reps. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut, and John Ratcliffe, R-Texas introduced new legislation that would establish election interference as a Federal crime. The bipartisan bill, dubbed the<a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/reps-himes-ratcliffe-introduce-election-hacking-bill/"> Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act</a>, would make it a Federal crime to hack a voting system used in a Federal election.</p>
<p>Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) have written a<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448155-klobuchar-wyden-demand-answers-from-fbi-on-2016-election-hacking"> letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray demanding answers</a> from the agency on its response to Russia’s attempts to have VR Systems during the 2016 presidential election. According to The Hill, the senators questioned the FBI on whether it had investigated those machines for attempted hacking, and also how the FBI is ensuring that local and state election officials “feel comfortable reporting potential cybersecurity incidents” to authorities. The senators have given Wray until July 12 to respond.</p>

Using emergency lights from the fire department and a few camping lantern, Rawski was able to tabulate the ballots after they were cast on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The Union County board of elections<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/local/elections-officials-find-three-more-ballots-in-a-bag/"> discovered three uncounted provisional ballots</a> while organizing polling place supply bags. Two of the ballots should have been counted and one was from a voter who was not registered. The ballots were added to the tally which did not alter the results.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> It didn’t make national headlines, but as we point out, there are<a href="https://www.wytv.com/news/local-news/mercer-county-races-decided-by-ping-pong-balls-after-elections-end-in-ties/2061004432"> tied elections</a> every voting cycle and this year has been no different. There were four tied races in Mercer County which were all decided this week by drawing numbered ping pong balls from a bag. Whoever chose the #1 ping pong ball was the winner. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of weird, but you have to determine it somehow so I guess it&#8217;s the way it is,&#8221; candidate Mark Skidmore told WYTV.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Voters headed the polls in the commonwealth this week and while the biggest story was low voter<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-election-officials-report-low-voter-turnout-for-tuesday-s/article_a4d5aaca-9b3a-5670-bbd4-703acbd1fd78.html"> turnout</a>, there were a handful of isolated issues. In<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/temporary-technical-snag-hits-roanoke-polling-places/article_4e96b941-bbd2-511d-809f-e73f29aef6e1.html"> Roanoke</a>, voters had to cast provisional ballots for about two hours when issues with laptop computers prevent poll workers from checking in voters. The problem was discovered just before 6 a.m. when the polls opened and a fix was deployed to all precincts by 9:30 a.m. Redistricting approved by a panel of federal judges earlier this year caused some issues for voters in<a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/article_c79c1fba-8c8b-11e9-b8a1-fbf3525f29ab.html"> Yorktown</a> who showed up at the wrong polling places or simply couldn’t figure out where to vote after reviewing new maps. &#8220;It’s not a happy election,&#8221; Judy Ruston, chief election officer for one polling place in Hampton City told the <em>Virginia Pilot</em>. Ruston said many would-be voters left confused and frustrated.<a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/local-election-hq/-it-was-unacceptable-chesterfield-polling-changes-causes-confusion-for-voters/2072264312"> Chesterfield County</a>, which split five precincts experienced issues as well.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>In November 2018, the Camp Fire</strong> destroyed several communities in Butte County, California including the town of Paradise. According to the <em>Enterprise Record</em>, the fire was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history with 85 lives lost, 19,000 structures destroyed and 14,000 families displaced. Since the fire, Butte County Clerk-Recorder, Registrar of Voters Candace Grubb and her staff have worked tirelessly to keep track of residents not only for voter registration purposes, but also vital records. Now with 19,000 displaced voters, Grubb is seeking to opt into the<a href="https://www.chicoer.com/2019/06/10/supervisors-to-hear-camp-fire-recovery-update/"> California Voter’s Choice Act</a> which will allow the county to move to vote centers and mail ballots in time for the March 2020 primary. The county will have 13 vote centers and every voter will receive a mail ballot with a return-postage paid envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>. A lot of counties are going to have<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190610/students-find-new-uses-for-old-ohio-voting-machines-that-shouldnt-have-been-sold-to-dispatch"> old voting equipment to get rid of</a> in the coming months so consider this a cautionary tale. Licking County, Ohio offered its old AccuVote-TSx machines on GovDeals.com and the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> bought a lot of them and gave them to area high schools to see what their engineering students could do with them. According the paper, while the actual elections software was removed before the sale, the units were otherwise functional. Students were easily able to access administrator functions without access cards and they had access to an internal activity log. That being said, as engineering teacher Greg King pointed out, “To tamper with a statewide election, it would take a lot of resources and a pretty sophisticated organization or somebody on the inside.” Following inquiries from <em>The Dispatch</em>, Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office issued an advisory to county election officials reminding them of disposal requirements. “Under no circumstances should a voting machine be sold to someone who’s not an authorized user,” said LaRose.</p>
<p><strong>Mythbusters for Elections?</strong> Republican Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich<a href="http://ktar.com/story/2608423/arizona-attorney-general-hires-4-people-to-investigate-voter-fraud/"> is hiring four staff members to investigate voter fraud in The Copper State</a>. “Consider us the `MythBusters’ of election fraud claims and rumors,” Ryan Anderson, a spokesman for Brnovich told KTAR. “If there is fraud, let’s investigate it, let’s prosecute it and work to eradicate it,” Anderson said. “If there’s not fraud, then let’s give the public the confidence they deserve in their elections.” While voter advocacy groups thing the money — $530,00 — would be better spent elsewhere, Democratic election officials, including Secretary of State Katie Hobbs see it as a chance to boost confidence in elections. “If this unit will help maintain the integrity of Arizona’s elections and election systems, then I am all for it,” Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Mybusters for Elections, Part II</strong>. This week, Paco County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Brian Corely sent a letter voters — which he also shared on social media — urging his voters to<a href="https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/post/local-official-urges-caution-social-media-during-election-cycle"> be aware of possible cybersecurity threats</a> ahead of next year’s election and how misinformation can easily spread on social media. He urged voters to be vigilant to misinformation and to think twice and even contact his office before sharing something questionable on social media. &#8220;There were an untold number of Americans who unknowingly helped perpetuate some of the half-truths and outright lies by retweeting something or sharing something they saw on social media. We just want to have the policy if you see something, say something,” Corely said.</p>
<p><strong>Who dunnit?</strong> According to <em>Wicked Local,</em> on May 13, Maynard on May 13, Town Clerk Michelle Sokolowski discovered that a basket by the clerk’s window, where she routinely places<a href="https://maynard.wickedlocal.com/news/20190612/cards-missing-from-maynard-town-hall-contain-partial-social-security-numbers"> paperwork was missing</a>. The paperwork included voter registration cards that had been submitted to the town clerk’s office to be logged into their computer database and the paperwork filed. The police were called and video reviewed and the police have concluded that the missing paperwork was the result of a clerical or custodian error and not a criminal act.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to Brevard County, Florida Supervisor of Elections</strong> Lori Scott and her team for<a href="http://www.vieravoice.com/Viera-Daily-Blog/June-2019/Supervisor-of-Elections-Lori-Scott-raises-more-than-3000-for-Project-HUNGER/"> raising more than $3,000 for Project HUNGER</a>. The money will go toward the Feed &amp; Read summer program for children. “As a mother, I am very passionate about helping children in need,” Scott told the <em>Viera Voice</em>. “We are honored this money will make a difference in the lives of children in our community.”</p>

All weekend, that’s what I’ve been thinking about,” Milliken told the paper. “Do you have to have a certain IQ to vote? What about if you have a stroke or Alzheimer’s?”</p>
