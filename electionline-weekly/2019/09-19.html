<em>How to celebrate National Voter Registration Day every day</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Next week, Tuesday September 24th, marks the 8th Annual<a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/"> National Voter Registration Day</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3788" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="343" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg 261w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-768x884.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups.jpg 869w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" />This year, more than 4,000 nonprofit organizations and a growing number of corporate partners will join forces with the goal of helping more than 250,000 eligible voters update their registration or get registered for the first time – nearly twice the number registered during any previous &#8216;odd-year&#8217; holiday.</p>
<p>The 4,000-strong network of community partners that will run National Voter Registration Day<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2582857-1&amp;h=3889385050&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnationalvoterregistrationday.org%2Fevents%2F&amp;a=events"> events</a> across the country includes 1,600 nonprofits, 900 libraries and 600 universities, along with local election offices, businesses, co-ops, veterans&#8217; groups, and more.</p>
<p>Since 2012, more than 2.4 million voters have registered or updated their registration as a result of the initiative.</p>
<p>While a lot of attention is rightfully focused on September as National Voter Registration Month and specifically the 24th as National Voter Registration Day, efforts to get people registered to vote are ongoing throughout the year.</p>
<p>We thought we’d take a look at just a few of those and hopefully provide some inspiration for next year’s voter registration efforts including National Voter Registration Day, which is sure to be a doozy!</p>
<p><strong>College Students</strong><br />
New comforter, check. Mini fridge, check. Voter registration, check. When the class of 2023 arrived on campus at Harvard earlier this month, student volunteers were on hand to help the incoming class get their IDs, keys and register to vote.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe that we should institutionalize voter engagement and civic engagement as a part of life here on Harvard&#8217;s campus,” Theodore “Teddy” N. Landis ’20, a co-founder of<a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/9/13/harvard-votes-challenge-19/"> Harvard Votes Challenge</a> told <em>The Harvard Crimson</em>. “One of the most powerful ways to do that is to say, ‘When you arrive here on campus, one of the first things you do as a Harvard student is to register to vote.’”</p>
<p>Harvard Votes Challenge volunteers spoke with more than 1,000 freshmen and helped mail more than 600 voter registration forms, according to Landis.</p>
<p>At<a href="https://columbiachronicle.com/professors-will-register-students-to-vote-in-class"> Columbia College Chicago</a>, it’s the professors who are getting the students registered to vote. After a successful pilot program in 2018, Associate Professor Sharon Bloyd-Peshkin has enlisted 24 of the 26 professors in the First-Year Writing Program to register students to vote during class. All incoming freshman are required to participate in the First-Year Writing Program.</p>
<p>“We all think our students are on social media and they like electronic communication and stuff like that … [but] actually students are more likely … to get engaged to register to vote if they are individually approached by a human being,” Bloyd-Peshkin told <em>The Columbia Chronicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>High School Students</strong><br />
<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2019_09_10.html">Iowa</a> Secretary of State Paul Pate has combined two of our favorite topics into one new program. Under the recently announced program every school in Iowa that registers at least 90 percent of their eligible students to vote will receive the Carrie Chapman Catt Award, named after the Iowan who was a national leader in the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
<p>A new state law allows 17-year-olds to register to vote in Iowa. They can also participate in primary elections if they will be 18 in time for the general election. Partnering with Project High Hopes, the YMCA Youth and Government organization and the Iowa Council for the Social Studies, Secretary Pate will help schools across the state organize and conduct voter registration drives.</p>
<p>Chapters of the League of Women Voters in the<a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/entlife/20190917/how-suburban-league-of-women-voters-chapters-are-encouraging-the-next-generation-of-voters"> northwest suburbs of Chicago</a> are wishing all 17- and 18-year-olds in their a community a very happy birthday encouraging them to register to vote.</p>
<p>The chapters provide every eligible student a birthday envelope that includes a letter with information on how to register to vote, along with an accompanying sticker, magnet and a pen &#8212; embellished with the quote: &#8220;The VOTE is mightier than the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Inmates and Formerly Incarcerated</strong><br />
In<a href="https://www.ohio.com/news/20190917/inmates-at-summit-county-jail-can-register-to-vote-next-week"> Summit County, Ohio</a>, the Summit County Clerk of Courts and a community group, Think Tank, will once again partner to conduct a voter registration drive in the Summit County Jail. Advocates and the clerk of courts will register male inmates on one day and female inmates the next. This is believed to only be the second time that a voter registration drive has been held at the county jail.</p>
<p>Voters Organized to Educate (VOTE) went door-to-door in places like<a href="https://www.wafb.com/2019/09/05/organization-knocking-doors-register-people-vote-especially-former-inmates/"> Baton Rouge, Louisiana</a> working to get those formerly incarcerated registered to vote.</p>
<p>“We’re really trying to speak with voters who are typically ignored by campaigns,” Jennifer Harding, organizing coordinator for Voice of the Experienced, a part of VOTE told WAFB.</p>
<p>In 10 counties in<a href="http://www.thefamuanonline.com/2019/09/03/local-group-works-to-register-ex-felons-to-vote/"> Florida</a> Big Bend Voting Rights Project is also going door-to-door in an effort to get as many formerly incarcerated residents whose rights were recently restored under Amendment 4 registered.</p>
<p>“They are the most marginalized people in our society, who are generally uninformed about their rights under Amendment 4, and they don&#8217;t have access to the kind of information you and I do. They tend to remember what they heard when they got out of prison or off probation,&#8221; Bob Rackleff, founding member of Big Bend Voting Rights Project told <em>The Famuan.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Sports Fans</strong><br />
The<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/461360-congress-must-step-up-to-protect-our-democracy"> King County Elections</a> (Washington) has joined with the Seattle Seahawks to celebrate the 18th anniversary of CenturyLink Field by promoting voting and voter registration throughout the season. Elections officials will be on hand to register voters this weekend when the Seahawks take on the Saints.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be partnering with the Seahawks and CenturyLink Field to spread the word far and wide about the importance and ease of voting, as well as offering tangible opportunities for Seahawks fans to get registered and cast a ballot right there at the stadium,” King County Director of Elections Julie Wise stated.</p>
<p>On Friday night home games, the<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-womens-equality-exhibit-oriole-park-20190712-2criqwv3ezdgth7gfttvgsel3q-story.html"> Baltimore</a> Orioles held voter registration drives at locations throughout the ballpark. The voter registration drives were held in conjunction with an exhibit of suffrage.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: Whether it&#8217;s college students, sports fans, formerly incarcerated or just Joe from down the street, if you&#8217;ve got a unique way to get your community registered to vote, let us know!)</em></p>

							<h2>Clearie Awards</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC Opens Submission Period in Fourth Annual ClearieAwards</strong><br />
<em>Celebrating Best Practices in Election Administration</em></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking submissions for its fourth annual national Clearinghouse Awards. Dubbed the “Clearies” for short, the awards provide election offices an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that Act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</p>
<p>The Commission will present awards in the categories of outstanding innovations in elections, improving voting accessibility for voters with disabilities, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. It will also award a special award in 2019 recognizing the most original and creative “I Voted” sticker submitted for consideration. Entries from all sizes of jurisdictions, both large and small, are encouraged to submit their work. All entries must be received by Monday, November 25, 2019. The 2018 winners of the Clearie awards can be found<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-clearinghouse-award-winners-2018/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>“The EAC Clearie Awards celebrate the innovative and creative approaches that election officials use each day in their work to serve voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “These awards are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices that other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
<li>Creating positive Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Election officials utilize innovative and resourceful initiatives on Election Day. We want to hear about these outstanding best practices in EAC’s 2019 competition. By incorporating Election Day into the submission deadline, we are able to capture activities implemented throughout the 2018 and 2019 elections.</p>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>
<p>For more information about this year’s competition, please contact Patrick Leahy at pleahy@eac.gov.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>This week, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee</strong><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/461844-democrats-press-for-action-on-election-security"> left out funding for election security</a> in its annual spending bill. According to <em>The Hill</em>, Democrats including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.) argued that time is running out to implement election security upgrades such as replacing outdated voting machines with just over a year left prior to the 2020 elections.</p>
<p>Congress has essentially until the end of October to pass legislation that can still make an impact in time for the general election in 2020, so we have to move, and the fact is that the window may have already closed to secure some of the 2020 primaries,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>,  Republicans are likely to put up a fight against these funds, citing the remaining money states have not yet spent from the $380 million designated to them last year, and concerns around federalizing elections.</p>
<p>“That’s the first step in federal control of elections,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) told reporters.</p>

														<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The Bladen County board of elections has determined that two people voted twice during the recent special election for the 9th Congressional district.

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger</strong> has opened an investigation into Fulton County’s election security procedures after<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/election-security-investigation-opened-after-atlanta-computers-stolen/2vkPtVbtmeV2K75002tOgN/"> two e-poll book laptops were stolen</a> from an Atlanta polling place. “It is unacceptable that bad actors entered a polling location under the cover of night and were able to steal critical elections machinery,” Raffensperger told the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>. The computers were stolen the night before a runoff election and were replaced in time for polls to open so voters weren’t affected, but the laptops did contain the state’s voter registration database and all the information that comes with it. Richard Barron, Fulton’s director of registration and elections, said the county will be reviewing its procedures, but poll workers did what they were supposed to do. “Other than providing 24-hour security at all polling locations, I’m unsure how you secure every building,” he told the paper. “Ours was in a government facility that had an alarm and was locked.”</p>
<p><strong>A<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/09/16/utah-voters-uses-new/"> new privacy law</a> in Utah</strong> has political parties up-in-arms. The law allows voters to keep all of their information, including name and party affiliation private and according to <em>The Salt Lake Tribune</em>, about one in every eight Utah voters uses the law to keep their information private. As of July 31, the office of Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox reports that 206,832 voters out of 1.67 million in Utah — or 12.4% — have opted to make their voter registration private since last year. So, their names, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, party affiliation and when or if they voted are not released in public databases sold by the state. Unlike most other states that allow certain people—celebrities, victims of violence, etc.— to keep their information private anyone in Utah can opt into the program.</p>
<p><strong>The Prince William County, Virginia electoral board</strong> had to hold an emergency meeting this week after the county’s elections director proposed<a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/prince_william/prince-william-electoral-board-votes-to-keep-saturday-schedule-for/article_3ab0a742-da2e-11e9-aadf-7bc662a5deed.html"> eliminating the first five Saturdays of in-person absentee voting</a> for the upcoming November election. According to <em>Inside NoVA</em>, Elections Director Michele White said the county did not have the $16,000 it would cost to keep the office open for the Saturday hours. The electoral board voted 3-0 to keep the office open on Saturdays. Board Secretary Keith Scarborough told the publication the electoral board is sympathetic to budget concerns, but said there are other things the office can do to balance their budget. “This election has the most direct impact on local citizens so we want to make sure people have as many opportunities as possible to vote in this election,” Scarborough said.</p>
<p><strong>Three cheers to Vigo County, Indiana</strong> that found a unique way to<a href="https://www.tribstar.com/news/local_news/election-board-gives-laptops-to-non-profits/article_9356fdb6-e768-5391-9d3c-bb952e8b3038.html"> get rid of old elections equipment</a>. The county will distribute 5-year-old laptops that used to serve as e-poll books to 21 area nonprofits. “We&#8217;ve got a wide variety of people we will be able to help with laptops,&#8221; Vigo County Clerk Brad Newman told the <em>Terre Haute Tribune Star</em>. There are 49 laptops going to organizations that include preschools, churches as well as agencies such as Swope Art Museum, Happiness Bag and Council on Domestic Abuse.</p>
<p><strong>This week,<a href="https://www.democracy.works/blog/knightsupport"> Democracy Works</a> announced</strong> that it had received a new $3 million investment from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The organization will use Knight’s new support to jump-start a $20 million fundraising round aimed at transforming the American voter experience during the 2020 election cycle. This new round of funding will support the large-scale growth of the organization’s innovative registration and information platform, with the ultimate goal of increasing voter participation around the country. “The backing of Knight Foundation sets Democracy Works up to raise a new round of support that stands to dramatically impact turnout in the 2020 election and beyond,” said Seth Flaxman, Democracy Works chief executive officer. “This investment is about improving the health of our democracy — it will help us reach millions of new users, turn the internet into an onramp for voting, and modernize the voting experience throughout the country.”</p>
<p><strong>I Voted Sticker News</strong>: This week the state of Maryland launched the<a href="https://www.msdefinearts.org/state-election-sticker-art-competition"> 2019 “I Voted” Sticker Competition</a> which is open to all Maryland students in pre-K through 12th grade.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> Anchorage Judge Yvonne Lamoureaux has granted permission for a political group that introduced a ballot measure to overhaul Alaska elections, including implementing ranked-choice voting, to begin collecting signatures while the application is being litigated.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> As part of settlement with The Navajo Nation, Arizona voters who<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2019/09/12/arizona-voters-who-dont-sign-early-ballots-get-second-chance-katie-hobbs-settlement-navajo-nation/2305304001/"> forget to sign their early ballot envelope</a> will have a chance after Election Day to fix their mistake. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has agreed to a new policy to require officials to notify voters about missing signatures on early ballots and give them five business days after an election to remedy the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Judge Robert Hinkle turned down Gov. Ron DeSantis’ request to put on hold a challenge to a new state law that requires those who wish to have their voting rights restored, as determined by<a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/judge-refuses-to-issue-stay-in-felons-voting-case"> Amendment 4</a>, to fulfill all financial obligations. The state had asked the court to put the challenge on hold while the state’s Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of Amendment 4.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Kentucky State Police<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article235213512.html"> seized a computer</a> Tuesday from the Office of the Secretary of State as part of an ongoing investigation into how Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes and her aides used voter data.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Michael Gibbons, 33, who served as the deputy chief of the Atlantic County Superintendent of Elections office has been indicted on charges that he ran an<a href="https://www.nj.com/atlantic/2019/09/indicted-elections-official-accused-of-paying-workers-to-clean-moms-attic-running-ot-scheme.html"> overtime scheme</a> to make extra cash. He is accused of paying county workers to clean out his mother’s attic.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> U.S. Judge Aleta Trauger has blocked Tennessee’s<a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/judge-blocks-tennessee-voter-signup-penalties-citing-harm/985622664?utm_source=homestream&amp;utm_medium=site_navigation&amp;utm_campaign=homestream_click"> new voter registration law</a> which would have penalized third-party groups for everything from incomplete forms to forms that weren’t turned in quickly enough. &#8220;There is simply no basis in the record for concluding that the Act will provide much benefit to Tennesseans, and even less reason to think that any benefit will come close to outweighing the harms to Tennesseans (and non-Tennesseans) who merely wish to exercise their core constitutional rights of participating in the political process by encouraging voter registration,&#8221; Trauger wrote when she approved the preliminary injunction in the days before her ruling.</p>
<p>Also in Tennessee, U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker ruled that a lawsuit filed by a group of Shelby County voters challenging the<a href="https://beta.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-dismisses-federal-voting-security-lawsuit-in-tennessee/2019/09/13/44f56562-d673-11e9-8924-1db7dac797fb_story.html"> security of the state’s voting machines</a> failed to show that any harm has come to plaintiffs and that they have no standing to bring suit.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Equipment Certification</strong>: According to <em>Cyberscoop</em>, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission has told lawmakers that it<a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/microsoft-windows-voting-machines-elections-assistance-commission/"> will not de-certify</a> certain voting systems that use outdated Microsoft Windows systems. In a letter to lawmakers, the EAC said the act of de-certifying the system is cumbersome and “has wide-reaching consequences, affecting manufacturers, election administration at the state and local levels, as well as voters.”</p>
<p><strong>Lines:</strong> A team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have used a<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614296/data-mining-shows-black-people-waited-longer-than-white-to-vote-in-2016/"> unique way to determine wait times at polling place</a>s. According to the <em>MIT Technology Review</em>, the team used the location of 117,000 polling stations around the country to find cell phones that spent more than one minute there on Election Day. However, they ignored phones that visited the polling station before or after this date to exclude individuals who live or work at the site. Using this, the team determined the average wait to vote across the US was 19 minutes in 2016, with 18 percent of individuals waiting more than 30 minutes. The team further broke down the data based on percentage of black and white voters and found that “Voters from areas [with the greatest percentage of black people] spent 19% more time at their polling locations than those in the bottom decile,” they say. “Further, [these] voters were 49% more likely to spend over 30 minutes at the polling location.”</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> This week Colorado became the first state to<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/state-to-phase-out-ballot-barcodes/article_83fab5c6-d904-11e9-ba3d-20677ce07cb4.html"> stop using barcodes on ballots</a>. The QR codes that are being phased out are only used on paper ballots in the polling place. Currently, only about 5 percent of ballots cast in Colorado elections are done with the use of in-person voting machines, and about half of those voters opt for paper ballots. That means only about 2-1/2 percent of ballots cast would be impacted by the change. &#8220;We live in a constantly changing threat environment,&#8221; Secretary of State Jena Griswold said when announcing the change. &#8220;Hostile actors will continue their efforts to discover vulnerabilities in the attempt to undermine confidence in our elections. We must continually assess all election systems to identify areas that should be improved.&#8221;</p>
