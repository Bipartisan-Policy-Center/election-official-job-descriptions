							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Trust but verify has become verify and trust…maybe</strong><br />
<em>State and local election officials work to fight disinformation campaigns</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>In the 20 months since the 2016 election, millions of dollars and millions of column inches have been spent on securing America’s elections. However, most of that money and most of that media coverage has focused on preventing a hack of America’s voting machines and systems.</p>
<p>But what about a hack of America’s mind — so-to-speak?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4272" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.51.19-PM-300x167.png" alt="" width="374" height="208" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.51.19-PM-300x167.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.51.19-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.51.19-PM-1024x571.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" />According to a Brookings Institute report,<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/"> How to Combat Fake News and Disinformation</a>, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016</p>
<p>Within the elections community, while securing the vote has and continues to take precedence, elections officials are also now turning their focus to the impact disinformation campaigns can have to the democratic process.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> West Virginia Secretary of State</a>’s office  recently released a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvfSJ5Xcb3U"> new video</a>, as well as<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/elections/Documents/ForeignInfluenceUSElections.pdf"> audience-specific PowerPoint presentations</a>, to educate citizens on foreign interference in U.S. elections.</p>
<p>“Educating our citizens on how to recognize disinformation and misinformation is a top priority,” Secretary of State Mac Warner said. “Foreign entities know the best way to break down trust between citizens and citizens and their government is through division. We can’t allow that to happen.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4273" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.44.13-PM-300x169.png" alt="" width="392" height="221" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.44.13-PM-300x169.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.44.13-PM-768x433.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.44.13-PM-1024x577.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-6.44.13-PM.png 1710w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" />Warner presented his video and PowerPoint slides at the<a href="https://www.nass.org/"> National Association of Secretaries of State</a> conference earlier this summer and since then has done, or been asked to do presentations in more than a dozen states.</p>
<p>Although the presentations include declassified information from the<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/"> Department of Homeland Security</a>, all the work on the video and PowerPoint was done in-house by staff and summer interns in the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p>“We have entered a new age – the age of Big Data – and our culture is being driven by algorithms, artificial intelligence, bots, blockchain, machine learning, micro-targeting and social media,” Warner said. “Unfortunately, Russia and other bad actors have weaponized these tools, and like judo experts, are using these against us.  They know elections are the heart of democracy, so elections are the center of gravity for their disinformation operations.”</p>
<p>The secretary’s office worked directly with the<a href="https://wvde.us/"> West Virginia Department of Education</a> to create a set of the PowerPoint presentation that is tailored to students. According to Michael Queen, deputy chief of staff and director of communications, said it’s been encouraging to meet and speak with state educators who know about the presentations and are already planning to use them in their curriculum this coming school year.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.pascovotes.com/"> Pasco County, Florida</a>, Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley recently<a href="https://www.pascovotes.com/Portals/Pasco/Documents/SocialMediaAndThe2020Election.pdf"> penned an op-ed</a> about the impacts of misinformation and how to combat it.</p>
<p>Corley, a self-confessed recovering social media junkie, gave up on the platform because he could no longer take the half-truths, misleading comments and outright lies that persons were knowingly or unknowingly disseminating via retweets on Twitter and likes/shares on Facebook.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is this: These activities further erode voter confidence at such a pivotal time when we as election administrators work so hard to improve the voter’s confidence in the process,” Corley said.</p>
<p>And after reading<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5955118-The-Mueller-Report.html"> “The Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election”</a> by the Office of Special Counsel with intricate details on methods and actors involved in the meddling of our elections, Corley said he was angry.</p>
<p>“To read in the report how these nefarious actors used social media to further polarize Americans, delegitimize the winner and erode voter confidence made my angry,” he said.</p>
<p>He was also dismayed to see partisan politics ruin something that should have brought all Americans together, united in the defense of our democracy and elections.</p>
<p>“Instead, it became yet another partisan battleground with the ability to tell if one believed in the undeniable conclusions of the report based on which cable television news channel they watched,” Corley said.</p>
<p>He noted that regardless of party politics, any and every attempt to educate on the perils of spreading misinformation on social media to voters is paramount to offsetting what most certainly will continue through the 2020 cycle.</p>
<p>“We are currently working with our county public information department to develop PSA’s on this exact topic,” Corley said. “I use every opportunity to relay the importance of when in doubt, verify before sharing on social media.</p>
<p>Both Warner and Corley encouraged other elections officials to take the work that they’ve done and tweak it as they see fit to make it their own.</p>
<p>“The old adage ‘Sometimes the best defense is a good offense’ comes to mind as no longer can we in the elections community be ‘reactive’ with misinformation,” Corley said. “We need to stress to our constituents that we are their elections administrator and contact us for the truth. As we know, election administrators are nonpartisan professionals who exist to administer secure and transparent elections.”</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <em>The Hill</em>, Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Illinois), the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, sent</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/456256-key-house-republican-examines-federal-election-security-efforts"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a letter to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demanding answers regarding election security oversight issues. Davis poses a series of questions that included what steps the EAC is taking to ensure there is a plan in place to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security in the event of a threat to election infrastructure in 2020, how the EAC is communicating its activities to the public, and details around the new Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines 2.0, which are a national voluntary set of standards for voting systems. Davis gave the EAC until Sept. 2 to respond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remain committed to ensuring that local election officials have every resource they need to provide for a secure election in 2020,” Davis wrote according to <em>The Hill</em>. “Effective and focused oversight over the EAC is critically important in this mission.&#8221;</span></p>

Tabitha recently called her son out on social media for not yet casting his ballot, but like any good elections official she also provided him with information about all his remaining voting options. According to Tabitha, he showed up Monday morning to cast his early ballot and spend some time with his mom. A win for democracy and moms everywhere!

Bequi Flores, pastor of the church where the polling place is located explained to KAKE.</span></p>

Although it’s summer break, students in</span><a href="http://www.thenewsherald.com/news/high-school-students-help-with-voting-process-in-melvindale/article_07a3340a-b878-11e9-bbaa-23d5632d3362.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Melvindale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped out at the polls.

Speaking of no-excuse absentee voting, in</span><a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2019/08/07/august-2019-primary-sees-low-voter-turnout-lansing-city-council-absentee/1942758001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lansing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a whopping 76 percent of voters cast their ballot by absentee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mississippi:</strong> A polling place in Hinds County opened late after a polling manager suffered a</span><a href="https://www.wapt.com/article/gop-polling-location-opens-late-after-manager-suffers-heart-attack/28622909"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heart attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took about two hours to find a replacement for the election official. There is no work on their condition. In Jackson County, voters had to use paper ballots at one precinct after early morning issues with</span><a href="https://www.wtok.com/content/news/Jackson-County-precinct-uses-handwritten-affidavit-ballots-523833911.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

An</span><a href="https://www.kait8.com/2019/08/07/suv-crashes-into-mississippi-voting-precinct/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SUV crashed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into a polling place in Lamar County around 6:30p.m. No one was injured and voting continued until the regular closing time.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: On Tuesday, Judge John G. Ingram began his</span><a href="https://patch.com/new-york/foresthills/judge-starts-review-disputed-ballots-queens-da-primary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> review of about 100 disputed ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Democratic primary for Queens DA. After Ingram refused to reinstate most of the ballots, Caban</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/nyregion/tiffany-caban-queens-da-concedes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conceded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the election, losing by just 55 votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in New York, State Supreme Court Judge James McClusky has ruled that</span><a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2019/08/07/judge-all-three-candidates-go-ballot-mayor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three candidates for mayor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Watertown will appear on the ballot. Only the top two finishers are supposed to appear on the November ballot, but the candidates in second and third place were tied and with no laws on the book to break an election tie, McClusky has ruled that both the second and third place finisher will go through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Thursday Aug. 1 was election day in Davidson County and while overall things went smoothly, one polling place in Nashville did have issues with its</span><a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/polling-place-experiences-issues-with-voting-machines"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot scanning machine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington:</strong> All eyes were on The Evergreen State this week as Washington rolled out its new VoteWA voter registration system and same-day registration.

The introduction of same-day registration seemed to go well too. Some counties had no people exercise that option and some only had a handful, but there were no issues with those who did. In total,</span><a href="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article233638212.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,029</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people registered to vote on election day.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A new law in Ohio, the language of which was included in the state’s budget</strong>, will now allow voting locations with multiple precincts to have as few as two poll workers pre precinct. Before the new language was included in the budget, elections boards had to hire at least four poll workers per precinct. According to the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>, counties have</span><a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190801/with-fewer-poll-workers-will-ohio-voters-face-long-lines-on-election-day-in-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been fighting to make this change for five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the difficulty in finding and keeping enough poll workers. “Unfortunately, we are just really having a lot of difficulty recruiting poll workers, keeping poll workers,” Aaron Ockerman, executive director of the Ohio Association of Elections Officials told the paper. “It’s a tough job. It’s a long day.” Ockerman also told the paper that the way Ohioans vote now is dramatically different than in 2004 when the state was plagued with long lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Using the 54th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act as a backdrop</strong>, Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill, federal and state legislators, the League of Women Voters and other voting rights advocates called on the state Legislature to include</span><a href="https://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-pol-voting-rights-reform-special-session-push-20190806-pynil6uncfezngjx7hy2nt743u-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting rights reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an upcoming special session. According to the <em>Hartford Courant</em>, They’d like to implement automatic voter registration, fix problems with Election Day registration and give residents on parole the right to vote. A bill that included all three of the proposed changes died in the state Senate as the legislative session came to a close in early June. House Bill 7160, An Act To Increasing Voter Access, passed in the House on May 28 but stalled in the Senate amid partisan tension over which bills would be heard in the session’s final days. Merrill is urging for the reforms to be taken up during the special session to give her office time to implement them. “It cannot wait until the next session,” Merrill said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This is a pretty cool idea!</strong> For the third time, Contra Costa County, California’s Elections Division will be holding a photo contest with the winning photo</span><a href="https://eastcountytoday.net/contra-costa-elections-host-march-2020-photo-contest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being featured on the cover of the county’s 2020 voter guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which hits more than 650,000 mailboxes. The theme of this year’s contest is “The Flora and Fauna of Contra Costa County.”  “The Photo Contest is a fun way to get our residents involved in the election process and pique their interest in voting,” Registrar of Voters Joe Canciamilla told <em>East County Today</em>. “It’s also a great way to highlight the talent of our residents.” The second and third place winners will also have their photos featured on the Elections Division website, in the office lobby and in other elections publications. The first contest was held in 2016 and received more than 100 entries. We’re looking forward to seeing the winner!</span></p>

In addition to his duties in the St. Louis elections office, Bauer was also an active observer of international elections doing observation work in places like Albania, Bosnia, Ukraine and Belarus. “He didn’t just represent the US in a technical way on these missions, he was the heart and soul of the United States. He wanted to know people, stay in their homes, meet their family and friends and learn what made them happy. Over the years Dick kept in touch with his interpreters, drivers and people he met along the way,” DeGregorio wrote in a Facebook post memorializing his friend. Bauer is survived by his four children, his brothers and sisters-in-law along with numerous nieces, nephews and cousins.</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland:</strong> The National Federation for the Blind as well as three blind voters have sued the state board of elections alleging</span><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-blind-election-lawsuit-20190803-b3grd2ey4rhvzajc4p4rkzt7hm-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blind voters are being discriminated against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when attempting to cast a ballot. The suit claims the voters are being denied a secret ballot. According to <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>, the ballot marking devices used by blind voters print a paper ballot that is different in shape and size than the default paper ballots most voters use. “Thus, when only one voter uses the [Ballot Marking Device] in her precinct, her ballot becomes easily identifiable, destroying the secrecy of her vote,” the lawsuit states.</span></p>

Among the things the new research found is that only about 22 percent of U.S. adults say they use Twitter. Most U.S. Twitter users are younger, have more education and higher incomes than U.S. adults overall. Two important things for elections folks to keep in mind, the research found that 71 percent of Twitter users get their news from the site, however according to PRC because a relatively small share to Americans use Twitter to begin with, that means fewer than one-in-five U.S. adults get news from the site.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Montana:</strong> The secretary of state’s office is delaying a move to new voter registration system until 2021. Previously Secretary of State Corey Stapleton had said the state would make the switch from MontanaVotes to ElectMT before the 2020 election cycle. However, with election turnout expected to be through the roof, count election officials had expressed concerns about making the move during a critical election year. &#8220;The whole association is extremely excited with the decision to wait and not roll it out in the 2020 election,&#8221; Montana Association of Clerks and Recorders President Stephanie Verhasselt, who is the Richland County clerk and recorder told <em>The Missoulian</em>. &#8220;We do believe when the new system comes out, once we get it working and everyone trained, I think it will have a lot of features we like.&#8221;</span></p>
