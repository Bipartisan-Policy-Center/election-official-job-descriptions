														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Joe’s Top-10 Election Security List</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Joseph Lorenzo Hall</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4516" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Hall-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Hall-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Hall-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Hall-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Hall-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Hall.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I’ve been working with election technology for 17 years — first as a young student and academic and most recently as part of civil society. Despite that, I suspect this puts me somewhere in the middle of the experience range for most electionline readers!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, as I find myself</span><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2019/09/announcing-joseph-hall-as-svp-for-a-strong-internet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moving on to other more challenging pastures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in my own career, I can’t help but look back at how far the elections community has come over these years. At the same time, it seems like our work will never truly be complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an expert in privacy and security, I wanted to take the time to try and jot down a quick list of pieces of advice… although of course that list might be tailored a bit differently depending on where you sit. In the interest of bridging communities, I’ll offer five pieces of advice to election officials and another five to security experts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For election officials:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Build community</strong>: We are all in this together and for the most part have the exact same goals: making sure eligible voters can cast votes as intended and have those ballots counted as cast. We have never faced the threats — or opportunities, frankly — that we face today, and I spend a good deal of time explaining to people why one thing or another is not happening and which element of the elections community is frustrating that progress. The only thing that will be constant in the new election administration is change, and everyone is going to need to do things that may make them uncomfortable, including trying to appease, entertain, and tolerate even the most litigious or aggressive voices throughout the community. Try to give everyone a fresh take and don’t let grudges or spats from years past cloud the current set of complex tasks at hand. And don’t</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/fbi-voting-app-hack-investigation/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refer students tinkering with your stuff to the FBI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Train</strong>: We’ve never been in a place like where we are now: so much of the stability and integrity of the election process relies on staff having expertise built into them and reinforced constantly.</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/courses"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CDT and our partners CTCL have created a self-paced cybersecurity training for election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and this is essentially the minimum election staff will increasingly need to be familiar with in order to ensure they are a capability and not a liability. There are an increasing number of groups that can help create training materials or other kinds of educational tools around emerging concepts such as cybersecurity, risk-limiting auditing, moving (or not!) to the cloud, etc.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cultivate your inner geek</strong>: I tell people that my job in life is to “create a tiny technologist within you… each of you… no matter how tiny!” By this, I’m trying to tell people that to the extent they cultivate and encourage their own technical-geek tendencies, they will be better off in work and life… and this is especially true for people working on the front lines of critical infrastructure like elections. For example, do you know how to securely send a file from one person to another without anyone in between being able to intercept it or observe it? Check out</span><a href="https://send.firefox.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> https://send.firefox.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which you can use for everything from W-9s, I-9s, etc. and the encryption protecting those files takes place in the browser itself, so no one ever has the opportunity to eavesdrop, modify, or learn what you are sharing. And that’s just one example of a killer tool… if you keep your ear to the ground and make some geeky friends, there are oodles of little tricks and tools you can use to make your life and job easier. (And when you have enough of these tricks, people may start calling you a “hacker” and that’s a good thing.)</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Put two-factor on errythang</strong>: I cannot stress enough that you should all be using two-factor authentication on absolutely everything you can, on your work accounts but also on your personal accounts. As</span><a href="https://cdt.org/insight/election-cybersecurity-101-field-guide-two-factor-authentication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we explain in this one-pager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two-factor is having to enter something in addition to your password to login to a service; for example, your bank may send a text message with a six-digit code when you’re trying to login from a new device or an exotic location. This is crucial as stealing an account without two-factor protections is a key step in remote attacks that might originate from malicious attackers in other countries, a key threat we clearly face in the United States. But I would also encourage you to turn it on by default across your election office and force all of your staff to use it, most importantly senior staff and leadership. If the equivalent of an Elections Director or CEO cannot be bothered to protect voter data and elections processes, your office is as good as doomed as the most important person there is unprotected.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Think as medium- and long- term as you can</strong>: So often we plan for the immediate short term, but as you may have seen, changes to equipment and processes — for example, single-ballot comparison risk-limiting audits! — often bleed over into the medium and long term. You may not be able to get to your ideal state of running elections tomorrow or even next year, but if you don’t plan to orient and make progress — measurable progress — towards the ideal state, you will literally never get there.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For security experts:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Build community</strong>: Security experts don’t face the constraints that many other people in the elections community face — they aren’t answerable to the public, they don’t have precarious vendor relationships, and they don’t sit in the middle of a complex set of government hierarchies. This freedom is exactly why many of us are attracted to the work, but it can also mean at certain crucial times we are seen as loose cannons, with no real insight into the constraints that affect election officials and others. I would encourage you to make one election official friend every two months until the 2020 election… that’s at least 6 new friends, but it’s also six people that can give you feedback about your work, your tone, the degree of receptivity you enjoy, and many other things (like Tammy’s love of Bluegrass!). It’s time to build relationships, not complicate them or break them.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Disclose privately, first</strong>: I think we’ve seen an arc in terms of disclosures from security experts about process, privacy, and security vulnerabilities; in the early 2000s it was disclose publicly, talk to the press. Recently, I’ve seen disclosures happen over longer periods of time and privately and I think that’s on balance the right thing to do, given the constraints that I mention above. Of course, there is always a role for public disclosure, but I would urge you to make that the last resort, and, when you do, make sure a reporter who understands elections is behind you! I have also seen recent private disclosures that have resulted in good mitigations at what I would consider lighting speed. That is a good sign that the community is maturing — election officials, their coordinating organizations like MS/EI-ISAC, and manufacturers — and better able to handle things privately when vulnerabilities or flaws are live. There will always be time for follow-up and always time for more newsworthy items in the future, but you never know who has an election right around the corner, and we want to help defenders moreso than attackers.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Work with election officials</strong>: We often tell people interested in helping out in elections that the greatest thing they can do is be a poll worker. That is true, but for those of us with significant technical expertise, we can go further: we can be technical poll workers. Election officials need help not just in traditional poll worker duties, but as our voting machinery becomes increasingly computerized and networked officials are going to need volunteers that can help troubleshoot technology failures. And we have to create frameworks that allow for this without also “letting the fox in the henhouse”, so to speak. We at CDT have taken a shot at this with a set of toolkits for</span><a href="https://cdt.org/insight/infosec-toolkit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technical folks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://cdt.org/insight/election-officials-toolkit-for-technical-volunteers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would like to attract those people, and the last DEF CON Voting Village held an off-the-record session to see how hackers can actually step up and defend on the front lines. Let’s build this capacity, together.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Build things to the greatest extent you can</strong>: So often technical election security work is about breaking things, be it machinery, software, schemes, or processes. However, no where is it more important to make sure that as we break things we attempt to build things too. I’m heartened by the efforts of LA County with the VSAP system, VotingWorks with its system and their Arlo risk-limiting auditing software, and Microsoft’s efforts to actually bring cryptographic end-to-end election methods out of the pages of theory and into the real world. We are going to need secure accessible verification for printed ballots with QR codes, more flexible methods of composing risk-limiting audits across jurisdictions with varying technology and law, and e-pollbooks that we don’t glance at and shudder at the potential for insecurity.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The internet is here:</strong> None of you are going to like this, but we have to recognize that the internet is here and people are going to cast voted ballots over it. I know that makes me scream inside; if only people knew what we know about the stuff that makes up our devices, networks, and servers (it’s all effectively rubber bands and paperclips)… and how the heck are we supposed to do risk-limiting audits of elections without a software-independent record of the voter’s intent? Yes, people are going to cast ballots over the internet, but instead of saying “never!” we need to say, “Only when absolutely necessary, when there are no alternatives to return a physical ballot, and with the full understanding of the voter that they may be submitting garbage.” We need to work to minimize internet voting until we have the necessary breakthroughs that can help fix the sorry state of our digital technologies… but those breakthroughs are going to take decades and it’s hard to imagine being able to hold the “no internet voting” line for decades. We have to choose our absolutes carefully and minimize other badness.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So long and thanks for all the votes!</span></p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: A very heartfelt thank you to Joe for all of his support of electionline and for helping us understand the tech and security world better. We&#8217;re gonna miss you Joe!)</em></p>

							<h2>2019 Election Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alabama</strong>: Birmingham officials have</span><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/10/locked-ballot-boxes-to-be-reopened-at-3-pm-at-birmingham-city-hall.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retrieved the memory cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> containing results from the three boxes that were missing Tuesday night. Presiding Jefferson County Circuit Judge Joseph Boohaker signed an order allowing the boxes to be opened Wednesday afternoon. According to <em>The Advance</em>, the ballots weren’t missing as much as they were misplaced.  “During tabulation of votes from the 69 polling places it was determined certain election records (memory cards) were erroneously placed in the sealed Records of Elections Boxes and/or the Provisional Ballot Boxes at the close of the polls in three locations,” Director of Communication Rick Journey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Early voting got underway this week in the city of Las Cruces and voters</span><a href="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/ranked-choice-voting-causing-mixed-emotions-across-las-cruces"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are using ranked choice voting for the first time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So far the reviews have been mixed. “It’s not necessary. I’m going to vote for who I’m going to vote for, and some of the other people, I don’t even know them anyway,” Robert Treviño KFOX14. On the other hand, “I think it’s wonderful that you’ve got a second or a third choice,” Violet Cauthon told the station. Dona Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin anticipate Las Cruces will save about $80,000 to $100,000 by not having to conduct a runoff election. “We rank things every single day. Let’s say you’re wearing a blue dress. Well you maybe had a black dress but it hadn’t been dry-cleaned yet, so the blue dress was acceptable to you,” said López Askin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: With early voting set to debut in New York this fall, the roll out in New York City seems to be moving slowly. Last week it was report that it’s unclear if the city has purchased the necessary electronic poll books to conduct early voting and this week, school principals are expressing concerns that they are</span><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/principals-learn-their-schools-are-early-voting-sites-just-three-weeks-polls-open"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only now being told that their schools will be used to for 11 days of early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, beginning Oct. 26. “As a citizen of New York City, I didn’t even know there was such a thing as early voting—which I’m excited about,” Kiri Soares told <em>Gothamist</em>. “As a principal, it poses a lot of logistical problems that I gotta go figure out right now.” The Department of Education said it notified schools about being early voting sites in the same manner as it does if they will be used for Election Day polling places, about three weeks in advance. Thirty-three school sites will be used for early voting. “I can’t not have kids [in the gym] for a week in October. That’s crazy,” Soares told <em>Gothamist</em> / WNYC.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Earlier this season, the Montgomery County, Maryland Board of Elections</strong> voted</span><a href="https://wtop.com/montgomery-county/2019/10/montgomery-co-has-to-revisit-adding-early-voting-site-after-states-decision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not to add a 12th early voting site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in White Oak. After public outcry and a state legislator threatening emergency legislation, the Maryland State Board of Elections has voted to direct the county bring in additional information about opening a 12th site. The MoCo BOE, which had cited costs as the reason for not adding the 12th site will have until October 24 to provide the information to the SBOE which will vote on the issue at its regularly scheduled October 31 meeting. Montgomery County Councilmember Tom Hucker noted that 35 percent of the residents of White Oak, many of whom are low-income, African-American and immigrants — don’t have access to a car and the closest early vote center is a 41-minute bus ride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate announced</strong> a new 14-member, bipartisan</span><a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2019_10_07.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Auditors&#8217; Working Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist in the administration of elections and sharing of best practices. The 14 members represent a broad spectrum of Iowa counties, spanning urban and rural areas across the state. “Administering elections across the state requires a team effort, and these 14 auditors are very important members of the team,” Pate said. “They have shown the ability to work together in a bipartisan way to strengthen Iowa’s elections. Together, we will share ideas, concerns and best practices, and ensure we are doing everything possible to protect the integrity and sanctity of the vote.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Office News</strong>: Election and Voter Services in</span><a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/new-center-in-minneapolis-puts-all-city-elections-services-in-one-spot-for-first-time"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minneapolis, Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now all under one roof. Previously the office had been spread out over several locations, but late last week, the Mayor, city council members and Secretary of State Steve Simon were on hand for the official opening. The building on Hennepin Avenue will serve Minneapolis residents as an early-voting location and will be a year-round office for election officials. The location will also be a place to train election judges, test equipment, and count absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Congratulations to three employees</strong> of the</span><a href="http://www.co.union.nc.us/news/board-elections-receive-certifications"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Union County, North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> board of elections for their recent professional achievements.

The partially redacted report, Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election Volume 2: Russia’s Use of Social Media with Additional Views, documents the committee’s findings on Russian activities and intentions, and the U.S. response, as well as makes recommendations for the tech industry, Congress, and the executive branch. As part of Russia’s “broader, sophisticated, and ongoing information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in American politics and society,” the report identifies voter suppression as an apparent goal of its influence operations targeting the 2016 elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heritage Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released a</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/report/vote-harvesting-recipe-intimidation-coercion-and-election-fraud"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on mail ballot return this week. The report, Vote Harvesting: A Recipe for Intimidation, Coercion, and Election Fraud, finds that 27 states and the District of Columbia permit someone other than the voter or a family member to return mail ballots on behalf of voters, what it terms “vote harvesting” or “ballot harvesting,” and argues against this practice. The report also discusses recent examples of illegal mail ballot return activity in North Carolina and Texas.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several pieces of</span><a href="https://lakeconews.com/index.php/news/62905-governor-signs-bills-to-strengthen-california-s-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections-related legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law. The new laws include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 72 by Sen. Thomas Umberg (D-Santa Ana) requires conditional voter registration and provisional voting to be available at all county elections satellite offices and polling places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AB 49 by Assemblymember Sabrina Cervantes (D-Riverside) ensures people have more time with their ballots by requiring county elections officials to begin mailing vote by mail ballots no later than 29 days before Election Day and complete the mailings within five days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 523 by Sen. Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) aligns the timeline for notices and the submission of an unsigned vote by mail ballot envelope with the deadlines established for mismatching signatures to give voters more flexibility to correct their signatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AB 1707 by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) allows voters to use an electronic device at a polling place​. The bill will allow voters to access information on their phone, tablet or other handheld device while voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AB 59 by Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D-San Jose) requires county elections officials to consider placing a vote center on a university or college campus and allows public college and university buildings to be used as polling places or vote centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AB 963 by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris (D-Laguna Beach) establishes the Student Civic and Voter Empowerment Act to be administered by the Secretary of State, which requires each campus of the California Community Colleges (CCCs) and the California State University (CSU), to provide students with civic and election dates and information, and designate one person per campus as a Civic and Voter Empowerment Coordinator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: Councilmember David Grosso introduced several pieces of election-related legislation this week including the</span><a href="https://thedcline.org/2019/10/08/press-release-councilmember-grosso-introduces-bills-to-enhance-representation-in-local-government/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ranked Choice Voting Amendment Act of 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would implement ranked choice voting in all city elections, the Local Residents Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2019 that would allow permanent residents who are on the path to U.S. citizenship, the right to vote in local elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vermont:</strong> By a 10-2 vote, the Burlington city council has approved a resolution that seeks to</span><a href="https://www.wcax.com/content/news/City-Council-passes-proposal-to-let-noncitizens-vote-562487091.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow noncitizens to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in city elections. The proposal now heads to the Charter Change Committee which could add an amendment to the city’s charter, but it would need ultimate approval from the Legislature.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arizona:</strong> Richard John Greenfield, 80, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted illegal voting and was sentenced to two years of probation after admitting that he</span><a href="https://ktar.com/story/2772961/registered-republican-sentenced-in-arizona-for-voting-twice-in-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted twice in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> At the end of a two-day hear on the</span><a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/10/08/judge-urges-florida-legislature-to-revamp-law-restoring-voting-rights-to-felons/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implementation of Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 4, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle called the process “an administrative nightmare,” and urged the Florida Legislature to revamp a state law aimed at carrying out a constitutional amendment that restores voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> The state Supreme Court is weighing a portion of the state’s</span><a href="https://www.kbia.org/post/missouri-supreme-court-weighs-voter-photo-id-law#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> photo ID law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires those without a photo ID to sign a sworn statement. Senior Cole Co. Circuit Court Judge Richard Callahan struck down that provision in 2018 saying that the affidavit was misleading because it implied proper photo ID is necessary to vote, despite the fact that the law had allowed voters without ID who signed the affidavit to cast ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: William Mann, 61, of Cutchogue and Gregory Dickerson, 55, of Mattituck, both former Republican board of elections employees in Suffolk County had felony forgery charges against them dropped to</span><a href="https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2019/10/felony-forgery-charges-dropped-to-violations-in-case-of-local-board-of-elections-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disorderly conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to <em>The Suffolk Times</em>, the charges stemmed from a scheme in which Green Party members claimed that Republicans had “hijacked” the Green Party line on the Nov. 2018 ballot for three countywide judge positions. The members claimed that they were told the petition carriers were helping Green Party judicial candidates on the ballot, even though the Green Party didn’t have any such candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in New York, Ted Hamm, chair of the Journalism and New Media Studies Program at St. Joseph’s College, filed a request in Queens Supreme Court to obtain a court order that would</span><a href="https://queenseagle.com/all/journalists-court-challenge-would-reveal-uncounted-queens-da-primary-ballots-katz-caban"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unlock 353 affidavit ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with voter information redacted, that the BOE never counted in the 2019 Democratic primary for Queens district attorney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> Almost a  year after the November 2018 general election, Marion County Common Pleas Court Judge William Finnegan ordered the Marion County BOE to</span><a href="https://www.marionstar.com/story/news/local/2019/10/08/marion-judge-orders-hand-recount-2018-marion-county-prosecutor-race/3902854002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conduct a hand recount</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 16 precincts in the county prosecutor’s race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong>  The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced a settlement with York County over</span><a href="https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/2019/10/04/york-county-settles-federal-lawsuit-over-ada-violations-polling-places/3868478002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polling place accessibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Officials from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office and the Department of Justice found &#8220;barriers to access&#8221; at several polling places they surveyed during the primary in 2018. Under the settlement agreement, the county will evaluate each current and prospective polling place to make sure it meets ADA standards. Any inaccessible polling places must be relocated or retrofitted with temporary measures on Election Day, such as portable ramps, signs or doorbells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee:</strong> A judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Shelby County Election Commission that allows campaign workers to use</span><a href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/10/04/judge-tells-election-commission-campaign-workers-must-be-allowed-use-polling-place-restrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restrooms in polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Campaign workers will be permitted to use the restrooms as long as they have no campaign material with them and aren’t wearing anything campaign-related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Shelby County, a group of voters is</span><a href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/10/08/tennessee-voters-appeal-ruling-election-security-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appealing a judge&#8217;s dismissal of a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging the security of voting machines in Tennessee&#8217;s largest county and calling for a switch to a handwritten ballot and a voter-verifiable paper trail.</span></p>

During National Voter Registration Month alone nearly 44,000 Tennesseans used the system.</span></p>

							<h2>Request for Information</h2>
														<p><strong>IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group Request for Formation</strong></p>
<p>On August 15, 2019, the IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group released a<a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b8fa6c_112b6b0bdc764533816b57dfdb3481b9.pdf"> paper</a> that detailed the commitment of voting systems manufacturers to the development and implementation of corporate Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Programs.</p>
<p>The white paper also noted the value of Crowd-Sourced CVD programs and discussed potential challenges in applying such programs to the elections industry and noted that the SIG would create a Request for Information to solicit feedback on how crowd-sourced CVD programs could be implemented in the elections industry.</p>
<p>The IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group seeks public input, comments and suggestions on the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to manage a crowd-sourced CVD program on systems that are designed to be closed, isolated, and disconnected from the Internet including stand-alone embedded systems?</li>
<li>How to ensure that those engaging in a crowd-sourced CVD program are not nefarious actors seeking sensitive information that can then be used in attacks against the elections’ infrastructure?</li>
<li>How best to ensure the confidentiality of the researcher findings so that vulnerability announcements are disclosed simultaneously with a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments and input should please be sent to cvd@it-isac.org by October 21, 2019</p>
