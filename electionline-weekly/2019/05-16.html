														<p><strong>‘We were basically dead in the water’</strong><br />
<em>Baltimore City ransomware attack affects board of elections</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Baltimore City’s new mayor had been on the job for just four days when he had to announce that the city’s computer system had fallen victim to a<a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-government-is-still-recovering-from-ransomware-attack/27457696"> ransomware attack</a>.</p>
<p>The person(s) behind the attack, which has been dubbed the RobinHood ransomware attack wanted $75,000 in Bitcoin to release the city’s computer system.</p>
<p>Mayor Jack Young has said the city will not pay and so while the city’s systems staff is trying to solve the problem, city agencies, including the<a href="https://boe.baltimorecity.gov/"> Board of Elections</a> have been left scrambling.</p>
<p>Abigail Goldman, deputy director of the board of elections said on the morning of May 7 staff at the board knew something was up because emails weren’t functioning properly, but they soon discovered it was much bigger than that.</p>
<p>“We found out about it with everybody else when the announcement was made by the mayor,” Goldman said.</p>
<p>After consulting with the city’s IT department, which took the elections office completely offline — no Internet, no word processing, no nothing — Goldman said call number two was to the<a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/"> State Board of Elections</a>.</p>
<p>According to Nikki Charlson, deputy director of the Maryland State Board of Elections, the SBOE immediately disconnected the local election office from state networks and asked all network administrators to analyze system logs and network traffic looking for unusual activity. To-date, they have seen no unusual activity.</p>
<p>“We were basically dead in the water at that point,” Goldman said. “When people came in we were able to use paper forms.”</p>
<p>Goldman said that the SBOE and other boards in the state have been very helpful with helping the BCBOE get back on its feet.</p>
<p>Six staff from the BOE will be working remotely for the next few weeks. Three will be stationed in the<a href="https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/elections/index.html"> Baltimore County Board of Elections</a> and three will be stationed at the<a href="https://harfordvotes.info/"> Harford County Board of Elections</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah Mohan with the Harford County BOE said the staff are excited to have Baltimore City employees in their office and she hoped that getting back into their routine will bring their spirits up!</p>
<p>&#8220;We here at Harford County are always willing to lend a hand to other counties around the state,” said Cynthia Remmey, director of the Harford County BOE. “We are in this together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SBOE is also helping how they can.</p>
<p>“Because we have a statewide, top-down voter registration system, we started processing electronic voter registration applications from Baltimore City voters,” Charlson said. “We also will accept filings from individuals who wish to file for next year’s Baltimore City mayoral and city council offices. Immediately, after the incident, we kept them updated on the steps we took to disconnect them from State networks and the results of our analysis of system logs and network activity.”</p>
<p>Goldman estimates that once those staff are in place in place and able to complete the necessary tasks like data entry, the city will be at about 80 percent of where they would normally be.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness it’s not an election year,” Goldman said.</p>
<p><strong>Ransomware<br />
</strong>So what exactly is ransomware and how can elections offices protect themselves from it?</p>
<p>“Ransomware is unfortunately one of the more challenging cybersecurity threats that election offices might face,” said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the<a href="https://cdt.org/"> Center for Democracy and Technology</a>.</p>
<p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, designed to deny access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid. Ransomware typically spreads through phishing emails or by unknowingly visiting an infected website.</p>
<p>Hall said that in general there are two things that election officials can do to best prepare for this kind of event:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure all software is updated in a timely fashion; and</li>
<li>Make sure you are backing up critical systems so that you can recover.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Updating software may sound easy, but if an elections office has dependencies such as relying on the wider city or county infrastructure, this may be out of the election office&#8217;s hands and they may not be able to demand that the software they are using is updated as soon as new updates are available,” Hall said.</p>
<p>He noted that some of this can be mitigated by using what is called cloud computing or software-as-a-service, where some of the key office productivity tools an office would normally use locally (Word, Excel, email, etc.) are not hosted and maintained by the election official (or their city or county) but by a company that focuses on maintaining that software and protecting millions of other small-business-like entities.</p>
<p>Backing systems up has complications too, Hall said. So many people back systems up but rarely do they &#8220;practice&#8221; trying to use those backups suddenly to restore normal operations.</p>
<p>“This is why it is important to simulate a ransomware attack: have everyone realistically pretend that the office has been hit by a ransomware infection and, working with a few spare machines, they restore recent backups to those machines and demonstrate that they were able to recover and conduct normal elections business,” Hall recommended.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Goldman said the city estimates it will be at least three weeks before everything can be rebuilt and the departments are back up to speed.</p>
<p>As for how to prevent something like this from happening again in the future, Hall said that’s difficult. While the city could consider isolating the elections department systems like they did when<a href="http://pottercountyvotes.com/"> Potter County, Texas</a> was recently hit by a virus, but Hall said it’s not that simple.</p>
<p>“Isolating systems on different machines, different networks, or otherwise can mean that the program that want&#8217;s to ‘jump’ to another machine won&#8217;t be able to do that so easily. However, often there is some basic need for systems to be able to communicate (e.g., an elections staffer needs to update the elections webpage) and that can be increasingly painful in terms of heightened isolation of these systems,” Hall said. “After all, the most isolation in an typical elections office should be that of the Election Management System which should be ‘air-gapped’ meaning it is so isolated that there is no wired or wireless connection between those systems and other local or public networks, like the internet.”</p>
<p>Hall noted that there is no “silver bullet” solution, but Goldman has found a silver lining.</p>
<p>“Everybody is doing the best that they can,” Goldman said. “People [voters and candidates] are being very understanding of this.”</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>The House has reintroduced the<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/443168-house-dems-reintroduce-bill-to-protect-elections-from-cyber-attacks"> Elections Security Act</a> that is aimed at reducing risks posed by cyberattacks by foreign entities. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the bill would also require the establishment of cybersecurity standards for voting system vendors, and require states to use paper ballots during elections. Additionally, the legislation would establish a National Commission to Protect U.S. Democratic Institutions that would be tasked with countering efforts to undermine democratic institutions, and require the Director of National Intelligence to assess threats to election systems 180 days prior to an election.</p>
<p>In the Senate, a bipartisan group of senators have introduced legislation that would require a cybersecurity expert from the Department of Homeland Security be included on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Technical Guidelines Committee.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/443704-bipartisan-group-of-senators-introduce-legislation-to-strengthen"> Voting System Cybersecurity Act&#8217;</a>s main sponsors are Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), with the bill also co-sponsored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and a group of 12 other senators including a number of 2020 candidates, introduced the<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/443809-senate-dems-introduce-election-security-bill-requiring-paper-ballots"> Protecting American Votes and Elections (PAVE) Act</a> that would mandate the use of paper ballots in U.S. elections and also ban all Internet, Wi-Fi and mobile connections to voting machines.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, he legislation would also give the Department of Homeland Security the power to set minimum cybersecurity standards for U.S. voting machines, authorize a one-time $500 million grant program for states to buy ballot-scanning machines to count paper ballots and require states to conduct risk-limiting audits of all federal elections in order to detect any cyber hacks.</p>
<p>The Senate legislation comes with a dose of reality though from Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) who during a Senate Rules Committee hearing with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission said that it is unlikely the Senate will vote on any<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/443948-top-gop-senator-says-senate-unlikely-to-vote-on-any-election-security"> election security legislation</a> this year. When questioned by a fellow committee member about his assertion, Blunt pointed the finger at H.R. 1.</p>
<p>“I think the majority leader is of the view that this debate reaches no conclusion. And frankly, I think the extreme nature of H.R. 1 from the House makes it even less likely we are going to have that debate,” Blunt said according to <em>The Hill</em>.</p>
<p>Wyden has also<a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2019/05/13/wyden-letter-voting-cyber.aspx"> sent a letter to the CEO of VR Systems</a> raising concerns about whether the company was forthcoming during a 2017 and 2018 legal fight with the state of North Carolina when it denied in court filings that it’s e-poll book system had ever experienced a breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mueller Report&#8217;s revelation that Russia infected your network with malware raises serious questions about your March 2018 claim your company had not experienced a security breach,&#8221; Wyden wrote according to <em>FCW</em>..</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Michigan Secretary of  State Jocelyn Benson recently announced a number of proposals</strong> to<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/05/report-wayne-county-judge-accused-by-grandson-of-covering-up-abuse.html"> make it easier for military and overseas voters to cast a ballot</a> including allowing members of the military and their spouses to be able to return their ballots electronically. Benson noted that some of the changes she wants to pursue will take legislative action, but others she will be able to dictate from her including better ways to track mailed ballots. “Currently, military service members and their families in Michigan face a series of obstacles in participating in our democracy, as my husband and I experienced firsthand,” Benson said at a press conference according to MILive.</p>
<p><strong>The chief elections officials from 18 states recently participated in the Democracy Tour</strong>,<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/voting-officials-take-civil-rights-tour"> a three-day visit to many of Alabama’s historically significant civil rights monuments</a>. The 11 Republicans and seven Democrats visited Edmund Pettus Bridge, the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice among many other sites. According to ProPublica, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said aid the history of the struggle for the vote, and specifically registration, wasn’t something he’d previously understood. “I now have the perspective of both sides,” he according to the publication.</p>
<p><strong>This week, the<a href="https://www.wral.com/nc-elections-director-removed-by-democrat-controlled-board/18383583/"> North Carolina State Board of Elections</a></strong> chose to remove Kim Strach as the executive director. The 3-2 vote was done remotely with all the members of the board of elections calling in because a fire alarm was going off in the building. Strach will be replaced by Karen Brinson Bell, a former elections director in Transylvania County. According to WRAL, before she became director six years ago, Strach was a board investigator.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has announced</strong> the three finalists for the state’s new<a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/media-center/press-releases/2019/2019-05-09/"> “I Voted”</a> stickers and now<a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/secretary-office/office-initiatives/sticker/sticker-vote/"> voting is open</a> to choose the winner. More than 2,000 students statewide submitted entries. “I’m so encouraged by the overwhelming enthusiasm from young people all over our great state,” said LaRose. “It’s a testament to their passion for the power and importance of voting.” Do you have a favorite? We do!</p>
<p><strong>Oh yeah…This week Yavapai County, Arizona Recorder Leslie Hoffman announced</strong> the two winners of the county’s<a href="http://www.sedona.biz/arizona/yavapai-county/winners-of-the-i-voted-sticker-design-contest/"> “I Voted” sticker contest</a>.

The report, Greater Costs, Fewer Options: The Impact of the Early Voting Uniform Hours Requirement in the 2018 Election, finds that Senate Bill 325 (S325) limited early voting options in many parts of the state during the 2018 midterms. Following the passage of S325, 43 of North Carolina’s 100 counties eliminated at least one early voting site, almost half reduced the number of weekend days for early voting, and about two-thirds reduced the number of weekend hours, compared to 2014. S325 will eliminate the last Saturday of early voting for elections beyond 2018. During the 2018 midterms, this last Saturday was the only weekend early voting option in 56 of North Carolina’s 100 counties, and it was a popular day to cast an early ballot for 18- to 25-year old voters.</span></p>

Using all indicators, the states rated highest were Vermont, Washington, Maine, Minnesota, and Iowa. The lowest rated states were Georgia, Florida, Indiana, and South Carolina.</span></p>

<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> Voters in Montpelier approved a ballot measure that would have allowed non-citizens to vote in local elections. In Brattleboro, voters approved a measure allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections. Because they are<a href="https://www.vpr.org/post/senate-committee-punts-decision-non-citizen-voting-until-2020#stream/0"> municipal charter changes</a>, they must be approved by the state Legislature. According to Vermont Public Radio, lawmakers have decided to block action this year on the legislation that would have allowed the revisions to go into effect.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> Contra Costa County recently released a new texting app that allows voters to request their vote-by-mail ballot. Voters simply text<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Elections-Office-Ballot-App-Designed-To-Boost-13839130.php"> COCOBALLOT</a> to 28683 and the texter receives a reply with a link to a form that they complete with their name, date of birth and mailing address. Paul Burgarino of the Contra Costa County Elections Division told the Associated Press  the hope is the app will encourage more voters to get ballots through the mail. That, he said, is hoped to result in more voting, as voters will not have to work a trip to the polling place into their schedules.</p>
