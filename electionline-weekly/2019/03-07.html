														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Joe Mansky</strong><br />
<em>Masnky prepares to end “accidental career”</em></p>
<div id="attachment_3713" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3713" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3713" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mansky-photo-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mansky-photo-212x300.jpg 212w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mansky-photo-768x1089.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mansky-photo-722x1024.jpg 722w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3713" class="wp-caption-text">Joe Masky</p></div>
<p>“They call the elections an accidental career. No one plans to be the elections director,” Patty O’Connor former Blue Earth County, Minnesota elections director recently told the Pioneer Press.</p>
<p>And that’s certainly the case for Ramsey County, Minnesota Elections Director Joe Mansky who is set to end his 35-year career in the office.</p>
<p>When Mansky got into the field, he had a degree in hydrology and had taken only one political science class in college. But during his tenure in office he became according to former Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, “a legend.”</p>
<p>It’s not often that you get to talk to a legend, but we grabbed a bit of Masky’s time before his official last day for one of our Exit Interviews.</p>
<p><em>Why have you decided to retire at this time?</em><br />
Honestly, I prefer at this point in my life to spend more time outside than sitting in an office.</p>
<p><em>What would you say you&#8217;re most proud of during your tenure in elections?</em><br />
Creating the legal and administrative environment in which voting systems are used in Minnesota. Decertifying our punch card systems &#8211; I believe we were the first state to do so. Legally prohibiting the use DREs and other systems lacking a paper ballot – I think we were the first to do that too (in 1985.) Developing and implementing the recount process we used 20 years later in the Coleman-Franken recount. Authoring Minnesota’s post-election audit law. If that’s my legacy, I’m ok with that.</p>
<p><em>Is there anything that you wanted to accomplish in the field of elections that you weren&#8217;t able to?</em><br />
Just a few small things. When I wrote the uniform local government election bill in 1994, I was hoping to have the state-federal elections in the even-numbered years and all county-municipal-school district elections in November of the odd-numbered years. We and the voters would have been the better for it, but we couldn’t get the county elections switched to the odd years. I also was hoping to conduct the 1992 presidential primary as an all-mail election, but the legislature didn’t see things my way.</p>
<p><em>You lived through some pretty big recounts. What did you learn from that that you could impart on others who may find themselves in the same situation?</em><br />
To my friends and colleagues in other states, my advice would be to ensure that in every recount you do, make sure the candidates and attorneys have the chance to visually inspect every ballot. In my experience using optical scan ballots, there are generally two ballots for every 10,000 ballots cast on which there are marks that cannot be read by the ballot counter but on which you can determine the voters’ intent and count the votes. That’s what made the difference in the Coleman-Franken recount, which at the time was the largest recount in American history. Frankly, if you’re not going to visually examine every ballot, why bother doing a recount at all?</p>
<p><em>You took a bit of a nontraditional route to elections, but I understand you&#8217;ve been able to use your hydrology degree in developing election technology, can you tell us a bit about that?</em><br />
Yes, one of the first projects I worked on when I started with the secretary of state in 1984 was the process to collect and report statewide election results electronically, which had never been done before. I ended up using the methodology that the US Geological Survey developed to identify geographic locations on streams and report streamflow data from those locations. It occurred to me that reporting election results could be done in a similar fashion, since that activity also identified data points geographically and reported digital information from them. Any water resources engineer would recognize the concatenation I developed to report our election results. And that method is still being used today, 35 years later.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give to someone just getting into the field today?</em><br />
This is a much more visible and controversial activity than was the case in 1984 when I got my start. Don’t be afraid of that, however. Become an expert in what you are doing. Work proactively with the voters in your community. Don’t sit back and let things happen to you – take the initiative and make things happen.</p>
<p><em>If you could design the perfect voting system, what would it look like?</em><br />
I would like to see a system where you could get your ballot from an official website, mark it electronically, print the ballot somewhere and mail it back or deposit it in a ballot counter at a vote center anywhere in the state where you reside. We would use your smartphone or some other device as an authenticator, so we could verify who you are and where you reside. I think all the tools exist to make this work right now.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s next for you, besides sleeping in on Election Day?</em><br />
I’m going to ride my touring bicycle from the west steps of the US Capitol Building in Washington DC to the Presidio in San Francisco. [<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: We asked Joe if he was planning on keeping a travel blog or tweeting about his journey and he said he’s thinking about it. We’ll be sure to let you know where to find it if he does!]</p>

We’ll be back March 21 with more on communications pieces.

							<h2>VVSG Public Comment Period</h2>
														<p><strong>VVSG public comment period now open</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) four sitting Commissioners unanimously voted to publish the proposed Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 (VVSG) Principles and Guidelines in the Federal Register for a 90 day public comment period, after which comments and feedback on the proposed document will be compiled and presented to the Commissioners for discussion and consideration.</p>
<p>“Today’s unanimous vote demonstrates the Commissioners’ shared commitment to taking this next important step in consideration of the proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines. The EAC looks forward to holding hearings on these Principles and Guidelines soon and we encourage the public to provide their feedback on the proposed guidelines,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks, who joined Vice Chair Christy McCormick, Commissioner Ben Hovland and Commissioner Donald Palmer in supporting the measure.</p>
<p>The proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines will be published in the Federal Register in accordance with sections 222(a)(1) and 222(d) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. They will appear in the Federal Register for a period of 90 days. Separately, upon the completion of the VVSG 2.0’s accompanying Requirements developed by NIST and the EAC, those accompanying Requirements will also be subject to public review and comment, including distribution to the EAC’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), Standards Board and Board of Advisors. This review and comment period will take place prior to consideration and implementation by the Commission.</p>
<p>VVSG are a set of Principles, Guidelines and Requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems meet required standards. Some factors examined under these tests include functionality, accessibility, accuracy, auditability and security capabilities.</p>
<p>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandates that EAC develop and maintain these requirements as well as testing and certifying voting systems. On December 13, 2005, the EAC unanimously adopted the 2005 VVSG, which significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities for individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. The 2005 guidelines updated and augmented the 2002 Voting System Standards, as required by HAVA, to address advancements in election practices and computer technologies. These guidelines were again updated by the EAC’s Commissioners on March 31, 2015. These guidelines are voluntary. States may decide to adopt them entirely or in part prior to the effective date.</p>
<p>The structure of the new VVSG reflects modifications proposed by the election community, EAC, NIST and the TGDC, which is comprised of election officials, voting system manufacturers, disability experts, cyber security experts, technology experts, and other key election stakeholders. The new guidelines are a high level set of principles that will be supplemented by accompanying documents that detail specific requirements for how systems can meet the new guidelines and obtain certification. The supplemental documents will also detail assertions for how the accredited test laboratories will validate that a system complies with those requirements.</p>
<p>Last Spring, the EAC convened its advisory boards to review and comment on the adoption of the newest version of the voluntary guidelines, VVSG 2.0. Both Boards recommended that the EAC adopt VVSG 2.0. Today’s unanimous Commissioner vote occurred less than two weeks after a quorum of Commissioners was restored at the EAC.</p>

<p><strong>Democratic leaders of the<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressional-panel-seeks-documents-georgia-voting-practices/nW2GipsXCxPlpo1qROGjML/"> U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee</a></strong> have sent letters to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger seeking documents related to the state’s “exact match” law, the consolidation of polling sites and long lines that were reported at the polls on Election Day in 2018. “The Committee is particularly concerned by reports that Georgians faced unprecedented challenges with registering to vote and significant barriers to casting their votes during the 2018 election,” the letters stated according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Committee members—Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) gave the Georgia officials until March 20 to provide the documentation. Raffensperger confirmed he received the letter and said his office “looks forward to an open dialogue and a thorough process.”</p>
<p><strong>Oops. Budget writers in Idaho are scrambling to find $2 million</strong> to hold the state’s 2020 presidential primary after Secretary of State Lawerence Denney<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article227183579.html"> forgot to include the money in his budget</a>. In 2015 the Legislature approved a bill requiring the state to hold a presidential primary and pick up the costs. The first covered primary was in 2016. According to the Idaho Free Presse Denney said it simply “slipped through the cracks.” &#8220;This is in the actual budget, so I think from here on out, here every four years it will show up, so I don&#8217;t think it will fall through the cracks,&#8221; Denney said according to the paper. &#8220;We will notice from here on out.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>If you made a Venn diagram of election geeks and baseball lovers</strong>, the intersection would probably be pretty great, which is why we bring you this story about a plan Major League Baseball is considering to<a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26150351/mlb-all-star-election-day-planned"> create an Election Day for All-Star voting</a>. According to ESPN, under the proposed plan, the standard online voting would take place starting this year. Upon its completion, the top three vote-getters at each position in each league would be on the ballot on Election Day, and whichever players received the most votes on that single day would determine the All-Star starters. We’re down with this, as long as voting fans are provided an I Voted sticker after casting their ballots on Election Day. Psst…opening day is three weeks from today!</p>

She was 85. According to The Oregonian, Paulus was a member of the Legislature, Oregon’s secretary of state from 1977 to 1985, her party’s nominee for governor in 1986 and the state’s elected superintendent of schools for two terms in the 1990s. Under Paulus’ leadership, Oregon, implemented statewide vote-by-mail. She also fought for a fair election in Wasco County when an organization tried to bus in homeless people to vote. “She blazed trails for women here,” Senate President Peter Courtney said. “She was a founding member of the Oregon Women’s Political Caucus and helped push the Equal Rights Amendment in Oregon.” Her autobiography is entitled<a href="http://osupress.oregonstate.edu/book/only-woman-in-room"> “The Only Woman in the Room,”</a> which was often the case during her years in politics. She is survived by daughter Liz Paulus; son Fritz Paulus and his wife Jennifer Viviano and their son Will; and her sister Gerri Pyrch and brother Paul Petersen. A public memorial service will be held in Salem at Willamette University’s Smith Auditorium on April 27.</p>

Goodro was first elected in 1976 and ended his term as clerk in 1999. “When overseeing elections, it took a long time before my election officials came around to accepting me and my way of doing things compared to Dick,” current Clerk Ann Webster told the Addison Independent. “I was reminded frequently that I did not do things quite like Dick and that he even would sing songs or do a little dance to entertain them during slow periods at the elections. He even told jokes, at which I was a big disappointment.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office is out with its cost estimate to implement<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-03/hr1.pdf"> H.R. 1</a>, the For the People Act of 2019.</p>
<p>In honor of Women’s History Month and the impending 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, Rep. Andy Kim has introduced the<a href="https://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/20190304/kim-introduces-alice-paul-voter-protection-act"> Alice Paul Voter Protection Act</a>. The bill, specifies that it is unlawful for anyone to hinder or prevent another person from registering or aiding another person in registering. Doing so would be punishable with a fine and up to five years in prison, according to a draft copy of the bill. The measure also encourages states to establish best practices to protect voters’ rights and encourage registration and participation in elections, including posting relevant information at polling places and voter registration agencies, training poll workers and election officials, and publishing educational materials related to voting rights and laws.</p>
<p>Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Georgia) has introduced the<a href="https://lasentinel.net/congresswoman-lucy-mcbath-introduces-election-official-integrity-act.html"> Election Official Integrity Act of 2019</a> that would prevent chief state election officials from participating in federal campaigns and prohibit the use of official authorities to affect elections. It would make it unlawful for these officials to serve on a campaign committee, be involved with campaign fundraising, or use their official authority to affect the result of a federal election.  It would also require these election officials to recuse themselves if they or their immediate family members run for office in an election they would otherwise oversee.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Three senators have filed<a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/289614-bill-statewide-election-reform"> SB 1386</a> that would require standardized ballot design, create guidelines on notification procedures for rejected ballots and set up rules on the cure process for ballots with missing or mismatched signatures. The bill was<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article227083879.html"> approved</a> by the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee and will head next to Senate President Bill Galvano who has the discretion to send it before the full chamber or other committees.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The Senate Ethics Committee, by a 7-5 vote, approved a bill that will replace Georgia’s<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/bill-for-new-georgia-voting-machines-clears-senate-committee/au9H9ftivrRUSRS9BMZjWI/"> aging voting system</a> with a $150 million electronic voting system that features ballot-marking devices.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Several<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/03/heres-whats-not-passing-the-hawaii-legislature-this-year/"> election-related bills</a> that would have lowered the state’s voting age to 16, would have moved the state to a top-two primary and would have restored voting rights to felons were deferred and are therefore dead for this session.</p>
<p>Other<a href="https://www.hpr2.org/post/house-unveils-election-reform-package"> election reform bills</a> that were approved by the House and now move to the Senate include automatic recounts, all-mail elections and automatic voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> A bipartisan effort that would ensure<a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/bipartisan-bill-uniformly-count-mail-ballots-advances#stream/0"> absentee ballots</a> that get mailed in time are counted in a consistent way is moving forward in the House. The bill requires counties to pay for and use the same barcode system for absentee ballot envelopes. The bill would take effect in 2020.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee has approved a bill that would automatically<a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/03/06/felon-voting-rights-restoration-clears-iowa-house-panel/"> restore voting rights for ex-felons</a> who have completed the terms of their sentence. If approved by the Legislature, it would go before the voters in 2022.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/iowa-polls-would-close-one-hour-earlier-in-statewide-elections-under-senate-bill-20190306">Senate Study Bill 1241</a> would: create a uniform polls closing time, 8 p.m., prohibit state-owned buildings other than county courthouses from serving as early voting sites, change the deadline for absentee ballots to be in the office on Election Day, not just in the mail, require election officials to verify signatures on absentee ballots and college students would be given a form that would ask whether they plan to live in or outside Iowa upon graduation, and those who indicate they plan to live outside Iowa would be removed from the voter registration list.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Senate Bill 34, which would have<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article227094764.html"> made the secretary of state a symbolic</a>, non-voting member of the state board of elections and stripped the secretary of any day-to-day authority over its staff has failed in a House committee after two Republicans joined Democrats in voting against it. However, Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer (R-Georgetown) attached an<a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2019/03/06/republican-bill-yank-power-away-grimes-advances/3081150002/"> amendment</a> to another House bill that would ultimately make Grimes, and all future secretaries of state, nonvoting member of the state board of elections.</p>
<p>House Bill 325, which has cleared the House, would prohibit voters who<a href="https://www.wtvq.com/2019/03/05/voter-bill-advances-kentucky-senate/"> switch parties</a> on or after December 31st immediately preceding a primary election from voting in the upcoming primary. New voters who register to vote after December 31st must stay registered with the same party until the following primary in order to vote in that election.</p>
