							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Contra Costa County Elections’ star turn on ‘reality TV’</strong><br />
<em>Broadcasting live on Facebook is an opportunity for more transparency</em></p>
<p>By The<a href="https://www.contracostacore.us/"> Contra Costa County Elections</a> Team</p>
<p>The tension was high as all eyes focused on a single die. A tied election hung in the balance.</p>
<p>Larry Enos, a two-term incumbent in a tiny irrigation district, needed to roll at least 14 to keep his seat. He took the 20-sided die and calmly tossed it onto the table. As the final roll came to a stop, spectators looked on in anticipation. Our staff confirmed the die showed a 20, securing Enos’ win.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ContraCostaElections/videos/1883011188412861/"> made-for-TV moment</a> played out in our office lobby and was simultaneously broadcast on Facebook Live for all to see. It was gripping reality TV. It’s not surprise that it’s our most viewed video to date since the spectacle of the event—breaking a tie!—and the unique Dungeons and Dragons die drew national and international<a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1072629075213074432"> news coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Armed with just smartphones and tablets, our office crafted and shared a range of visuals showing our November 2018 preparation and post-election canvass activities. The concerted and creative use of videos and images helped our messages reach more people and made it easier for them to understand the process.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to provide more avenues to showcase how we do business,” said Joe Canciamilla, Contra Costa County Registrar of Voters. “Videos and photos provide information to residents in a way that is simple to follow.”</p>
<p>Last fall, our office highlighted real-time activities, from a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ContraCostaElections/videos/2225622367674780/"> time-lapse of vote by mail ballot extraction</a> to a video of<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ContraCostaElections/videos/197363531188101/"> ballots being ironed</a> to flatten creased timing marks.</p>
<p>In addition to presenting the daily work, our posts could be whimsical or fun, and included<a href="https://twitter.com/cocoelections/status/1057737609965842432"> superheroes</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/cocoelections/status/1065398843297026048"> emojis</a>, and<a href="https://twitter.com/cocoelections/status/1068645155933048832"> GIFs</a>. Tone was important and varied based on the message. For example,<a href="https://twitter.com/cocoelections/status/1063553068275445760"> results updates</a> were brief and clear, but other posts could be an entertaining<a href="https://twitter.com/IClerkUVote/status/1051988236640219136"> exchange with colleagues</a>. These platforms allow us to make personal connections with voters. Unlike the expected formality of a press release, our personality can shine through, which helps humanize the work.</p>
<p>“We wanted to liven it up and give those following our social media accounts something to look forward to,” Canciamilla said. “One of the best parts is that our team could show their family and friends exactly what they were doing. It became a source of pride for them.”</p>
<p>While we welcome all to observe the process, a limited number of people actually visit our facilities during an election. Still, voters want to know what happens to their ballot after they drop it in the mail or leave the polling place.</p>
<p>“We’ve always tried to be transparent, but in the past this kind of information has been limited to those who are aggressively hunting for it. Now, with these visual platforms, everyone can understand what’s happening as it’s happening,” Canciamilla said.</p>
<p>One of our most popular posts<a href="https://twitter.com/cocoelections/status/1060333295844524032"> showed the rainbow of vote by mail ballots</a> we received from various jurisdictions and explained how we return them to the correct California county for counting.</p>
<p>Community members offered<a href="https://twitter.com/Becca_Barrett/status/1055885331130572800"> kudos</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/mrtobias50/status/1060232711548264448"> praise</a> for our efforts to pull back the curtain and show the inner workings of the democratic process.</p>
<p>We initially expanded our use of social media in 2015 and began using videos to share information, including livestreaming poll worker activities on Election Day.  Our<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd73ZubO0VOyJVcoOdBcubg/videos"> YouTube channel</a> hosts everything from<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFs87N-W6Qc"> a movie trailer</a> for a special election to a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WpjEpwMcpM&amp;t=45s"> training video</a> on late-breaking poll worker procedures. Our latest production is an invitation to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me4AOYJ0E-c"> fall in love with vote by mail</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to explore what audiences are interested in knowing more about and will keep an eye on the most effective social media platforms to deliver the message.</p>
<p>“We feel that we’ve only scratched the surface as far as what we can do. We’re optimistic that we can continue to improve and use innovative ways to tell our story,” Canciamilla said.</p>
<p>(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: This week’s story marks the fourth and for now final piece in our series on the important role that communications play in an elections office. Previously we’ve heard from Alton Dillard of the Denver County Clerk and Recorder’s Office on<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/02-21/"> Communications 101</a>, Kurt Sampsel of the Center for Technology and Civic Life on<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/02-28/"> What makes an effective elections website</a> and a piece on the importance of<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/03-21/"> branding</a>.  In the not-so-distant past we’ve also covered<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2017/10-19/"> effective uses of social media</a>. Elections officials wear a lot of hats and not all of them are fortunate enough to have a dedicated comms staff person so our hope with this series has been to give you some easy (and hopefully free) tips on how to effectively communicate with the public and the press.)</p>

							<h2>VVSG Public Comments</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) four sitting Commissioners unanimously voted to publish the proposed</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf?fbclid=IwAR33Zx8yw13uW7T6uoJr8wZwYFOswqIC7tdbjHOfavjGuZATR366h28H-48"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 (VVSG) Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the</span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Federal Register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a 90 day public comment period, after which comments and feedback on the proposed document will be compiled and presented to the Commissioners for discussion and consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s unanimous vote demonstrates the Commissioners’ shared commitment to taking this next important step in consideration of the proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines. The EAC looks forward to holding hearings on these Principles and Guidelines soon and we encourage the public to provide their feedback on the proposed guidelines,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks, who joined Vice Chair Christy McCormick, Commissioner Ben Hovland and Commissioner Donald Palmer in supporting the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines will be published in the Federal Register in accordance with sections 222(a)(1) and 222(d) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. They will appear in the Federal Register for a period of 90 days. Separately, upon the completion of the VVSG 2.0’s accompanying Requirements developed by NIST and the EAC, those accompanying Requirements will also be subject to public review and comment, including distribution to the EAC’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), Standards Board and Board of Advisors. This review and comment period will take place prior to consideration and implementation by the Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VVSG are a set of Principles, Guidelines and Requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems meet required standards. Some factors examined under these tests include functionality, accessibility, accuracy, auditability and security capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandates that EAC develop and maintain these requirements as well as testing and certifying voting systems. On December 13, 2005, the EAC unanimously adopted the 2005 VVSG, which significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities for individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. The 2005 guidelines updated and augmented the 2002 Voting System Standards, as required by HAVA, to address advancements in election practices and computer technologies. These guidelines were again updated by the EAC’s Commissioners on March 31, 2015. These guidelines are voluntary. States may decide to adopt them entirely or in part prior to the effective date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure of the new VVSG reflects modifications proposed by the election community, EAC, NIST and the TGDC, which is comprised of election officials, voting system manufacturers, disability experts, cyber security experts, technology experts, and other key election stakeholders. The new guidelines are a high level set of principles that will be supplemented by accompanying documents that detail specific requirements for how systems can meet the new guidelines and obtain certification. The supplemental documents will also detail assertions for how the accredited test laboratories will validate that a system complies with those requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Spring, the EAC convened its advisory boards to review and comment on the adoption of the newest version of the voluntary guidelines, VVSG 2.0. Both Boards recommended that the EAC adopt VVSG 2.0. Today’s unanimous Commissioner vote occurred less than two weeks after a quorum of Commissioners was restored at the EAC.</span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>Sens Amy Kobuchar (D-Minnesota), Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) and Gary Peters (D-Michigan) have<a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/election-security-voting-machines-klobuchar-letter/"> sent a letter</a> to the three largest voting system vendors demanding more transparency about their plans to improve their products not just for 2020, but beyond.</p>
<p>“The integrity of our elections is directly tied to the machines we vote on — the products that you make,” says the letter according to <em>CyberScoop</em>. “Despite shouldering such a massive responsibility, there has been a lack of meaningful innovation in the election vendor industry and our democracy is paying the price.”</p>
<p>Also this week, Matt Masterson, a senior advisor to the Department of Security told <em>CNET</em> that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) is<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/election-security-in-2020-means-a-focus-on-county-officials-dhs/"> doubling down</a> on its efforts to secure the 2020 election cycle. Masterson told the publication that CISA’s focus will be on local election authorities.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Voters in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma were surprised recently</strong> when they received letters from the county elections board asking them to confirm their registration<a href="https://www.mcalesternews.com/news/local_news/election-board-letters-seek-updates/article_ae3f1f70-7a63-54e2-9d8c-580c54994598.html"> and include their official 911 address</a>. Election Board Secretary Cathy Thornton told the <em>McAlester News-Capital</em> that it’s the elections board way of updating the records for many voters who live in rural areas and may have initially registered using rural routes or highway contract routes. When the county moved to a 911 system many of those rural routes were renamed which has lead to returned mail when the elections office has sought to contact voters. The county sent out about 2,400 letters.</p>
<p><strong>Following the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</strong> in Parkland Florida, students who survived the shooting rallied people, especially young people, across the country to register to vote and by many accounts, more young people than ever before voted in the 2018 midterms. But<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/parkland-youths-ballots-were-rejected-at-much-higher-rate-than-state-average-in-november-election-research-finds/2019/03/24/1745cdc8-3c31-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html?utm_term=.544cef8f2385"> did their votes count</a>? According to an analysis by Daniel A. Smith, chairman of the political science department at the University of Florida, about 1 in 7 mail-in ballots by college-age voters in Parkland was rejected. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, Smith discovered that15 percent of mail-in ballots submitted by Parkland residents between ages 18 and 21 were never counted in the midterm election, far exceeding the statewide average. A spokesman for the Broward County Supervisor of Elections said he could not comment on Smith’s findings “unless and until” the office reviewed his data and methodology.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s only taken five years, but finally, Lake County, Indiana has</strong><a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/lake-county-s-precinct-consolidation-saga-comes-to-an-end/article_f5f04bd5-fb27-51a7-b964-21047b42f13a.html"> pared down the number of precincts</a> in the country from 523 to 364 in time for the May municipal primary. It all began back in 2014 when the Legislature ordered the county to pare down the precincts. The largely Democratic county balked at the order from the Republican-controlled Legislature. When the Indiana Election Commission failed to adopt a consolidation plan, the secretary of state issued a plan in 2018, which the county rejected. Further back-and-forth ensued until a final plan was adopted last week. Under the final plan, nearly all of the consolidated precincts have at least 1,000 registered voters, according to figures provided to The Northwest Times. In some cases, three precincts were merged instead of two.</p>
<p><strong>This week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced a competition</strong> to<a href="https://www.13abc.com/content/news/Ohio-looks-to-students-for-new-I-Voted-sticker-507629981.html"> create a new statewide “I Voted” sticker</a>. The contest is open to all Ohio students in grades 6-12 and a winner will be chose by, you guessed it, a vote, which will be open to all Ohioans. The contest runs until April 28.  Arlington County, Virginia is also embarking on<a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/arlington/arlington-election-officials-unveil-decal-competition/article_17a6530c-4efe-11e9-9e8c-e77c0d7321d8.html"> their own search</a> for a new and unique “I Voted” sticker. The Arlington Electoral Board is partnering with the Arlington Artists Alliance to run the competition. Submissions, from any Arlington resident, are due April 12. A selection committee will then winnow the field with the final decision being left up to a public vote. We here at electionline are very excited to see both the Ohio and Arlington winners and hopefully add one of each to our collection (hint, hint).</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Gov. Greg Ducey has signed a bill into law that will require early voters casting a ballot at a countywide voting center to<a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/gov-ducey-signs-bill-requiring-identification-for-early-voting"> provide the same forms of ID</a> that they would have to show if they voted at the polls on Election Day.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, a bill that would automatically remove voters from a<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/840641/arizona-bill-remove-people-early-voting-list-advances"> permanent early voting list</a> if they miss two consecutive elections passed the House Elections Committee on a party-line vote.</p>

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> PCB SAC 19-01 has passed the House State Affairs Committee. Under the proposal, Floridians would be able to<a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article228249504.html"> fix signature problems</a> on their vote-by-mail and provisional ballots until two days after elections, and supervisors would be able to mail domestic vote-by-mail ballots earlier to voters, between 40 days and 28 days before elections. The bill also legalizes ballot selfies.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> By a 22-12 vote, Bill 270, which will make sure public schools are available to serve as<a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/local_news/bill-to-ensure-public-schools-are-available-for-elections-passes/article_7304b2a6-50d5-11e9-b7cf-6f3f01d73282.html"> polling places</a>, has been approved by the Senate. If signed by Governor Brad Little, the bill would go into effect in July 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Sen. Ram Villivalam (D-Chicago) has introduced legislation that would give any registered voters who casts a ballot in a general election a<a href="https://www.ilnews.org/news/state_politics/illinois-lawmaker-proposes-tax-credits-for-voting/article_f9fb34b0-4eff-11e9-9b55-db42924e4fa7.html"> $25 state tax credit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> A Senate committee has rejected an amendment that would have required<a href="https://www.washtimesherald.com/news/effort-to-track-absentee-ballots-rejected-by-senate/article_af14f6c4-4be4-5461-9240-218c0ac9211d.html"> tracking numbers</a> on all absentee ballot envelopes. Senators opposing the amendment questioned the Postal Service’s ability to provide the service.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The House has approved House File 692 which mandates all 99 counties to use ballot tracking from the U.S. Postal Service for<a href="https://www.tribuneledgernews.com/extra/news/ballot-tracking-bill-gets-green-light/article_91ac8c4d-5028-5e64-bae2-17c85169124b.html"> absentee ballots</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Senate has unanimously approved Senate Bill 104 which would allow towns to<a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/New-Hampshire-Secretary-of-State-towns-come-to-agreement-on-town-meeting-snowstorm-procedures-24437011"> postpone and reschedule elections</a> due to poor weather conditions or other emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey:</strong> By a 77-0 vote, the Assembly has approved a bill that will allow counties to use<a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/reynolds-jackson-verrelli-karabinchak-bill-permit-e-poll-books-elections-clears-full-assembly/"> e-poll books</a> to check-in voters at polling places.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Gov. Michelle Lujuan Grisham has signed Senate Bill 672 into law which allows for<a href="https://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/governor-signs-senate-bill-672-same-day-voter-registration/5294328/"> election day registration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The Senate has killed a bill that would have given legislators a say before counties change<a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Senate-stops-bill-giving-legislators-input-for-voting-district-changes-507705991.html"> legislative district boundaries</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> State Sen. Elder Vogel Jr. has introduced legislation to create a<a href="https://www.timesonline.com/news/20190325/state-sen-vogel-bill-creates-election-law-advisory-board"> Pennsylvania Election Law Advisory Board</a> to consider possible statutory changes and other issues, such as emerging election technology.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Rep. Stephanie Klick (R-Fort Worth) has introduced<a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/politics/cleaning-up-voter-databases-removing-ineligible-felons-focus-of-new-legislation/287-bf5be334-e8d8-4112-b3bd-c458462f8fc7"> House Bill 3576 and House Bill 3578</a>. House Bill 3576 makes it mandatory for counties to update their voter registration databases—current law says the “may” do list maintenance, the legislation would change that to “shall”. And under House Bill 3578 district courts would determine the final order of felony conviction on an individual to directly notify the secretary of state’s office that a person is no longer eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, Under House Bill 1419<a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20190325/house-considers-expanding-voting-eligibility-to-felons-on-parole"> felons on parole or under supervision</a> would regain their right to vote.</p>

Ralph Northam has<a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/governor-northam-vetoes-bills-that-would-restrict-voting-access/291-d6b5bdf3-580d-4db1-bbd8-93209182157b"> vetoed two elections-related bills</a>. House Bill 2764 would have required anyone who assists a voter with a registration application, or collects applications  to provide their name, number and information about the group they are working/volunteering for. Northam also vetoed Senate Bill 1038 that would have required registrars to verify the name, date of birth and social security matched information on file with the Social Security Administration.</p>
