														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Natalie Adona</strong><br />
<em>Democracy Fund’s Adona returns to her roots in local elections</em></p>
<p>By  M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4486" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-09-27-at-8.55.24-AM.png" alt="" width="282" height="344" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-09-27-at-8.55.24-AM.png 282w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-09-27-at-8.55.24-AM-246x300.png 246w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px" /></p>
<p>Every election geek has their story for how they got started in the field. For Natalie Adona, it was doing poll worker training in San Francisco in 2008.</p>
<p>Following her foray in to local elections, Adona, who is the Senior Research and Learning Associate for the Elections Program at the<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, went on to work at the<a href="https://www.fairelectionscenter.org/"> Fair Elections Legal Network</a> and<a href="http://www.projectvote.org/"> Project Vote</a> before coming to Democracy Fund.</p>
<p>While at Democracy Fund, Adona’s  primary interests were in election administration, with a particular legal research emphasis on the use of strict precinct requirements in provisional voting.</p>
<p>“Natalie has worked to promote and expand the study of election science and systems thinking to improve voting in ways that have left their mark. From initiating the first public survey of election officials in more than a decade, to promoting collaboration from foundations on research, to driving greater diversity in the political science field through the ‘Women Also Know Stuff’ initiative, Natalie has used research to promote a better system of elections in this country,” said Adam Ambrogi, director, Elections, The Democracy Fund. “I am glad she will be taking those skills and using them to promote elections and serve voters directly, and thank her for her years of service to Democracy Fund’s election team.”</p>
<p>Now Adona is getting back to her roots and is headed west to serve as the assistant clerk-recorder  in<a href="https://www.mynevadacounty.com/695/Registrar-of-Voters"> Nevada County, California</a>. But before she packed up the U-Haul she sat down for one of electionline’s infamous Exit Interviews.</p>
<p>Good luck Natalie!</p>
<p><em><strong>After being a local election official, then on the advocacy side with Democracy Fund, why have you decided to go back to being a local election official?<br />
</strong></em>My first real job in local elections was as a poll worker trainer for the City and County of San Francisco. Then candidate Obama was running for president for the first time and Proposition 8 was on the ballot, the California citizen-led initiative that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But for me, politics was not what made the work exciting. Rather, I really loved interacting with poll workers and explaining the voting process to the public. When I wasn’t training poll workers, I soaked up all I could about election administration, whether it was learning about warehouse operations, sifting through old election materials, being part of the call center team, participating in canvass—basically, every single process between registration and the audit. I was a natural born election geek!</p>
<p>At the same time, the nation was facing the worst economic recession in recent history. As many who’ve worked elections, I started out as a temporary employee. While I managed to find elections work beyond November, the 2008 financial crisis meant that there would be no permanent work in local government for the foreseeable future and temporary positions would get even more competitive. I was extremely disheartened because I felt like I found my calling but was being forced down another path.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I held onto my stubborn belief that I could control the direction I’d go. Unfortunately, competition for work got so bad that I had to look outside of California. Leaving my family, my friends, and everything I knew remains one of the toughest choices I’ve ever made. My expectation was that, through enough schooling, hard work, and persistence, someday I’d be able to go back to working in local elections. So, I highlighted my growing experience in elections research, which took me to Montana and then to Washington, DC. Through it all, I never forgot about how much I loved serving voters.</p>
<p>It took me over 10 years to come full circle, and I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m so happy and excited to come back home to the people I love and to serve California voters once again! I’ll be serving as the Assistant Clerk-Recorder for the County of Nevada, California (not to be confused with the state of Nevada, though the County does border the state line)!</p>
<p><em><strong>H</strong><strong>ow do you think your time working for the Democracy Fund will help inform your work as a local election official?<br />
</strong></em>I definitely know more now than I did when I first started—as one would expect, but I never could have pictured how much I’d learn. Working in a DC-based philanthropy gave me a bird’s eye view of elections processes happening all over the country, as well as the people and organizations that work toward improving elections. I would not know as much about election policy, research, advocacy, or the resources available for election officials if I’d never been with Democracy Fund and the fine people that make up the Elections Program team.</p>
<p>While all this knowledge has obvious benefits (and I plan to use that knowledge to the fullest extent possible), I admit that I feel a lot of pressure to get it all right the first time around. Thankfully I’ll be working with a great team of people in Nevada County! I’ve also been lucky enough to get to know some of the country’s foremost elections experts and I hope that they’ll be glad to lend a helping hand when needed!</p>
<p><em><strong>You have worked with academics, grantees, and election officials. How have you navigated those different audiences? How would you recommend they best learn to work together?<br />
</strong></em>Navigating different audiences is not always easy, especially when you work with people as passionate as the election geeks I’ve met! That was definitely a learning curve for me. In those difficult-to-navigate moments, I reminded myself that my “true north” is the voter and my “map” is the elections process. I can only hope that in all my interactions with the folks I’ve talked to, they understand that my primary concern is in making elections understandable and accessible for voters and my main goal is to make sure that the voter feels empowered to participate.</p>
<p>For the future, I hope that academics, grantees, and election officials will continue the process of building trust with each other. I hope that they all continue to create space for stakeholders to have honest, productive conversations and encourage newcomers to participate. Some good examples where this is happening include the Election Science, Reform, and Administration conference, the NASS Advocacy Breakfast, and the Language Access Summit. The more you can invite folks into these spaces—especially those who haven’t had the chance to access these opportunities—the better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there a question not on the new LEO survey that you wish someone would ask locals, and how would you answer</strong> <strong>that?<br />
</strong></em>Good one! If I could add one question, I would ask for their opinions about whether election officials ought to be elected, appointed, or chosen in some other manner. The public opinion work that I’ve done with the Reed College team finds that the public prefers to elect their local election officials in nonpartisan contests. It’d be great to know what LEOs think about this important topic and the extent to which their opinions mimic the public’s.</p>
<p>And how would I answer that question? If forced to choose, I’d have to agree with the public on this one—especially on the issue of nonpartisanship, which is incredibly important to me. But it’s a hard question—“ought to” implies a judgment call on what process is better, and I can’t say that I really know which option produces the highest levels of voter confidence (assuming that’s what’s meant by “better”). On one hand, elections offer an opportunity for the public to hold election officials accountable, which is critical given the election official’s role in democracy. On the other hand, the potential for real or perceived conflicts of interest arise when the person in charge of overseeing elections processes also appears as a candidate on the ballot. The direct election of election officials and—importantly—the steps that they take to mitigate conflicts of interest is a somewhat (if not altogether) unique phenomenon in public administration that’s worthy of further study.</p>
<p><em><strong>In research that you helped lead you identified that only 5% of respondents did not identify as being Caucasian. Now you are going to be a leader as a local election official yourself- can you talk about representation and diversity within the election official community— and what that means to you?<br />
</strong></em>Thank you for asking! Yes, I was quite taken aback by that finding—but not because I thought we’d see the opposite trend. Rather, I thought that there would have been a change between the time that the Congressional Research Service conducted similar research over 10 years ago and today. There wasn’t. I also think it’s important to recognize that elections appear to provide paths to leadership for women—the majority of respondents to the Democracy Fund-Reed College survey were also female. Again, that finding was not different from the CRS surveys conducted so long ago.</p>
<p>As many who read electionline.org know, election officials create rules that have the potential to impact the voter experience, whether good or bad. Election officials deal in high stakes and are oftentimes blamed for problems, sometimes rightfully but other times without regard to any exculpatory details. Given the increasingly diverse electorate, I think it’s important to have a serious discussion about the apparent lack of racial diversity in elections leadership and what that might mean to voters and to the future leaders in the profession. This deserves more nuanced conversation than I have time for here—but I will say that it’s worth talking about the body of research showing that passive and active forms of representation in government have the potential to lead to more equitable administrative decision making. I find this conversation especially compelling now because I am entering into a position that’ll allow me to help shape the next generation of election administrators. In that role, I will endeavor to work with people who are knowledgeable, passionate, and have the ability to recognize how their decisions impact others. I believe that this part of my job will be best accomplished by inviting a diverse set of perspectives into our tight knit elections community.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the one thing you&#8217;ll miss most about Democracy Fund and what&#8217;s the one thing you&#8217;re most looking forward to getting back into local elections?<br />
</strong></em>I was afforded a lot of opportunities to participate and am thankful for the time I spent with Democracy Fund. I’m thankful for my team (which includes the Democracy Fund and Reed College), all of whom bring so much experience to their jobs and are amazing people. I had the opportunity to invest in innovative organizations and people who’ll no doubt continue to add tremendous value to the elections community. I got to know a cohort of election scientists who blow me away with their intellect and passion for research. I also had the great privilege of access—the standout for me was attending the pilgrimage from Montgomery to Selma with John Lewis and other members of Congress on the 52nd anniversary of the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>When I get back to local elections, I’m most looking forward to sharing the wealth of knowledge I’ve managed to accumulate over my time in DC (spoiler alert: I’m already doing that!). When your audience includes local election officials, it’s hard to get information to everyone. While I can’t promise to change California politics, I can play a role in making sure that my community of peers knows more about the wonderful research and projects that are available for election administrators, as well as the people behind those ideas. And I’ll have fun doing it!</p>
<p><em><strong>You started out as an election administrator, took the academic route to philanthropy, and are now returning to administration. Is there a ninja movie with a plot line that mirrors your path?<br />
</strong></em>First of all, anyone who really knows me knows that I love martial arts movies and know more about them than your average person. A marital arts movie that features elections? That would be pretty amazing! What would a movie like that be called? Way of the Intercepting Punch Card Ballot? The 36th Voting Booth of Shaolin? 47 State Senate Candidates? (Those election geeks who know martial arts movies would actually get those jokes. Is that you? Talk to me!)</p>
<p>Second of all, never did it ever cross my mind that there would be philanthropies that cared about election administration, nor that I’d find election experts in philanthropy. The idea that any person or organization would invest in democracy was all brand new to me. I’m glad I could be part of it!</p>
<p>Third and last, I agree that my career path has been pretty unconventional. I actually didn’t really start in elections—I spent the better part of my 20s working professionally in community theatre as an actor, dancer, and teacher. In my late 20s I decided it was time to get my Bachelor’s degree in political science, so I put myself through Cal and got one. In my mid-30s, I put myself through school once again and enrolled in a joint JD/MPA program at American University. As I was figuring out what the heck to do with myself after law school, I met Rob Ritchie of FairVote and he told me of an internship with a new program called Democracy Fund and said I should consider applying. Longest. Internship. Ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us something embarrassing about Paul Gronke that no one already knows.<br />
</strong></em>Haha! Excellent. (Touches fingertips together and sits back in seat like<a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/8fen5LSZcHQ5O/giphy.gif"> Montgomery Burns</a> from The Simpsons.)</p>
<p>I’m totally kidding. The truth is, there’s nothing I know about Paul that people don’t already know. But I’ll share my two reactions:</p>
<p>Short answer: Mr. Outdoor Recreation has never been to Yosemite. He and I both know that he should feel embarrassed by that.</p>
<p>Long-ish answer: Paul is one of the most kindhearted people I know and a great mentor. (This isn’t a secret but deserves to be said because it isn’t said enough.) The first time I ever worked with Paul, he strolled into our office grinning ear-to-ear, proudly holding a homemade apple pie he carried with him on the airplane (accompanied by a story about his refusal to use McCormick’s cinnamon spice, which I found both frustrating and hilarious) and some beer (presumably from some local brewery ‘cause that’s how he rolls). I was struck by his unfiltered honesty, his passion for teaching, and his West Coast “work hard, play harder” attitude. I knew right then and there that he was someone I’d enjoy working with. And I was right! You’re the best Paul (and if you’re reading this:<a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/Itrkk5dvZLgeA/giphy.gif"> https://media.giphy.com/media/Itrkk5dvZLgeA/giphy.gif</a> )</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The House Judiciary Committee</strong> held a</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/house-committee-looks-to-pave-over-election-security-potholes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on election security last week. Kathryn Boockvar, the acting secretary for the Pennsylvania State Department and Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft were among the witnesses. Chairman  Jerry Nadler (D-New York) noted that there is no getting around the imperative to tighten election security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our adversaries are agile and technologically advanced. We must be too,” Nadler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</strong> on Monday</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/30/mcconnell-2020-election-security-012116"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warned against foreign interference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in U.S. elections, threatening that nations seeking to meddle in the 2020 races will “have a serious problem” on their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m convinced we&#8217;re ready for 2020,” he continued. “Any foreign country that messes with us is going to have a serious problem in return.”</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut:</strong> According to Connecticut Public Radio, the secretary of the state’s office has referred Coventry’s Republican registrar of voters to the State Elections Enforcement Commission. The referral stems from errors that</span><a href="https://www.wnpr.org/post/misadvised-and-misled-actions-coventry-registrar-could-warrant-primary-probe"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced this month’s primary election to be pushed back a week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “[The secretary of the state’s office] referred this to SEEC because the error that was made was sufficiently serious so as to keep an otherwise qualified candidates off the ballot through no fault of their own, and required a lawsuit and a judge’s order to fix,” said Gabe Rosenberg, the communications director for the secretary of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Connecticut, Judge Barry Stevens is allowing a lawsuit seeking a new</span><a href="https://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/fairfield/judge-to-allow-lawsuit-seeking-new-bridgeport-mayoral-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bridgeport mayoral primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that absentee ballot manipulation seemed to swing the election for the incumbent.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Following weeks of outreach</strong>, Ohio recently</span><a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190930/vast-majority-of-180000-ohio-voters-purged-because-they-didnt-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purged about 182,000 voters from their rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to T<em>he Columbus Dispatch</em>, 158,000 of those, around 87 percent, were removed because the voter had not cast a ballot in the last six years. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office said those registrations could be duplicates, belong to deceased voters or those who have moved but didn’t notify the U.S. Postal Service. According to the <em>Dispatch</em>, the analysis sheds light for the first time on the reason most voter registrations are purged in Ohio. Far more voter registrations were purged under the more controversial supplemental process, which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld as legal in a 2018 decision. Although concerned about the number of people removed from the rolls under the supplemental process, Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters. But she said “we now understand the purge process better than ever” because LaRose required more reporting by county boards of elections than past administrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advocates for ex-felon voting rights</strong> in Florida are not happy with how the</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article235664777.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state voter registration form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is addressing the issue. According to the <em>Miami Herald</em>, the form still has the same language it has always used about felony convictions: “If you have been convicted of a felony, or if a court has found you to be mentally incapacitated as to your right to vote, you cannot register until your right to vote is restored,’’ reads the online and print form used to register voters across the state. However, following the passage of Amendment 4, the state added this line below it: “pursuant to s. 4 , Art. VI of the State Constitution.” “Nobody understands what that legal gobbledygook means,’’ Liza McClenaghan, state chair of Common Cause Florida, one of several groups that have asked state officials to update their forms to reflect the changes to state law told the paper. “It is confusing.” Sarah Revell, spokeswoman for the agency, told the <em>Herald/Times</em>: “The language you cite is carried over from the previous voter registration form and the form is currently in rulemaking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>One of the hardest jobs for an election administrator</strong> is to find</span><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article235501092.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suitable polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve voters. When Johnson County, Kansas had to recently move a polling place to a Catholic Church from a private school, the county ran into issues. According to the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, but many fear the move to the creates a conflict, citing the church’s stance against homosexuality. One candidate is a parishioner at the church, and his wife is a teacher at the parish school. His opponent is openly gay. “I don’t have a problem with it being a Catholic church … but when you move it to a church that one of the candidates attends, and when the church has a history of being anti-LGBT, the optics themselves are eyebrow-raising,” said state Rep. Brandon Woodard, a Democrat from Lenexa and one of the first openly gay legislators in Kansas. “Do I think the election office did this maliciously? No. But I would hope they would consider the optics of this.” The Johnson County Election Office has relocated five polling places for the November general election, spokeswoman Lori Sand told the paper. She added that the county is moving away from using schools as polling locations for security reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>At hearing of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Elections</strong> held in Arizona, tribal leaders told members of Congress this week voting rights of Native Americans in Arizona are routinely suppressed by a slew of requirements and practices, such as photo ID laws, a scarcity of polling places, and lack of language accessibility. Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Stephen Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community proposed a</span><a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2019/10/01/native-american-voting-rights-suppressed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Native American Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that, according to <em>Cronkite News</em>, could ease some of the burdens by removing the requirement for photo ID, adding translators for Native speakers, being less restrictive with mail-in ballots and opening more polling places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There’s been a lot of consternation in Pennsylvania</strong> over the required purchase of new voting equipment before the 2020 election cycle, but <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> has a story this week about one</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw6odlNp7_8"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happy accident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with regard to</span><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philly-polling-place-accessibility-voters-disabilities-20190928.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Philly’s new voting equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the paper, the city’s new voting machines can’t be carried up stairs due to their size and weight and therefore, the city has been forced to find polling locations that allow the machines to be rolled up ramps, which will in turn make every city polling place accessible to voters with mobility issues. “If that’s what’s going to drive the change, I’ll take it,” Michelle Bishop, a voting-rights specialist at National Disability Rights Network told the paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The numbers are in and they are pretty impressive</strong>. It’s estimated that</span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-voter-registration-day-shatters-record-for-off-year-with-an-estimated-400-000-voters-registered-300929381.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 400,000 citizens registered to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or updated their voter information as part of National Voter Registration Day. According to NVRD, this unprecedented number is more than three times the previous record set for an &#8220;off-year&#8221; focused primarily on local elections, and far outpaced expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alaska Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a</span><a href="https://www.usccr.gov/press/2019/09-26-Alaska-Native-Voting-Rights-Report-PR.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Alaska Native voting rights last week. The report evaluates Alaska’s efforts to meet legal requirements from a 2015 settlement on language access and examines the potential impact of adopting a vote-by-mail system in the state. Among the committee’s findings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an unequal distribution of election equipment among urban and rural polling stations in the state, and election equipment in rural locations lacked privacy;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Division of Elections has no procedures in place to assess the effectiveness of poll worker training or outreach worker training; and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Division of Elections was considering a vote-by-mail system, there were no studies examining the impact of vote by mail on Alaska Natives, limited English proficient voters, geographically and linguistically isolated communities, and voters who receive mail exclusively by P.O. Box.</span></li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: According to Government Executive, the legislation authorizing $250 million for election security spending does not include much new funding for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Under the Senate legislation, EAC would receive $11,995,000 in 2020, about $2 million more than it received in 2019, however $1.5 million of that would be transferred to the National Institute for Standards and Technology to develop voluntary state voting system guidelines, and another  $2.4 million is designated for the EAC’s relocation to new offices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland:</strong> Several new</span><a href="https://marylandreporter.com/2019/09/29/hundreds-of-new-maryland-laws-take-effect-tuesday-oct-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took effect this week in the Old Line State including same day registration—available in 2020, a law mandating that an election service contractor must provide specified notice of ownership, investment, or avenues for influence that a foreign entity may hold in the business and a new law allowing students in grades six through 12 to serve as Election Day pages and help judges at polling places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Red Wing City Council unanimously voted to begin the process of putting</span><a href="https://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/ranked-choice-to-appear-on-red-wing-ballot/article_78300268-e067-11e9-a9cb-eff48c7f18a1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the 2020 general election ballot. According to <em>The Post Bulletin</em>, Council President Dean Hove told the audience at the city council meeting that the city has been talking about ranked choice for about six years, specifically at Charter Commission meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Gov. Chris Sununu has vetoes House Bill 315 that would have removed New Hampshire from the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program. “House Bill 315 would impose unreasonable restrictions on the Secretary of State’s ability to determine the best voter registration information-sharing arrangement for our state,” Sununu wrote. “New Hampshire should maintain the Secretary of State’s flexibility on this issue and trust him to make the best decision for the people of New Hampshire, as he has done for over 40 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Assembly members Nick Chiaravalloti (D-31), Angelica Jimenez (D-32) and Annette Chaparro (D-33) are sponsoring a bill that would bring</span><a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/three-hudson-assembly-members-are-trying-to-bring-ranked-choice-voting-to-new-jersey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Garden State. Bill A-5205 would establish ranked choice voting for all elections including presidential elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in New Jersey, Assemblyman Ronald Dancer (R-Plumstead) has introduced a bill that would allow residents to register to vote through the state Division of Fish and Wildlife and its official “license agents” which are businesses where people get licenses for boating, fishing and hunting.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed legislation into law</span><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Cuomo-greenlights-extended-voter-registration-14469961.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extending the deadline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for registered voters to switch their party in advance of partisan primaries. The new law scraps the previous Oct. 11 deadline, giving voters until Feb. 14 to switch parties and still vote in the state&#8217;s primary elections in April and June. The bill was approved by the state Legislature in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The House has approved Senate Bill 250 which would require jury excuses to be sent to the state board of elections so officials can</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/bill-to-scrub-voter-rolls-based-on-jury-excuses-clears-house/18672850/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remove non-citizens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the voter rolls. Under the bill, clerks of court would forward the elections board the names of people who get out of jury duty by saying they&#8217;re not U.S. citizens. Those names would be published online, and election officials, the bill states, &#8220;shall use this information to conduct efforts to remove names from its list of registered voters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> The House has voted 90-0 to approve Senate Bill 52 which would create the</span><a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/ohio-lawmakers-vote-set-cyber-reserve-fight-prevent-attacks/Jrkj318mtfi9NeLRMijETJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio Cyber Reserve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the command of the Adjutant General, the team of experts would protect against attacks on critical infrastructure and government systems. The legislation also calls for the secretary of state to be added to the Homeland Security Advisory Council. The secretary of state would be mandated to appoint a chief information security officer, who would be a resource for county boards of elections. The bill also calls for regular audits of elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors has unanimously backed a resolution proposed by Sup.

The lawsuit alleges that California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and the director of California&#8217;s DMV, Steve Gordon, have violated the National Voter Registration Act and that Padilla has &#8220;forsaken his duty to ensure that non-citizens&#8221; are kept off voter rolls. She told the <em>Sacramento Bee</em> the lawsuit does not allege voter fraud but that the state is neglecting one of its duties as outlined by the voter act.</span></p>

While Seidlin left in place photo ID, he did strike down as unconstitutional the law&#8217;s provision that would have prohibited election officials from issuing a voter ID card based on Iowa driver’s license or nonoperator’s identification card records, as well as a provision that would have allowed election officials to dispute the signature on a registered voter&#8217;s application.

The suit seeks public voter data gathered by state and county election boards months after they received subpoenas from U.S. Attorney Robert Higdon&#8217;s office in a secretive voter fraud probe. Both the Wake County Board of Elections and the State Board of Elections are named in the suit.</span></p>

The cybersecurity measures we have in place through OIT, combined with the immediate actions taken by our Information Services team, left us with minimal impact from what could otherwise have been a far more serious incident,” Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said. The Central Voter Registration database was not impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: According to a report in <em>Gotham Gazette</em>, with under a month to go before early voting makes its debut in New York, the New York City Board of Elections has yet to acquire the 10,000</span><a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/8816-board-of-elections-shift-to-electronic-poll-books"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e-poll books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to make early voting at vote centers possible. The publication found that the Board of Elections had moved to adopt a $19.1 million contract with KNOWiNK for the devices, but no contracts have been submitted to city or state fiscal oversight entities. No one from the Board of Elections responded to the publication’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Pennsylvania’s voter registration database was down for several hours last Friday preventing local elections officials from processing voter registration applications and prevent residents from applying online for absentee ballots.

							<h2>Request for Information</h2>
														<p><strong>IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group Request for Formation</strong></p>
<p>On August 15, 2019, the IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group released a<a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b8fa6c_112b6b0bdc764533816b57dfdb3481b9.pdf"> paper</a> that detailed the commitment of voting systems manufacturers to the development and implementation of corporate Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Programs.</p>
<p>The white paper also noted the value of Crowd-Sourced CVD programs and discussed potential challenges in applying such programs to the elections industry and noted that the SIG would create a Request for Information to solicit feedback on how crowd-sourced CVD programs could be implemented in the elections industry.</p>
<p>The IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group seeks public input, comments and suggestions on the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to manage a crowd-sourced CVD program on systems that are designed to be closed, isolated, and disconnected from the Internet including stand-alone embedded systems?</li>
<li>How to ensure that those engaging in a crowd-sourced CVD program are not nefarious actors seeking sensitive information that can then be used in attacks against the elections’ infrastructure?</li>
<li>How best to ensure the confidentiality of the researcher findings so that vulnerability announcements are disclosed simultaneously with a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments and input should please be sent to cvd@it-isac.org by October 21, 2019</p>
