														<p><strong>New kids on the block</strong><br />
<em>Meet the new chief elections official in 13 states</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline</p>
<p>A new year means new faces in 13 state election offices around the nation.</p>
<p>They come from a variety of backgrounds including county elections offices, social work, and the business community. They are lawyers and Army veterans. Many have served in their state Legislatures.</p>
<p>As they ramp up their new offices, there are plenty of new faces, but also some faces familiar to the elections world serving as staff or on transition teams.</p>
<p>They’ve got big plans for their offices in the coming years, but before we get to that, let’s meet the 13 newest kids on the block.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3514" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Alaska-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alaska</strong> — Lieutenant Governor</span><a href="https://ltgov.alaska.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kevin Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is in charge of elections in Alaska, although the bulk of the work and oversight is done by the Division of Elections. As part of his duties, Meyer gets to appoint who runs the Division of Elections and in December he appointed</span><a href="https://ltgov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2018/12/lt-governor-meyer-appoints-gail-fenumiai-as-elections-director/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gail Fenumiai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve as director. Fenumiai has 17 years of experience with the Division of Elections and previously served as its director from 2008 to 2015. “Gail has the skills, wisdom, experience and judgement to restore Alaskan’s faith and trust in our elections process and that is exactly what we pledge to do.” said Meyer.<br />

Thurston previously served as the state’s Commissioner of Lands for two terms. Shortly after his election, Thurston told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette that one of his top priorities in office would be streamlining the office itself. &#8220;The governor wants to consolidate and streamline,&#8221; Thurston</span><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/nov/12/set-to-take-new-post-thurston-shares-id/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the paper. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s just good government, and every constitutional office and state agency should be doing that.&#8221; According to the paper, Thurston said his first order of business will be to develop a management structure that supports his style and encourages a healthy work environment.</span></p>

In an interview with the Orlando Sentinel, Ertel said being secretary of state is “a very big job that goes beyond just elections….” But, he acknowledged, “the most high-profile thing we’ll really focus on in the beginning is help establish trust in the [election] process among Florida voters.” On his first full day in office as secretary, Ertel was spotted putting together is own office chair so we look for him to be very hands on!</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman is hitting the ground running</strong> and that includes a proposal to<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/New-Harris-County-Clerk-pitches-countywide-voting-13514113.php"> move Texas’ largest voting jurisdiction to a vote center system</a>. “Life gets in the way; you’ve got to pick up the kids, or go to another job,” Trautman said at her office Monday. “But if people actually had a choice of when and where to vote, I think you would see a big difference in turnout.” According to the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, 52 Texas counties, including some neighboring Harris, use vote centers. Harris County currently uses 46 vote centers for two weeks of early voting. Trautman told the paper she would begin by using those 46 sites as well as neighborhood-based polling sites and the review the resulting data to determine where and how many vote centers to have.</p>
<p><strong>On Tuesday, nearly 1.5 million formerly incarcerated residents of the state of Florida</strong> became<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/article224079435.html"> eligible to register to vote</a> and hundreds, if not thousands took advantage of their right on day one. We’re not going to lie, some of the stories coming out the Sunshine State on Tuesday were truly heartwarming. Registrants cried and hugged after they filled out their forms. They were greeted by bands and cheering supporters. All over the state, supervisors of elections came out of their offices and stepped up to the counter to greet the new voters and help them fill out their forms. Some counties even gave out “Future Voter” stickers! There were great stories from counties all over the state, here are just a few:<a href="https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190108/rights-restored-felons-register-to-vote-in-alachua-county"> Alachua</a>,<a href="https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190108/voter-registration-for-former-felons-begins-in-bay-county"> Bay</a>,<a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20190108/felony-convictions-wont-stop-jacksonvilles-newest-voters"> Duval</a>,<a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2019/01/08/florida-amendment-4-restores-voting-rights-1-4-million-ex-felons/2508531002/"> Escambia</a>,<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/01/08/this-is-history-to-me-felons-in-tampa-register-to-vote-on-first-day-of-amendment-4/"> Hillsborough</a>,<a href="https://www.news-press.com/story/news/crime/2019/01/08/former-felons-register-vote-after-amendment-4-restored-voting-rights/2419411002/"> Lee</a>,<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/01/08/im-part-society-florida-ex-felons-register-vote-after-regaining-right/2507409002/"> Leon</a>, <a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/article224078525.html"> Manatee</a>,<a href="https://www.ocala.com/news/20190108/they-couldnt-wait-to-register-to-vote-in-ocala"> Ocala</a>, and<a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190108/singing-and-applause-as-ex-felons-register-to-vote-in-sarasota"> Sarasota</a>.

<p><strong>The<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190103/franklin-county-commissioners-fund-elections-board-for-january-but-without-raises"> battle of wills</a> in Franklin County, Ohio</strong> between the county commission and the board of elections continues. Last year, the board of elections refused to authorize money to pay for GOTV efforts around early voting. County commissioners pushed back and forced the BOE to do limited advertising. Now,  the commission has approved funding for the BOE through the end of January, but will not approve any additional funding, including cost-of-living and merit raises for elections board employees until an MOU is signed regarding advertising. “Either they’re going to agree to voter education or I’m not going to vote for this,” said Commissioner John O’Grady according to the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>. “I’m not going to play this game all year.”</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the South Carolina State Election Commission</strong> which is<a href="http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2019-01-04/News/State_Election_Commission_Celebrates_50_Years.html"> celebrating 50 years</a> of overseeing elections in the Palmetto State. The General Assembly approved legislation creating the independent agency in 1968 with the first SEC taking office on January 1, 2019. Prior to the creation of the state election commission, the state’s elections were overseen by a secretary of state. In 50 years, the election commission has only had four executive directors. The current state commission consists of five board members, an executive director and 26 staff. “With the level of technology in elections today, the cyber security required to protect the state’s election infrastructure, and the public scrutiny of the election process, the election environment has changed dramatically,” current executive director Marci Andino said in a statement. “But through all that, we’re still working towards the same goal, making sure voters are able to register and vote and have confidence the process is fair and impartial.”</p>

														<p>The<a href="http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx"> Economist Intelligence Unit</a> released its<a href="http://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index"> Democracy Index 2018 report</a> on January 9. Beginning in 2006, the index has scored and ranked 165 countries and 2 territories based on 5 categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. The report characterizes the United States as a “flawed democracy,” ranking 25th overall in 2018 (down from 18th place in 2008). The 2018 report gives the highest scores to Norway, Iceland, and Sweden and the lowest to North Korea, Syria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, respectively. Canada (tied for 6th), Uruguay (15th), Costa Rica (20th), and Chile (tied for 23rd) are the only countries in the western hemisphere to rank ahead of the United States in the 2018 index.</p>

							<h2>FVAP Update</h2>
														<p><strong>New voter registration/ballot request and back-up ballot forms on Federal Register now</strong></p>
<p>The current draft Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms are available for review and comment on the Federal Register until January 22 at regulations.gov.</p>
<p>The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) requires that the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) prescribe two standard federal forms. Both forms require review and public comment every three years. The FPCA (SF-76), can be used to register to vote, request an absentee ballot and update contact information, while the FWAB (SF-186) serves as a backup ballot if the voter doesn&#8217;t receive a requested ballot in time.</p>
<p>FVAP leveraged feedback from voters and election officials to update the forms to clarify their use and requirements.</p>
<p>The revised forms simplify instructions for voters and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification of National Guard classification for use of the form.</li>
<li>Alterations to the list of states requiring additional information.</li>
<li>Clarification of registration and ballot request instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form usability is an essential part of the redesign process. To help ensure the form is easy and intuitive from a voter&#8217;s perspective, please download and complete it as if you were registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot or voting the FWAB. Provide usability comments via the links below.</p>
