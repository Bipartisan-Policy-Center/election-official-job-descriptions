							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Off to the races</strong><br />
<em>Three top state elections officials on the ballot in 2019</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>During this “off-year” election, the top elections official spot is up for grabs in three states, well two states and a commonwealth. Here is a brief look at the candidates up for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong><br />
Incumbent Secretary of State Allison Lundergan Grimes (D) chose not to seek a third term so Republican<a href="https://michaelgadams.com/"> Michael Adams</a> will face Democrat<a href="https://www.heatherfrenchhenry.com/"> Heather French Henry</a> to be the commonwealth’s new secretary.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4535" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael_Adams-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" />Adams became the first member of either side of his family to earn a college degree when he graduated from the University of Louisville. He later earned a JD from Harvard Law. For the last 11 years Adams has served as the general counsel for the Republican Governor’s Association.</p>
<p>According to Adams, who served on the Kentucky State Board of Elections before stepping down to run for secretary of state, he’s running to make it<a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2019/05/05/kentucky-secretary-state-candidates-michael-adams/3632480002/"> easy to vote and hard to cheat</a>. He is seeking to reduce wait times for early voting, make voting by mail easier and allow change of party registration to be available to residents until the voter registration deadline. He also supports enacting a photo ID law, would work to clean up the voter rolls and improve cybersecurity.</p>
<p>“The time has never been more important to have someone in this office that can restore credibility and tranquility to this office,” Adams told the Murray Ledger &amp; Times. “And if there is any office in Kentucky politics that needs to be above politics and above suspicion, it’s the chief election official because this person has to be fair and neutral and objective and play it straight, and we haven’t had that in this office the last eight years.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4536" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/French-Henry.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="248" />French Henry is a graduate of the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art &amp; Planning. She has served both Governor Steve Beshear (D) and Governor Matt Bevin (R) as the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs. During her year of service as Miss America 2000 French Henry focused on veteran’s affairs, particularly homeless veteran’s. In 2002, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/739"> Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance Act</a> was approved by Congress.</p>
<p>French Henry<a href="https://www.supportheatherfrenchhenry.com/platform"> supports</a> making voting more accessible by extending polling hours on Election Day, she is a proponent of restoring voting rights to ex-felons who have completed the terms of their sentence, she hopes to partner with K-12 teachers on civics education and she believes it’s important to partner with the state’s county clerks.</p>
<p>French Henry supports a voter ID law, but believes that free IDs should be made available to low-income residents.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana</strong><br />
Incumbent Secretary of State<a href="https://www.keepkylesos.com/"> Kyle Ardoin</a> (R) failed to clear the 50 percent plus on threshold in Louisiana’s recent election so he will face<a href="https://www.gwensos.com/"> Gwen Collins-Greenup</a> (D) in a runoff on November 16. The two first faced each other in a 2018 special election for the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4537" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ardoin.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="275" />Ardoin was first appointed secretary of state in May of 2018 and then won a special election for the seat later that year. He is now running for his first full four-year term. Before being appointed in May 2018 Ardoin has served as first assistant for eight years.</p>
<p>“I am not running for this office as a stepping stone. I love this office and I have dedicated nearly a decade of my life to it. I know what I’m doing and we do this job well,” Ardoin writes on his campaign website.</p>
<p>“People come from around the world to see how Louisiana elections work. With upgrades to our voting machines coming and those who are threatening to disrupt our election process, we need a steady hand in the secretary of state’s office. I have the experience needed to keep this office on course.”</p>
<p>Ardoin serves on the National Association of Secretaries of State’s Elections Committee and has testified before the U.S. Election Assistance Commission seeking more funding for state election officials to secure elections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4538" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Collins-Greenup.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="266" />Collins-Greenup began her career as a legal secretary at Louisiana Department of Labor. She later served as a deputy clerk of court at East Feliciana Parish Clerk of Court and a director at Baton Rouge City Court.</p>
<p>She earned her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Accounting from Liberty University, and her Master of Divinity degree in Professional Ministries from Liberty University Baptist Theological Seminary. She earned her Juris Doctor cum laude from Southern University Law Center.</p>
<p>Collins-Greenup<a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_321d8124-da36-11e9-881d-fb8db960d856.html"> told</a> The Advocate the lack of post-election paper audits and the state’s failure to have new machines in time for major election cycles should be major concerns.</p>
<p>“We didn’t get them, so I’m looking to replace our outdated voting machines,” she said. “My platform is pretty simple – protecting Louisiana.”</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong><br />
Longtime Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann (R) is running for the lieutenant governor’s position leaving the secretary’s seat open. Democrat<a href="https://johnnydupree.com/"> Johnny Dupree</a> will take on Republican<a href="https://www.michaelwatson.ms/"> Michael Watson</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4539" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dupree.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="183" />Dupree has earned a bachelor’s and master’s from the University of Southern Mississippi and a doctorate from Jackson State University. He entered public service in 1987, when he was appointed to the Hattiesburg Public School Board where he served as secretary and president.  In 1991, he was elected to the Forrest County Board of Supervisors where he served for 10 years before running for mayor of Hattiesburg in 2001. He served as mayor of Hattiesburg from 2001 to 2017.</p>
<p>As part of his<a href="https://johnnydupree.com/issues/"> platform</a>, Dupree would like to expand voter education including developing a secretary of state election certification program for college credit; increase access to the polls by, among other things allowing voter registration up to 15 days before an election; and increase overall voter turnout by moving state elecitons to the same year as federal elections.</p>
<p>Watson was first elected to the state senate in 2007 and has twice been re-elected. Watson earned a B.B.A. and a J.D. from the <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4540" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Watson.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="212" />University of Mississippi. His professional experience includes working as an attorney. According to Ballotpedia, Watson’s<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Michael_Watson_(Mississippi)"> top three priorities</a> if elected are: 1. To ensure clean, fair and secure elections. 2. To minimize the regulatory burden on businesses. 3. To move the DMV under the Secretary of State&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Watson is a strong proponent of the state’s voter ID law and would work to implement proof-of-citizenship laws in the Mississippi.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to make sure<a href="https://www.michaelwatson.ms/why-im-running"> only citizens</a> of the United States are eligible and allowed to register and vote in Mississippi. To accomplish this, I will work to follow a path successfully taken by other states and support legislation to allow the Secretary of State&#8217;s office to run a newly registered voter’s identification information through security screens to confirm legal citizenship. &#8220;</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Last week the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent letters</strong> to<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/16/group-seeks-remove-thousands-wisconsins-voter-rolls/3986444002/"> approximately 234,000 voters that the commission believes have moved</a>. The letters told the recipients to update their voter registrations with their new addresses if they have moved or to notify the commission if they have not moved. If the voters do not act, their voter registrations will be suspended after April 2021, according to the commission. However a group of residents, represented by the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty have now filed a complaint with the election commission demanding that if the commission does not get a response from the voters within the next month, that the registrations be canceled. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the commission&#8217;s executive director, Meagan Wolfe, disputed the complaint&#8217;s claim that the commission must remove voters from the rolls within 30 days of sending them a letter based on data from ERIC. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s really important to note that the ERIC process, there are no statutes that govern that process as far as how that (voter) list maintenance happens,&#8221; Wolfe told reporters. &#8220;State law requires that the State of Wisconsin join ERIC, but it does not specify how this maintenance is conducted.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>No postage necessary.</strong> Oregon election officials recently announced that it will once again send out<a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-elections-restore-postal-subsidy-newly-registered-voters/"> prepaid postage return envelopes</a> to Oregonians who are automatically registered to vote at the DMV. According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, earlier this year the Legislature cut $75,000 from the budget for automatic voter registration—about the amount of what it costs to send the forms to newly registered voters that allows them to choose a political party. Voting rights groups warned that if voters potentially had to pay 55 cents in postage to return a form to register within a party, that could run afoul of federal law. They noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states can’t charge a processing fee for registering, including in party primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Never under estimate people’s passion about voting</strong>. The Will County, Illinois clerk’s office recently had to call the sheriff’s office after a voter called the clerk’s office to complain about his<a href="https://abc7chicago.com/mokena-man-made-death-threat-to-clerk-after-learning-his-polling-place-changed-police/5612670/"> polling place being changed</a>. According to ABC 7. Leonard Feiner, 69, of Mokena, is charged with disorderly conduct after he called the clerk&#8217;s office about 8:30 a.m. and told an employee he was upset that his polling place had been changed, the sheriff&#8217;s office said. The employee tried to calm him down for about 15 minutes but Feiner became more agitated and allegedly made a threatening statement.</p>
<p><strong>Oops!</strong> After Douglas City, Michigan Clerk Pam Aalderink provided to the wrong filing deadline to the three candidates running and therefore their names will not appear on the ballot and<a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/politics/elections/allegan-county-election/69-0bec67e0-af38-40f6-bb78-6f8778f850c0"> voters will have to write-in their choices</a>. All three candidates are running unopposed. According to 13 On Your Side, since the deadline was missed, under the law, Aalderink says the city is not allowed to publish a list of candidates. Instead, each person has to promote their own candidacy using things like yard signs and social media.  Aalderink says she was out of town at a conference on July 23 when the official deadline passed. The Allegan County clerk and state elections officials are aware of the mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Guam has joined the growing number</strong> of states and the District of Columbia that employs<a href="https://www.kuam.com/story/41193184/motor-voter-registration-will-require-you-to-vote-where-you-live"> automatic voter registration</a>. Implementation of the new system has meant sending out letters to voters to transfer them from one voting district to another because the commission now has their correct home addresses through the territories DMV.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has vetoed SB212 that would have allowed counties and cities statewide to move to a<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Gavin-Newsom-vetoes-bill-to-allow-ranked-choice-14535193.php"> ranked choice voting</a> system. Newsom was a county supervisor in San Francisco when ranked choice voting was approved and he did not support that move. “Ranked choice is an experiment that has been tried in several charter cities in California,”<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SB-212-Veto-Message.pdf"> Newsom said in his veto message Sunday.</a> “Where it has been implemented, I am concerned that it has often led to voter confusion and that the promise that ranked-choice voting leads to greater democracy is not necessarily fulfilled.”</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> The Portland City Council will hold a public hearing next month on a proposed charter amendment to extend<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/10/16/portland-advances-proposal-to-expand-ranked-choice-voting/"> ranked-choice voting</a> to all city and school board elections. That discussion could lead to a citywide referendum in March.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> The Kentucky Democratic Party sued the State Board of Elections, claiming it unlawfully placed 175,000 registered voters on an “inactive” list that might infringe on their right to vote. “After weeks of conversations with the State Board of Elections staff that raised more questions than it provided answers, we determined that we had no choice but to file this lawsuit in order to protect Kentucky voters from facing unfair burdens at the polls,” Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Ben Self said in a statement. A judge has<a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/judge-175-000-inactive-kentucky-voters-reinstated/3979277002/"> temporarily reinstated</a> the voters.</p>

<em>Celebrating Best Practices in Election Administration</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking submissions for its fourth annual national Clearinghouse Awards. Dubbed the “Clearies” for short, the awards provide election offices an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that Act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commission will present awards in the categories of outstanding innovations in elections, improving voting accessibility for voters with disabilities, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. It will also award a special award in 2019 recognizing the most original and creative “I Voted” sticker submitted for consideration. Entries from all sizes of jurisdictions, both large and small, are encouraged to submit their work. All entries must be received by Monday, November 25, 2019. The 2018 winners of the Clearie awards can be found</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-clearinghouse-award-winners-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The EAC Clearie Awards celebrate the innovative and creative approaches that election officials use each day in their work to serve voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “These awards are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices that other election administrators can emulate.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainability</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outreach efforts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-effectiveness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replicability</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating positive Results</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials utilize innovative and resourceful initiatives on Election Day. We want to hear about these outstanding best practices in EAC’s 2019 competition. By incorporating Election Day into the submission deadline, we are able to capture activities implemented throughout the 2018 and 2019 elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</span></p>

							<h2>Request for Information</h2>
														<p><strong>IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group Request for Formation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 15, 2019, the IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group released a</span><a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b8fa6c_112b6b0bdc764533816b57dfdb3481b9.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that detailed the commitment of voting systems manufacturers to the development and implementation of corporate Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white paper also noted the value of Crowd-Sourced CVD programs and discussed potential challenges in applying such programs to the elections industry and noted that the SIG would create a Request for Information to solicit feedback on how crowd-sourced CVD programs could be implemented in the elections industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IT-ISAC Elections Industry Special Interest Group seeks public input, comments and suggestions on the following challenges:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to manage a crowd-sourced CVD program on systems that are designed to be closed, isolated, and disconnected from the Internet including stand-alone embedded systems?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to ensure that those engaging in a crowd-sourced CVD program are not nefarious actors seeking sensitive information that can then be used in attacks against the elections’ infrastructure?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How best to ensure the confidentiality of the researcher findings so that vulnerability announcements are disclosed simultaneously with a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments and input should please be sent to cvd@it-isac.org by October 21, 2019</span></p>
