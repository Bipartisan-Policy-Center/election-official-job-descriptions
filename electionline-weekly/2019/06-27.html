<p><strong>Stewards of Democracy</strong><br />
<em>The views of American local election officials </em></p>
<p>By Natalie Adona, Elections Senior Research and Learning Associate<br />
The Democracy Fund</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4149 size-medium" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stewards-of-Democracy-Front-232x300.png" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stewards-of-Democracy-Front-232x300.png 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stewards-of-Democracy-Front-768x994.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stewards-of-Democracy-Front-791x1024.png 791w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stewards-of-Democracy-Front.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />Local elections officials (LEOs) are the stewards of our democracy, but oftentimes they are left out of important conversations about the future of our elections nationwide. The LEOs from our survey are the chief elections officers in their local jurisdictions. Not to be confused with poll workers, the LEOs surveyed in our new report oversee local election processes and are responsible for ensuring the voting process is fair, free, and secure. Among their many responsibilities, LEOs execute the election laws in their state, make decisions that define the voter experience, and train the permanent and temporary employees that interact with the electorate.</p>
<p>It might be hard to imagine but (depending on how you count) between 7,000-10,000 local election officials manage the front line of elections in the United States. Despite their recognition as the people who run elections, LEOs are often left out of national conversations about reform and may not have a seat at the table when important policy decisions are made at the local, state, or federal levels—decisions that they alone will ultimately implement.</p>
<p><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/stewards-of-democracy/">Stewards of Democracy: The Views of American Local Election Officials</a> details the findings of the Democracy Fund-Reed College 2018 Survey of Local Election Officials (2018 LEO Survey), and is part of our effort to create a space for these stewards of democracy to be heard. The survey is designed to capture the collective experience of officials across the country, and to help us learn more about their perspectives on election administration, access, integrity, and reform. The results should be interpreted as a snapshot of opinion taken in the midst of a competitive midterm election.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 LEOs from across the country responded to our survey. Our survey respondents serve over 81 million registered voters. They manage offices with staffs of one or two in the smallest jurisdictions to over 1,000 employees in the largest (not including poll workers). Our hope is that this report will be the start of an ongoing attempt to elevate LEO’s voices in efforts to modernize and secure American elections.</p>
<p>The report breaks down the findings of the survey into four sections:</p>
<p><strong>Meet Your Local Election Official</strong> – This section provides data on the professional and demographic profile of the typical LEO including LEO workload, years in service, pay, professional training and other demographic information.</p>
<p><strong>Running the 2018 Election</strong> – This section covers findings on 2018 election preparedness including information on resources, staff, meeting the challenges of cybersecurity, and confidence in voter registration list security.</p>
<p><strong>Voter-Centric Elections: Education and Outreach</strong> – This section discusses LEO attitudes regarding accessibility, including voter education and outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Improving Elections Using New and Old Tools</strong> – This section focuses on the adoption of modernization and of technology, such as online voter registration and automatic voter registration systems to improve elections. It also covers our analysis of LEO opinions, in their own words, on how they think elections can be improved, including legislative and policy changes involving voting.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that all the LEOs we surveyed care deeply about their ability to administer elections in an accessible, efficient, and secure fashion. We were particularly moved by how our survey demonstrated LEOs’ dedication to a positive voter experience and to nonpartisan election administration. Respondents in our survey made it clear that they have and will continue to be good stewards of democracy—but resources, staffing, and coordination between state and local officials are areas of concern.</p>
<p>We plan to solicit LEO opinions again, at different times, using different lenses. We hope that our efforts encourage conversations and collaboration with LEOs and lead to reforms that best serve the American electorate—providing policymakers with invaluable insight into the makeup of the election administration field and its evolving needs as it hopefully becomes more diverse in the coming years.</p>

							<h2>EAVS 2018</h2>
														<p><strong>2018 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS)</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4141" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/EAVS-233x300.png" alt="" width="280" height="360" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/EAVS-233x300.png 233w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/EAVS-768x989.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/EAVS-796x1024.png 796w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/EAVS.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) today released findings from the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/2018_EAVS_Report.pdf">2018 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS)</a>, the most comprehensive source of state- and local jurisdiction-level data about election administration in the United States.</p>
<p>“For the last 15 years, the EAVS has played a vital role in helping election officials, policy makers and other election stakeholders identify trends, anticipate and respond to voter needs, and invest resources to improve election administration and the voter experience,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “This year, the EAC was pleased to make several notable improvements to improve the survey’s data quality and completeness and make the survey more accessible and useful to the election community.”</p>
<p>The EAC has taken multiple steps since 2016 to strengthen the EAVS. For example, EAVS Section F questions on voting equipment makes and models were redesigned, resulting in substantially improved data quality. The Statutory Overview was re-named the Policy Survey and given a new format to provide better context for understanding the EAVS data and make it easier to interpret the results and create comparisons across states. The EAC also introduced new questions within the Policy Survey relevant to cybersecurity, including on the functionality of statewide voter registration databases, online voter registration, election failsafe mechanisms, and post-election auditing.</p>
<p>“While election administration across the nation is largely decentralized, this report allows us to better understand election frameworks and operations in each state and most localities,” said Dr. Nichelle Williams, EAC Director of Research, who leads the EAVS. “It also depicts election administration trends over time, such as the increased usage of electronic poll books and increased rates of early in-person voting.”</p>
<p>The EAC contracted with<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/"> Fors Marsh Group</a> to conduct the survey. EAVS Section B, which concerned voting by military and overseas citizens, was administered in partnership with the Department of Defense’s<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/"> Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP).</p>
<p>Some notable findings from the 2018 EAVS include:</p>
<p><strong>Turnout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 120 million Americans, or 52 percent of the estimated Citizen Voting Age Population, voted in the 2018 Midterm Elections.</li>
<li>The nationwide turnout rate was 15.5 percentage points higher than in the 2014 Midterm Election, with some states reporting turnout levels that approached those of a typical Presidential Election.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 211 million persons were reported as registered and eligible to vote in the 2018 Midterm Elections, an increase of 11 percent over the 2014 Midterm Elections.</li>
<li>Nearly 80 million voter registration applications were received between the 2016 and 2018 Federal Elections.</li>
<li>Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs) remained the most utilized method for voter registration and accounted for 45 percent of registrations, an increase of 33 percent over 2014.</li>
<li>Online voter registration is allowed in 39 states and territories, and accounted for 16 percent of registrations in 2018, a six-point increase over 2014. This represented a slight decrease from 2016, when 22 percent of registration applications were processed online.</li>
<li>Nearly half of states have some kind of policy allowing for same day voter registration and more than 800,000 same day registrations were processed during the 2018 Midterm Elections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By-Mail and In-Person Early Voting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Voting in-person on Election Day remained the most-used mode of voting. More than half of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day.</li>
<li>However, by-mail voting was used by a quarter of the electorate in 2018.</li>
<li>Nearly one-fifth voted at in-person early voting sites, a rate that more than doubled since the 2014 elections. In six states, more than half of ballots were cast at in-person early voting sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Military and Overseas Voting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 350,000 Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) voters participated in the 2018 Midterm Elections.</li>
<li>The number of ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters increased by more than 50 percent over the 2014 Midterm Election.</li>
<li>Ballot transmission increasingly occurs electronically rather than through postal mail, while postal mail was the most common mode of ballot return.</li>
<li>Overall, five percent of ballots returned by UOCAVA voters were rejected, most commonly because they were received after state deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polling Places and Poll Workers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Almost one-third of states have vote centers or allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Recruiting adequate numbers of election workers continued to be a challenge for election officials. Nearly 70 percent of responding jurisdictions reporting that it was “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to obtain a sufficient number of election workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Election Technology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nationwide, jurisdictions reported deploying 334,422 pieces of equipment to cast and tabulate votes in the 2018 Midterm Elections.</li>
<li>The most commonly-used equipment types are optical or digital scanners and Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs).</li>
<li>More than 90 percent of election jurisdictions use voting machines that produce some form of paper backup.</li>
<li>The usage of e-poll books among jurisdictions increased by nearly 50 percent between the 2014 and 2018 Midterm Elections. More than a quarter of all jurisdictions used electronic poll books in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-Election Auditing and Recounts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All states have a mechanism for conducting recounts to ensure that ballots were counted correctly.</li>
<li>Most states (78.2 percent) require some kind of post-election audit.</li>
<li>About half of states conduct election audits of voting machines every election.</li>
<li>Only twelve states do not require any type of election audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EAC conducts the EAVS to meet its<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/HAVA.html"> Help America Vote Act of 2002</a> mandate to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information with respect to the administration of federal elections. Additionally, the EAVS fulfills EAC data collection requirements contained in both the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the UOCAVA.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>The House Administration Committee approved the<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/449760-house-panel-advances-election-security-bill-requiring-paper-ballots"> Securing America’s Federal Elections Act</a> in a 6-3 party-line vote. The bill, would establish cybersecurity safeguards, such as prohibiting machines from being connected to the internet in any way and outlawing voting machines from being manufactured in a foreign country. It also authorizes $600 million in funding for the Election Assistance Commission to give to states to increase security standards through the fiscal 2020 financial services and general government funding bill. The House Appropriations Committee approved that spending bill, with the election funds, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Over in the Senate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) the top Democrat on the Rules Committee tried to bring forward an election security bill, the<a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/450334-senate-gop-blocks-election-security-bill"> Election Security Act</a>. The bill would require a paper trail and would provide security grants to the state. The bill was blocked by Sen. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) who has worked with Klobuchar on bipartisan elections legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find myself at odds today with a partner in this … we have worked together in a very nonpartisan way to be able to resolve this issue. I think we still can resolve this and we can actually get a result, but a partisan proposal will not get us an end results where both parties come together and get to resolve this,&#8221; Lankford said from the Senate floor according to <em>The Hill. </em></p>
<p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California) announced this week that Congress will receive an<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/450482-pelosi-congress-will-receive-election-security-briefing-in-july"> election security briefing</a> from administration officials in July.</p>
<p>“Next month we will take further steps to harden our democratic institutions against attacks, and on July 10 we will receive the all-member election security briefing we requested from the administration so we can continue to protect the American people,” Pelosi said during a press conference according to <em>The Hill.</em></p>

							<h2>2020 Candidates on Election Issues</h2>
														<p>This week, as part of her platform, Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) released<a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-to-strengthen-our-democracy-6867ec1bcd3c"> a plan</a> that would create new standards for how federal elections are conducted.</p>
<p>As part of the proposal, intended to expand voting access and strengthen election security, Warren would create a new federal agency, the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-voting-rights.html"> Secure Democracy Administration</a>, the <em>New York Times</em> reports. She would replace every voting machine across the country with modern equipment and would require the use of a uniform federal ballot. She would also impose uniform standards on election rules, requiring all states to have automatic voter registration and same-day registration, early voting and voting by mail.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>This week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose launched a program</strong> that will enlist the help of community and social service groups to find inactive voters who are at risk of being removed from the state’s voter rolls. LaRose is asking all 88 county boards of elections to send the secretary’s office names for a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ohio-elections-chief-taps-advocates-to-find-inactive-voters/2019/06/26/d82a9592-9847-11e9-9a16-dc551ea5a43b_story.html?utm_term=.a856173c7d57"> “registration reset list”</a> that will share with local organizations that work with populations vulnerable to being removed. “I want to partner with some of these community organizations that are, in many cases, better equipped than any government office to actually go out and find people in the communities, because they are local, on-the-ground, grassroots organizations,” LaRose told the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Well this isn’t lucky.</strong> As it currently stands, the Ohio 2020 primary will be March 17 and that has<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2019/06/the-ohio-legislature-set-the-2020-primary-election-for-st-patricks-day-and-that-could-be-a-problem-for-cleveland.html"> officials in Cleveland concerned because the city is known for its large and boisterous St. Patrick’s Day celebrations</a>. Cuyahoga County elections officials noticed the date and have discussed internally the challenges it might create, Anthony Perlatti, director of the board of elections told <em>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>. “We haven’t put much thought into it because we’re kind of hoping it doesn’t happen,” Perlatti told the paper. Initial concerns include polling-place logistics — downtown polling places may have to be closed for logistical and security reasons. There are also concerns about drunk people and parking. “Voting probably will not be the first thing on many people’s minds that day,” Perlatti said. “They’re going to have their day planned out with friends and family, and maybe they’ll be able to squeeze voting in, but who knows.”</p>
<p><strong>It’s not an “I Voted” sticker, but this is a fun story</strong>. A new law in Iowa requires county elections officials to<a href="https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Dubuque-County-creates-county-seal-to-comply-with-new-state-election-law-511759301.html"> print the county seal on vote-by-mail ballot envelopes</a>. Problem is, not all counties have a seal. They may have a logo, but under Iowa code a seal is different and has different requirements. County Deputy Auditor Jenny Hillary told KCRG she spent about 10 weeks creating a seal with other county officials. She said, &#8220;I think a lot of other auditors thought they had a seal too and then when you start reading the Iowa code it says it&#8217;s supposed to have the word &#8216;county&#8217; spelled out or abbreviated (and) the word &#8216;Iowa.'&#8221; An IT worker actually did the design work which saved the county the costs of contracting out the design. The county supervisors approved the seal this week and Hillary said she’s already sent ballots with the new seal to the printer.</p>
<p><strong>Wooo! We’ll take a whole roll of these!</strong> The Manatee County Supervisor of Elections and State College of Florida’s Graphic Design Program teamed up to create a<a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190620/state-college-of-florida-student-designs-i-voted-sticker-for-manatee-county-elections"> new “I Voted” sticker</a> exclusively for the 2020 election year. Students from a graphic design class submitted their creations for Supervisor Mike Bennett’s review. “We will print more than 500,000 stickers for all three elections in 2020,” Bennett said according to the <em>Herald Tribune</em>. “SCF approached us last year asking for an opportunity to create a future ‘I Voted’ sticker. With 2020 being a presidential election year, we thought that would be the best time to showcase a student’s talents to Manatee County voters.”</p>

He was 61. Shubat retired from the board of elections in January after 24 years with the BOE. Before joining the Belmont County BOE, Shubat worked in the secretary of state’s office. “Fortunately for everybody in Belmont County who has an interest in a fair and accurate election process, he graciously agreed to begin working at the Board of Elections here in Belmont County,” BOE Member Michael Shaheen told the <em>Times Leader</em>. “He was always able to navigate the waters so as to be mindful of everyone’s political affiliations and allegiance while always keeping politics out of his job as a director of the board of elections. Board member Robert Quirk told the paper that Shubat was instrumental in instituting new security requirements after the 2016 election. “When he was in charge, there was a feeling that there were going to be no problems,” Quirk said. “You had a tremendous air of confidence … that we were going to get through the elections, and the elections would be fairly-run without difficulty.”</p>
