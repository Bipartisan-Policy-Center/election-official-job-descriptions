														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Minnesota’s Gary Poser</strong><br />
<em>After almost 30 years in elections, “Competent Bureaucrat” is ready to retire</em></p>
<p>Being called a “Competent Bureaucrat” by a major media outlet might not sound like a compliment, but it is something outgoing Minnesota Director of Elec<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3493 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gary-Poser-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gary-Poser-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gary-Poser-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gary-Poser-768x769.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gary-Poser-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gary-Poser.jpg 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />tions Gary Poser is proud of.</p>
<p>And now, after almost 30 years as a “competent bureaucrat” working in the field of elections, Poser is ready to become a most excellent retiree.</p>
<p>Before becoming director of elections in 2007, Poser had more than 17 years of elections experience working in Anoka, Hennepin and Washington counties in Minnesota. He has served on the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>’s Standards Board, chair of<a href="https://www.ericstates.org/"> ERIC</a> and in numerous executive roles in the<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Elections Directors</a>.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;sbeen an honor to work with Gary over the years as part of Minnesota&#8217;s top-notch election team. It will be hard to imagine the state election office without him &#8211; but I know how much he loves his home state and I have no doubt he will absolutely enjoy his retirement,” said Doug Chapin, director of elections research at<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/about/leadership/doug-chapin/"> Fors Marsh Group</a> and University of Minnesota instructor. “Hopefully he won&#8217;t be a stranger, but if I ever need to find him I can always consult the Pierz High School football schedule!&#8221;</p>
<p>Congratulations and good luck Gary!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why have you decided to retire at this time?</strong></em><br />
Because I am eligible to! I’ve completed participating in 17 state general election cycles, which includes 3 statewide recounts and 3 redistricting periods &#8211; I’m ready to retire!</p>
<p><em><strong>What are you most proud of during your time in Minnesota elections?</strong></em><br />
Being able to serve the voters of Minnesota, who continually turnout in high numbers is something I’m very proud of.  There are so many other things from implementing online voter registration, online absentee applications, joining ERIC, expanding absentee and mail ballot modules in our statewide voter registration system, etc.  Obviously surviving the 2008 U.S. Senate Recount was a major accomplishment and actually resulted in the St. Paul Pioneer Press labeling me as a “Competent Bureaucrat” in an article about the upcoming Governor’s recount in 2010.  I don’t know of any other state employee being declared “competent” by a major newspaper, so I’ll go with that as what I’m most proud of.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there anything you were not able to accomplish as director of elections that you really wish you had?<br />
</strong></em>There is always a long list of potential computer-type projects one would like to see accomplished that never quite make it up the priority list based on resources and needing to implement required changes due to law changes first, etc.  More mobile optimization of our election night reporting website would probably be high on that list.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minnesota usually ranks at or near the top of the nation in voter turnout&#8211;do you feel some responsibility for that? Is there (self-imposed) pressure to stay #1?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think there is self-imposed pride in wanting to stay # 1.  The quality of the candidates to make races close and the legal framework of how our elections work are big factors of turnout that are not in our administrative control.  Making sure the we are enacting the laws as they do exist in ways that ease the administrative burdens of our local election officials and making the voter’s experience in the polling place or when voting absentee as positive as possible are the things we can do well so that voter’s continue to return regularly.</p>
<p>We can take responsibility for that part, but “we” includes my staff here at the Office of the Secretary of State as well as all the local election officials who work hard to make that happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s your advice to election officials caught in the middle of fierce, partisan legislative fights like the Minnesota saw on voter ID in 2012?<br />
</strong></em>I think the best election officials can do is to be transparent and fair in how they administer the elections.  The partisan fights need to stay in the political arena and not be brought into how the election itself is administered.  Keep your head down and out of the line of fire.</p>
<p><em><strong>You began your career at the county level before moving on to the state, how important do you think that is, for someone to work in local elections before moving on to the state level, either in the secretary of state&#8217;s office or as the chief elections official?<br />
</strong></em>I think there is a difference between it being helpful versus being important.  Having been at the county level, it was a huge help to me in understanding things from a local point of view and helped me to explain things in ways that were easily understood by the local election officials because I talked the same language.  I think a state director coming in without that experience can still accomplish great things, it takes more time and effort to learn the system from both the state and local perspectives all at once but it can certainly be done. I’m just grateful that I had that experience coming in to the job.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could design the perfect elections system, what would it look like?</strong></em><br />
I don’t think there is a perfect elections system. It needs to meet the needs and wishes of the local community and that varies from state to state and changes over time.  However, I think we spend an awful lot of time trying to get individuals to register to vote when the government already has so much of that data. It would be much more efficient to start with the existing government data and add to it rather than maintaining a completely separate database.  I would definitely support automatic registration efforts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Overall, what innovations would you like to see the elections community work on in the future?</strong></em><br />
I think the immediate future will continue to involve strengthening security around elections infrastructure and finding ways to implement and maintain that infrastructure all the way to the local level.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s next for you?</strong></em><br />
I’m looking forward to hiking in many of the great state parks and traveling the bike trails in Minnesota.  I still need to check off baseball games at more ballparks around the country and will reinvigorate my efforts on my genealogy hobby.  In the elections arena, I hope to explore the possibilities of participating in international observations.</p>

														<p><strong>Seminole County, Florida Supervisor of Elections</strong><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-mike-ertel-secretary-of-state-20181228-story.html"><strong> Mike Ertel</strong> has been named the Sunshine State’s next secretary of state</a>. Ertel has served as the Seminole County supervisor of elections since 2005. In an interview with the Orlando Sentinel, Ertel noted that while the secretary of state has responsibilities other than elections, elections will be the focus at the beginning of his term following the problems some counties faced in November. “We need to instill the best practices to ensure all counties run as well as [those did in November],” Ertel told the paper. “And on a state level, we have to make sure we do what we can do to give counties the tools they need to run great elections.” Congratulations Mike!</p>
<p><strong>Officials in DuPage County, Illinois are working</strong> to determine when, exactly, they will<a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20190102/vote-to-disband-dupage-election-commission-could-be-delayed"> finally disband the county election commission</a> and fold those duties into the clerk’s office. &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for some direction from the clerk,&#8221; Board Chairman Dan Cronin told the Daily Herald. &#8220;I think it makes all the sense in the world to do it on (Jan. 15). I don&#8217;t see any obstacle, but I want to work with the clerk. I want to get this right.&#8221; The last time the county clerk’s office oversaw elections in DuPage was in the 1970s to there are a lot of details to be worked out. New Clerk Jean Kaczmarek had previously indicated she would like to wait until after the April election for the transition. &#8220;I know what I want to do,&#8221; Cronin said. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t know what the clerk wants to do. And I want us to work together.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ouch, this is not good news</strong>. According to an analysis by <em>The Spokesman-Review</em>, almost half of the 5,180 Spokane County, Washington young people between 18 and 25 who registered to vote in 2018<a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/dec/27/almost-half-of-young-voters-who-signed-up-in-2018-/"> didn’t actually bother to cast a ballot</a>. According to the paper, the areas with the greatest number of newly registered voters who didn’t vote were in precincts around the county’s two major college campuses, Gonzaga and Eastern Washington universities. “Young voters have always been a challenge,” Secretary of State Kim Wyman told the paper. It’s the state’s job to provide a secure system to remove barriers to registering and voting, and make sure voters have the information they need, Wyman said. But it’s the job of the candidates and the campaigns, not the state, to increase turnout.</p>

														<p><a href="https://www.electiondataservices.com">Election Data Services</a> released its<a href="https://www.electiondataservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NR_Appor18wTablesMaps-20181219.pdf"> 2018 Apportionment Study</a> on December 19. Based on<a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/estimates-national-state.html"> newly released Census Bureau population estimates for 2018</a>, the study finds that six states would gain an additional seat (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Oregon) or two seats (Texas) in the House of Representatives following the 2020 decennial census and subsequent reapportionment of seats, while seven would lose a seat (Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia). The study includes trend analyses to project additional apportionment changes due to further population changes before 2020. As reapportionment also affects the allocation of Electoral College electors among the states, the study also examines how expected upcoming reapportionment changes would have impacted the outcomes of the past five presidential elections.</p>
<p><a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">National Voter Registration Day</a> issued its<a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/about/2018-report/"> final report</a> on 2018 National Voter Registration Day on December 19. The report finds that National Voter Registration Day partners and volunteers supported the registration of 865,015 people on the holiday (September 25, 2018), including more than 200,000 collected by community partners in the field and more than 600,000 collected by major digital and media partners. Texas experienced the most registrations collected by community partners on National Voter Registration Day (19,469), while California reported the most online registrations (95,872). The report further highlights that a record 4,087 community partners were engaged in the effort, including 145 election offices.</p>

							<h2>FVAP Update</h2>
														<p><strong>New voter registration/ballot request and back-up ballot forms on Federal Register now</strong></p>
<p>The current draft Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms are available for review and comment on the Federal Register until January 22 at regulations.gov.</p>
<p>The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) requires that the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) prescribe two standard federal forms. Both forms require review and public comment every three years. The FPCA (SF-76), can be used to register to vote, request an absentee ballot and update contact information, while the FWAB (SF-186) serves as a backup ballot if the voter doesn&#8217;t receive a requested ballot in time.</p>
<p>FVAP leveraged feedback from voters and election officials to update the forms to clarify their use and requirements.</p>
<p>The revised forms simplify instructions for voters and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification of National Guard classification for use of the form.</li>
<li>Alterations to the list of states requiring additional information.</li>
<li>Clarification of registration and ballot request instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form usability is an essential part of the redesign process. To help ensure the form is easy and intuitive from a voter&#8217;s perspective, please download and complete it as if you were registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot or voting the FWAB. Provide usability comments via the links below.</p>
