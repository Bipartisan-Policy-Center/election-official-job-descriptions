							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Perspective: State of the Military Voter in 2019 and Beyond</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By David Beirne, director<br />
Federal Voting Assistance Program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_4315" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4315" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4315" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-282x300.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="276" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-282x300.jpg 282w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-768x816.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-964x1024.jpg 964w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4315" class="wp-caption-text"><em>David Beirne, director of FVAP.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Director of the U.S. Department of Defense’s <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/">Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP), I help lead the nation’s efforts to ensure that Americans around the world — military members, their families and other overseas citizens — can exercise their voting rights under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work is especially rewarding to me because I’ve been in the field in many different capacities over the years: as a local election official in Florida and Texas, as a representative of election technology companies after the passage of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and as a contributor to the Pew/Google partnership that created the Voting Information Project. All of these roles over twenty years of experience in election administration have given me a deep appreciation for all the people who do the work to make elections happen and a unique perspective on what FVAP does to assist them and their voters worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Election Day is always exciting for the FVAP team, we also look forward to the summer following a federal election because it gives us an opportunity to share our progress with data and analysis from our regular Post-Election Voting Surveys (PEVS) of active duty military, voting assistance officers and state election officials. This year’s PEVS was especially meaningful because it took place a decade after passage of the 2009 The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act which dramatically improved access to registration and absentee ballots for military and overseas voters. FVAP summarized the results in its regular Report to Congress and created a new look at the data called “</span><a href="https://www.fvap.gov/info/reports-surveys/StateoftheMilitaryVoter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of the Military Voter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State of the Military Voter in 2018 found that life for military voters has improved significantly in the last 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4316" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FVAP1-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="521" height="326" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FVAP1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FVAP1.jpg 468w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, challenges remain; in particular, while participation rates among active duty military voters improved from 2014 to 2018, they fell behind increases in domestic civilian participation rates even when you control for demographic differences between the two populations. This represents one of the biggest challenges for FVAP as we are not a Get-Out-The-Vote operation, but one focused on raising awareness of the various absentee voting resources available to these voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, we’re continuing our work to reach those military voters — especially younger and first-time voters — by alerting them to the resources that can help them register and vote, including the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), which doubles as a registration form and absentee ballot request for UOCAVA voters. Only by raising awareness, can FVAP fulfill its mission and support those who have an interest in voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former election official, I know how much state and local election offices want to help their military and overseas voters and how much FVAP relies on their passion for these voters. FVAP will continue to work with those offices to ensure that UOCAVA voters can find and use the information they need to get and cast a ballot in 2020 and beyond. In addition, we’re working with election officials and the Council on State Governments to promote policies that improve the absentee voting process — like Montana’s recent legislation allowing UOCAVA voters to digitally sign registration and voting materials using their secure Common Access Card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also excited about our ongoing efforts to improve the quality of data on UOCAVA voters, particularly a program FVAP is piloting that collects standard data from the states on UOCAVA voting transactions to identify individual drivers for success or failure. Using records of voting transactions, rather than relying on voters’ sometimes imperfect or incomplete recollections, will help us determine how best to serve voters around the world. For FVAP it is important to the voters’ experience to find out if their absentee ballots ultimately were counted or rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we are closely monitoring the current international negotiations regarding the Universal Postal Union and will assist election officials and their overseas voters with understanding any changes in the voting process and will post official guidance on FVAP.gov/UPU as we receive it.  FVAP is working closely with its federal partners to ensure ballots are transmitted as seamlessly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that life for military and overseas voters has improved tremendously in the last 10 years — but as another presidential election approaches, we know there is still work to do. I have great confidence that the state of the military voter — and all Americans around the world — will continue to improve in 2020 and beyond, but only as we continue to work closely with our state and local election officials and support our Voting Assistance Officers across the Armed Services and the State Department.</span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission</strong> recently held an</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2019/0812/eac-to-host-an-election-security-forum-with-representatives-from-government-technology-and-voting-system-manufacturers-and-testing-laboratories-voluntary-voting-system-guidelines-vvsg-election-systems/software-security-cybersecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Security Forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which included secretaries of state and representatives from government and voting system manufacturers and testing laboratories. State officials who spoke — Connecticut’s Denise Merrill and Louisiana’s Kyle Ardoin both stressed the need</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/russian-hackers-town-budgets-windows-updates-election-officials-grapple-realities-n1043211"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more federal funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more clear standards from the federal government. Ardoin and Merrill pointed out while they need more funds and standards, given the diversity of election administration in the country, they also both stressed the importance of</span><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/election-officials-want-security-money-flexible-standards"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more leeway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the federal government in how states spend their allotted funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Brookings has a new survey out</strong> on how Americans feel about the potential</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/08/20/americans-want-federal-action-on-election-security-ahead-of-2020-per-new-brookings-survey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> threat to our democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While the nation seems split on whether or not foreign interference is a threat, they are united on the need for the government to take action. According to the survey, 58 percent believe the U.S. government should provide additional funding to the states to help them upgrade the security of their election equipment, 19 percent do not, and 23 percent are unsure. Sixty percent also think the U.S. government should offer additional technical expertise to the states to help them upgrade their electoral machines, 17 percent do not, and 23 percent are unsure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>While the Senate is still on summer recess</strong>, a conservative group — Republicans for the Rule of Law — is unveiling ads that will run in Kentucky, Florida, Missouri, South Carolina and Oklahoma that the group hopes will urge Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, to</span><a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article234142532.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> push Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a vote, urging them “don’t let Mitch McConnell stand in your way.” The group is also re-airing a 60-second ad that calls on McConnell to act.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>In 2018 <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/precinct-closures-make-comeback-rural-georgia-after-brief-defeat/efuDMWGhOY7R4h5FAQsABL/"> Randolph County</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>, Georgia made headlines</strong> for attempting to shutter seven of nine precincts in the majority African-American county. The county has cited cost-savings as the need to close the polling places. According to The <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the precincts are housed in aluminum buildings that serve as volunteer fire stations and many of those buildings are in need of repair to make them accessible. This week, the board of elections</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/precinct-closures-rural-georgia-approved-county-elections-board/cDHVxWR6F6547qexIsYjNI/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted 3-0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to shut down three overwhelmingly white precincts that lacked accommodations for people with disabilities. The move is expected to save the county $4,500 per election. “The public was more in agreement,” Michelle Graham, a member of the elections board, told the paper. “They gave suggestions about which ones they didn’t want closed, and we listened.” In all, 447 white voters and 54 black voters will be reassigned to other precincts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In addition to announcing new legislation</strong> that he hopes will improve the state’s voter rolls, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced this week that</span><a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190820/larose-says-10000-voters-so-far-avoiding-purge"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearly 10,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who had been contacted through the state’s “Registration Reset” program have taken action to avoid having their voter registration cancelled for inactivity. Advocates are still concerned that there are nearly 225,000 people who may be purged when the Sept. 6 purge deadline arrives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate</strong> turned voting rights activist Stacey Abrams announced the launch of a new voting rights initiation —</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/stacey-abrams-expanding-voting-rights-group-nationally/eeper6tpb1qNSUsZiOkHYJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fair Fight 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — this week. According to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, Fair Fight 2020 is a multimillion-dollar effort to set up voter protection programs in a group of mostly battleground states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Earlier this summer</strong>, we</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/05-30/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> featured a piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about several suffrage exhibits at Washington, D.C. museums, but you don’t have to travel all the way to D.C. to learn about suffrage.</span><a href="http://unothegateway.com/nebraska-history-museum-opens-womens-suffrage-exhibit-to-celebrate-centennial/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nebraska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ratified the 19th Amendment more than a year before it became law, has a new exhibit, “Votes for Women: Nebraska’s Suffrage Story” at the Nebraska History Museum in Lincoln. “Woman Suffrage in North Dakota” recently opened in</span><a href="https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2019/08/new-exhibit-focuses-on-woman-suffrage-in-north-dakota/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heritage Center &amp; State Museum in Bismarck. The fight for suffrage in North Dakota began in 1883 when legislation was approved giving women the right to vote in school elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>An interesting story this week</strong> about Harding County, New Mexico that had had nearly 100 percent voter for the last four election seasons. By comparison, New Mexico had 62 percent overall in 2016. While Harding has just under 500 voting-age residents, it’s still pretty impressive and a fun story. “We know most of the people in the county. Anybody new come in,</span><a href="https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/inside-the-county-that-hit-100-voter-turnout/94387"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’re sending them a registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already,” County Clerk CK Garrison told <em>OZY</em>.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> The push to</span><a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/08/15/california-may-lower-the-voting-age-to-17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lower the voting age</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 18 to 17 passed a key legislative committee last week and may go before the voters to decide. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 4 and Assembly Constitutional Amendment 8 both propose allowing a 17-year-old to vote. ACA 4 would allow them to vote in a primary or special election if they will turn 18 by the general election. ACA 8 would allow a 17-year-old to vote in all elections. If ACA 4 passes it would require voter approval in order to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Illinois:</strong> Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed legislation into law designed to expand voting rights and civic engagement for those in the state’s</span><a href="https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local-news/gov-pritzker-signs-legislation-expanding-voting-rights-rehabilitation-in-criminal-justice-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criminal justice system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SB2090 directs county jails and local election officials to establish a process that allows detainees awaiting trial to cast their ballots during elections. It also directs the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) and county jails to provide a voter registration application and detailed information about their voting rights. House Bill 2541 provides re-entering citizens with a non-partisan civics peer education program within 12 months of discharge from IDOC or Department of Juvenile Justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maine:</strong> A referendum to extend</span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/08/21/petition-to-extend-ranked-choice-voting-in-portland-falls-short/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all city council and board of education races in Portland failed to get enough valid signatures to appear on the ballot in November City Clerk Katherine Jones told the <em>Press Herald</em>. The petitions for ranked-choice voting fell about 400 signatures short of the required number after more than 1,000 were disqualified by the clerk’s office as duplicates or for not matching the names of registered voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Gov. Chris Sununu has</span><a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/sununu-veto-reignites-residence-voting-law-dispute/article_8c5a319a-cf9f-59d3-8788-915f7ab9ee07.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetoed SB 67</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was approved by the Legislature to undo a 2018 law that requires that students and others registering to vote just before the election or at the polls be informed that voting here would trigger the requirement they obtain driving licenses and have their cars registered in the Granite State.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Senate Bill 250 has received tentative approval in the House.
