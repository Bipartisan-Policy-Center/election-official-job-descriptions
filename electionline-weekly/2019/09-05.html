							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>A plus for democracy</strong><br />
<em>Project uses plus codes to help rural Utahans get properly registered</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, armed with about 8,000 images from Google, two staff members for the<a href="https://www.ruralutahproject.org/"> Rural Utah Project</a> set out to determine what those images were…residence, business, out-building, outcropping or shadow.</p>
<p>As part of the<a href="https://vimeo.com/337552064"> Rural Addressing Program</a>, for about three months, the staff members visited every site and determined that about 2,500 of the images spread out all over rural Utah, but largely on the Navajo Nation, were actual businesses and residence that could then be assigned a plus code.</p>
<p>In partnership with Google Plus Codes, the Rural Utah Project is working to create addresses for 70 percent of the registered voters on the<a href="http://www.navajo-nsn.gov/"> Navajo Nation</a> as well as other rural Utah residents who may lack a proper street address.</p>
<p>So what exactly is a<a href="https://plus.codes/"> plus code</a>? Plus codes were created by a group of engineers at Google and give everyone an address that can be used for voter registration, allow for deliveries and get faster access to emergency services. A plus code address looks like a regular address, but with a short code where the street name and number would be. These addresses exist for any location, even for places where there are no roads.</p>
<p>Plus codes are based on latitude and longitude. By using a simpler code system, they end up much shorter and easier to use than traditional global coordinates. Plus codes are free with no licensing fees or other costs and the technology is open-sourced.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4370" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-04-at-2.51.39-PM-300x167.png" alt="" width="521" height="290" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-04-at-2.51.39-PM-300x167.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-04-at-2.51.39-PM-768x427.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-04-at-2.51.39-PM-1024x569.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-04-at-2.51.39-PM.png 1914w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" />TJ Ellerbeck, executive director of the Rural Utah Project said his organization had been working on voter registration and other civic engagement on the Navajo Nation — although as he points out the RUP is not exclusively a Native voting rights group — when he spoke with someone from the<a href="http://www.nnaa.nndcd.org/"> Navajo Nation Addressing Authority</a> who had seen Google present on their plus codes at a conference the year before.</p>
<p>According to Ellerbeck, the plus codes aren’t meant as a replacement for U.S. Postal addresses. Rural residents in Utah, whether living on the Navajo Nation or not, would still need to travel to their nearest post office or some other pick-up location for mail.</p>
<p>What they do help is ensure that a voter is registered in the correct precinct. Gone are the days when the local elections clerk would have to manually pinpoint where on a map a rural voter is. Now Ellerbeck said the plus codes are helping to solve a problem.</p>
<p>The final push of the project is to affix plus code signs to all the locations. The Rural Utah Project is preparing to do that soon. Ellerbeck did note that neither the project nor the Navajo Nation or Utah government would force someone to affix a plus code sign to their property if they didn’t want it.</p>
<p>“It’s [the feedback] been really positive for the part,” Ellerbeck said. “Definitely there are people who are skeptical and worried about what having an actual address may mean, but for the most part are really excited. I don’t know if people realize the voting implications on a wide level, but people are really excited to be able to call 911.”</p>
<p>What impacts might plus codes, as opposed to traditional number/name street addresses have on data sharing? According to Shane Hamlin, executive director of<a href="https://ericstates.org/"> ERIC</a>, there really wouldn’t be any impacts.</p>
<p>“This is something we need to learn more about and we especially need to learn more about how Utah is using, or not using it,” Hamlin said. “But just looking over it, our system wouldn’t necessarily flag it. It would just show up as an odd address that we do get now and then.”</p>
<p>Hamlin said he could see where plus codes could be a big help to states like Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, places where there are wide swaths of tribal lands and even in more remote areas in Appalachia.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough West Virginia solved their<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/01/where-the-streets-have-no-name/309186/"> lack-of-street address problems</a> in a rather unique way. After it was discovered that Verizon was overcharging West Virginians, the state and the company came to a settlement agreement with $15 million being used in a mapping project.  Today, everyone in the state has a recognizable street address.</p>
<p>“West Virginia has a complete address point data set, so everyone has a street address. There is an ongoing QA/QC program with monthly updates to the published dataset,” explained Brittany Westfall, director of elections. “The addressing project has reduced the burden on county clerk staff to manually determine the address point for rural addresses, which would sometimes require additional communication with voters. Most importantly, it has increased accuracy in our voter precinct assignments.”</p>
<p>One other possible use for plus codes could be in a place like<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/opinion/sunday/north-dakota-addresses-voting-id.html"> North Dakota</a> where the state’s voter ID law requires the government-issued ID to include a street address.</p>
<p><strong>First Nation’s Voting Rights Conference</strong><br />
The Rural Utah Project (with support from The Democracy Fund) will be hosting a First Nations Voting Rights conference later in the month where sessions will cover everything from plus codes to Section 203 language assistance to the impacts of state laws on the Native vote to name just some of the topics covered.

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>In a daylong meeting in California</strong>, security teams from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft met with members of the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security to discuss and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/2020-election-facebook-google.html"> coordinate how to best help secure the 2020 election</a>. According to The New York Times, the agenda was to build up discussions and strategic collaboration ahead of the November 2020 state, federal and presidential elections. Tech company representatives and government officials talked about potential threats, as well as how to better share information and detect threats, the social network said. Chief executives from the companies did not attend, said a person briefed on the meeting, who declined to be identified for confidentiality reasons.</p>
<p>“Improving election security and countering information operations are complex challenges that no organization can solve alone,” Nathaniel Gleicher, head of Facebook cybersecurity policy, said in a statement. “Today’s meeting builds on our continuing commitment to work with industry and government partners, as well as with civil society and security experts, to better understand emerging threats and prepare for future elections.”</p>
<p><strong>A progressive group — Stand Up America</strong> — is spending more than $100,000 on a<a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/progressive-group-spending-100000-pressure-mcconnell-vulnerable-gop-senators-election-security"> campaign to pressure</a> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and other Republicans to pass a bill that will provide $600 million in election security. According to Roll Call, the money will be spent on billboards and Facebook ads.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Beginning in November voters in Dallas County, Texas</strong> will now be able to vote at any location they wish after the secretary of state’s office approved<a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-approves-dallas-county-countywide-voting-plan-11746868"> the county’s plans to move to vote centers</a>. With Dallas now moving to vote centers that means three of the state’s largest counties — Harris, Dallas and Travis — will use vote centers. This covers about 4.5 registered voters. There are now 60, of 254, Texas counties using vote centers.</p>
<p><strong>In other Texas vote center news</strong>, Hays County is looking to solve problems before they arise. The county commission has agreed to appoint a<a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/san-marcos-buda-kyle/city-county/2019/09/03/hays-county-commissioners-to-appoint-citizens-election-commission-to-advise-on-polling-locations/"> citizens election commission</a> to advise the county on polling locations and review changes. According to County Judge Ruben Becerra, the group’s mission would be “to serve Hays County as an independent advisory commission in the area of effectively identifying voting center locations and addressing locations after each election period.”  In addition to considering where people need polling locations, the commission will “evaluate the distribution and effectiveness of the early voting polls and vote centers and recommend changes as needed,” Becerra told the <em>Community Impact Newspaper</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Routt County, Colorado Clerk and Recorder Kim Bonner</strong> has<a href="https://www.steamboatpilot.com/news/routt-county-clerk-renounces-democratic-party-affiliation-ahead-of-election/"> withdrawn her affiliation</a> with the Democratic Party. Routt, who is in her fourth term as county clerk, told the <em>Steamboat Pilot</em> that her aim in revoking her affiliation is to make herself and her office more inclusive and nonpartisan ahead of 2020. “Politics are getting so intense, I felt that I needed to remove myself from that,” she told the paper. In switching to an unaffiliated, or Independent, voter status, Bonner hopes to promote confidence in local elections and boost voter participation. “The message is, ‘let’s try and get the vote out.’ We don’t care which party is voting,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>For weeks, New York counties had worried</strong> whether or not the state would provide funding to<a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/08/29/counties-relieved-cuomo-administration-releases-early-voting-funding/2155433001/"> help them implement early voting</a> and last week the governor’s budget decision announced plans to distribute $10 million to help with roll out. “There was never any question that the full $10 million to support early voting would be made available, and the full amount has been approved today,” state Budget Director Robert Mujica said in a statement to the <em>Democrat &amp; Chronicle.</em> “We look forward to the expanded access to the polls that early voting will provide voters this fall.” The state board of elections had told counties the state was only going to distribute about 22 percent of what was necessary. With the full $10 million approved, counties will get $15,000 per polling site, with the rest of the money distributed based on their total number of voters. Counties are planning on opening 245 early voting sites statewide.</p>
<p><strong>According to a review by the <em>Associated Press</em></strong>, showed that while Louisiana law change in March that<a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2019/09/01/louisiana-voting-rights-change-not-causing-surge-signups/"> restored the voting rights to thousands of convicted felons</a>, only a few had taken advantage of the law and registered to vote. But since the law took effect, 581 felons have had their voting rights restored. The secretary of state&#8217;s office has said it cannot determine which were able to register specifically because of the law change. The data shows 82 felons had their voting rights reinstated in February before the voting rights restoration took effect. By comparison, the number was 77 in March and 88 in April. The secretary of state numbers show 179 felons had their voting rights reinstated in May, followed by 99 in June and 138 in July.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://www.nber.org/"> National Bureau of Economic Research</a> released a<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26206"> working paper</a> on voter identification last month. The study, Strict Voter Identification Laws, Turnout, and Election Outcomes, explores the impact of voter identification laws on turnout and election outcomes using historical data on more than 2,000 races in Florida and Michigan, which both allow and track ballots cast without identification. The paper finds that at most only 0.10 percent and 0.31 percent of total votes cast in each state were cast without IDs.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense’s (DoD)<a href="https://www.fvap.gov"> Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP) released a<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Surveys/FVAP_ADM-Technical-Report-2018.pdf"> report</a> on active duty military (ADM) participation in the 2018 midterms this week. The report summarizes findings from FVAP’s 2018 Post-Election Voting Survey on Active Duty Military (PEVS-ADM), one of three interrelated post-election surveys supported by FVAP. The study examines voting measures for ADM in 2018, registration and participation rates vary by Service, ADM knowledge of the absentee ballot process, and electronic request and return of absentee ballots, among other issues.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.southerncoalition.org/"> Southern Coalition for Social Justice</a> released a<a href="https://www.southerncoalition.org/resources/the-freedom-to-vote/"> report</a> on felony disenfranchisement in North Carolina last month. The report, The Freedom to Vote: Felony Disenfranchisement in North Carolina, examines the state’s policy and practices regarding felony disenfranchisement and voting rights restoration, highlighting that North Carolina is 1 of 18 states that disenfranchise persons who are on felony probation and post-release supervision. Using data from the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts, the study finds that nearly 70,000 North Carolinians could not vote in 2017 due to their felony probation or post-release status.</p>
<p>New York University’s<a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/"> Stern Center for Business and Human Rights</a> issued a<a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/tech-disinfo-and-2020-election"> report</a> on disinformation in the 2020 elections this week.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> The Alaska Division of Elections has denied an initiative that would have, among other things, instituted<a href="https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/State-denies-election-reform-initiative-558876021.html"> ranked-choice voting</a> and opened up the state’s primary elections to all registered voters. “The single-subject rule serves an important constitutional purpose in the initiative context by protecting voters’ ability to have their voices heard,” wrote Attorney General Kevin Clarkson in his opinion to the Lt. Governor. “But 19AKBE, if certified, would force voters into an all or nothing approach on multiple important policy choices, all of which implicate their fundamental constitutional rights in different ways.”</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The state’s Attorney General has certified initiative petitions that would put<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/09/04/ranked-choice-voting-massachusetts-proposal"> ranked choice voting</a> on the ballot on the November 2020 ballot. The initiative petition would implement ranked-choice voting, starting in 2022, for primary and general elections for all Massachusetts statewide offices, state legislative offices, federal congressional offices, and certain other offices.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Senate Bill 191 would establish a new online system for voters to submit an<a href="https://www.sent-trib.com/news/gavarone-introduces-bill-to-encourage-voter-participation/article_f4976e6c-cf5b-11e9-acc9-834645e79683.html"> absentee ballot request</a>. The system prioritizes security by requiring the requestor to verify the last four digits of their social security number, driver’s license or state ID number and birth date. Upon receipt of the request, the signature of the voter will be compared to that on file with the statewide voter registration database.</p>

<p><strong>New York:</strong> Jefferson County Republican Elections Commissioner Jude Seymore has sent the county a bill for $8,900 for<a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2019/09/03/elections-commissioner-wants-county-pay-legal-bills-over-watertown-mayoral-race/"> legal fees</a> incurred during the fight over Watertown’s mayoral race. Seymore told WWNY that if the county says no to the bill, he may consider filling an Article 78 proceeding, which would take the county to court and challenge the determination that he is not entitled to a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: In a unanimous decision, a three-judge superior court panel Wake County has ruled that the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/north-carolina-court-rules-partisan-state-legislative-districts-unconstitutional/2019/09/03/4a137034-ce8a-11e9-8c1c-7c8ee785b855_story.html"> state’s legislative districts are unconstitutional</a>. The judicial panel set a Sept. 17 deadline for the General Assembly to submit redrawn state House and Senate district maps.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> The secretary of state’s office has reached a settlement with the ACLU of Ohio that will allow voters who have been purged from the state’s voter rolls to<a href="https://radio.wosu.org/post/ohio-settles-aclu-lawsuit-allowing-purged-voters-cast-ballots-through-2022#stream/0"> cast a provisional ballot</a> through the 2022 election. The agreement applies to any local, state, special or federal election through 2022. Voters who cast a provisional ballot in any of these elections will also be restored to the voter rolls. &#8220;As long as they still live in the same county where they were originally registered to vote and otherwise remain eligible, they can vote provisionally and have their provisional votes counted,&#8221; Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU of Ohio told WOSU.</p>
<p>Ohio Democrats have filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Frank LaRose in an effort to stop his office from removing more than 200,000 voters from the<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190830/ohio-democrats-file-federal-lawsuit-to-halt-new-voter-purge"> state’s voter registration rolls</a>. The 17-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus seeks a restraining order blocking the Sept. 6 purge and asks that LaRose be ordered to conduct “a manual review of the voting history of each voter at risk of being purged.” Democrats also are demanding an independent audit to review Ohio’s process for updating voter rolls removing infrequent voters from the lists.

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: This week, the North Carolina State Board of Elections launched a new website to<a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2019/09/04/new-website-provides-voting-information-during-dorian/"> keep voters informed</a> about the effects Hurricane Dorian is having on the special Congressional elections set for Tuesday. The site includes county-by-county information on closings of one-stop early voting sites and county boards of elections offices, along with additional information for voters.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Utah County Clerk Amelia Powers Gardner said the county’s recent test of a<a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/local/utah-county-clerk-says-mobile-voting-pilot-program-was-a-success/"> blockchain mobile voting app</a> for military and overseas voters was a success. “It was absolutely a success. It went a little better than I expected,” Powers Gardner told ABC4. She says an audit of the process shows 22 of 58 eligible voters took advantage of the option. That’s a 38 percent turnout, compared to a 25 percent turnout countywide. The mobile voters are residents of seven of the nine cities that held elections. And, Powers Gardner says not one mobile vote was disqualified.</p>
