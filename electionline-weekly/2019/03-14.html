														<p><strong>VotingWorks to scale Colorado&#8217;s risk limiting audit software to all 50 states</strong><br />
<em>Tool set to help states confirm and secure elections</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>The common thinking used to be that all you needed to audit an election was a pencil, some paper and basic grasp of 5th grade math. But like many things, common thinking changes over time.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/COSOS/bulletins/1c69217"> 2017</a> Colorado became the first state legally mandated to conduct a post-election risk limiting audit (RLA) and it became clear that a good No. 2 pencil and some scratch paper wasn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado Secretary of State’s Office</a> invested in the development of an open-source RLA tool designed around the cast vote record (CVR) from<a href="https://www.dominionvoting.com/"> Dominion Voting Systems</a> and the ballot-comparison method for conducting the audit. The state spent $300,000 of their own money and received a $350,000 grant from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. The original code was written by<a href="https://freeandfair.us/"> Free &amp; Fair</a> with the help and input of subject matter experts that were part of an advisory group. The staff in the secretary of state’s office, according Colorado Elections Director Judd Choate, spent thousands of hours working on the project.</p>
<p>Realizing that they needed more help, Colorado turned to<a href="https://www.democracy.works/"> Democracy Works</a> to create a more user-friendly interface for the tool and other enhancements.</p>
<p>“In 2017, Colorado approached us with an urgent need to complete this project before the 2018 midterm elections,” explained Kathryn Peters, co-founder of Democracy Works. “We worried that if we did not take it on, the entire momentum behind RLAs might stall out nationwide.”</p>
<p>Now, after<a href="https://bartels-on.sos.state.co.us/index.php/2018/07/09/another-election-another-risk-limiting-audit-for-colorados-county-clerks/"> several</a><a href="https://bartels-on.sos.state.co.us/index.php/2018/11/16/colorados-third-risk-limiting-audit/"> successful</a> RLAs and with more states considering RLAs, Colorado and Democracy Works are turning the keys over to<a href="https://voting.works/"> VotingWorks</a> to make the tool customizable by state, voting system and types of audits.</p>
<p>“The RLA tool we&#8217;re currently contributing to is an open-source tool, and we are proud to have made significant contributions on top of the work that Free &amp; Fair did before us,” Peters said. “We&#8217;re excited to welcome VotingWorks into the field, share what we&#8217;ve learned with them and remain supporting partners in the ecosystem as VotingWorks takes on a leadership role with RLAs.”</p>
<p>Choate said that it was always Colorado’s hope that the RLA software would work for other jurisdictions. He noted that voter confidence in election outcomes is central to a functioning democracy and the Colorado secretary of states’ office believes a risk-limiting audit is the best way to ensure that confidence.</p>
<p>“Monica Childers and Democracy Works did a great job creating a polished version of the RLA code,” Choate said. “Colorado is excited to partner with VotingWorks as they adapt the base code to function for both central and precinct count states and localities.”</p>
<p>Jennifer Morrell, a consultant for the<a href="http://www.suncommercial.com/opinions/article_90c22fe4-45db-11e9-af3e-5becbe0449ab.html"> Democracy Fund</a>, has been working with states to implement RLAs while exploring possible solutions for a universal RLA tool. She is excited that VotingWorks has agreed to take on this role and feel like it will be a catalyst for other election audit tools.</p>
<p>“This is a big win for the election community beyond the usefulness to RLAs,” Morrell said. “All of this work around the creation of an RLA tool, from the first version used in Colorado to the forthcoming development done by VotingWorks, represents exactly what we need to solve other challenging problems in election administration. It is a model that embraces technology while focusing on collaboration to create a tool that can be used by everyone to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the work being performed. I think that is something everyone can get behind!”</p>
<p>VotingWorks is a non-partisan nonprofit which started in November 2018 to build secure and affordable voting equipment. Although it’s a young organization VotingWorks founders Ben Adida and Matt Pasternack have years of experience. Adida has been in the election world for 20 years and received his PhD in election security from MIT. Pasternack is an experienced public sector executive, who previously worked with school districts across the country in secure software deployment.</p>
<p>According to Adida, states performing a risk-limiting audit need to coordinate the actions of many stakeholders in a precisely choreographed process—and software is the key to that coordination.</p>
<p>“As more states sought access to [Colorado’s RLA] tool, we offered to help scale the tool by applying our expertise building scalable, reliable, and secure enterprise software,” Adida said. “Because scaling the tool to these new use cases requires a significant software development effort, Democracy Works realized that if VotingWorks took on the RLA tool, Democracy Works could then focus on the more voter-centric aspects of election administration they specialize in.”</p>
<p>Adida said VotingWorks is ready to hit the ground running by consulting broadly with election officials looking to pilot RLAs in the near future. He noted that ultimately, the next generation of RLA tools is going to succeed only if they&#8217;re developed in close concert with all stakeholders.</p>
<p>“We know one important thing that won&#8217;t change: the source code for the tool and any follow-up tool we build will remain free and open-source,” Adida said. “We&#8217;ll be consulting with states to determine a long-term sustainability plan, but that won&#8217;t start until we hear from states that the tool has become useful to them and is worth sustaining.”</p>
<p><strong>So what is an RLA and how does the RLA tool work?<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/gentle12.pdf">Risk limiting audits</a> provide statistical evidence that an election outcome is correct. While there are varying definitions, generally an RLA means officials hand count and review a statistically meaningful sample of the votes cast.</p>
<p>The audit software, Morrell explained, is essential for conducting an RLA at any level. The tool calculates the appropriate number of ballots to audit, assists with the random selection of those ballots, and determines when the audit can stop or if it should be expanded.</p>
<p>According to the<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/post-election-audits635926066.aspx"> National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, three states—Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia— have a statutory requirement to conduct RLA. Ohio and Washington counties have the option to run RLAs (or other types of post-election audits) and beginning in 2020 California counties will also have the option to conduct RLAs.</p>
<p>NCSL’s election legislation database indicates there are nine bills pending in six states (Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Virginia) specifically about risk limiting audits and 48 bills in 19 states that have post-election audits as a topic, which is an increase from 2017 but on par with 2018.</p>
<p>If your state is considering undertaking an RLA—or the state Legislature is requiring election officials to do so—Adida recommends you reach out to Jennifer Morrell at jmorrell@democracyfund.org.</p>
<p>VotingWorks would also like to hear from election officials about how they want to use the tool and what they want from it in the future. They can be contacted at rla@voting.works.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re very interested in hearing how you want to use the tool and what you&#8217;ll need from it in the future,” Adida said.</p>

							<h2>VVSG Public Comment</h2>
														<p><strong>VVSG available for public comment</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) four sitting Commissioners unanimously voted to publish the proposed<a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf?fbclid=IwAR33Zx8yw13uW7T6uoJr8wZwYFOswqIC7tdbjHOfavjGuZATR366h28H-48"> Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 (VVSG) Principles and Guidelines</a> in the<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/"> Federal Register</a> for a 90 day public comment period, after which comments and feedback on the proposed document will be compiled and presented to the Commissioners for discussion and consideration.</p>
<p>“Today’s unanimous vote demonstrates the Commissioners’ shared commitment to taking this next important step in consideration of the proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines. The EAC looks forward to holding hearings on these Principles and Guidelines soon and we encourage the public to provide their feedback on the proposed guidelines,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks, who joined Vice Chair Christy McCormick, Commissioner Ben Hovland and Commissioner Donald Palmer in supporting the measure.</p>
<p>The proposed VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines will be published in the Federal Register in accordance with sections 222(a)(1) and 222(d) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. They will appear in the Federal Register for a period of 90 days. Separately, upon the completion of the VVSG 2.0’s accompanying Requirements developed by NIST and the EAC, those accompanying Requirements will also be subject to public review and comment, including distribution to the EAC’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), Standards Board and Board of Advisors. This review and comment period will take place prior to consideration and implementation by the Commission.</p>
<p>VVSG are a set of Principles, Guidelines and Requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems meet required standards. Some factors examined under these tests include functionality, accessibility, accuracy, auditability and security capabilities.</p>
<p>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandates that EAC develop and maintain these requirements as well as testing and certifying voting systems. On December 13, 2005, the EAC unanimously adopted the 2005 VVSG, which significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities for individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. The 2005 guidelines updated and augmented the 2002 Voting System Standards, as required by HAVA, to address advancements in election practices and computer technologies. These guidelines were again updated by the EAC’s Commissioners on March 31, 2015. These guidelines are voluntary. States may decide to adopt them entirely or in part prior to the effective date.</p>
<p>The structure of the new VVSG reflects modifications proposed by the election community, EAC, NIST and the TGDC, which is comprised of election officials, voting system manufacturers, disability experts, cyber security experts, technology experts, and other key election stakeholders. The new guidelines are a high level set of principles that will be supplemented by accompanying documents that detail specific requirements for how systems can meet the new guidelines and obtain certification. The supplemental documents will also detail assertions for how the accredited test laboratories will validate that a system complies with those requirements.</p>
<p>Last Spring, the EAC convened its advisory boards to review and comment on the adoption of the newest version of the voluntary guidelines, VVSG 2.0. Both Boards recommended that the EAC adopt VVSG 2.0. Today’s unanimous Commissioner vote occurred less than two weeks after a quorum of Commissioners was restored at the EAC.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), testified before the House Appropriations Committee’s subcommittee on homeland security that the agency’s new<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/433946-dhs-to-focus-on-cybersecurity-basics-ahead-of-2020-election-cyber-head"> “Protect 2020” initiative</a> will focus on making sure that state and local officials are prepared for the upcoming presidential election.</p>
<p>In his testimony, Krebbs said the focus of the project will be on “broadening the reach and depth of assistance to state and local officials” in addition to mphasizing the need to audit elections, patch vulnerabilities in election systems and develop cybersecurity priorities for state and local election officials.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Starting this spring, voters in the largest election jurisdiction in the largest state</strong> in the union will be able to vote at any polling place they want to. Texas Secretary of State David Whitley has<a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Secretary-of-state-OKs-Trautman-s-countywide-13671256.php"> approved an application from Harris County to participate in the state’s countywide polling program</a>. “The voters of Harris County have made it clear that a countywide polling place program would have a positive impact on elections and I am confident that the transition to a countywide polling place program will be successful,” County Clerk Diane Trautman said in a statement. According to the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> 50 of Texas’ 254 counties are currently participating in the countywide polling program.</p>
<p><strong>NC9:</strong> While most (all) of the attention has been focused on the North Carolina 9th District Congressional race,<a href="https://www.fayobserver.com/news/20190308/live-wire-two-other-bladen-county-races-will-have-new-elections"> other races in Bladen County</a> were also impacted by the election fraud case and will have to be conducted again. In addition to the 9th Congressional District, Bladen County Commissioner District 3 and Bladen County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor. All other races have been certified. New elections for the two Bladen County races will be held on May 14 in conjunction with the new District 9 race. One local official, Richmond County Manager Bryan Land is<a href="https://www.yourdailyjournal.com/news/85620/land-calls-new-election-unfair-to-innocent-counties-requests-refund-from-state"> protesting the cost of conducting a new election</a> noting that it would cost the county at least $125,000. “I realize we are required by federal law to hold a special election if it is deemed necessary and we are also required by law to pay for all of the associated cost that accompany this election. However, it seems extremely unfair to me that Richmond County is being penalized for the collusion and illegal activities that took place in Bladen and Robeson counties,” Land wrote To Sen Tom McInnis and Rep. Ken Goodman. “The election in Richmond County was certified and no collusion took place within our county. Furthermore, I find it extremely odd that the District 9 race is the only race that is being challenged. If collusion took place in these Counties, would it not be fair to say that ALL races were affected?” The<a href="https://www.wral.com/9th-district-election-fraud-now-part-of-federal-criminal-probe/18252282/"> U.S. Attorney’s Office</a> for the Eastern District of North Carolina has issued<a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/state-board-of-elections-subpoenaed-in-district-9-investigation/929525128"> subpoenas</a> for the North Carolina State Board of Elections and former candidate Mark Harris. This week, the State Board of Elections recommended changes to the states absentee ballot laws, including consideration of<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/article227560209.html"> paid postage</a> for return ballots.</p>
<p><strong>While legislation is making its way through the state house</strong> that could automatically restore the voting rights to ex-felons, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is making things easier in the meantime. The governor’s office recently unveiled a<a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/03/12/governor-unveils-streamlined-app-for-felons-seeking-voting-rights/"> new one-page rights restoration request</a> (replacing a three-page document) and now former incarcerated felons will no longer have to provide their own documentation for the status of their fines because state officials will be able to look that up online. “Restoring voting rights is more than a trip to the ballot box,” Reynolds said according to Iowa Public Radio. “It really resurrects dignity and begins re-entry into life as a contributing member of our communities.”</p>
<p><strong>Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) has replaced</strong> all three members of the<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/northam-replaces-all-three-members-of-state-board-of-elections/article_5978722d-b78c-5f0d-bc78-e4b72e3c0078.html"> State Board of Elections</a>.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-New Mexico) and Representative Ben Ray Ljuan (D-New Mexico) have reintroduced the<a href="https://www.indian.senate.gov/news/press-release/udall-luj-n-introduce-bicameral-native-american-voting-rights-act"> Native American Voting Rights Act</a>. The legislation would enact key measures, such as increasing Native access to voter registration sites and polling locations, and authorizing tribal ID cards for voting purposes. The bill would also bolster Native voter registration, education, and election participation efforts in tribal communities by authorizing a first of its kind Native American Voting Rights Task Force. Finally, the bill addresses the effects of Shelby County v. Holder by prohibiting states from undertaking discriminatory actions without Department of Justice agreement and government-to-government consultation.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin (D-Thousand Oaks) has introduced AB 1044 that would authorize the secretary of state’s office to require entities applying for voter registration data to complete a<a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/money/business/2019/03/10/irwin-bills-aim-tighten-election-cybersecurity/3032892002/"> free educational course on data security</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> Rep. Vincent Candelora (R-North Brandford) had proposed a bill that would allow schools, when used as polling places, to<a href="http://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Wallingford/Wallingford-News/Candelora-Allow-schools-to-require-photo-IDs-from-voters-to-access-buildings.html"> mandate photo ID</a> for entry into the building if such a requirement is already part of their policy.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> Legislators are considering a bill that would include Delaware in the<a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/post/bill-binding-delawares-electoral-votes-natl-popular-vote-creates-controversy"> National Popular Vote</a> Interstate Compact.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Sen. Linda Stewart and Rep. Geraldine Thompson have each filed a bill (Senate Bill 1802 and House Bill 1365) would, among other things,<a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/290348-geraldine-thompson-linda-stewart-propose-election-day-holiday-other-reforms"> make Election Day a state holiday</a> for all state agencies and forbid other employers from denying employees time off with pay to vote on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The Senate has approved House Bill 316, an<a href="https://www.gpbnews.org/post/cost-questions-loom-senate-passes-voting-machine-bill"> omnibus voting bill</a> that would not only tweak state code, but also authorizes the state to purchase new ballot-marking voting equipment. The measure was approved 35-21 along party lines.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> State Rep. Allen Skillicorn (R-East Dundee) has introduced two bills, HB 2633 would add Illinois to<a href="http://www.wsiltv.com/story/40089828/lawmaker-files-bills-to-address-voter-fraud"> Crosscheck</a> and HB 2632 would enhance criminal penalties for filing more than one vote and make it a felony to vote in different states.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> A House committee advanced a bill that would set up an<a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/article_14965478-69df-5ce4-af59-57291a36baf3.html"> automatic recount</a> if a legislative election&#8217;s margin is within 0.5 percent.

The automatic recount also would apply to statewide constitutional races and Kentucky&#8217;s contests for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> House Bill 423 and Senate Bill 934 would allow students and teachers at public and private high schools who meet the requirements of<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-high-school-voter-registration-0314-story.html"> voter registration</a> to do so at their schools.</p>

One of the overturned laws requires voters to provide additional documentation when registering within 30 days of an election and the other related to the difference between domicile and residency. Both now move to the Senate along with a bill allowing for no-excuse absentee voting.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Senate Republicans have introduced a bill that would delay the implementation of the state’s new<a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/voter-id-measure-would-delay-requirement-until-2020"> voter ID</a> until 2020. The<a href="http://www.reflector.com/News/2019/03/14/House-passes-Voter-ID-delay-bill-governor-must-sign.html"> House</a> has also approved the bill and it now heads to the desk of Gov.

The bill would require at least on early voting site in each county.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Under House Bill 935, elections in even-numbered years would be a<a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/republicans-push-back-against-making-election-day-a-texas-holiday/"> holiday for state employees</a> though most state offices would remain open.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The Senate Government Operations Committee voted unanimously to send SB242 to the full Senate. Under the proposed legislation, the state’s presidential caucuses would be replaced by a<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/03/08/after-chaos-utahs-last/"> presidential preference primary</a> to be held on Super Tuesday.</p>
<p>House Bill 259, which would eliminate<a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/bill-to-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting-advances-at-capitol/1844937070"> straight-party voting</a>, has passed the House and a Senate committee.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The Legislature has given final approval to the<a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/mar/10/native-american-voting-assistance-passes-legislatu/"> Native American Voting Rights Act</a> that would allow tribal members to request voter registration services be provided at state and tribal facilities on reservations. Voters could register using those buildings’ addresses or register using nontraditional addresses.
