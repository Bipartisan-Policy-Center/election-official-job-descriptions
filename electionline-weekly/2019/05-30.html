							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Summer of Suffrage<br />
</strong>Three exhibits on Suffrage featured in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>With summer vacation season underway and with the nation beginning a year-long celebration of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, three institutions in Washington, D.C. are putting on special exhibits to celebrate the Centennial of Suffrage.</p>
<p>The National Archives Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Library of Congress will each have exhibits on display covering every aspect of the Suffrage movement and serving as encouragement for current women and men to register and exercise their right to vote.</p>
<p>All the exhibits are free and open to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Rightfully Hers|</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.archivesfoundation.org/women/">Rightfully Hers: American Women and the Vote</a> runs now through January 3, 2021 at the National Archives Museum (Lawrence F. O’Brien Gallery, 701 Constitution Ave, NW. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily except Thanksgiving and Dec. 25).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3763" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Suffrage2-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Suffrage2-300x214.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Suffrage2-768x548.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Suffrage2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Rightfully Hers is a nationwide initiative and exhibition that explores the fight for suffrage. Through the initiative, the National Archives will not only highlight the hard-won victories that stemmed from the Women’s Suffrage movement, but also remind modern-day citizens of their responsibilities associated with the right to vote.</p>
<p>“As the steward of our nation’s memory, we will tell the story of the 19th Amendment through a special exhibition in Washington, DC, free public programming, a national traveling exhibition, classroom displays (distributed to nearly 1,600 schools and libraries), educational offerings (for teachers and students, both off and on-line) and digitization of women&#8217;s records,” the Archives wrote on its website.</p>
<p>Several initiative components will specifically shine a spotlight on voting as a civic duty &#8211; from revealing the often dire consequences faced by non-voting populations to providing the opportunity to register to vote directly from the museum.</p>
<p>The National Archives is a non-partisan agency, that encourages all to be “election-ready” and exercise their right to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Votes for Women</strong><br />
<a href="https://npg.si.edu/exhibition/votes-for-women">Votes for Women: A Portrait of Persistence</a> runs now through January 5, 2020 at the National Portrait Gallery (8th and F Streets, NW. Hours: 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Dec. 25).</p>
<p>The presentation is divided chronologically and thematically to address “Radical Women: 1832–1869,” “Women Activists: 1870–1892,” “The New Woman: 1893–1912,” “Compelling Tactics: 1913–1916,” “Militancy in the American Suffragist Movement: 1917–1919” and “The Nineteenth Amendment and Its Legacy.” These thematic explorations are complemented by a chronological narrative of visual biographies of some of the movement’s most influential leaders.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3762" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suffrage-226x300.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suffrage-226x300.jpg 226w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suffrage.jpg 753w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></p>
<p>The exhibit at the Portrait Gallery makes the effort to explore the role African American women played in the Suffrage movement noting that while African American were often excluded by white women and the main Suffrage movement, that they did in fact play a vital role in Suffrage not only in the ratification of the 19th Amendment, but also moving forward through the civil rights fight of the 50s and early 60s.</p>
<p>“The Portrait Gallery exhibition tells this complex history through an array of early photographic portraits, paintings, engravings, works on paper, lithographs, video, newspapers, postcards, books, ballots, banners, fliers, a china set, embroidery and pennants,” the Gallery wrote in its website. “Viewers will be able to see authentic objects, including original banners from the National Woman’s Party, a late-19th century ballot box and original writings by influential suffragists.”</p>
<p><strong>Shall Not Be Denied<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-002/">Shall Not Be Denied: Women Fight for the Vote</a> opens June 4 and runs through September 2020 at the Library of Congress (101 Independence Ave., SE. Monday-Saturday 8:30 am to 4:30pm, closed Sundays).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3973" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Suffrage-3-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Suffrage-3-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Suffrage-3-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Suffrage-3.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The exhibition draws from the Library’s extensive collections of personal papers and organizational records of such figures as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mary Church Terrell, Carrie Chapman Catt, the National Woman’s Party, the National American Woman Suffrage Association and others.</p>
<p>Documents, images, video and audio recordings will trace the movement leading to the women’s rights convention at Seneca Falls, the contributions of suffragists who worked to persuade women that they deserved the same rights as men, the divergent political strategies and internal divisions they overcame, the push for a federal women’s suffrage amendment and the legacy of this movement.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p>On Wednesday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the closing of the special counsel’s office and his return to private life. While he spoke mostly about what his report did or did not find with regard to the president, he issued what many have referred to<a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/mueller-highlights-need-vigilance-election-interference"> as a stark warning for Americans</a> to pay attention to what Russia did to interfere with the 2016 and what they could do in the future.</p>
<p>“I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments — that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election,” Mueller said during remarks delivered from the Justice Department. “That allegation deserves the attention of every American.”</p>
<p>Following his remarks, Democrats in Congress immediately<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/445979-democrats-push-election-security-legislation-after-mueller-warning"> spoke up</a> about moving forward with legislation pending in both chambers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must take steps to protect our democracy by passing legislation that enhances election security, increases social media transparency, and requires campaign officials to report any contact with foreign nationals attempting to coordinate with a campaign,&#8221; Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman, Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) said in a statement.</p>
<p>In other election security news, Democrat Stephanie Murphy and Republican Michael Waltz, both from Florida, have announced plans to introduce a bill that would require federal officials to inform Congress, state and local authorities and the public<a href="https://statescoop.com/u-s-house-bill-would-require-feds-to-notify-public-of-election-hacking/"> if an election-related computer system is hacked</a>.</p>
<p>Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Susan Collins, R-Maine have introduced the<a href="https://www.brainerddispatch.com/news/government-and-politics/4617875-klobuchar-collins-introduce-bill-boosting-election"> Invest in Our Democracy Act of 2019</a> that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a grant program administered by the Election Assistance Commission to cover up to 75% of the cost of the yearly tuition of election officials and employees who are enrolled in an accredited certificate program for election administration or cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Define eligible persons to include state or local election officials, employees of a state or local election official, or an employee of the Election Assistance Commission.</li>
<li>Provide $1 million for fiscal year 2021 and such sums necessary for each fiscal year between 2022 and 2028.</li>
</ul>

														<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> A software malfunction in the Clatsop County clerk’s ballot-counting machines<a href="https://www.dailyastorian.com/news/local/software-error-adds-votes-to-tuesday-s-election/article_cfb13fa2-7e3d-11e9-8c03-c72020bc48b8.html"> failed to delete 200 test ballots</a> which were then added to the final results.

														<p><strong>Just before the Texas Senate’s closing gavel</strong> would have ended his term as secretary of state,<a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20190527/david-whitley-resigns-as-end-of-session-deadline-nears"> David Whitely submitted his resignation</a> to Gov. Greg Abbot. According to the Austin American-Statesman Whitley needed to be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the legislative session, but he did not have the votes to be confirmed. In his resignation letter, Whitley thanked Abbott, for the opportunity but mentioned nothing about the voter citizenship investigation that lead to his troubles in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>When nearly 61,000 ballots went missing last year in Adams County</strong>, County Clerk Josh Zygielbaum<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/05/28/adams-county-ballot-disappearance-audit/"> wanted to get to the bottom of it t</a>o make sure it never happened again so he hired an outside auditor to look into the matter. The third-party firm blamed the delay in mailing out ballots on a “miscommunication” between a driver and a dispatcher for a shipping company that was handling the ballots for the county’s printer. Fortunately the problem was discovered and the ballots were mailed in enough time for the election, but Zygielbaum told the Denver Post that the office has “put measures in place to ensure this will not happen again.”</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to York, Maine Clerk</strong><a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190528/york-town-clerk-honored-with-state-award"> Mary-Anne Szeniawski</a> for receiving the 2019 Lorraine M. Fleury Award from Secretary of State Matt Dunlap. According to Seacoastonline, the award is given annually to someone who has made a significant contribution to the election process and who exemplifies the qualities of fairness, experience, knowledge and service.”</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/"> Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) released a<a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST19-002"> security tip</a> last week regarding best practices for securing election systems and an accompanying<a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Elections%20Infrastructure%20Questionnaire.pdf"> questionnaire</a> on election infrastructure. Drawing from lessons learned by the<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/CISA"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> Hunt and Incident Response Team through their work with election offices, the best practices touch on the following topics: software and patch management; log management; network segmentation; blocking of suspicious activity; credential management; establishing a baseline for host and network activity; organization-wide information technology guidance and policies; and notice and consent banners for computer systems. The security tip also links to additional resources from DHS, the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and non-governmental organizations. The accompanying questionnaire seeks to help election offices with implementing cybersecurity best practices and strengthen the security of their election infrastructure.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/"> Brennan Center</a> released an<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/2019_05_FloridaAmendment_FINAL-3.pdf"> analytical brief</a> on voting rights restoration for persons with felony convictions in Florida earlier this month. The brief, Thwarting Amendment 4, examines the potential impact of a new state law that requires Floridians to pay back all fees, fines, and restitution imposed as part of a sentence for a felony conviction before they can register to vote. Using data from Florida’s Department of Corrections and the Board of Elections, the study identifies more than 2,000 formerly incarcerated Floridians who registered to vote after the January 8, 2019 effective date of Amendment 4. The brief finds that the new law will disproportionately affect African Americans, highlighting that while African Americans make up 13 percent of the total registered voter population in Florida, 44 percent of re-enfranchised individuals from January to March 2019 were African American.</p>

<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The House has approved a bill that proposes to study the use of<a href="https://www.newmilfordspectrum.com/news/article/Legislator-s-voter-data-improvement-concept-13901578.php"> blockchain technology</a> to collect voter information. The bill now moves to the Senate.</p>
<p>The House has approved a bill, on a nearly part-line vote, has approved a bill that will<a href="https://www.journalinquirer.com/politics_and_government/house-passes-bill-allowing-parolees-right-to-vote/article_4c8d96ce-8221-11e9-86cb-9ff86fec26b8.html"> grant people on parole the right to vote</a>.

Gov. Kevin Stitt has<a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5632624/stitt-signs-bill-lifting-ban-on-ballot-selfies"> signed</a> the bill into law.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: The House Judiciary Committee has approved a bill that would codify a current practice by the secretary of state’s office to limit what<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190528/house-panel-oks-bill-shielding-birth-dates-in-voter-lists"> voter data</a>, included date of birth, is available for public view.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Before the end of the Legislative session, House Bill 1888 was approved by both chambers. The legislation requires that each early voting location be open for voters on each and every day that voting is conducted at the main early polling place, and that each location remain open for at least eight hours a day, for all elections held on the November uniform election date. There are exceptions for territories with fewer than 1,000 registered voters if the city or county clerk does not serve as the early voting clerk for the area. If signed into law, it essentially means that county election officials cannot set up<a href="https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2019/05/death-of-mobile-voting-bill-to-complicate-elections/"> short-term polling places</a> at sites like nursing homes.</p>
<p>House Bill 2909, which would have required all voting machines to include individual<a href="https://statescoop.com/texas-voting-machines-bill-stalls/"> paper records</a> of all votes cast stalled in the Legislature before the Legislature eventually ended.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> People who<a href="https://www.wpr.org/proposal-would-allow-electronic-early-voting-wisconsin"> vote early</a> in Wisconsin would be able to feed their ballots into electronic voting machines under a bipartisan proposal. Current law requires local election officials to store early ballots for electronic processing on Election Day. Under this proposal, officials would have the option to electronically process ballots on the day they are cast. Votes would still not be officially tabulated until Election Day.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Tech Companies</strong>: Protect Democracy, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit has developed an app called<a href="https://www.govtech.com/security/Nonprofits-Free-App-Flags-Suspicious-Changes-to-Voter-Rolls.html"> VoteShield</a> which is in use in 14 states. The app, which is authenticated by election administrators, uses basic statistics machine learning and data visualization to analyze changes in local voter databases and flag unusual activity.

<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> According to the Northwest Times, Marcus Orciuch, a senior at Lake Central High School, has worked since last February with the Lake County Board of Elections to create the<a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/lake-county-elections-app-brings-first-of-its-kind-updates/article_5876ce19-fd89-5eaa-9ad5-51696b41e2c6.html"> county’s first election tracking mobile app</a>. The app — tested with a small group of friends, election board members and candidates in last November’s midterm elections — brings polling location, campaign finance and candidate data into one central, mobile-friendly location, searchable by election date and contest.

<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Following the November 2018 election, elections officials reported that voter registrations from the state’s department of motor vehicles were<a href="https://www.register-herald.com/news/state_region/officials-say-voter-registration-issue-fixed/article_d9fbeb61-4421-5174-be7d-6d398d1191b0.html"> being lost due to technology malfunction</a>. Officials at the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles say they believe a programming change fixed the problem in January. Adam Holley, acting DMV commissioner, said, in an email to the <em>Register-Herald</em> last week, that state officials had since completed two rounds of testing that found no problems. “I am satisfied that the prior issue was fixed but efforts to verify the successful transmission of voter registration information will continue as a routine part of the process,” he said. “We don’t know how many people were impacted last fall but believe the number was limited based upon the instances that were brought to our attention and corrected.”</p>
