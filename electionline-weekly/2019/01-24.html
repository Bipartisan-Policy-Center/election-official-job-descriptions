							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>A users group for local, state, and federal election data analysts<br />
</strong><em>As number of analysts grows, so does value of creating a professional community</em></p>
<p>By Charles Stewart III<br />
MIT Election Data and Science Lab</p>
<p>Elections are awash in numbers.  In the late nineteenth century, state and local governments started releasing boatloads of data to document registration statistics and precinct-level election returns, all in the name of transparency and election integrity.  More recently, as computers have taken on a growing role election administration functions, what was already a deluge of election-related data has become a tsunami.</p>
<p>Political scientists have long taken advantage of the availability of election data for their work, as have campaigns and citizen groups.  Federal, state, and local election agencies have climbed aboard the bandwagon in recent years, using election data not only to judge the outcome of elections, but also to manage elections and to communicate with the public about the changing landscape of election administration.  Unlike other groups, however, agency employees who are responsible for helping to corral election data don’t have a peer group to associate with — a space for them to share tricks of the trade, professionalize rookies, and develop a distinct professional identity. Until now.</p>
<p>To help fill this gap, the MIT Election Data and Science Lab is coordinating the creation of a user group for data analysts who work for federal, state, and local election agencies.  The group doesn’t have a name yet — maybe that will be its first order of business — but it does have a listserv. I invite anyone who is interested to either e-mail me or go directly to the<a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/sl-election-analytics"> listserv information page</a> and enter your e-mail address to join.</p>
<p>The idea behind this user group is based on my observation that election agencies are increasingly hiring employees to provide data analysis in support of election administration.  More and more frequently, I have found myself sharing e-mails with these employees and meeting them at state election official conferences. Sometimes, they hold a full-time position with a job description that specifically emphasizes data and policy analysis.  In other cases, they have a more traditional non-data focus, but find themselves increasingly writing data-driven reports for their boss as well. Some come from data science or policy analysis backgrounds. Others have fallen into the position with no formal training in data analysis.</p>
<p>As the number of people providing data analysis to election agencies grows, so does the value of creating a professional community of election administration data analysts.  Such a community brings benefits to its members: learning from peers, working out puzzles, contributing to the development of this field, and sharing the joys and frustrations of the job —just to name a few.</p>
<p>As I have shared my idea for this user group with a number of election officials around the country, at all levels of government, I’ve heard a great deal of enthusiasm about the concept.  Before getting too far down the road with future plans, though, Step One is identifying who is interested in joining. That is why I am asking people to self-identify and agree to join the group (and the listserv).</p>
<p>Step Two will be seeing what these founding members want to do.  I can imagine at least two directions this community could go. First, it could exist purely as an online community organized around the listserv.  The model here would be something like the<a href="https://department-lists.uci.edu/mailman/listinfo/law-election"> election law mailing list</a> that Dan Lowenstein (UCLA) and Rick Hasen (UCI) manage.</p>
<p>The second direction could be to give it a more face-to-face component.  One possible model for this is the annual<a href="http://bowencenterforpublicaffairs.org/institutes/policy-research/election-admin/conference"> State Certification Testing of Voting Systems</a> conference, which has been held for nearly a decade now.  (I call this the election geek’s Merlefest, after the conference’s founding soul, Merle King.)</p>
<p>Others will certainly have other notions.  I hope the listserv will become a place for active discussion of those ideas.</p>
<p>One last point:  Some will notice that although I am suggesting that this be a community confined (at the moment) to employees of election agencies, MEDSL itself is not such an agency.  I recognize the irony. Still, one of the missions of MEDSL is to encourage collaborations between election officials and academics, and to encourage the spread of scientific approaches to election administration wherever we can.  I am happy to use our resources to jump-start this effort. Once it gets going, MEDSL can step away, if that’s the will of the group.</p>
<p>For now, the important thing is to start.</p>
<p><strong>Questions?  Interested in joining?</strong>  E-mail Charles Stewart (cstewart-AT-mit.edu) or go directly to the (distinctly utilitarian) listserv homepage and sign up: <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/sl-election-analytics"> http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/sl-election-analytics</a>.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>No, this isn’t a plot for the latest Neflix thriller.</strong> According to the <em>Lincoln Journal Star</em>, elections officials in Lancaster and Douglas counties in Nebraska were<a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/fbi-questioned-nebraska-election-officials-party-leaders-following-visit-by/article_e09c1462-a2d9-5082-9742-4b6a1f116257.html"> questioned by the FBI about two international election observers</a> from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Officials questioned by the FBI told the paper, agents wanted to know if anyone was offered a pen as a gift. The officials were show schematics of pens that could also be used as a listening device. It&#8217;s essentially something you would see in a spy movie,&#8221; one of the people shown a blueprint of the device by the FBI told the paper. An FBI spokeswoman told the <em>Journal Star</em> it was the agency&#8217;s policy to neither confirm nor deny an investigation, but the paper spoke to a half-dozen people who met with the observation team in mid-October and said they were later contacted by federal agents.</p>
<p><strong>There’s another story of lost and found ballots this week</strong>, this time in Ohio. In late December the Ohio secretary of state’s office notified the Miami County board of elections that November election results were out of line with historic voter participation. According to the <em>Dayton Daily News</em>, a review discovered that<a href="https://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/local-govt--politics/miami-county-200-uncounted-votes-what-really-going/SEOrznqpPUTXks0layhItJ/"> 6,288 early ballots</a> cast on a voting machine in the county elections office were not counted. The discrepancy occurred on election night when voting equipment did not pull all of the vote total data. It went unnoticed until the state review according to the paper. Reportedly no vote totals were changed. The board of elections has fired director Beverly Kendall and will conduct a<a href="https://www.tdn-net.com/news/56059/election-results-amended-to-include-missing-ballots"> full investigation</a> into what happened, and why it happened.<a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/state-election-investigators-will-miami-county-today/3pHQZ3tJ96768jVAXtvjjI/"> Representatives</a> from the secretary of state’s office are in the county to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>There is always a<a href="https://www.craigdailypress.com/news/municipal-polling-cast-into-doubt-moffat-county-county-clerks-office-has-no-one-certified-to-conduct-elections/"> learning curve when new folks come on the job</a></strong> and that is being felt in an interesting way by the city of Craig, Colorado and Moffat County. It seems that no one in the Moffat County Clerk and Recorder’s office is trained in the secretary of state’s SCORE System, which is the state’s voter registration system and is necessary to conduct an election. Craig, which has always had the county conduct their elections, has a municipal election fast approaching in April and new County Clerk Tammy Raschke said no one in her office will be trained in time to conduct the election. &#8220;This has never happened before,&#8221; Craig Mayor John Ponikvar told the <em>Craig Press.</em> &#8220;We&#8217;ve always contracted with the county to do our elections.&#8221; The secretary of state’s office said that it’s working to get the county staff trained but may have to help the city conduct the election on contract. “We’re going to do everything we can to expedite training and make sure she (Raschke) has access to other people who have the knowledge to get this election back on track,” Communications Director Serena Woods told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>While it didn’t quite come to pistols at high noon</strong>, but Ford County, Kansas has agreed to open two<a href="http://www.hutchnews.com/news/20190122/ford-county-commits-to-two-polling-sites-in-dodge-city/2"> polling sites in Dodge City</a> for future elections following a lawsuit filed by the ACLU. In November 2018 Dodge City, which has about 13,000 registered voters had only one polling site about a mile outside the city limits. The ACLU sued Ford County Clerk Deborah Cox siting among other things that the average Kansas polling site has 1,200 voters assigned to it. The two new sites are the Hoover Pavilion and the Knights of Columbus Hall. According to <em>The Hutchinson News</em>, Dodge City Transit said it will provide temporary bus stops in front of the polling places on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>According to the <em>Des Moines Register</em></strong>, Iowa House Republicans are<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/23/iowa-house-republicans-end-review-contested-election-kayla-koether-michael-bergan-district-race-vote/2659613002/"> ending their review of a contested House race</a> which is separated by nine votes, but with 29 rejected mail-in ballots still outstanding. The committee is scheduled Thursday afternoon to recommend to the full House that the ballots not be opened or counted. It’s unclear when the chamber will vote on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>The Illinois State Board of Elections voted 8-0</strong> to remove the state from<a href="https://hoiabc.com/news/top-stories/2019/01/22/illinois-drops-out-of-controversial-crosscheck-anti-voter-fraud-program/"> Crosscheck</a>. Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Matt Dietrich said the main reason Illinois is withdrawing from the Kansas-administered Crosscheck is to create a new data sharing agreement with Indiana.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://spsa.net/"> Southern Political Science Association</a> (SPSA) held its annual conference in Austin last week. The<a href="https://spsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-SPSA-Preliminary-Program-6.0.pdf"> program</a> included several papers on election administration topics, a handful of which are summarized below. Additional SPSA papers will be highlighted in the coming weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjugxs3d7xmwu9n/Alberda.pdf?dl=0"> Examining the Impact of Early Voting on Local Elections</a> by<a href="https://www.fairfield.edu/lassochannel/academic/profile/index.lasso?id=2228"> Gayle Alberda</a>, Fairfield University. The paper examines whether in-person early voting increases turnout in local elections. Using data from Ohio from 2001 to 2017, the study finds a significant negative relationship on municipal voter turnout suggesting that in-person early voting laws alone may not be an adequate policy solution to the low voter turnout problem found in American elections.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cy0w7hkenqs8jj/Crawford%2C%20et%20al.pdf?dl=0"> Surveying Local Election Officials in the United States: Methodological Considerations</a> by<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/cas/political-science/faculty-and-staff/biography.php?profile_id=6250"> Evan Crawford</a>, University of San Diego;<a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/paul-gronke/"> Paul Gronke</a>, Early Voting Information Center and Reed College; and<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/cupa/profile/paul-manson"> Paul Manson</a>, Early Voting Information Center and Portland State University. The paper explores lessons learned from a recent large-scale survey of local election officials in the U.S., highlighting the difficulties in assembling a valid survey population and in obtaining responses in a time of increased concern about elections and cybersecurity.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ujfa5wndhcskgte/Gibson_SPSA_2019%20011419.pdf?dl=0"> Privatized Democracy: How Election Services Vendors Influence the Voting Experience</a> by<a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/graduate/student-profiles/profile.php?id=nsg422"> Nadine Suzanne Gibson</a>, University of Texas at Austin. The paper investigates the impact of four categories of vendor service packages (Election Day support, project management, training, and voter outreach programs) on individual-level election performance indicators in 14 states. Examining survey data from in-person voters in 2016, the study suggests that county purchases of election support and training courses from election vendors have a negligible effect on improving voter experience.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/84m5atxiagzundp/Merivaki%20Florida%20pre-registration%20SPSA%202019.pdf?dl=0"> Uncovering implementation problems in voter registration: The case of youth pre-registration in Florida</a> by<a href="https://www.pspa.msstate.edu/about/faculty/staff.php?id=tm2292&amp;itk=332f0fcfd84d6521ecf9139864f9994f"> Thessalia Merivaki</a>, Mississippi State University. The paper examines the impact of implementation of Florida’s youth pre-registration laws on “on hold” voter registration applications prior to the 2008 Presidential election. Using Miami-Dade and Hillsborough counties as a case study, the study finds evidence of inconsistent implementation at the county level which appears to result from a gap in the effective date of Florida’s more expansive pre-registration law, thus leaving 16- and 17-year-old applicants more vulnerable to having their voter registration applications rejected.</li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Arizona is the only state that does not include<a href="http://kjzz.org/content/750389/constitutional-amendment-voting-rights-proposed-arizona-capitol"> explicit language granting the right vote</a> in its constitution and now a group of lawmakers are hoping to change that with a constitutional amendment, the Arizona Voters Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights would include the ability to register to vote unhindered, equal access to the ballot and guarantee that every vote is counted.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Legislation has been introduced that would protect the private data—phone numbers, addresses, birth dates—of 16- and 17-year-olds who have<a href="http://news.wjct.org/post/two-florida-lawmakers-move-restrict-teen-voter-information"> pre-registered to vote</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Senate Bill 30 would allow<a href="https://www.allongeorgia.com/georgia-state-politics/bill-proposed-to-allow-overseas-absentee-ballots-to-be-returned-by-fax-or-email/"> absentee ballots</a> for persons living overseas or serving in the military be returned by fax or email.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The House Elections Committee appears poised to support House Bill 1217 that would revamp<a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/house-panel-shakes-up-porter-county-election-reform-plan-to/article_62e4f6cf-a092-50df-98d9-01f85a074c1f.html"> how elections are administered in Porter County</a>. Under the proposed legislation, election directors will be chosen by the county clerk and subject to the bipartisan approval of the five-person election board.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Correction are each considering legislation that would revoke the authority of the secretary of state to prosecute people for<a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article224722135.html"> voter fraud</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> A bill to authorize Minnesota to access<a href="https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2019/01/minnesota-lawmakers-fast-track-election-security-funding/"> federal funds for election security</a> is on the fast track at the Capitol and could be the first major proposal to pass in the 2019 legislative session. The proposal passed through two House committees this week and a key Republican lawmaker is leading the effort in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: A bill, which has the backing of Secretary of State William Gardner would forbid future<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/bill-targets-spending-nh-secretary-state-races#stream/0"> candidates for the secretary’s office</a> from forming political committees to fundraise. &#8220;Our duty is to keep that position non-partisan. And when there&#8217;s money thrown around it becomes very partisan,&#8221; said Rep. David Love (R-Derry).</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: A bill being reviewed by a House committee would allow felons to maintain their<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224944505.html"> voting rights</a> even after they are convicted.</p>
<p>Other pieces of<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1271967/democrats-push-host-of-election-proposals.html"> election reform legislation</a> moving through the Legislature include a bill that would enter New Mexico in the National Popular Vote pact, a bill implementing automatic voter registration and same day registration.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Senate Bill 363 would require any state senator or representative who resigns, is removed from office or expelled to use any remaining funds from their campaign funds to help defray the<a href="https://kfor.com/2019/01/18/proposed-bill-would-force-ousted-lawmakers-to-pay-for-special-elections/"> costs of special election</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> A package of<a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/local/pennsylvania-democrats-propose-new-voting-registration-bills/1714180864"> election reform bills</a> is being championed by Democrats. The bills include proposals to allow early voting, vote-by-mail, Election Day holidays, same-day registration and automatic voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Sen. Brenda Gilmore (D-Nashville) has introduced a bill that would allow<a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/tennessee-lawmakers-want-voting-rights-restored-to-convicted-felons"> ex-felons to have their voting rights</a> before they have cleared any financial debt, although they would have to show they are on payment plan. The legislation would not apply to anyone convicted of sex crimes or crimes using a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> House Bill 2034 would require local electoral boards to<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/virginia-lawmakers-consider-creating-new-job-protections-for-election-officials/article_f017f701-26d4-577a-a782-2ada9d7b3662.html"> remove registrars</a> through the court system instead of the current system which allows two of the three electoral board members to decide to oust a registrar.</p>
<p>Also in Virginia, State Sen. Adam Ebbin (D-30th District) has introduced a bill that would allow localities to move to a<a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/arlington/legislation-on-instant-runoff-voting-awaits-senate-committee/article_b7ce3790-1cd2-11e9-b409-9f47ec23c3d6.html"> ranked choice voting</a> system for boards of supervisor and city council elections beginning in 2020.</p>

According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, Grubbs said while she “respected” the argument there may be some issues with the entire voting system, the plaintiffs did not prove specific problems with the recording of ballots in the lieutenant governor’s race that would alter the outcome of the election.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Wake County Superior County Judge Paul Ridgeway has denied candidate Mark Harris’ request to certify his victory in the<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article224889035.html"> 9th District Congressional race</a> even as the investigation into election fraud is ongoing. The state elections board “has authority under (state law) to initiate and consider complaints on its own motion,” Ridgeway said. “Until a protest is resolved there is no requirement the board must certify an election.”</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Judy Guinn, 70, of Piney Flats has been indicted for allegedly committing<a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/01/18/sullivan-co-woman-voter-fraud-charge-nov-election/2617049002/"> voter fraud</a> in November 2016. An investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation alleges that Guinn cast an early ballot despite being a convicted felon.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> A Travis County district court ruled Thursday that Austin violated the state’s open carry law by barring residents from bringing firearms into its city hall which also<a href="https://www.news-journal.com/travis-county-court-says-austin-must-allow-guns-in-its/article_7970c6e8-1ab6-11e9-ac9f-eff1623dae56.html"> serves as a polling place</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Following an investigation by the Grand County Attorney’s office, County Attorney Andrew Fitzgerald chose not file<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/01/17/san-juan-county-clerk-who/"> criminal charges</a> against San Juan County Clerk John David Nielson for illegally removing a candidate from the November ballot. However, San Juan County Attorney Kendall Laws has now asked another county attorney from Davis County<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/01/19/he-thought-he-avoided/"> to take another look</a> at the case.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> U.S. District Judge James Peterson has ruled that laws enacted during the<a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/courts/lame-duck-voting-laws-violate-court-order-federal-judge-rules/article_5fd6369d-2729-5b68-9a92-bd894474937e.html"> lame duck session of the Legislature</a> violate a federal court order issued in 2016 that voided similar restrictions. in a five-page ruling, agreed to issue an order enforcing injunctions against time limits for in-person absentee voting, restrictions on the use of student identification cards for voting and time limits on the validity of temporary identification cards issued under a process called the ID Petition Process. “This is not a close question,” Peterson wrote according to the <em>Wisconsin State Journal.</em> “The three challenged provisions are clearly inconsistent with the injunctions that the court has issued in this case.”</p>
