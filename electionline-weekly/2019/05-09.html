							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>County elections offices give back<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public service doesn’t end on Election Day for these elections offices</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week is</span><a href="https://psrw.ourpublicservice.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Public Service Recognition Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1985, PSRW is celebrated the first week of May  to honor the men and women who serve as federal, state, county and local government employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ARAuditor/status/1126145687152934912"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blood drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to canned food drives to coat collections, state and county elections offices go above and beyond the public service they perform as defined by their job description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In honor of PSRW, electionline Weekly thought we’d take a look at three elections offices that are giving back to their communities through more than just voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also know there are so many more state, county and local elections offices that serve their communities and we’d love to hear from you so we can highlight in future editions of electionline Weekly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Brevard County, Florida</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the nine years that she has been in office,</span><a href="https://www.votebrevard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brevard County Supervisor of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lori Scott has spearheaded several charitable initiatives to assist the community including the office’s annual participation in the WESH Share Your Christmas Food Drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To-date the office has collected more than 3,100 pounds of non-perishable food which is donated to the Second Harvest Food Bank that provides food and basic needs to more than 500 organizations across Central Florida.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3906" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3906" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3906" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brevard-300x142.png" alt="" width="300" height="142" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brevard-300x142.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brevard-768x365.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brevard-1024x486.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brevard.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3906" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Some of the perishable items donated by Brevard County. Photo Courtesy of Brevard County Supervisor of Elections.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly Dale, communications director said the feedback from residents of Brevard has been very positive. hey have expressed their gratitude for the efforts of the office to help those less fortunate, have a holiday season filled with joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the good works of the supervisor of elections office don’t end with the holidays. The office participates in multiple charitable events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is so important to be involved in your community and I am passionate about mine!” Supervisor Scott said. “Knowing the needs of my county helps me to determine the best ways to focus our efforts and reach the most people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott noted that one of the fun community initiatives the office does each year is creating a cookbook and holding a bake sale/raffle to raise money for Project HUNGER. Over the past nine years participating in Vote to End Childhood Hunger  the office has raised $26,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, each of the supervisors four administrative offices serves as a drop-off site for cell phones, which they donate to “Cell Phones For Soldiers”. The donated items benefit active-duty troops and veterans. In the fall, staff collects school supplies and backpacks and donates them to Brevard Public Schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also participate in many charitable fundraisers including March for Babies and walks for the American Heart Association, Scott said. “I am blessed with a staff that is as passionate about our community as I am!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Harford County, Maryland</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, staff from the</span><a href="https://harfordvotes.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harford County Board of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visited some of the senior centers in the county, but this time it wasn’t to help the residents with absentee voting, this time it was do a something a little different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Harford County extended a ‘Day of Service’ to us. We thought it would be a great idea to broaden our relationship with our local assisted living and senior centers,” explained Sarah Mohan, program manager, social media and outreach. “We got in touch with United Way who brought us all of the donated supplies to create hygiene care kits for the residents. Our entire office participated in packing the supplies and delivering the kits. The best part was creating little notes of encouragement for the recipients with quotes and drawings.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3907" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3907" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3907" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harford-Co-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harford-Co-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harford-Co-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harford-Co.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3907" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Hygiene bags are packed and ready for distribution. Photo Courtesy of Harford County Board of Elections</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs associated with the giveaway were covered by the county. Mohan said the residents were extremely grateful and excited by the visit and donation. She noted that they knew ahead of time the election office staff would be stopping by and the residents were waiting for the elections staff to arrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will absolutely be doing this in the future,” Mohan said. “We recently started doing a team building activity each month and this was a great way to kick it off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohan said that county elections offices considering to do additional service work should look close to home and look where there is the greatest need. It doesn’t have to be costly and it doesn’t have to be grand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is amazing how much even something we take for granted, like a hygiene kit, can brighten someone’s day,” Mohan said. “We gained a friendship from an existing election-ship which strengthens our bond with the people we serve every day that much more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Weber County, Utah</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running an election is a marathon not a sprint so it seemed to make sense that the</span><a href="http://www.weberelections.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weber County Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team would choose to volunteer their time running a water aid station in the Ogden Marathon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ogden Marathon, a qualifier for the Boston Marathon, is one of the largest events held in the county typically 7,000 participants run the full or half marathon. Running an aid station entails filling up water jugs the day before, setting up the water station area and keeping it free of trash and safe for the runners and then passing out water and Gatorade to them as they run past.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3908" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3908" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3908" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Weber-Co-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Weber-Co-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Weber-Co.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3908" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Weber Co. Elections staff hand out water to passing runners. Photo courtesy of Weber County Elections.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Weber Elections water station is located at mile 14 (mile 1 for the half marathoners) at the top of the course’s toughest hill. Race coordinators encourage each ambassador group to develop a theme for their aid station and so naturally, Weber Elections used political themes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We set up funny/motivational political-themed signs to entertain/encourage the runners during this uphill leg of the course. We bring our families, including younger kids, and they have a blast. The runners really appreciate it,” said Clerk Ricky Hatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such family volunteer dressed as Uncle Sam and handed out licorice to all the passing runners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting the water station is part of the election office’s Winning in Weber program that is designed to engage students, veterans, teens, seniors, individuals with disabilities and children in the electoral process. Winning in Weber won a</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/weber-county-ut-2018-clearinghouse-award-winner/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2018 Clearie Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This year [May 18] will be the third year that we volunteer,” explained Ryan Cowley, elections director. “This has been a fun and rewarding way for us to give back a little bit to the community.”</span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a hearing before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, FBI Director Christopher Wray told senators that “there are still</span><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/fbi-director-wants-game-election-interference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more messages to be sent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to Russia when it comes to interference in American elections, as the bureau prepares to combat foreign meddling efforts during the 2020 elections. According to <em>Roll Call</em>, the FBI requested a total of $9.31 billion, which includes increases of $70.5 million to enhance cyber investigative capabilities and $18.3 million to mitigate threats from foreign intelligence services, Wray told the panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following testimony from Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D), Zoe Lofgren (D-California) chair of the House Administration Committee said that</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/442803-house-administration-committee-to-make-election-security-a-primary-focus"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election security would be a primary focus of the committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal action is needed now to grasp the scope of the problem and to innovate concrete solutions that can be implemented before the next federal election cycle in 2020,” Lofgren said according to <em>The Hill</em>. “This goal will be a primary focus of this committee moving forward. No matter your side of the aisle, the oath of upholding democracy as citizens and elected leaders is fundamental.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald J. Trump (R) has issued an</span><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/trump-creates-new-cybersecurity-competition-with-a-25000-award"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive order that directs the Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with the Office of Management and Budget to create a rotational program that will “serve as a mechanism for knowledge transfer” across agencies. The order is an attempt to address a shortage of cybersecurity workers across the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to<em> Roll Call</em>, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of DHS, along with OMB and other agencies will also develop an annual cybersecurity competition for federal employees called the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition, the order said. The first such challenge will be held in 2019 and will award at least $25,000 to the winner, according to the order.</span></p>

							<h2>2019  Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters went to the polls in several states and localities this week and while overall things went well, there were some notable issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Hoosier State, over all voting was smooth, especially in those counties that were testing</span><a href="https://www.goshennews.com/multimedia/video-voters-talk-new-voting-machines/video_37675e86-7116-11e9-8159-dff20d58bb07.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new voting equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Several polling places opened late for a variety of reasons including school staff that showed up late to open the polling place. However there were bright spots like faster results.  And finally, cheers to Jan Rhodes in Evansville who spend her day not only serving as a</span><a href="https://www.tristatehomepage.com/election/your-local-election/election-worker-dresses-as-aunt-samantha-/1986964938"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll worker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but did so dressed as Aunt Samantha.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Waterville, Maine Voter Registration Appeals Board has ruled unanimously</strong> that</span><a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2019/05/03/waterville-appeals-board-upholds-rights-of-colby-students-to-vote-in-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 66 voters whose registrations were challenged are in fact valid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the basis that they had taken oaths of residency and provided proof of physical address. The 66 voters in questions? Students and faculty members at Colby College. The voter registration challenges began over a referendum to ban plastic bags. According to the <em>Morning Sentinel</em>, The voter registrations that were looked at this week represent voters who went through hearings before the city clerk to verify their residency after a recount of the referendum forced the city to re-examine the challenged ballots. The clerk’s determination on the registrations is what the challengers had questioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The saga of the Porter County, Indiana clerk’s office continues</strong>. New Clerk Jessica Baily recently discovered</span><a href="http://www.chestertontribune.com/Porter%20County/clerk_thousands_in_election_expe.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than $72,000 in outstanding expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the 2018 election. According to the <em>Chesterton Tribune</em>, Bailey was approved to transfer $5,000 from her office supply funds to legal notices and to transfer $15,000 from her food and groceries line item to cover the outstanding expenses for legal notices and contractual services in the 2018 election and to have a balance remaining in those funds for 2019 primary expenses. Bailey told the council that she believes she has found all the outstanding balances from 2018 but that she may need more money to make up for the expenses she paid from her 2019 budget.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates </h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Florida Reps. Ted Deutch (D) and Alcee Hastings (D) have introduced the Protecting American Votes Act that election officials to make two attempts to notify voters when their</span><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-mail-voting-federal-protection-20190507-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballots are rejected based on a signature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mismatch. Notifications would have to be made by mail and either by text, phone call or email; voters would get at least 10 days from the date of notice to resolve the mismatch. They would be allowed to verify their identity and ensure their vote is counted; and officials who review signatures will have to get formal training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alabama:</strong> House Bill 174 would simplify the voting process for those with disabilities by allowing them to be on a</span><a href="https://www.dothanfirst.com/news/politics/bill-proposed-to-improve-voting-rights-for-disabled-citizens/1974562612"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permanent absentee voter list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Alabama, the Secretary of State’s office is advocating for a bill that would increase the penalties someone faces for tampering with electronic voting machines. Currently it is a misdemeanor to tamper or misuse an electronic voting machine. The bill would make it a</span><a href="https://www.wtvm.com/2019/05/03/bill-would-increase-penalties-tampering-with-voting-machines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Class B felony to tamper with, hack or manipulate the machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Colorado:</strong> The Legislature has approved SB 19-235 which, if signed by the governor, will expand opportunities for people to</span><a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/politics/colorado-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-governors-desk-expanding-automatic-voter-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatically register to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the measure, anyone who applies for a new or renewed driver’s license or ID card at a Colorado DMV location will have their data sent directly to the Secretary of State’s Office. If the person has provided proof of citizenship, their respective county clerk will review the information and send the person a postcard notifying them they will be registered to vote at that address. The potential voter will then have 20 days to accept the registration and choose to register with a party, or to decline the registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The Senate has approved a measure to create an</span><a href="https://ctmirror.org/2019/05/08/senate-endorses-early-voting-but-not-with-margin-to-get-on-2020-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system. However, the 23-13 margin falls four short of what was needed to put the measure on the ballot as required by law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> The Senate gave final approval to a bill that would require</span><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-florida-senate-felon-voting-20190503-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formerly incarcerated residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fulfill all the financial obligations of their sentence before having their voting rights reinstated. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has said that he</span><a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190507/desantis-to-sign-felons-voting-measure/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will sign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The Springfield city council is considering an ordinance that would require the city to</span><a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2019/05/springfield-city-council-considers-postcards-robocalls-to-boost-dismal-voter-turnout.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> send postcards and robocalls to all voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in advance of every election. It is estimated it would cost the city $30,000-$40,000 per election due to postage and printing costs. “Our democracy and local government benefit from having as many people at the table as possible,” City Councilor Jesse Lederman said in a prepared release according to <em>The Republic</em>. “The steady decline in voter turnout across the country is concerning — and locally, we should be working to engage people. It is important that we start this conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Gov. Phil Murphy (D) has signed a bill into law that would permit a county commissioner of registration and board of elections use</span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/diegnan-greenstein-e-polling-bill-signed-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e-poll books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The law will require the Secretary of State to adopt and publish electronic poll books standards and regulations governing the certification and use of electronic poll books within 90 days.  If the Secretary of State receives a request for approval to review compliance of standards, regulations and all capabilities of electronic poll books, it will be reviewed within 10 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Gov. Bill Lee (R) has signed a bill into law that will punish</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/03/voter-registration-groups-sue-block-tennessee-law-with-tough-penalties-signup-mistakes/?utm_term=.2b6075d2eb5e"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third-party registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> groups that turn in late registration forms or turn in forms that are not correct or complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Tennessee, the Nashville Metro Council defeated an effort to put</span><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/05/08/ranked-choice-voting-nashville-rejected-council/3551337002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The House has approved a bill will allow parents with small children to use</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/05/07/Texas-House-bill-curbside-voting-parents-/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> curbside voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if their polling place chooses to offer it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Senate&#8217;s elections committee voted unanimously to recommend confirmation of Meagan Wolfe as leader of the state Elections Commission, more than a year after she started the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Wisconsin, legislation was voted out of committee in the House that will legalize</span><a href="http://www.startribune.com/wisconsin-voters-could-take-selfies-with-ballot-under-bill/509585472/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot selfies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Badger State.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> The state Supreme Court is mulling whether to reverse a lower court&#8217;s dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the outcome of November&#8217;s race for lieutenant governor in a case that focuses attention on the state&#8217;s outdated voting machines. The lawsuit says</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/georgia-high-court-to-hear-appeal-in-election-challenge/18370057/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tens of thousands of votes were never recorded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the race and the contest was &#8220;so defective and marred by material irregularities&#8221; as to place the result in doubt. It contends an unexplained undervote in the race was likely caused by problems with the state&#8217;s paperless touchscreen voting machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Secretary of State Allison Lundergan Grimes filed suit in Franklin County Circuit Court this week seeking an</span><a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2019/05/07/alison-lundergan-grimes-contests-law-removing-her-elections-board-power/1127680001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> injunction against the state’s new law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that removes the secretary of state’s power over the state board of elections. In her suit, Lundergan Grimes warns that without the oversight, “confusion and uncertainty” will surround the upcoming primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michigan</strong>: Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) has settled a 2016 lawsuit that challenged the state ban on</span><a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2019/05/08/michigan-lifts-ban-ballot-selfies/1140259001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot selfies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under terms of the deal, which was reached in April, but only reported this week, voters will be able to take a photo of their voted ballot, but they may not take a selfie of themselves in a polling place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Prosecutors have</span><a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/06/voter-fraud-case-charges-dropped-canton-mississippi-manslaughter-sherman-matlock/1094457001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped voter fraud charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Sherman Matlock, 44 of Canton. Matlock was accused of signing an affidavit and voting in Canton&#8217;s municipal election in 2017 when he allegedly knew he was disqualified because of a 1993 conviction for manslaughter. Mississippi law does not include manslaughter as one of the 22 felony crimes that would disqualify someone from voting. Matlock spent a month in jail before the case was dismissed because he was unable to make bond.</span></p>

Sununu and Secretary of State Gardner that we’re not going anywhere and that the student vote is important,” Quincy Abramson, a UNH student from Concord told the <em>Union Leader</em>. “They can’t drown out our voices, and in the upcoming election we will show them that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The Middlesex County prosecutor’s office has announced a new initiative to target voter fraud, specifically for mail-in ballots. Andrew C. Carey told <em>NewJersey.com</em> that his office would work the board of elections and the county’s 28 police departments on the new</span><a href="https://www.nj.com/middlesex/2019/05/middlesex-prosecutor-announces-initiative-targeting-voter-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voter Integrity Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “There is a concern with fraud, and we’re trying to combat it,” Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey said in an interview last week. “This is not to prevent people from voting. We want to make sure everyone can vote safely and that their votes count.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The State Board of Elections has issued guidance to 32 county elections board with instructions on how to pull voting histories, signed poll books and redacted ballots dating back several elections</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/elections-board-directs-counties-to-turn-over-data-on-hundreds-of-nc-voters-in-federal-probe/18361497/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in response to subpoenas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of North Carolina in 2018.</span></p>

According to NPR, it will also allow election officials and third parties to verify election results to make sure there was no interference with the results. It&#8217;s very much like the cybersecurity version of a tamper-proof bottle,&#8221; said Tom Burt, Microsoft&#8217;s vice president of customer security and trust, in an interview with NPR. &#8220;Tamper-proof bottles don&#8217;t prevent any hack of the contents of the bottle, but it makes it makes it harder, and it definitely reveals when the tampering has occurred.&#8221;</span></p>
