							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>And the &#8220;Clearie&#8221; goes to&#8230;.</strong><br />
<em>EAC announces recipients of the 2018 Clearinghouse Awards for Best Practices in Election Administration</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) today announced the recipients of the 2018 Clearinghouse Awards for best practices in election administration, also known as the “Clearie” Awards. Born of the EAC’s mandate to serve as a national clearinghouse of information on election administration, the annual “Clearie” awards recognize best practices in election administration and highlight exemplary models which can serve as examples to other officials and jurisdictions. This year’s award categories celebrate excellence in election innovations, voting accessibility and the recruitment, training and retention of election workers.</p>
<p>“Election officials are some of the greatest civic leaders our nation has to offer,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks. “They are tasked with being the stewards of the bedrock of our democracy, who often implement innovative solutions with limited budgets and zero margin for error. The annual Clearie awards give the EAC an opportunity to recognize their vital contributions on a national stage and highlight best practices within the field of election administration. Each recipient of this award represents the very best of what it means to be an election administrator. We at the EAC applaud them for their dedication, and hope their work can serve as an example to others.”</p>
<p>Now in its third year, the “Clearie” awards recognize the innovative efforts of election officials across America. Entries were judged based on each initiative’s efficacy, innovation, sustainability, outreach efforts, cost-effectiveness and replicability. This year’s honorees are:</p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Innovations in Election Administration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>City of Rochester Hills, Michigan – For its Election Day Precinct Support Portal which allowed precinct workers to submit requests or questions via a smart phone or tablet using a simple Google Form.</li>
<li>New Mexico Secretary of State – For its electronic ballot software system, launched in the spring of 2018, which allowed blind or visually impaired voters to independently cast an absentee ballot.</li>
<li>Weber County, Utah – For its “Winning in Weber” program to engage students, veterans, teens, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and children in the electoral process.</li>
<li>Wisconsin Elections Commission – For “Securing WisVote,” a series of online learning modules which enhanced the cybersecurity of the state-wide election database and in local governments statewide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contra Costa County, California – For its “A Simple (Accessible) Path for All” initiative which included Accessible Polling Place Location and Equipment (APPLE) classes and follow up kits that provided instruction on establishing and maintaining accessible polling places.</li>
<li>Martin County, Florida – For “Count Me in Too,” a series of educational videos which helped increase voter registration and turnout among voters who indicated they had special needs by 8 percent during the 2016 Presidential Elections.</li>
<li>Iowa Secretary of State – For the Helping Veterans and Iowans with Disabilities Vote Project educated thousands of veterans and Iowans with disabilities about resources available to help them vote privately and independently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practices in Recruiting, Training and Retaining Election Workers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Montgomery County, Maryland – For the Future Vote Initiative, which since 2004, has recruited 43,619 students from grades 6 to 12 to participate in elections, including over 10,000 who have served as election judges after their sixteenth birthday.</li>
<li>The City of Ely, Minnesota – For their partnership with nonprofit “Walking Civics,” on a program that connected high school students and veterans to serve at the polls together on Election Day.</li>
<li>Bernalillo County, New Mexico – For “Learn the Vote,” a new online training program for election workers which reduced instruction time, decreased election worker errors and allowed the Clerk’s Office to redirect staff time towards completing post-election procedures more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year’s Clearie awards are dedicated to the life and legacy of<a href="https://www.eac.gov/documents/2018/07/30/eac-commissioners-issue-joint-statement-honoring-wendy-noren-/"> Wendy Noren</a> and R. Brian Lewis. Wendy Noren served as Boone County Clerk for over three decades and was a member of the EAC’s Board of Advisors before passing away in March 2018 following a long battle with cancer. R. Brian Lewis served as Counsel to the Office of the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee before his passing, and was an early and steadfast proponent of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and election officials. Both were luminaries in the field of election administration who will long be remembered for their hard work, integrity and friendship.</p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC’s 2018 Clearinghouse Awards: Sharing Best Practices in Election Administration</strong></p>
<p>By Thomas Hicks, chairman<br />
U.S. Election Assistance Commission</p>
<p>This week, the EAC announced the winners of our 2018 Clearinghouse Awards for Best Practices in Election Administration. The awards, also known as the Clearies, provide election offices across America an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</p>
<p>Through HAVA, the EAC works to help implement sweeping election reforms, assist states in certifying voting systems, advance voting accessibility, and serve as a clearinghouse of election information. When lawmakers drafted HAVA, bipartisan legislation to modernize elections across America, I like to think they envisioned EAC programs such as the Clearies.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the 2018 Clearies featured three categories: outstanding innovations in elections; best practices related to the recruiting, training, and retaining of election workers; and accessibility for voters with disabilities.</p>
<p>This year’s competition was conducted in honor of the life of Wendy Noren, the former Clerk of Boone County, Missouri, and R. Brian Lewis, the former Council of the U.S. Senate Rules and Administration Committee. Both Wendy and Brian were great friends of the elections community, and their positive impact on elections continues today. On a personal note, I came to know both Wendy and Brian well through EAC activities and my stint on Capitol Hill. We truly miss them and hope this competition serves in memory of their tremendous contributions.</p>
<p>Given the November 2018 midterm elections, the awards offered an excellent platform to highlight new programs. We received dozens of submissions from jurisdictions, both small and large, as well as individuals across the elections community. An independent panel of election officials from the EAC’s Board of Advisors and Standards Board served as judges.</p>
<p>Following a very competitive vote, we were pleased to announce 10 recipients. Please take a minute to follow this link and read about the honorees. The entries offered great insight and exemplified the can-do spirit of election officials. Our Clearie recipients exhibited a wide range of populous, from a city of 3,500 to a state with more than three million registered voters. We share their results so that other jurisdictions might replicate or build upon their efforts.</p>
<p>The winners in the outstanding innovations category addressed important election administration issues, such as cybersecurity training for local officials, overall efforts to effectively operate an election office, programs to extend accessible absentee ballots to underrepresented populations and ways to harness off-the-shelf technology in supporting Election Day operations.</p>
<p>In the accessibility for voters with disabilities category, our honorees showcased their efforts in training poll workers to better serve the needs of voters with disabilities, a coordinated effort for helping veterans and individuals with disabilities vote, and video outreach to assist people who are deaf.</p>
<p>Finally, the election worker competition highlighted great results of using high school students as poll workers, efforts to modernize training initiatives, and connecting veterans and students to serve at the polls.</p>
<p>From advancing cybersecurity training at the local level or helping veterans with disabilities in the elections process, the 2018 EAC Clearinghouse Awards are a testament to election officials’ leadership efforts across the U.S.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will continue highlighting the Clearie winners through blogs and additional outreach. On behalf of my three fellow Commissioners, I am pleased to follow through on the promise of HAVA by awarding EAC Clearies to these well-deserving state and local election officials.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Hicks has served as Chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for two terms. During his time with the Commission, Mr. Hicks has focused his efforts on increasing voting accessibility, including developing a<a href="https://www.eac.gov/documents/2016/10/14/your-federal-voting-rights-card-federal-voting-rights/"> guide to voting rights for voters with disabilities</a> and creating a help desk to address ballot delivery issues for overseas voters.</em></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>Christopher Krebs, chief of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said this week at a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee that the<a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2019/02/13/krebs-hicks-house-homeland-audits.aspx"> ability to audit voting machines</a> after elections is critical for ballot security.</p>
<p>&#8220;The area that I think we need to invest the most in the nation is ensuring auditability across infrastructure,&#8221; Krebs said according to FCW. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening and you can&#8217;t check back at what&#8217;s happening in the system &#8212; you don&#8217;t have security.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Politico</em> has an interesting article this week about Sen. Ron Johnson’s (R-Wisconsin) leadership of the<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/cybersecurity-ron-johnson-1160081"> Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee</a>. According to Politico, although there is no official account of cybersecurity bills in Congress, Third Way, a centrist think tank that works on tech policy, counted 15 bills that passed the House and did not advance out of the committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The record speaks for itself,&#8221; former House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) told <em>Politico</em>, expressing frustration over the fact that Johnson hasn’t advanced cybersecurity bills that his panel approved.</p>
<p>Johnson and his staff disagreed with Politico’s assessment.</p>
<p>“Protecting our nation against ever-evolving cyber threats is a significant challenge and one I take very seriously,” Johnson said in a statement to <em>Politico</em>. “We will continue our bipartisan, aggressive oversight and legislative efforts in the 116th Congress.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>We’d be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge that today is Valentine’s Day</strong> and so we’re going to share a love poem for elections from Ohio’s Director of Elections Amanda Grandjean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Freedom doesn’t come free,<br />
The American flag shines valiantly in red, white, and blue,<br />
Voting is a privilege,<br />
Thank you, election officials, for all that you do!</p>
<p><strong>This week, Kansas Elections Director Bryan Caskey told the Kansas House Elections Committee</strong> that<a href="http://www.hutchnews.com/news/20190213/kansas-elections-director-crosscheck-last-used-in-2017-when-audit-found-security-risks"> the state hasn’t used the Interstate Crosscheck program since 2017</a> following a Department of Homeland Security audit that discovered vulnerabilities in the system. According to the <em>Hutchinson News</em>, Caskey said Secretary of State Scott Schwab has ordered a review of Crosscheck to determine whether to abandon the program all together and that moving forward the state would be using HAVA 2 funds to join ERIC.</p>
<p><strong>Small towns making big news!</strong> This week, two small towns made big elections news. In Ohio, the town of Sandusky (pop. est. 24,845) has decided to<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/08/692771542/sandusky-ohio-makes-election-day-a-paid-holiday-by-swapping-out-columbus-day"> swap the Columbus Day holiday for a holiday on Election Day</a>. &#8220;A lot&#8217;s happened in the last three years that had us thinking a lot about voter access and democracy, and so we thought it was a really natural switch,&#8221; Sandusky City Manager Eric Wobser told NPR. In 2014 negotiations with the unions that represent police, firefighters, and municipal workers, the city suggested dropping Columbus Day, but giving up a paid holiday was a non-starter, Wobser says. So when negotiations for 2019-2021 started up last year, the city had a new proposal: replacing Columbus Day with Election Day. The unions agreed. About 800 miles east, the town of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, best known for being the first town to cast ballots, just after midnight, in New Hampshire’s presidential primary, is facing questions about how it administers<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/amid-election-scrutiny-dixville-notch-s-midnight-voting-tradition-could-be-risk#stream/0"> one of America’s most famous primaries</a>. “What started out as an investigation into a complaint involving one voter, who may not have been a resident of Dixville … has appeared to uncover a potentially more pervasive issue with respect to the process in Dixville as a whole,” an investigator for the state attorney general’s office told New Hampshire Public Radio.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t do the crime if you can’t pay the fine</strong>. This week the Oregon Secretary of State’s office announced that it will fine Defend Oregon<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/oregon-secretary-of-state-proposes-95k-fine-for-ballots-turned-in-late.html"> $94,750 for failing to turn in nearly 100 ballots</a> it had collected from voters until after the November 6 election. According to the <em>Oregonian</em>, Oregon law requires people who collect ballots on behalf of other voters to turn them in on time. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 per violation. “In the secretary’s view, the harm of not having a ballot counted is more severe than any other violation of election law,” state elections director Stephen Trout wrote. Defend Oregon has 20 days to decide whether or not they want to request a hearing.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Senate Bill 1188 that would remove voters from the state’s<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2019/02/07/bill-would-purge-inactive-voters-from-permanent-early-ballot-list/"> permanent early voting list</a> if they don’t vote in either the primary or general elections for two consecutive election cycles.</p>

The legislation was billed as a cleanup of state law since the ballots and voting machines it addresses are no longer in use.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Assemblyman Evan Low has reintroduced a constitutional amendment that would lower California’s<a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article226099350.html"> voting age to 17</a>. An amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the state Assembly and Senate, and the approval of voters.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> A bill that would include Colorado in the<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/02/12/colorado-national-popular-vote-bill-electoral-college/"> National Popular Vote</a> Compact passed out of a House committee this week on a party-line vote.

<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> House Bill 5507, cosponsored by Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, and Rep. Terrie Wood, R-Darien would prohibit the disclosure of<a href="http://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/State/Bill-aims-to-protect-voter-privacy.html"> voter registration data</a> for commercial purposes, but would make certain information available to election and political committees. The bill is currently before the Joint Committee on Government Administration and Elections.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Rep. Brett Parker (D-Overland Park) has introduced a bill that would eliminate the<a href="https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Bill-would-end-proof-of-citizenship-requirement-for-voting-505749991.html"> proof-of-citizenship</a> require for voter registration.

Current law allows 17-year-olds to work at the polls as long as they turn 18 on or before Election Day.</p>
<p>The Senate State and Local Government Committee has voted 8-2 to advance a bill that would<a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/2019/02/13/lawmakers-advance-bill-to-lessen-secretary-of-states-duties/"> remove the secretary of state as chairperson</a> of the state board of elections and revoke the secretary’s access to the state’s voter registration database.</p>

<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: A House committee has approved a bill that will limit the number of days available for<a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2019/02/13/south-dakota-lawmakers-vote-roll-back-absentee-voting/2865257002/"> early voting</a>. Although the original bill recommended limiting early voting to 14 days, but the approved bill will allow early voting to begin the first Friday in October which will mean about 21 days of early voting.</p>
