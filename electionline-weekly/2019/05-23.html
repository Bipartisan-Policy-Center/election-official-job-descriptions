							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Knowing It&#8217;s Right</strong><br />
<em>Limiting the Risk of Certifying the Wrong Winner</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick, Elections Program Senior Advisor<br />
The Democracy Fund</p>
<p>Every election we ask ourselves, what motivates voters to participate? Could it be the love of a charismatic candidate? The dislike of a less-than-desirable one? Passion for a specific ballot initiative? Do voters show up to the polls out of habit? The answer is as varied as th<strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3953 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RLA-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="398" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RLA-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RLA-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RLA-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RLA.jpg 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></strong>e voting population, as is the reason voters do not participate.</p>
<p>Research shows that while voters’ confidence in their own vote being counted accurately remains relatively constant, their belief that results at the national level are correct is in decline. As we work through reestablishing trust in our elections following Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month long investigation, the threat of interference in our elections by another nation-state remains.</p>
<p>The American public wants to believe that when they vote it means something—we are teaching elections officials about a new way to audit our elections and check for the accuracy every voter deserves. As with most election administration processes, implementation success lies in preparation—and Risk Limiting Audits (RLAs), which some proponents often refer to as the “cheap and easy” method to check the accuracy of the results, are no exception.</p>
<p>Democracy Fund recently launched the<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/increasing-trust-in-elections-democracy-funds-election-validation-project"> Election Validation Project</a> to increase trust in elections through rigorous audits, standards, and testing. Part of this project is the release of the first <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/rla-practical-guide/">Risk-Limiting Audit report</a> which serves as a summary to capture where we currently stand on risk-limiting audits; an overview of what policymakers need to know; and as a guide or <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/rla-implementation-workbook/">workbook</a> on how practitioners can prepare to implement. The materials demonstrate the rigor that a jurisdiction needs to go through in order to conduct a meaningful audit, the decisions that need to be made along the way, and what to contemplate as this relatively young procedure continues to evolve.</p>
<p>The what and the how of an RLA are not well understood by many, which is why we created guidance for elections administrators to save time, money and ensure that the correct candidate won.</p>
<p>The idea is simple, although not many people have heard of a risk-limiting audit. Risk-limiting audit is a post-election audit that takes a random sample of voted ballots and manually examines those ballots for evidence the originally reported outcome is correct. An RLA limits the risk of certifying a contest with the wrong winner.</p>
<p>We are proud to support Jennifer Morrell, a nationally recognized election official with over eight years of experience managing local elections, to lead the Election Validation Project and spearhead the outreach on this guidance. Morrell’s work in Colorado was instrumental in the successful implementation of the first statewide risk-limiting audit and she has since spent time traveling across the country working on post-election audits. This report is the cumulative documentation of her effort.</p>
<p>We believe sound election administration policy and its practical application can ensure the American electorate is well served and that our democracy is strong. We are dedicated to that work and appreciate all who strive for that ideal along with us.</p>

In</span><a href="https://lex18.com/news/covering-kentucky/2019/05/21/fayette-co-clerk-website-down/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fayette County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the clerk’s website went down.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> With overall low turnout, voting on primary day in the Commonwealth was rather uneventful. Several counties tested their new voting equipment with no major mishaps although voters had plenty to say about the</span><a href="https://www.philly.com/news/pennsylvania/montgomery-county-paper-ballot-system-2019-primary-20190521.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> move to paper ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

							<h2>Election News This Week </h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Memphis Mayor Lee Harris is trying</strong> to  </span><a href="https://www.localmemphis.com/election/your-local-election/shelby-county-mayor-lee-harris-says-no-new-voting-machines-until-commission-changes/2017194149"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put the brakes on spending $5 million on new voting equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He’s asking the county commission before they sign off on the purchase to seek some sort of commitment things to change at the Shelby County Election Commission. &#8220;I lived in Nashville,&#8221; Harris told WATN. &#8220;I served in the State Senate in Nashville for four years. It&#8217;s very different there, because election results come right after elections close. Here it is just a complete cluster. Once they have an election here, getting the results back, it’s a complete cluster.&#8221; Harris is also demanding that the election commission make voting hours uniform across the county, in 2018 an early voting location in a predominately urban area had shorter early voting hours. After a contentious meeting with the county commission and elections officials it was agreed that a committee will be formed to look at the</span><a href="https://www.localmemphis.com/election/your-local-election/committee-formed-to-deal-with-shelby-county-election-snafus/2019489040"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> county’s voting problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how to solve them. &#8220;I am so tired of being sued,&#8221; Harris told reporters following the meeting. &#8220;Our election commission gets sued. When our election commission gets sued, and they get sued all the time, the county picks up the legal tab.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Town Meeting News</strong>: Voters in</span><a href="https://www.wanderer.com/news/voters-defund-town-clerks-salary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted to reduce the fiscal year 2020 town clerk salary line from $19,493 to $0. The current Town Clerk Ray Pickles has been asked to resign following indictment of criminal felony charges. And in</span><a href="https://arlington.wickedlocal.com/news/20190516/arlington-town-meeting-elects-to-give-non-citizens-local-voting-rights"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arlington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Town Meeting members voted to give noncitizens the right to vote in local elections. The vote must be approved by the state Legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This week, Georgia became the 27th state</strong> — and the District of Columbia — to</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-joins-multi-state-voter-registration-and-cancellation-effort/Z0yLAHuQLqH2KsmTPRh1aJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> join ERIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the multistate nonprofit that helps member states maintain their voter rolls. “Joining ERIC is a tremendous step forward for the integrity of Georgia&#8217;s voter rolls, keeping our lists up-to-date and bringing our state to the forefront of election security,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>According to KPVI, the Wyoming Democratic Party has asked</strong> the Fremont County Attorney’s Office to investigate allegations that</span><a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/regional_news/dems-ask-fremont-county-to-investigate-voting-difficulties-on-the/article_c7509c26-db83-5761-9123-079b3d4ad3a2.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters on the Wind River Reservation encountered difficulties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 2018 election. In the complaint, the party outlined two concerns. The first involved tribal members who experienced difficulty voting early after they were allegedly told by an employee at the county clerk’s office in Lander that they needed a valid state driver’s license to vote ahead of Election Day — which is only partially true. The second involved an incident in which a poll worker was perceived to improperly ask voters to read an oath aloud stating they understood election procedures – which Democrats say violated a state law banning literacy tests at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Congratulations to the Virginia Department of Elections</strong> (ELECT) and the Center for Civic Design for</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/NewsRelease/ELECTNewsRelease-05-17-19.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> receiving the Before and After: Print award from the Center for Plain Language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The award recognizes organizations that successfully develop plain language communication. ELECT and CCD were honored for their entry,</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/Election-Management/Election-Day-Instructions-and-Forms/Whatifs-electiondaymaterials_primary_05132019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What Ifs: A Complete Guide for Helping Voters with Exceptional Situations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a guide filled with frequently asked questions and solutions for voters. “We are excited to receive this award from the Center for Plain Language,” Commissioner Christopher Piper said in a statement. “As a government agency, we can no longer rely on a ‘one size fits all’ approach to communications; we have to use a diverse set of tools to be able to reach every eligible voter in our Commonwealth. The work that we do encourages Virginia voters to actively participate in our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Our cup runneth over this week</strong> as both Ohio and Arlington County, Virginia announced the winners of their “I Voted” sticker contests. In</span><a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/21/new-i-voted-sticker-chosen-ohio/3755418002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced the winner for the statewide sticker on Tuesday. The winning sticker was designed by Emily Legg, a high schooler from Pickaway County. More than 15,500 people voted in the contest. We’re not gonna lie, Emily’s sticker was our favorite all along!</span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/arlington/arlington-voting-sticker-contest-proves-a-nail-biter/article_836e8650-7bfd-11e9-b219-5bc604e12cfa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arlington County, Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took their “I Voted” sticker contest to a whole ‘nother level of election geekiness by using ranked choice voting to choose the new sticker. It was a nail-biter with the winning sticker, designed by county resident John Musco, winning with a 0.18 percent margin after four rounds of vote counting.</span></p>

How will decisions be made, and will that make it more difficult for state election officials to protect the security and integrity of the vote?&#8221;</span></p>
