														<p><strong>NASS, partners launch #TrustedInfo2020</strong><br />
<em>Initiative hopes to drive voters to elections officials for trusted election info</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="221" />On Election Night 2019 in Kentucky, as results from the final precincts slowly came in, an army of<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/11/kentucky-elections-2019-thousands-twitter-bots-spread-fake-facts/2564439001/"> Twitter “bots” went to work</a> spreading misinformation that the election had been rigged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immediately at the end of the counting of the votes, these stories started popping up in parallel, all about the election being rigged,&#8221; Gideon Blocq, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://vinesight.com/">VineSight</a> told the <em>Louisville Journal-Courier.</em></p>
<p>Blocqu told the paper that his company witnessed thousands of accounts with “bot-like” automated behavior spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>And while the issue loomed largest in Kentucky, misinformation spread on November 5 in other places as well seeming to set the stage for a contentious 2020.</p>
<p>“At best, it would undermine public confidence and at worst lead to violence and a refusal to accept the results of the election,” MIT’s Charles Stewart<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/social-posts-blame-election-results-on-unsubstantiated-fraud/2019/11/12/6314b844-0577-11ea-9118-25d6bd37dfb1_story.html"> told <em>The Associated Press</em></a>. “People are practicing for the 2020 election. I hope they realize they’re playing with fire.”</p>
<p>Of course November 5 is not the first time this has happened, only the most recent. Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller highlighted instances of  election interference via misinformation campaigns in his<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5955118-The-Mueller-Report.html"> Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election</a>.</p>
<p>And elections officials like<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> West Virginia Secretary of State</a> Mac Warner and<a href="https://www.pascovotes.com/"> Pasco County, Florida Supervisor of Elections</a> Brian Corley have been<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/08-08/"> working to get ahead of</a> misinformation campaigns for a while.</p>
<p>Rolling into the 2020 election cycle, the<a href="https://www.nass.org/"> National Association of Secretaries of State</a> and a host of partner organizations ranging from Twitter and Facebook to the<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> and the<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Election Directors</a> have joined forces on the<a href="https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo-2020"> #TrustedInfo2020</a> initiative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-4767 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trustedinfo2020-300x150.png" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trustedinfo2020-300x150.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trustedinfo2020-768x384.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trustedinfo2020.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;As the 2020 elections begin, American voters must have accurate information about registration and voting, and they need to know where to turn and who they can trust to provide them with that information,” officials from the EAC said in a state. “Disinformation, misinformation, and incorrect messaging hurts voter confidence in our elections and the EAC is continuously working to ensure our elections are accessible, fair, and secure. We recommend that voters verify their registration and any election information with their state and local election officials who are the experts on elections, and we urge all eligible citizens to go vote!&#8221;</p>
<p>#TrustedInfo2020 encourages American citizens to look to their state and local election offi­cials as the trusted sources for election information. Driving voters directly to election officials’ websites and verified social media pages will ensure voters are getting accurate election infor­mation, and cut down on the misinformation and disinformation that can surround elections.</p>
<p>“NASED is proud to work with NASS on #TrustedInfo2020 to encourage voters to find the information they need from official state sources,” said Keith Ingram, NASED president and director of elections for the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/">Texas secretary of state</a>. “Election officials are working hard to secure our election infrastructure, and it’s important that voters get accurate information about their elections from government sources so they don’t fall victim to mis or disinformation campaigns.  We all play a part in securing American elections.”</p>
<p>#TrustedInfo2020 aims to highlight state and local election officials as the credible, verified sources for election information.</p>
<p><a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">Iowa Secretary of State</a> Paul Pate is the current president of NASS. A submitted Q&amp;A with Pate about #TrustedInfo2020 follows.</p>
<p><strong>What is #TrustedInfo2020 and why is it important?</strong><br />
As President of the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) I’m proud to say on Nov. 12 we launched <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4768" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pate.png" alt="" width="250" height="350" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pate.png 250w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pate-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />#TrustedInfo2020—a new year-long education effort to promote election officials as the trusted sources of election information. By driving voters directly to election officials’ websites and social media pages, we will ensure voters are getting accurate election information and cut down on the misinformation and disinformation that can surround elections. #TrustedInfo2020 aims to highlight state and local election officials as the credible, verified sources for election information.</p>
<p>The nation’s Secretaries of State, 40 of whom serve as their state’s chief election official, as well as other election officials are continuously working to inform Americans about the elections process. This includes voter registration, state election laws, voting and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about how you can participate in #TrustedInfo2020 if you aren’t a member of NASS?<br />
</strong>Our message is that state and local election officials are the trusted sources for election information. We are excited that the National Association of State Election Directors, the Election Center and the Election Assistance Commission have joined NASS in this effort! This allows NASS to get the word out to all election officials and not just Secretaries of State. These organizations have received a toolkit that can help them and their folks meaningfully participate in #TrustedInfo2020.</p>
<p>Everyday Americans can help us spread the message too by sharing election information from state and local election officials. People can easily follow officials on social media, just make sure to look for the little blue check to ensure they are verified.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of partners, how did NASS pick partners for #TrustedInfo2020?</strong><br />
NASS wanted to reach out to organizations we have worked with previously in some capacity and whose audiences we needed to reach. These organizations may not always have the same viewpoints on specific issues as NASS, but we can all agree that getting accurate, factual election information out to American citizens is critical for 2020.</p>
<p>NASS currently has 28 partner organizations on board to support and amplify #TrustedInfo2020 messaging, including: Brennan Center for Justice, Campaign Legal Center, Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology, Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, Center for Technology and Civic Life, Council of State Archivists, Council of State Governments, Democracy Fund, Election Center, Electronic Registration Information Center, Facebook, Federal Voting Assistance Program, Google, iCivics, Kids Voting USA, MIT Election Data and Science Lab, National Association of Attorneys General, National Association of State Election Directors, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Governors Association, Nonprofit VOTE, Twitter, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, U.S. Vote Foundation, Verified Voting, Women in Government and YMCA Youth in Government.</p>
<p>NASS is a nonpartisan organization made up of bipartisan officials and it is important to us for #TrustedInfo2020 to be that way as well. We plan to do a second round of partner recruitment in the spring, so stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Do you think #TrustedInfo2020 will have an impact?</strong><br />
I do and here’s why. Our goal as election officials is to educate Americans about election and voting information. There can be a lot of noise around elections in big presidential years, so we have to be out there actively letting people know the accurate information on the who, what, why, where and how of registering and voting. NASS’s #TrustedInfo2020 effort can help us potentially reach millions of eligible voters in a coordinated, concise way. Together we can promote accurate election information so we as a country can successfully participate in our democracy and have confidence in our elections.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be #TrustedInfo2020 stickers (election geeks love stickers)?!<br />
</strong>A resounding YES! There will be a variety of swag available at our 2020 NASS Winter Conference held in D.C. Jan. 30-Feb. 2. Once you get your #TrustedInfo2020 stickers be sure to take a selfie, tag NASS on Twitter (@NASSorg) and use the hashtag #TrustedInfo2020! Let’s make sure we get #ElectionTwitter buzzing about this exciting initiative!</p>

							<h2>Election 2019 Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Ties:</strong> The general public is always in disbelief when an election ends in a tie and we like to point out they happen at least once a cycle and this year was no different. In<a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/akron-canton-news/coin-toss-to-decide-ohio-villages-mayoral-race-40-years-after-coin-toss-decided-last-mayor"> Magnolia, Ohio</a>, the mayor’s race ended in a tie which will be decided by a coin toss. In<a href="https://www.morganton.com/news/coin-toss-decides-council-race-tie/article_d0dddfa6-16a6-552e-8aee-117f5ca469cc.html"> Hildebran, North Carolina</a>, a race for a town council seat ended in a tie. That race too will be decided by a coin toss. In<a href="https://helenair.com/news/local/elections-in-helena-citizens-council-districts-result-in-ties/article_571726d8-4e5e-5c29-99ee-2418af403c90.html"> Helena, Montana</a> not one, not two, but three races for citizens council districts ended in ties. The ballots for each of the tied races will be recounted and if they still end in a tie, a winner will be appointed. The race for<a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/11/13/name-drawn-from-hat-decides-towns-mayoral-race-after-tie-vote/"> Elk Run Heights, Iowa</a> mayor ended in a tie with the race ultimately being decided by the winners name being drawn out of a hat. And in<a href="https://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/20191111/whitehead-drops-out-of-killingly-council-race-grandelski-sole-democrat-elected"> Killingly, Connecticut</a>, after a race for town council ended in a tie, a re-vote was scheduled, however, citing the costs of a re-vote the Republican challenger has yielded the position to the incumbent Democrat.</p>
<p><strong>Early Voting</strong>: Early voting in<a href="https://www.arklatexhomepage.com/top-stories/louisiana-clocks-second-highest-early-voting-numbers-in-history/"> Louisiana</a> came to an end over the weekend with the second-highest early voting numbers since the state began early voting. Nearly half a million people cast their ballots during the roughly one-week early voting window. While the state didn’t break an early voting record several parishes did. In<a href="https://www.govtech.com/news/New-York-Reports-Some-Election-Issues-Related-to-Early-Votes.html"> New York</a>, which held early voting for the very first time in 2019, the jury is still out on whether or not it should be deemed successful with regard to increasing turnout. And some counties did report issues with early voting trickled over and caused issues on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Election Equipment:</strong> While most counties in multiple states successfully rolled out new voting equipment on November 5, there were some notable exceptions and fallout continued a week after Election Day. At press time, it was still unclear what caused the problems with<a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-northampton-county-council-election-fiasco-20191108-4ushkt3l6vhx5ovcnh3clnqjza-story.html"> Northampton County, Pennsylvania’s</a> new voting machines and further complicating matters was the discovery of<a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/northampton-county/2019/11/uncounted-votes-found-in-lower-saucon-wilson-borough-as-ballot-audit-nears.html"> uncounted ballots</a> nearly a week after the election. In<a href="https://www.ydr.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/07/york-county-2019-election-results-all-precincts/2516779001/"> York County, Pennsylvania</a> it took two days for the results to be complete and the governor’s office blamed the state GOP for<a href="https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/2019/11/07/wolf-admin-official-rips-state-gop-over-york-county-election-fracas/2517847001/"> stirring up the issue</a> more than it deserved. New voting equipment in<a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2019-11-06/fleeing-voters-delay-travis-county-count/"> Travis County, Texas</a> presented an interesting problem with 108 voters leaving the polling place without placing their ballot in the ballot scanner. The 108 missing ballots were not within the margin of error for the races. Probably the most universal problem reported was about the lack of privacy surrounding new paper ballot systems. Voters in many states including<a href="https://www.counton2.com/news/your-local-election-hq/awkward-voting-many-feel-the-states-new-voting-system-isnt-very-confidential/"> South Carolina</a> complained about a lack of privacy when casting a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Vote-by-mail</strong>:<a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/government/in-rockvilles-first-vote-by-mail-election-record-participation-was-a-challenge/"> Rockville, Maryland</a> held the state’s first ever all vote-by-mail election with turnout nearly doubling from previous city elections. While turnout was a huge success, that also led to some issues with timely results that left just over a dozen canvassers hand-veryfying thousands of same-day ballots. “I think it’s fair to say that any significant vote-by-mail system is going to require some modifications,” Alysoun McLaughlin, deputy director of the county’s Board of Elections, who oversaw Tuesday’s count told <em>Bethesda Magazine</em>. “The efficiency of the process is something the city, the county, and the state will need to look at, in terms of processing that number of ballots in such a short amount of time.” And in<a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/news/colorado-secretary-of-state-post-office-spar-over-ballots-delivered/article_669ea004-0290-11ea-ae0e-9f51cd7d3481.html"> Colorado</a>, 828 mail ballots didn’t arrive in several areas until Election Day, which complicated issues in razor-thin races. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has called on regulations or legislation requiring the U.S. Postal Service to notify election elections officials of delays in delivering mail ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Recanvass:</strong> At press time, officials in Kentucky’s 120 were conducting a<a href="https://www.somerset-kentucky.com/news/local_news/election-boards-set-to-recanvass-governor-s-race-on-thursday/article_0a0964c7-423a-5bfe-8493-4fdfc5550f5a.html"> recanvass</a> of the state’s gubernatorial election after incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) requested on citing irregularities although he provided<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/11/kentucky-elections-2019-thousands-twitter-bots-spread-fake-facts/2564439001/"> no proof</a> and local elections officials have reported no problems.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>According to <em>The Hill</em> a group of advocacy organizations</strong> let by Stand Up America and including the Sierra Club and Indivisible are pushing the Senate to include</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/469962-advocacy-groups-push-senate-to-include-election-security-money-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election security funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — $600 million—in the upcoming CR to fund the government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time has almost run out to provide states with the resources they need to protect the 2020 election,” the groups wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  (R-Kentucky) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York). “The best opportunity for lawmakers to effectively secure our elections before 2020 is by including $600 million in directed appropriations for election security in the continuing resolution that will extend government funding past November 21, 2019—when current government funding runs out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This week, The Brennan Center for Justice released a new report</strong>,</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/framework-election-vendor-oversight"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A Framework for Election Vendor Oversight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concluding that a lack of federal regulatory pressure on private-sector voting equipment vendors has created dangerous security vulnerabilities. The report recommends: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new federal certification program should be empowered to issue standards and enforce vendors’ compliance;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should reconstitute the EAC’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) to include members with more cybersecurity expertise and empower it to issue best practices for election vendors;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should expand the EAC’s existing voluntary certification and registration power to include election vendors and their various products;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In its expanded oversight role, the EAC should task its Testing and Certification Division with assessing vendors’ ongoing compliance with certification standards; and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There must be a clear protocol for addressing violations of federal guidelines by election vendors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This week, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers</strong> introduced the</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2019/11/13/nist-cyber-bills-moving-on-down-the-road-782301"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Technology Research Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (HR 4990) that would establish and elections systems center of excellence at NIST to promote cooperation between the agency, state and local governments, and academia; direct NIST to provide technical assistance to state and local election officials on implementation of cybersecurity and privacy standards; and authorize research grants for elections systems research and education at NSF. The bill would also expand the 2002 Help America Vote Act definition of “voting systems” to include electronic poll books and voter registration systems.</span></p>

But what if it’s a</span><a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2019/11/13/as-power-shut-offs-increase-california-counties-are-making-plans-for-elections-without-electricity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prolonged and planned power outage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? California counties are facing that prospect for future as elections as power companies in the state shut down the grid more frequently and for longer periods of time to combat the possibility of wildfires. From backup generators to working with  nearby elections offices, counties are planning ahead. “Obviously we’re having to consider [outages] at a level that we hadn’t thought about before,” Jesse Salinas Yolo County’s chief elections official told California Public Radio. “In case for some reason the generator blows, we still need a way to count the ballots.” Yolo County has an agreement with nearby Solano County to use that county’s voting tabulation machines to count ballots. The secretary of state’s office said it is working to secure additional funding for county elections offices so they can buy back-up generators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Beginning in 2020</strong>, Hawaii will move to an</span><a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/11/how-the-counties-are-preparing-for-all-mail-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all vote-by-mail system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and recently the four county clerks and Chief Elections Officer Scott Nago gave an update on preparations to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. Maui, Kauai and Hawaii county have all purchased new vote counting machines, while Honolulu, which modernized its vote counting system in 2014, will purchase eight to 10 half-ton boxes for ballot deposit. According to the Honolulu Civil Beat, between now and election season, Nago said that state and counties will be focusing on voter education, including making people aware that traditional polling places won’t exist anymore. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re understanding that voters don’t necessarily know that,” Nago said. “Now, your polling place will come to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There’s a growing problem in the Jefferson County, Arkansas</strong> election commission office. Literally. There is a</span><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/11/mold-growth-has-election-panelists-hunt-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mold problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the office that is not only putting the health of staff at risk, but is also putting the 150 electronic voting machines stored there at risk. Technicians from a local company came to test the air quality in the office and found that there was significant mold contamination. &#8220;They came in with meters and the lady was disbelieving the readings she was getting in the [personal electronic ballot] room,&#8221; Commissioner Stuart Soffer said at a commission meeting according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. &#8220;So she called me in to look at the readings. The reading in the room was 73,300 particles per cubic foot.&#8221; Because the problem inside the office are so great the commission will now look for a new location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Years before the rest of the country got around to it,</strong> Wyoming became the first state to give women the right to vote in 1869 and on September 6, 1870 Louisa Ann Swain of Laramie became the first woman to vote in a general election. As we move into 2020, the 100th anniversary of national suffrage, the Wyoming Eagle Tribune has an interesting series of articles on</span><a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/suffrage/the-forces-behind-the-suffrage-movement-in-wyoming/article_1ca0a678-88a9-5f9d-9f97-0cb9a7b6bdfe.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suffrage in the Cowboy State</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including one on how suffrage was viewed by</span><a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/suffrage/naive-american-women-look-at-suffrage-anniversary-differently/article_df7ba001-6a3f-5c33-88ba-ef24849b1433.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Native American women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how female</span><a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/suffrage/years-later-female-voting-participation-is-higher-than-ever/article_d2aa66ef-2c29-573e-8470-dcb3f42063e0.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter participation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state today was impacted by those early years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don’t let anyone tell you different, voting is sexy</strong> and this week we’ve got just the news combination to prove it. We rarely (ever?!?!) get to talk about People Magazine’s</span><a href="https://people.com/music/john-legend-sexiest-man-alive-2019-reveal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and elections in the same breath, but lucky us, the 2019 cover star is John Legend. Legend is a longtime advocate for criminal justice reform and he was on hand last week in Miami-Dade when about 20 people with felony convictions and outstanding financial obligations had their</span><a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/11/08/john-legend-miami-dade-court-amendment-4-ex-felons-voting-rights-restored/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting rights restored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While the fate of Amendment 4 plays out in court, Miami-Dade has implemented a process to restore the voting rights of those who still owe financial restitution. “It’s so beautiful to see real people affected by this law are so happy to vote, so many people take it for granted this right to vote and when you lose it I think it makes you realize how important it is and it makes you feel even more joy and accomplishment to come back,” Legend told <em>The Miami Herald</em>. EGOT, People’s Sexiest Man Alive and now featured in electionline Weekly, one might say he&#8217;s quite the Legend.<br />

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://publicinterestlegal.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Public Interest Legal Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PILF) released a</span><a href="https://publicinterestlegal.org/reports/calm-before-the-storm-are-palm-beach-countys-elections-protected-against-emerging-threats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on voter registration in Palm Beach County, Florida last week. The report, Calm Before the Storm: Are Palm Beach County’s Elections Protected Against Emerging Threats?, summarizes findings from PILF’s audit of the county’s voter registration rolls. The report identifies: 225 individuals who appear to have voted twice, once in Palm Beach County and once in another state, during the 2016 and 2018 general elections; 20,479 active voter registration records in New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island that “matched as duplicates” with records in Palm Beach County; 68 instances of voters registered at non-residential addresses; 2,208 registrants who appear to be deceased; 156 instances where voters who appear to be deceased were credited with voting from 2008 to 2018; and 68 cases of voter registration cancellations where citizenship eligibility was the primary factor for removal.</span></p>

The report, Practice-Based Preclearance: Protecting Against Tactics Persistently Used to Silence Minority Communities’ Votes, examines various discriminatory tactics, including: changes to the method of election to entrench majority dominance; redistricting after significant demographic changes; annexations and de-annexations that reduce minority share of the electorate; restrictive identification and proof of citizenship requirements; polling place closures and realignments; and withdrawal of multilingual materials and assistance. The report recommends restoring a practice-based geographic coverage formula for Section 5 and creating a complementary provision that targets known discriminatory practices.</span></p>

O’Sullivan tripped on an exposed cord at her polling place and claims the injuries she suffered were serious and permanent. The setup of the open and exposed electrical wires constituted a defective and hazardous condition and caused (O’Sullivan) to sustain serious and permanent injuries,” the lawsuit alleged. O’Sullivan’s attorney Brian Devane said they hope to resolve the matter without going to trial with the Legislature’s</span><a href="https://www.news10.com/news/local-news/settlement-reached-in-polling-site-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a $225,000 settlement.</span></p>

Common Council File # 191090 directs the city’s Intergovernmental Relations Division to support 2019 Wisconsin Senate Bill 348, which restores the right to vote to certain persons barred from voting as a result of a felony charge, changes the information required on voter registration forms, and changes voting procedures for certain persons who are convicted of felonies.</span></p>

The proposal states that county employees will be allowed paid time off to work at the polling sites. “It is the duty of Milwaukee County to support the cities and villages within its boundaries to support elections,” reads the resolution. It goes onto call this, “an objective which can only be achieved through adequately staffing municipal polling locations to effectively register voters, distribute ballots, count ballots, and report results.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Laura Seeds, wife of an Espanola city councilmember  has been convicted on</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-mexico/articles/2019-11-07/wife-of-espanola-city-councilman-is-convicted-of-voter-fraud"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five counts of felony voter fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She was found guilty of two counts of making false statements relative to the municipal election code, one count of conspiracy to violate the election code and two counts of unlawful possession of another&#8217;s absentee ballot. Laura Seeds was accused of forging signatures on absentee ballots to get her husband elected. Prosecutors say she is facing more than 7 ½ years in prison at her Dec. 9 sentencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: State Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Nichols has rejected a request for a court order invalidating</span><a href="https://www.recordonline.com/news/20191111/judge-tosses-challenge-of-rules-weakening-elections-watchdog"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rules that govern an independent elections watchdog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nichols ruled that the Board of Elections’ commissioners have broad authority to issue such regulations, which include allowing anyone under investigation to seek to quash subpoenas. Commissioners voted in 2018 to require the state’s independent enforcement counsel to justify in writing each subpoena they want to issue when investigating alleged campaign finance and election law cases. Board members said the change gives them greater oversight over important investigations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed a federal district judge’s ruling that Texas was violating federal law by failing to</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/11/13/appeals-court-overturns-court-order-online-voter-registration-texas-dr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> register residents to vote when they updated their driver’s licenses online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The panel of three federal judges that considered the case did not clear the state of wrongdoing but instead determined that the three Texas voters who had brought the lawsuit did not have standing to sue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty has filed a federal lawsuit against the Wisconsin Elections Commission alleging that the commission has</span><a href="https://www.apg-wi.com/news/state/conservative-group-filing-lawsuit-against-state-elections-commission-s-voter/article_c0584bc1-c60b-563b-9368-837405c319bb.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violated state law by not removing 234,000 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whom may have moved from the state’s voter rolls. “The Wisconsin Election Commission was warned in October that they were acting contrary to state law by allowing voter registrations at old addresses to remain active beyond 30 days,” WILL president and general counsel Rick Esenberg said in a statement. “Instead of reversing course, the Wisconsin Election Commission has stubbornly doubled down. This lawsuit is about accountability, the rule of law, and clean and fair elections.”</span></p>

Wyden wrote that he is “very concerned about the significant security risks associated with voting over the internet.” He cited the National Academy of Sciences, which recommended in 2018 that no internet voting be used until much stricter security measures can be put into place.</span></p>

And in Guilford County,</span><a href="https://www.rhinotimes.com/news/county-tells-state-what-it-can-do-with-its-new-voting-machine-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the county commission has spoken out a state mandate to purchase new equipment and it’s unclear if the votes will be there to authorize the purchase. “If the General Assembly thinks they can do a better job running the elections, they can come on into Guilford County and do it,” Commissioner Justin Conrad said according to the <em>Rhino Times</em>.</span></p>

							<h2>2019 Clearie Awards</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC opens submission period in Fourth Annual Clearie Awards</strong><br />
<em>Celebrating best practices in election administration</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="304" height="304" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking submissions for its fourth annual national Clearinghouse Awards. Dubbed the “Clearies” for short, the awards provide election offices an opportunity to share their innovative efforts and celebrate successes. The Clearies play an important role in furthering the EAC’s responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). Under that Act, the EAC serves as a clearinghouse for election administration information.</p>
<p>The Commission will present awards in the categories of outstanding innovations in elections, improving voting accessibility for voters with disabilities, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. It will also award a special award in 2019 recognizing the most original and creative “I Voted” sticker submitted for consideration. Entries from all sizes of jurisdictions, both large and small, are encouraged to submit their work. All entries must be received by Monday, November 25, 2019. The 2018 winners of the Clearie awards can be found<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-clearinghouse-award-winners-2018/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>“The EAC Clearie Awards celebrate the innovative and creative approaches that election officials use each day in their work to serve voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick. “These awards are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices that other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
<li>Creating positive Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Election officials utilize innovative and resourceful initiatives on Election Day. We want to hear about these outstanding best practices in EAC’s 2019 competition. By incorporating Election Day into the submission deadline, we are able to capture activities implemented throughout the 2018 and 2019 elections.</p>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition, Outstanding Innovations Competition, or Sticker Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a summary of the election program nominated. Entrants may attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>
<p>For more information about this year’s competition, please contact Patrick Leahy at pleahy@eac.gov.</p>
