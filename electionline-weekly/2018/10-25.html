							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election 2018 Preview: Secretary of state races</strong><br />
<em>State’s top election official on the ballot in 25 states</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>Voters in 24 states will decide who they want to oversee their elections for the next four years. In addition, governor’s races in other states will dictate who overseas elections in those states.</p>
<p>We’ll say good-bye to the top elections officials in eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota — because their chief election official is either term limited, lost in a primary or chose not to seek re-election. We’ll have exit interviews with as many of them as we can in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Here is a quick look at the secretary of state (and one lieutenant governor) races on the ballot this year.</p>

														<p>The Department of Homeland Security is<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2018/10/dhs-preps-extra-cyber-support-states-close-midterm-races/152242/"> pushing additional Election Day cybersecurity resources</a> to states with tight electoral races according to Undersecretary Chris Krebs. According to <em>Nextgov</em>, the tightness of an electoral contest will just be one criteria Homeland Security uses as it decides where to embed federal cyber technicians on Election Day and it will not be a “controlling factor,” said Krebs.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Early Voting</strong>: Early voting is underway throughout much of the country. Turnout has been quite large in some places with<a href="https://www.chron.com/news/politics/horseshoe/article/Harris-County-smashes-early-voting-record-13327145.php"> records being broken</a> in several<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2018-elections/2018/10/23/689000-texans-voted-early-first-day-surpassing-2016-presidential-elections-day-1-total"> Texas</a> jurisdictions. Besides lines and wait times, there have been some other issues as well. In<a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/hays/connection-issues-shut-down-multiple-voting-booths-in-hays-co/1542441728"> Hays County, Texas</a>, old equipment led to connection issues which caused lines to form. From long lines to problems with ballots, early voting has been bumpy from day one in<a href="https://www.dailymemphian.com/article/766/Glitches-suspicion-overshadow-heavy-start-of-early-voting"> Shelby County, Tennessee</a>. In<a href="https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2018/10/22/garland-county-leaves-susan-inman-off-election-ballot"> Garland County, Arkansas</a>, Democratic candidate for secretary of state Susan Inman was left off the ballot. About 222 had voted before the problem was discovered and voting was shut down until the problem could be resolved. In<a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2018/10/23/nearly-150-ballots-tossed-after-poll-worker-error-in-leland/"> Brunswick County, North Carolina</a>, about 150 ballots had to be tossed out after it was discovered poll workers had provided voters with the wrong ballot. The BOE is working to notify the affected voters. Also in North Carolina, county elections directors are telling voters to double check their ballots after some voters in<a href="http://www.wfae.org/post/nc-election-directors-urge-voters-check-their-ballots-after-touchscreen-mistakes#stream/0"> Guilford County</a> reported having a candidate other than the one chose getting marked on electronic voting machines.  The<a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/suffolk-absentee-ballots-1.22359758"> Suffolk County, New York</a> board of elections has had to stop allowing walk-in voters to cast their absentee ballots at the office. Officials initially said there are too many mail ballots to process to deal with walk-ins, but have since changed their mind and will now allow<a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/steve-bellone-absentee-ballots-suffolk-1.22404855"> walk-ins</a>. Lines formed in several Indiana counties including<a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/voters-wait-out-long-lines-cast-early-ballots-central-indiana"> Johnson County</a>. In<a href="https://www.cbs46.com/news/old-technology-creating-new-problems-with-voting-machines/article_2badd660-d832-11e8-a1c0-431ce2e116b4.html"> Bartow County, Georgia</a>, several voters were reporting problems with old electronic voting machines “flipping” their votes. In<a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/environment/2018/10/24/beachside-early-voting-site-canova-park-moved-due-red-tide/1755794002/"> Brevard County, Florida</a>, one early voting site had to be relocated due to red tide, which made workers setting up the polling place feel ill.</p>
<p><strong>See something, say something.</strong> It wasn’t until a voter notified an official that they  had received the wrong ballot that elections officials in Hot Springs, Arkansas realized that some voters had been assigned to the<a href="http://www.hotsr.com/news/2018/oct/24/precinct-error-corrected-after-going-un/"> wrong precinct</a> for about seven years. No one currently on the election commission was on it when the precincts were assigned so no one knows for sure how the mistake happened. Commission Chairman Gene Haley told the <em>Sentinel Record</em> the ballot activation card affected voters are issued subsequent to check-in will be spoiled. Poll workers will then manually enter the adjacent precinct part and generate a new card with the correct slate of races. &#8220;We&#8217;re checking them in so they get credit for voting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re spoiling that ballot and reissuing them ballot style (No.7).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>For years, Dodge City — yes, that<a href="https://www.kansas.com/latest-news/article220286260.html"> Dodge City</a></strong> — Kansas had one polling place for about 13,000 voters. This year, due to road construction, Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox relocated the polling place outside of town and about a mile from the nearest bus stop. Cox did not return messages seeking comment from the <em>Kansas City Star</em>. Kansas Elections Director Bryan Caskey told the paper that Cox had no choice but to move the polling site due to the road construction, adding she did the best she could to find a suitable location. She also contacted every voter and sent out advance voting applications in English and Spanish, he said. In a town that is about 60 percent Hispanic, the new voting location raised alarm bells with local activists. Over the weekend though, Voto Latino announced a<a href="http://fortune.com/2018/10/22/lyft-voto-latino-gotv-dodge-city/"> partnership with Lyft</a> that will help get voters to the new polling place.</p>
<p><strong>We’ll take one of each please!</strong> In coordination with Juneau artist Pat Race, the Alaska Division of Elections has a new series of<a href="http://www.ktva.com/story/39315715/alaska-animal-themed-i-voted-stickers-unveiled-at-afn-convention"> animal-themed “I Voted” stickers</a>. The stickers, which feature a beaver, caribou, Dungeness crab, eagle, Alaska king crab, moose raven or walrus will only be available to those who cast a ballot during early voting. &#8220;Voter engagement is a critical component to our elections process and we are excited to present Alaskans with more fun opportunities to share with their communities that they&#8217;ve participated on Election Day,&#8221; State Elections Director Josie Bahnke told KTVA. Race&#8217;s artwork can also be found on the covers of the Election Pamphlets being mailed to Alaska homes this month.</p>
<p><strong>In more “I Voted” sticker news</strong>, when a Utah voter recently lamented on Twitter that he<a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900037929/utah-lt-gov-spencer-cox-makes-an-i-voted-sticker-for-one-lucky-utah-voter.html"> didn’t get an “I Voted” sticker with his mail-in ballot</a>, Lt. Governor Spencer Cox knew just what to do. He broke out his crafting box and got to work, creating a “sticker” for the voter and allegedly sending it off to him. When another voter complained about not getting a sticker, Cox instead responded thusly: “…if we mail stickers with every ballot, a person who doesn’t vote might wear a sticker. That would lead to chaos and anarchy and the end of our Republic. We can’t let that happen! As soon as the legislature makes sticker-fraud a capital offense, we will mail them.”</p>

She was 94. In 1971, the Virginia Constitution was revised to create the Office of the General Registrar for locality. Riddick because the first person appointed to the job. “Charlotte Riddick was a devoted voter registrar, and she was well regarded in Charlottesville and around the state,” University of Virginia Professor Larry Sabato told <em>The Daily Progress</em>. “She knew she had a vital role in our democratic system, and she faithfully fulfilled that role for many years. We should all be grateful for her service.” Riddick retired from the general registrar post in 1994. Current Charlottesville Registrar Rosanna Bencoach said that<a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/obituaries/riddick-charlotte-staples/article_e46dce98-87c6-53d5-bb4a-604f3e04ced2.html"> Riddick’s legacy</a> is still felt in the office today. “The family recently asked us to look up some records on Charlotte’s tenure,” Bencoach explained. “At her first Electoral Board meeting after her appointment, she reported that the state was beginning the computerization of the voter registration records, but she was using the data processing office in City Hall instead of sending our records to Richmond for entry. From everything I’ve heard, that was typical of her professionalism and take-charge attitude.”</p>

Montgomery County Democratic Election Commissioner Terry Bieniek said the small staff at the elections office have been<a href="https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/10/19/elections-board-feels-the-absence-of-crash-victim"> struggling</a>, not only with Jackson’s death, but also to pick up where he left off in the preparation for the 2016 midterms elections.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver recently presented her office’s<a href="https://www.ladailypost.com/content/secretary-state-maggie-toulouse-oliver-presents-legislative-priorities-new-mexico"> legislative priorities</a> for 2019 to the Legislature’s Courts, Corrections and Justice Interim Committee. “In the coming session, I’ll be advocating for legislation that increases voter participation, creates more transparency in our state’s campaign finance system, and fully funds my Office in the next fiscal year,” Toulouse Oliver said according to the <em>Los Alamos Daily Post</em>. “New Mexico is already a leader in how we make voting convenient, accessible, and secure, but there is always room to grow and I look forward to working with the Legislature in the coming months to build upon our success.”</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Rep. Mary Jo Daley (D-Montgomery County and Rep. Christopher Rabb (D-Philadelphia) have introduced legislation that would<a href="https://cumberlink.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bill_tracker/bill-tracker-banning-guns-at-polling-places/article_a759c600-029b-5046-8a88-53c1388877f3.html"> ban the possession of firearms at polling places</a>. House Bill 2711 would make it a third-degree misdemeanor to possess a firearm at any polling place and a first degree misdemeanor to possess a firearm at a polling place with the intent to commit a crime or use a firearm at a polling place in the commission of a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The Memphis City Council has voted to fund a<a href="https://wreg.com/2018/10/24/city-to-fund-campaign-on-ballot-questions-groups-see-problems-at-election-commission/"> public information campaign</a> to explain several ballot measures, including one on instant runoff voting, that many voters and others have complained are worded poorly.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Civil rights groups have filed an emergency motion asking the court to intervene so that citizens<a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/federal-judge-asked-ensure-new-citizens-can-vote-georgia/VGoUS2UiybXcUdnMCnPflK/"> inaccurately labeled as non-citizens</a> be allowed to vote if they show proof-of-citizenship at the polls. About 3,600 voter registrations are on hold because their citizenship has not been verified.</p>
<p>Also in Georgia, U.S. District Court Judge Leigh Martin May heard arguments this week on two different lawsuits filed against the secretary of state’s office and the Gwinnett County Board of Registrations and Elections over the county’s review of<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/federal-judge-mulling-action-over-georgia-absentee-ballots/JS3hXmCTp0wiI6ZOJui47L/"> absentee ballots</a>. On Wednesday she announced that she will be filing an<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/breaking-judge-proposes-injunction-absentee-ballot-rejections/drBFCpDG2Kmn1kJwQxItMJ/"> injunction</a> barring officials from tossing certain absentees.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> A Collinsville resident has filed suit seeking an injunction requiring the Madison County clerk to<a href="https://madisonrecord.com/stories/511608788-election-judges-and-poll-watchers-were-shut-out-in-16-suit-claims-republican-seeks-injunction-for-access"> make election night vote counting open</a> to all election judges and poll watchers.  According to the <em>Madison Record</em>, the suit specifically asks that election judges and poll watchers not be excluded from the counting process and votes not be counted &#8220;behind closed doors.&#8221; It also asks that the Clerk refrain from moving ballots to &#8220;unknown locations without full disclosure&#8221; and from counting ballots before polls close, or other times, without full disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Pike County supervisors are suing Entergy for more than a half-million dollars as the result of a short circuit that led to a power outage at election headquarters and the<a href="http://www.enterprise-journal.com/news/article_dec161d2-d18d-11e8-b1cd-4798c30f504d.html"> destruction of voting machines</a> on the night of the 2016 primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong>  The Missouri Supreme Court issued a one-sentence order late Friday afternoon in Jefferson City, overruling the state’s emergency motion for a stay. The denial means a Cole County judge’s decision to strike down several key provisions of the state’s<a href="https://www.missourinet.com/2018/10/19/judges-ruling-on-missouri-voter-id-law-remains-in-place-through-november-election/"> voter ID law</a> will remain in place through the November election. Cole County Judge Richard Callahan<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article220485190.html"> clarified</a> his ruling earlier this week that it applies to all election administrators.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Brown has<a href="http://www.nhpr.org/post/judge-blocks-sb3-voter-registration-law-use-upcoming-midterms#stream/0"> blocked the state from implementing SB3</a>, a law that requires voters to prove they live where they’re trying to vote. According to New Hampshire Public Radio, Brown&#8217;s<a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/201810/226-2017-cv-433__league_of_women_voters_of_new_hampshire_et_al_v_william_gardner_et_al_-_decision_notice__2_.pdf"> ruling</a> drew heavily on testimony from experts about the burdens SB3 could place on individual voters and on New Hampshire&#8217;s voting system as a whole. The state’s attorney general has asked for a<a href="http://www.nhpr.org/post/state-attorneys-no-changes-voter-registration-process-until-court-clarifies-instructions-sb3#stream/0"> clarification</a> on the judge’s ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Modesta Vela, 60 of Roma has been arrested on<a href="https://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_983f423e-d3e9-11e8-9bd6-a7ddaa46a712.html"> voter fraud charges</a> just two weeks after being arrested on other voter fraud charges. According to the district attorney, the four new charges are for tampering with a government record, in this case, voter registration applications. Earlier in October, Vela had been charged with illegal voting.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, Five students at Prairie View A&amp;M have filed suit against Waller County claiming that their<a href="https://www.news-journal.com/students-suing-waller-county-over-voting-rights/article_78a5d28e-d679-11e8-855c-d3e85c7e7540.html"> voting rights are being suppressed</a>. According to the <em>News Journal</em>, students at the Historically Black College accused the county of violating the federal Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution by not providing any early voting location on campus or in the city of Prairie View during the first week of early voting. The suit says the county’s decision “imposes a substantial and unwarranted burden” on student voters and denies them “an equal opportunity to vote” compared to the county’s non-black voters.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Hopewell Circuit Judge William Edward Tomko, III has ordered Hopewell electoral board members David Silvestro and Herbert Townes — both Democrats — be<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/hopewell-judge-suspends-two-members-of-city-s-elections-board/article_ff10da44-e055-5cc8-9abd-3bd14c9c4be5.html"> temporarily suspended from office</a> until a jury trial can be held to determine if they should be permanently removed for failing to properly perform their duties.</p>

														<p><strong>Social Media</strong>:<a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/officials-step-up-election-security-efforts-while-facebook-aims-to-stop-misinformation"> Facebook</a> recently gave members a media an inside look at its “election war room”. The social media giant says that it has hired thousands of new moderators, invested in artificial intelligence and brought in new rules on advertising in order to combat a misinformation campaign during the midterms. Not only politically, but the site is also looking out for false or misleading stories about lines at polling places and other voting-related issues.</p>
<p>In other Facebook news, the social media site announced this week that it will be reminding voters of early voting hours and deadlines in the states that have<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-facebook-early-voting-20181024-story.html"> early voting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: Snap, the company that runs the popular social media site Snapchat, announced this week that it<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/technology/snapchat-voter-registration-midterms.html"> helped more than 400,000 users register</a> to vote during a two-week period.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Secretary of State Alex Padilla recently launched the<a href="https://patch.com/california/dixon/felons-can-check-voting-eligibility-restore-vote-tool"> Restore Your Vote</a> tool, an online tool that will help let residents with criminal convictions know what their voting rights are. At the website, people are asked to answer whether they are a U.S. citizen and resident of California, whether they are 18 or older on Election Day, whether they are currently in prison or on parole for a felony, and  whether they have been found mentally incompetent to vote by a court. Based on the answers, users are told whether they can register to vote. Those who are eligible will be provided a link to online voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> The State Elections Board has launched a new online tool on its website called<a href="https://www.tulsaworld.com/communities/sandsprings/election-officials-encourage-voters-to-make-a-plan-to-vote/article_a0d15321-04f0-50b3-b548-ad6871059e22.html"> Make A Plan to Vote</a>. Voters who click on the “Make a Plan to Vote” link on the election board’s homepage can access a fillable PDF which will help them choose whether to vote by mail, during early voting or at their polling place on Election Day. Voters can access maps to their polling place, sample ballots and other resources as well.</p>
