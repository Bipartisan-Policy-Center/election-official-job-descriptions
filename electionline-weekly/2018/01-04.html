							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Electionline.org joins Democracy Fund</strong></p>
<p>By Stacey Scholl, Senior Program Associate and<br />Tammy Patrick, Senior Advisor at Democracy Fund</p>
<p>Democracy Fund has long been enthusiastic about the value of electionline.org as a site for important news and information, which is why Democracy Fund has provided financial support for its maintenance and continuance since 2014. As the partnership with electionline.org deepened, there was space for both organizations to consider what a long-term commitment could look like. We are so pleased to share that <a href="http://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/electionline-becomes-a-democracy-fund-project">agreement was made to bring the site within Democracy Fund as a project</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next year, Democracy Fund’s Elections team will work with electionline.org editor Mindy Moretti to manage and grow the site because we believe it remains a powerful tool for sharing knowledge. We will remain committed to a strictly nonpartisan lens and transparency about the role our organization plays. We know the election administration community only has a handful of places to find curated and organized news relevant to their work. For this small group, electionline.org has been a place for the story of American elections to unfold separately from the political race and campaign rhetoric.</p>
<p>Since 2013, electionline.org has operated independently under the leadership of Mindy Moretti, who joined in 2005 and is the current site editor. The site is now more than 16 years old and former editor Doug Chapin says that he is “pleased that it is bigger, better, and has lasted longer than many people (including me!) expected.”</p>
<p>Mindy shared that “there is a story behind every vote cast. There is a story behind every new innovation or piece of equipment purchased.” She noted that while the site has benefitted from its time as an independent entity, there have been drawbacks&nbsp;— like delaying the creation of new features or modernizing the archives for searchability. In this way, she compares the resource constraint to that of election officials making choices about where to spend and where to save. She is glad that the site will have a home with Democracy Fund where it can thrive.</p>
<p>Electionline.org has its roots in some of the most compelling election moments of our country’s history, and we want it to be around for many more pivotal events and conversations. The need for a website like electionline.org was felt after the 2000 presidential election, when interested groups, academics, and practitioners recognized that there was little to no routine information about the processes, equipment, and ideas shaping elections. Without this information, there might still be no dialogue about what is a common practice or a new innovation.</p>
<p>Today, the site is known for giving context for key issues and elevating the voices of election administrators, many of whom are more accustomed to correcting statements about laws, rules, and regulations than sharing their perspective and work.</p>
<p>Doug Chapin, founding editor of electionline.org in 2001, shared that, as part of its Election Reform Information Project (ERIP), The Pew Charitable Trusts made a grant to the University of Richmond for a website with a goal of creating a common source of knowledge that gives anyone in the elections field a sense of what was happening in their area. The site would share “election administration news only, with an emphasis on state and local coverage that was comprehensive, but not overly inclusive of topics like campaign finance or redistricting.” He recalls that there was a clear effort to “inform to reform.”</p>
<p>Doug explained that through the site, election news was presented in three rhythms: daily news roundups, weekly newsletters, and monthly/quarterly reports. This gave readers a choice for information, so they could read what they had time for and interest in. In 2007, electionline.org became part of the Pew Charitable Trust’s Election Initiatives. Like <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline#s=Relevance/sortDir=asc/pg=0/count=9/content=59fe81ce-f007-4fa1-a82e-a1579d6643bd">StateLine</a>, and other important Pew resources, electionline.org developed a reputation for spotting issues in the field before they reached many decision-makers, giving a preview of what to avoid and what new practices are possible.</p>
<p>Mindy will be an essential part of the next phase of electionline.org, remaining onboard as the editor, which entails waking before readers on the East Coast start their day and searching for stories to post. She will also assist with developing plans for the future. “I want electionline.org to be the first place people go to when looking for election reform news and information. We may not be your last stop online, but we hope to be your first.” She has said that continuing to watch electionline.org mature will be important to her given her long tenure with the site.</p>
<p>The team who started and have maintained electionline.org can be very proud of what it has become. Democracy Fund staff hope to be good stewards of the site. As the election profession continues to evolve in an ever-changing landscape, we will seek out your feedback (please email <a href="mailto:elections@democracyfund.org">elections@democracyfund.org</a>) on how the site can help you and other readers to connect with useful knowledge for better elections.</p>
<p><em>(Stacey Scholl is a Senior Program Associate for the Elections team at Democracy Fund, where she co-leads efforts to foster a voter-centric elections system by supporting election officials with tools and knowledge. Prior to joining Democracy Fund Stacey worked for the Department of Defense’s Federal Voting Assistance Program, State and Local Relations team.</em></p>
<p><em>Tammy Patrick is a Senior Advisor with the Elections team at Democracy Fund co-leading efforts with Stacey Scholl.

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Late Wednesday, The White House issued a statement saying that President Donald J. Trump had signed an executive order to dissolve the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.</p>
<p>The president remained steadfast in his belief that voter fraud was a major issue, but in his statement, the president said: “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen_Shot_2018-01-04_at_9.05.59_AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018 01 04 at 9.05.59 AM" width="368" height="194" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />On Twitter Thursday morning, the president lamented the need to disband the commission and said with the commission now gone, focus should be on voter ID. <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx">Currently</a> 34 states require some form of ID in order to cast a ballot.</p>
<p>Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, a Democratic member of PACEI appeared on NPR and spoke with Morning Edition Host Steve Inskeep about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575579712/trump-dissolves-controversial-voter-fraud-commission">decision to dissolve</a> the commission.</p>
<p>And in an interview with <em>The Washington Post</em>, Dunlap expressed concerns about the decision to move the review to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>“I think people who are saying ‘the witch is dead’ should be very alarmed by this move,” he told the paper. “I think that’s very dangerous.”</p>
<p>In other news, according to a report in <em>Politico</em>, states wishing to have the U.S. Department of Homeland Security conduct a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/29/2018-election-hacking-threat-government-help-231512">security screening</a> may have to wait up to nine months for the screening. The nine-month wait is “not a good metric” for states hoping to boost their security, admitted Christopher Krebs, one of the DHS officials leading election security efforts. “We are working to prioritize.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fairfax County, Virginia General Registrar Cameron Sasnett is </strong><a href="https://wtop.com/fairfax-county/2018/01/fairfax-co-registrar-to-deny-voter-registrations-over-concerns-with-state-system/"><strong>denying</strong> voter registration requests</a> from residents who have moved to the county from other Virginia counties claiming that concerns about the way a Department of Elections systems handles requests submitted through the DVM. “I’m going to deny the transfer, I’m going to inform the voter that they’re still registered in [their previous jurisdiction], and I’m going to send them an application so they can fill that out,” Sasnett told WTOP. According to the report, Sasnett and other Virginia registrars are concerned that address updates submitted through the DMV from July 1, 2016 until this fall wrongly appeared when printed out in registrars’ offices to be completely new applications.</p>
<p><strong>Mahoning County, Ohio Board of Elections Director Joyce Kale-Pesta has come up</strong> with a <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2018/jan/03/elections-director-proposes-reforms/">proposed series of changes</a> to how the county counts ballots after an error led to the double counting of more than 6,000 early votes in 2017. Although the problem was caught and an amended final vote report was issued, officials in Mahoning failed to contact the media and others about the error. Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a letter requiring the county issue a report about the incident. Among Kale-Pesta’s changes are: Having a checklist for tabulating all votes, assigning the board’s secretary of serve a point person to communication ongoing election totals to the media, training staff to post results on the board’s website in a more timely fashion and only allowing two specific people to scan ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Although Illinois legislators approved and Gov. Bruce Rauner signed legislation</strong> into law that would allow the state to <a href="https://www.ilnews.org/news/state_politics/automatic-voter-registration-law-doesn-t-allocate-money-for-implementation/article_fa0af192-ecd7-11e7-a222-4bc56bb5b222.html">automatically register voters</a> at the DMV, the law has yet to be implemented for a lack of funding. “We haven’t gotten any money appropriated for it quite yet,” Illinois State Board of Elections General Counsel Ken Menzel told the <em>Illinois News Network</em>. “There’s a supplemental appropriation request pending with the legislature but we do have staff working on it as best we can. The staff that’s working on it has been updating the board on a monthly basis.” Menzel anticipates the state will need about half a million dollars to implement the program. The law says AVR should be fully implemented no later than July 2019.</p>
<p><strong>NASED Update</strong>: Democracy Works will now serve as the organizational home for the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) with Amy Cohen, Democracy Work’s director of government outreach serving as the new executive director of NASED. “Election administrators define our voting experience—from registration and eligibility to the sticker you receive at the polls—in addition to the many responsibilities that voters never see,”&nbsp;said Kathryn Peters, Democracy Works’ Co-Founder and Chief Operations Officer.&nbsp;“NASED brings together state election directors nationwide to share best practices and collaborate. In fulfilling Democracy Works&#8217; goal to support election officials, I can think of no better partner than NASED.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> A bill sponsored by the secretary of state’s office would <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/12/29/bill-would-ban-signature-gathering-at-polling-places-in-maine/">ban the gathering of voter signatures at polling places</a> on Election Day. “It’s really not a shadow effort to restrict the people’s right to petition their government,” Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap told the <em>Portland Press Herald</em>. “That is not our intent.” He said the changes are more a result of complaints from voters themselves and polling place officials who want to maintain orderly and “civilized” polling places. “Sometimes signature gatherers are very, very aggressive,” Dunlap told the paper. “They take things right to the very edge and it causes issues.”</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> January 1 marked the start of a new law which establishes <a href="http://www.messagemedia.co/aitkin/news/state/new-laws-establish-election-dates/article_a434da96-ea5a-11e7-ad56-67af4bbaa5d8.html">five uniform dates throughout the year for special local elections</a>. A special election in a city, town or school district must be held on one of the following dates: The second Tuesday in February; the second Tuesday in April; the second Tuesday in May; the second Tuesday in August (state&nbsp;&nbsp; primary date); or the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November (general election date). A special election may only be held on a different date if it is held in response to an emergency or disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> The Clark County commission voted this week to end a decades-long practice of <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/clark-county-change-to-absentee-voting-procedure-will-save-50k/">automatically mailing absentee ballots</a> to voters in precincts with small populations. The county’s move to vote centers spurred the decision. “There’s no sense in sending out a $5, $6 mail ballot to someone who will likely surrender it to vote on a machine,” Registrar Joe Gloria told the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>. The change will affect about 4,800 voters and save the county $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Several <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/slate-bills-could-change-nh-election-lawsagain#stream/0">elections-related bills</a> have been introduced in the early days of the legislative session including one that would move the state to a ranked choice voting system and another that would mandate poll workers provide information on New Hampshire driver’s license laws to anyone registering with an out-of-state license. Another bill would remove the state from the Crosscheck program and another would give town moderates the authority to delay or change elections due to weather emergencies.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, in a 14-9 party-line vote, the Senate approved House Bill 372 which establishes a <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/state-government/state-senate-oks-residency-definition-for-voting-sununu-remains-opposed-20180103">new definition of residency</a> in order to register to vote. The bill must now go back to the House to reconcile changes. Gov. Chris Sununu has voiced his opposition to the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Rep. Bruce Cutler (R) is proposing legislation that would eliminate straight-ticket voting in Utah. Utah is one of eight states that still allows <a href="http://fox13now.com/2017/12/30/once-again-utah-lawmakers-try-to-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/">straight-ticket voting</a>. &#8220;When you go out to the polls and vote, sometimes it’s nice to check one number. You’ve got a lot of people waiting behind you,&#8221; Cutler told Fox 13. &#8220;But now that we do most of the voting by mail, you have all the time in the world to research and look at the candidates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in Utah. Rep. Stephen Handy (R-Layton) has introduced a bill that would <a href="http://fox13now.com/2017/12/30/once-again-utah-lawmakers-try-to-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/">automatically register</a> residents vote when they receive a new or renew their driver’s license. Handy said he has the support of county clerks.</p></p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> The City of Redondo Beach plans to file a lawsuit against the state challenging the law that creates <a href="http://tbrnews.com/news/redondo_beach/redondo-beach-to-challenge-state-law-on-election-dates/article_07c411f4-efe1-11e7-8e5c-d30093586107.html">uniform dates for elections</a>. Cities, school boards and special districts had had until Jan. 1 to come up with a plan to streamline their elections. Instead of coming up with a plan, the Redondo Beach city council decided to challenge SB 415.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Michael Gilmore, a candidate seeking to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Rep. John Conyers has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/12/29/candidate-conyers-seat-sues-move-election-sues-gov-snyder-over-delay-election-replace-u-s-rep-john-c/990088001/">11-month delay</a> in holding a special election to fill the vacant seat is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>In Macomb County, Clerk Karen Spranger has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that three Macomb officials have <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2018/01/03/karen-spranger-lawsuit-conspiracy/1001740001/">violated her constitutional rights</a> in a conspiracy with the county’s chief judge, the head of an AFSCME union local and two reporters she claims are biased against her.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Cole County Judge Jon Beetum has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and the state’s <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/missouri/articles/2018-01-03/judge-dismisses-suit-over-missouris-voter-id-law">voter ID law</a>. The suit claimed that the state had not provided enough voter education and poll worker training.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A losing candidate in the Hillside mayoral runoff has filed a suit <a href="http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2018/01/hold_former_hillside_mayoral_candidates_files_suit.html">challenging the election results</a>. The suit alleges that there were errors in the vote count. According to <em>New Jersey Advance Media</em>, the lawsuit alleges illegal votes, destruction of provisional ballots and errors in counting the votes.&nbsp; The suit alleges at least 18 provisional ballots were stolen by the current mayor, her council or their representatives before they could be counted. In total, the lawsuit questions more than 95 votes and lists the names and addresses of the voters as part of an exhibit.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway ordered the Pitt County BOE to <a href="http://www.reflector.com/News/2017/12/30/Judge.html">certify the election</a> of Ricky Hines to the Winterville Town Council. According to <em>The Reflector</em>, Ridgeway said the county board did not have the authority to revoke a certificate it has previously issued.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota:</strong> U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Miller has granted the plaintiff’s motion to file an amended complaint in the challenge of the state’s <a href="http://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/government-and-politics/4380029-federal-judge-allows-amended-voter-id-complaint-against-new-nd">voter ID law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> An Office of Open Records decision says that state law allows anyone with a valid ID to obtain your <a href="http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/13123726-74/law-blocks-public-from-seeing-who-is-buying-their-voter-registration-information">voter registration information</a>, but blocks the voter from finding out who’s looking. The decision came after Quincy Twp. Supervisor Kerry Bumbaugh filed a right-to-know request to find out who received copies of the county’s voter registration list in 2017. The county denied the request.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> <em>The Texas Tribune</em> has an article by Alexa Ura on what we can expect in Texas’ <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/03/what-expect-texas-voting-rights-court-fights-2018/">voting rights court fights</a> in 2018.
