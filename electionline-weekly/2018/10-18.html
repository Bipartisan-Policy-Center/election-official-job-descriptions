							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The Best Kind of October Surprise: A New electionline</strong></p>
<p>By Stacey Scholl</p>
<p>It might be an understatement to say electionline looks a little different these days; from a newsier<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/"> homepage</a> to a new<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/events/"> events page</a>, Democracy Fund is improving what we know you love and offering new content to help you better understand what’s happening in elections and what’s new for administrators.</p>
<p>When Democracy Fund<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/electionline-becomes-a-democracy-fund-project"> announced</a> in January 2018 that the website would become a project within the organization, we felt then, as we do now, that electionline is a vital resource for trusted news and information about the people and process that guide our nation’s elections. Our goals for redeveloping the site were to enhance its capabilities and expand content—but our long-term plans are to create a place where readers are exposed to new ideas, opportunities for continuing education, and relationship building.</p>
<p>To do this, we started by thinking long and hard about the site’s current audience and their needs. Starting now, election administrators, academics, voting advocates and other regular readers of electionline will find new ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Up With Election News &#8211; Electionline is still the only place on the internet to find national and state-by-state curation of daily election administration news. Our refreshed ‘<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/news/">Daily News</a>’ section allows readers to sort stories by date or by state, better enabling those with specific interests to hone in on the most relevant news quickly.</li>
<li>Track Election Events &#8211; We know that there are no shortage of election-related events, conferences, and public meetings happening across the country. These convenings are important opportunities to learn, share and refine ideas, and participate in critical conversations about voting and elections administration with advocates, administrators, and officials. Our<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/events/"> sortable list of national and local events</a> now makes it easy to find events you might be interested in. We are experimenting with ways to track and input these events, but event-organizer submission will be one key way we collect this information. If you’d like to share your event with electionline readers, you can<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/content-submission/"> submit it here</a>.</li>
<li>Stay Informed With Exclusive Analysis &#8211; In addition to continuing to publish the classic electionline Weekly newsletter, we will also start sharing exclusive reports and analysis on elections and voting from leaders and experts in the field. This week, we hope you’ll check out a new report on “<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/publications/understanding-the-voter-experience-the-publics-view-of-elections">Understanding the Voting Experience</a>.” Using data collected from 2008-2016 via the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, authors Natalie Adona and Paul Gronke offer new insight into how the public is thinking about the decision to vote or not, their knowledge and application of voter registration requirements, the over all voter experience, and the public’s trust and confidence in U.S. elections.</li>
<li>Boost Your Skills With New Training &amp; Resources &#8211; Our new ‘<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/training-resources/">Training &amp; Resources</a>’ page connects readers to organizations, trainings, tools, and more. Now searchable and sortable, these organizations and items are a potential game-changer for election administrators who want to connect with subject-matter experts, get up to speed on things like cybersecurity, or dig deep on a topic like election audits.</li>
<li>Find Career Opportunities in Elections Administration &#8211; The election administration community thrives not only when ideas are accessible, but also when opportunities are elevated and cost-savings are passed along. That is why, over time, we will work to populate and update our new<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/jobs-marketplace/"> Jobs &amp; Marketplace</a> landing page, featuring job openings and used equipment available for purchase from across the country. We think of this part of the website as a place to get employed and for resources to be redeployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the process of redeveloping electionline, we received invaluable insight from many friends and partners, and we are grateful to them for their time and thoughtful advice. As we continue to refine the new site, we will continue to leverage our greatest asset: our readers. Please email Mindy at mmoretti@electionline.org with your questions, thoughts, and feedback.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>Maryland’s two Democratic Sens Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, along with Maine’s Susan Collins (R) have introduced the<a href="http://www.startribune.com/measure-seeks-to-protect-election-systems-from-foreign-foes/496979481/"> Protect Our Elections Act</a> which would require companies that provide election services to report any foreign national who owns or controls their firm to the secretary of Homeland Security, the Election Assistance Commission and state and local officials. It also would require companies to provide notice of any material change in ownership or control. The bill establishes a $10,000 fine for failing to do so.</p>
<p>According to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security says it&#8217;s working to identify who is behind an<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/dhs-finds-increasing-attempts-hack-u-s-election-systems-ahead-n920336"> increasing number of attempted cyberattacks</a> on election databases ahead of the midterms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are aware of a growing volume of cyber activity targeting election infrastructure in 2018,&#8221; the department&#8217;s Cyber Mission Center said in an intelligence assessment issued last week and obtained by NBC News. &#8220;Numerous actors are regularly targeting election infrastructure, likely for different purposes, including to cause disruptive effects, steal sensitive data, and undermine confidence in the election.&#8221;</p>
<p>The assessment said, according to NBC, the federal government does not know who is behind the attacks, but it said all potential intrusions were either prevented or mitigated.</p>
<p>However, according to <em>The Hill</em>, Christopher Krebs, head the National Protection Programs Directorate (NPPD) said<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/411606-dhs-cyber-head-pushes-back-on-report-of-increased-attacks-on-election"> the report isn’t quite right</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not an uptick in activity,&#8221; he said according to <em>The Hill</em>.  Krebs added that state and local election officials have gotten better at sharing information about cyber activities targeting election systems like voter registration databases since the 2016 election, when that kind of information sharing largely wasn’t happening.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Counties in the Panhandle and Big Bend area of Florida</strong> that have been devasted by<a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/10/16/after-michaels-fury-hardest-hit-counties-say-changes-in-voting-are-needed/"> Hurricane Michael</a> have asked the governor to issue an executive order to that provides greater flexibility to conduct elections. One of the suggestions has been to move to a vote center model for Election Day. Other things that have come up are concerns about mail ballots and how relief workers will be able to cast their ballots. Mark Andersen, supervisor of elections in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BayVotes/posts/1588314181272993"> Bay County</a>, the hardest hit county posted this on Facebook: “On behalf of the Supervisor of Elections office, our thoughts and prayers are with everyone feeling the impacts of Hurricane Michael. Our office has experienced significant damage and our communication lines are still out. Our systems are slowly being restored which require patience and time. I am proud of how tirelessly and quickly the staff have been working to meet the needs of this office and the voters of Bay County. More updates regarding voting sites for the upcoming election will be posted as soon as all polling locations have been assessed.” Supervisors of elections from throughout the state are<a href="https://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Hurricane-ravaged-Panhandle-could-face-election-difficulties-497727411.html"> pitching in to help</a> their colleagues in any way they can including loaning additional cell phones. Despite the destruction, counties are still moving forward with logic and accuracy tests. The<a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/10/16/florida-secretary-of-state-waiting-to-consider-possible-election-changes"> secretary of state</a> has yet to decide how to handle the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Social media giant Facebook announced this week</strong> that it will<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2018-10-15/exclusive-facebook-to-ban-misinformation-on-voting-in-upcoming-us-elections"> ban false information about voting requirements</a> and fact-check fake reports of violence or long lines at polling places during this year’s midterms. Links to discouraging reports about polling places that may be inflated or misleading will be referred to fact-checkers under the new policy, Facebook said. If then marked as false, the reports will not be removed but will be seen by fewer of the poster&#8217;s friends.</p>
<p><strong>Early voting is underway</strong> in parts of the country and localities are reporting strong turnout numbers so far. In<a href="http://www.wfae.org/post/mecklenburg-county-more-10000-estimated-voters-first-day-early-voting#stream/0"> Mecklenburg County, North Carolina</a> the board of elections estimated that more than 10,000 people voted at 19 early voting sites on the first day.  It hasn’t all been smooth sailing though. In<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cobb-voters-energized-governor-race-wait-hours-for-early-voting/dMf1J0K3l4BMgTMTh0Rp1L/"> Cobb County, Georgia</a> voters reported waiting up to three hours to cast ballot. Due to poll worker error, several voters in<a href="https://www.journalnow.com/news/local/voters-get-wrong-ballot-in-early-voting/article_17865c8a-f840-5ed7-a7d1-a33dd3034b49.html"> Forsyth County, North Carolina</a> received the wrong ballot during early voting. In<a href="https://www.localmemphis.com/news/local-news/shelby-county-election-commission-blames-connectivity-issues-for-early-voting-problems/1531641897"> Shelby County, Tennessee</a> it was a connectivity issue, according to the county election commission, that delayed voters when polls opened at 11am.</p>
<p><strong>Whoops!</strong> An initiative of Mayor Bill DiBlasio sent about 400,000 letters to New York City voters telling them that they were inactive and may not be able to vote. Problem is, many of the people who received the letter were<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/nyregion/inactive-voter-letter-nyc.html"> not actually inactive voters</a>. “It has come to our attention that a very small group of active voters may have received inaccurate letters from the city identifying them as inactive voters,” the mayor’s press secretary, Eric F. Phillips, said in a statement. “We’re working to get to the bottom of why the mailing list used, which originated with the city Board of Elections, seems to have led to this error.” The board of elections however distanced itself from the letter noting that it was sent by the mayor’s office using data from a political consultant firm. It cost the city about $200,000 to send the letters.</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Problems</strong>: A number of jurisdictions have experienced problems with absentee and vote-by-mail ballots. The Maricopa County,<a href="http://ktar.com/story/2258804/maricopa-county-recorder-offers-replace-rain-damaged-mail-in-ballot/"> Arizona</a> clerk and recorder announced that the office will replace any water-damaged ballots after tropical storms brought record-breaking rain and flooding to the area.  In<a href="https://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2018/10/this_nj_county_sent_out_10_thousand_ballots_with_e.html"> New Jersey</a>, about 10,000 vote-by-mail ballots in Middlesex County contained errors in the recipients’ addresses. The mistakes prompted concerned calls to the county clerk’s office from voters fearful they would be prevented from voting. In Park County,<a href="http://www.powelltribune.com/stories/cody-are-absentee-ballots-reprinted,16263"> Wyoming</a>, about 1,300 people who had requested absentee ballots got new ones after officials discovered an error. The 100 or so voter who had already cast their ballots were allowed to submit news ones. The<a href="http://www.unionleader.com/AGs-office:-Incorrect-absentee-ballots-sent-to-126-voters"> New Hampshire</a> Attorney General’s office has identified 126 voters who received incorrect absentee ballots. About 300 voters in Athens-Clarke County,<a href="https://flagpole.com/news/in-the-loop/athens-voters-asked-to-resubmit-absentee-ballots-due-to-error"> Georgia</a> are being asked to submit new absentee ballots after it was discovered the ones they submitted contained a race it should not. After complaints about ovals on the ballot, Lucas County,<a href="https://www.13abc.com/content/news/Complaints-about-absentee-ballot-in-Lucas-County-lead-to-BOE-to-offer-new-ones-497220461.html"> Ohio</a> is offering new ballots to any voter who has an issue with the ovals. About  one-third of Mercer County,<a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/election/snafu-results-in-reprinting-of-ballots-in-mercer-county/article_048e1cac-92fd-517d-b76f-b656273b6231.html"> North Dakota</a>’s 2,600 mail ballots will have be recast after it was discovered that an independent candidate for the U.S. House seat was left off the ballot. Voters in Benzie County,<a href="https://www.9and10news.com/2018/10/15/benzie-county-absentee-ballots-delayed-over-printing-issue/"> Michigan</a> will be getting their absentee ballots a bit late after a printing delay held them up. Thirty Allen County,<a href="http://www.wboi.org/post/batch-absentee-ballots-botched#stream/0"> Indiana</a> absentee voters received ballots with candidate lists with no numbers. Yellowstone County,<a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/regional_news/some-heights-absentee-voters-receive-ballots-for-wrong-billings-precinct/article_7000c53f-a5e3-5ab4-97c4-1fb88f4f8bb1.html"> Montana</a> recently had to reach out to voters in Billings to let them know that they may have received the wrong vote-by-mail ballot. Also in<a href="https://missoulian.com/news/local/ballot-glitch-casts-cloud-over-mineral-county-election/article_c1cdc623-2ad9-5531-9d46-73733545d0ad.html"> Montana</a> in Mineral County, officials are trying to figure out how to deal with an error on instructions sent out with about 1,250 absentee ballots.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Montana:</strong> By an 8-3 vote, the Missoula City Council voted to expand the city’s gun-free zones to include all<a href="https://missoulian.com/news/local/missoula-city-council-expands-gun-free-zones-to-parks-all/article_2d7661b8-476c-52ab-9490-f4556de2efc6.html"> polling places</a>. According to <em>The Missoulian</em>, council member Julie Merritt proposed the changes in September as both an emergency amendment and an update to an existing city ordinance after concerns were raised about open and concealed carrying of weapons in polling places. Weapons aren’t allowed in schools, where many polling places are. But there are also voting sites that are not school based.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> The Franklin County commission voted to transfer $245,000 from the board of elections budget to the county commission’s budget to spend it on<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20181011/county-commissioners-ok-election-ad-spending-prosecutor-questions-legality"> public service announcements</a> promoting early voting. The board of elections had previously said they would not spend their own funds on early voting advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The House State Government Committee held a hearing this week to discuss ongoing<a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/politics/election/house-panel-holds-hearing-on-election-security/1526065031"> issues with the state’s election system</a>. In addition to discussion about Russian interference, the committee also discussed the possibility of non-citizen voters.</p>
<p>Also in Pennsylvania, Rep. Eric Roe (R-Chester) has introduced legislation that will allow Pennsylvania to offer<a href="http://mychesco.com/a/news/pennsylvania/eric-roe-introduces-legislation-to-provide-convenient-voting-opportunities-for-people-with-disabilities/"> curbside voting</a> for voters with disabilities.</p>

														<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> In a 5-2 decision the Arkansas Supreme Court has upheld the state’s<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article219848935.html"> voter ID law</a>. &#8220;In our view, providing a system of verifying that a person attempting to cast a ballot is registered to vote is relevant and pertinent, or has a close relationship, to an amendment establishing a system of voter registration,&#8221; the court said.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Late last week U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle turned down the Democrats request to extend the state’s voter registration deadline to October 16 for those affected by<a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/fl-ne-voter-registration-deadline-ruling-20181011-story.html"> Hurricane Michael</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Civil rights groups have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the state’s “<a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-challenges-000-stalled-georgia-voter-registrations/PK3tylRO9Z1ICNzDcH0FyH/">exact match</a>” law which has stalled approximately 53,000 voter registrations from being processed.</p>
<p>Two lawsuits were filed in federal court this week against the secretary of state’s office and Gwinnett County over “excessive rejection” of<a href="https://www.wsbradio.com/news/local-govt--politics/just-group-sues-kemp-gwinnett-elections-board-over-ballot-rejections/1qMxof9sA0um6w32vmrG2I/"> absentee ballots</a>. According to analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, so far Gwinnett has rejected about 8.5 percent of absentees while the state average is 2 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Guam:</strong> The government of Guam argued before a Ninth Circuit panel at the University of Hawaii that it is not unlawful to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/guam-argues-for-native-voting-law-before-9th-circuit/"> limit non-native residents from voting</a> on the territory’s future political ties with the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> The attorney general’s office has filed an appeal and an emergency stay to Cole County Circuit Court Judge Richard Callan’s ruling last week that overturned a provision in the state’s<a href="https://www.missourinet.com/2018/10/11/missouri-secretary-of-state-says-judges-decision-creating-mass-confusion-at-polls/"> voter ID</a> law that requires voters who don’t have a photo ID to sign an affidavit.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: It’s probably wrong that we love this as much as we do, but according to Teen Vogue, various Twitter users are posting<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/fake-celebrity-news-stories-are-actually-voter-registration-links-social-media"> fake celebrity news</a> headlines and when followers click on the link to read the story it takes the users to vote.gov so they can register to vote.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Contra Costa County has launched a social media-based campaign to promot citizens checking and confirming their voter registration. The “CoCoCheck” campaign is based on the idea that sometimes voters change their names or move and in that process, do not update their voter registration. The campaign Is a simple way to direct voters to the tools we offer and hopefully eliminate confusion and voters going to the wrong polling place on Election Day.</p>
<p>Also in California, congratulations to the<a href="https://www.calvoter.org/"> California Voter Foundation</a> on the launch of their newly re-designed website.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Johnson County  Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker announced that<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/article219856055.html"> updated software</a> for the county’s ballot tabulation system has received certification from both the federal government  and the state. “We have exhaustively tested this,” Metsker told the <em>Kansas City Star</em>. “It will be dazzlingly fast.”</p>

<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The Wake County Board of Elections has created a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZYcKg_b4gc&amp;feature=youtu.be"> YouTube video</a> designed to show voters exactly what happens<a href="https://abc11.com/politics/wake-county-elections-officials-show-how-your-vote-is-counted/4497476/"> behind the scenes</a> before, on and after Election Day.
