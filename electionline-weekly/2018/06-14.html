							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The check is in the mail</strong><br /><em>States are applying for 2018 HAVA funds, how are they spending them?</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the president signed Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 into law, the law includes <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/2018_HAVA_Election_Security_Funds.pdf">$380 million in grants for states</a> to improve their cybersecurity. To-date 32 states, America Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands have <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/HAVAgrants_2018.pdf">applied</a> for their HAVA funds.</p>
<p>Although states are allowed to draw down on their available funds in phases, most states seem to be applying for—and receiving—all their funds at one time. Once states have applied for their funds they have 90-days to provide a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/HAVA_Election_Security_Final_Award_Packet_041718.pdf">narrative</a> on what they will be spending the money on.</p>
<p>Part of the requirement for receiving the federal funds is a 5 percent match from states. How elections officials are getting those matches varies. Some states are relying on their Legislatures to allocate the funding and others are using existing funds allocated in state budgets.</p>
<p>The Election Infrastructure Subsector (EIS) Government Coordinating Council has provided a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Election%20Infrastructure%20Security%20Funding%20Considerations%20Final.pdf">white paper</a> of sorts on what states and counties should consider when planning their spending. The document is “intended to raise awareness of resources and helpful practices that can assist election officials to do more with the resources afforded to them. The document covers cyber navigators, common vulnerabilities and improving jurisdictions overall cybersecurity posture. The paper also includes a section on vendor selections.</p>
<p>In addition to the GCC considerations, a group of security experts/former elections officials/academics (and Democracy Fund Senior Advisor Tammy Patrick), sent a <a href="images/Letter_to_State_Election_Officials_04232018.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">letter to all 50 states</span></a>, the District of Columbia and the territories urging them to follow a list of best practices when considering how to spend their funds.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> also has a <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-canvass-may-2018.aspx#Funds">some suggestions</a> for how states should spend their money.</p>
<p>So with all these ideas in mind, what exactly are states spending their money on? Because many states are still working on their narratives, some of this is subject to change, but it’s a wide array of expenditures.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.sos.state.nm.us/">New Mexico</a>, the state intends to use the HAVA funds to make further election security advancements including creating and staffing an Election Security Program within the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p>“Our new Election Security Program will be tasked with expanding our election continuity plans and security assessments and assisting counties with security assessments and equipment needs,” explained Joey Keefe, spokesman for the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p>According to Nikki Charlson, deputy state administrator with the <a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/">Maryland</a> State Board of Elections, the state will spend its funding on training, upgrades to IT infrastructure, on-going security assessments and the development of a multi-year cybersecurity plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">Colorado</a> is “thinking outside the box” in how it will spend its funding.</p>
<p>“Even prior to 2016, Colorado had excellent security procedures and software in place, including dual-factor authentication, cybersecurity software for county systems, voter registration monitoring systems, training, firewalls, etc., explained Judd Choate, director of elections in the secretary of state’s office. “We are looking social media monitoring software to make sure that if people threaten attacks or make claims about our elections, we can counteract those claims quickly.&nbsp;And, obviously we are looking at other, even more sophisticated protections for our voter registration system.”</p>
<p>The state already has a number of ideas in the works including a September 6 table top exercise that will bring together 200+ county election officials, election IT personnel and county PIOs. The daylong session, which the state is calling Elections Wargames, will include a two-hour TTX and follow-up training.</p>
<p>According to Steve Trout, director of elections for the state <a href="https://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon</a>, the state will be spending its funds on survivability and redundancy. If there is a denial of service attack, or an attack on the electrical grid Trout said the state needs to make sure it has a backup system to switch over to in order to ensure continued operations and services.&nbsp;These funds will help with that.</p>
<p>A majority of <a href="https://www.sec.state.vt.us/">Vermont’s</a> money will be spent at the state level, however it will be used to purchase system, like the accessible voting system and new voting machines and services, such as cyber training. These will then be provided by the state to the towns.</p>
<p>“Further cyber security training for local officials and safeguards on their access point to the election management system,” explained Secretary of State Jim Condos. “And yes, these funds will help take care of that need by paying for ongoing training and for implementation of “two-factor authentication” for the local clerks’ login procedure.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">West Virginia</a> has already submitted their narative ( <a href="images/WV_HAVA_Narrative_Letter.compressed-1.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">WV_HAVA_Narrative_Letter.compressed-1.pdf</span></a> )to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. In the narrative, Secretary of State Mac Warner outlines the state’s plans to spend their funds. Interestingly, Warner writes:</p>
<p>“On a personal note regarding current and future HAVA funds made available by the federal government, I find it important that West Virginia’s long-term preparations for cybersecurity protections and maintenances of our Statewide Voter Registration System should be funded with a dedicated source from our state budgets; not short-term federal funds that may not exist in the future.”</p>
<p>Warner notes that he is however grateful for the federal funds to bolster local cyber and physical security.</p>
<p>Many, but not all of the states are keeping the funds at a centralized level which has caused some consternation amongst the counties.</p>
<p>“It makes sense that the states use a lot of the HAVA funds to help secure the statewide voter registration databases (since the majority of states have state offices that are responsible for VR databases, and these databases are more likely to be a target of an attack),” said Ricky Hatch, clerk/auditor for <a href="http://www.weberelections.com/">Weber County, Utah</a> and division director for the elections division of the <a href="http://iaogo.org/">International Association of Government Officials</a> (IGO) “However, there’s a lot more to security than just the VR database, and public trust is at the top of the list. Voters trust local officials more than state or federal officials. &nbsp;Local officials are the name and the face of elections, and should receive support (including resources, training, and outreach) to help shore up public confidence in elections.”</p>
<p>Maryland’s Charlson said it made sense for the state to keep the money centrally located given the state’s election structure.</p>
<p>“Because of how we administer elections in Maryland, we have the ability and infrastructure in place to procure goods and services for the local election officials, pay invoices, and receive reimbursement for those invoices,” Charlson said. “With this process, we can use federal funds to pay for goods or services for the local election officials, rather than transferring the funds to the local election officials.&nbsp; Centralized management of the funds worked well with the original allocation of HAVA funds.”</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Sens. <a href="http://thehill.com/people/james-lankford">James Lankford</a> (R-Oklahoma) and <a href="http://thehill.com/people/amy-klobuchar">Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minnesota) have introduced a new version of the <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/391380-senators-introduce-election-security-amendment-to-defense-bill">Secure Elections Act</a> as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The lawmakers originally introduced the legislation in December and according to The Hill have since then been working with state elections officials to revise the legislation to address some of the fears expressed by the states.</p>
<p>“The security of our election systems is a major national security issue, and it is appropriate for this legislation to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act,” Lankford said in a statement. “This legislation will help states prepare our election infrastructure for the possibility of interference from Russia, Iran, North Korea, or a domestic hacktivist group.”</p>
<p>In other Capitol Hill news, a group of Democratic senators has introduced a bill that would require state and local governments to take <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/391881-dems-unveil-push-to-secure-state-voting-systems">two steps to ensure that votes</a> are properly counted. According to The Hill, under the legislation, states would have to use voting systems that use voter-verified paper ballots that could be audited and states and local officials would also be required to implement risk-limiting audits.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>Voters in five more states went to the polls this week. It was the usual hodgepodge of confused voters, malfunctioning voting machines and delayed results. Probably the biggest story out of June 12 was the debut of ranked-choice voting in Maine.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> All eyes were on Maine this week as the state rolled out <a href="http://www.wmtw.com/article/what-to-know-about-tuesdays-primary/21083088">ranked-choice voting</a> for the first statewide elections in the nation. Voters also weighed in on a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maine/articles/2018-06-12/ranked-choice-voting-system-faces-big-test-in-maine-primary">referendum</a> that would have, if approved, repealed the use of ranked-choice. It wasn’t a perfect rollout with some elections officials noticing an uptick in <a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/06/12/central-maine-residents-focus-on-ranked-choice-voting-as-they-head-to-polls/">spoiled ballots</a>. Some voters also <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-06-13/maines-ranked-choice-voting-requires-some-patience">questioned</a> why they were being asked to vote on the system while using the system. With seven Democratic candidates vying for governor, it is <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2018/06/13/politics/whats-next-in-ranked-choice-tallying-for-democrats-who-want-to-replace-lepage/">all but certain</a> that the ranked-choice counting system will come into play. When it does, all ballots will be brought via <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/2018/06/couriers_to_deliver_ranked_voting_results_to_maines_capital">courier</a> to the state elections offices for counting. Although voters approved keeping the system and things seemed to go well, overall, on primary day, Gov. Paul LePage has threatened <a href="http://www.sunjournal.com/as-maine-holds-first-ranked-choice-election-lepage-says-he-probably-wont-certify-results/">not to certify the election</a>. In addition to ranked-choice voting, voters faced a variety of <a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/06/12/central-maine-residents-focus-on-ranked-choice-voting-as-they-head-to-polls/">typical election-day issues</a> including a lack of parking at a polling place in Chelsea, and voting machine issues in Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> There were some “<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/some-hiccups-during-voting-in-nevada-primary-election/">hiccups</a>” during primary voting in the The Silver State primary this week. In <a href="https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/The-Latest-Polls-open-in-Nevada-primary-election-12987857.php">Reno</a>, technical errors with the county’s new voting machines slowed some voters. There were reports in <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/12/ballots-problems-reported-washoe-county/696249002/">Washoe County</a> that some candidates were left off of ballots. <a href="http://www.macon.com/news/business/article213018499.html">Clark County</a> voters also experienced problems with names on ballots. Technical issues delayed the vote count in <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Latest-Polls-open-in-Nevada-primary-election-12987857.php">Pershing County</a>. In the secretary of state race, incumbent Barbara Cegavske (R) will face State Assemblyman Nelson Araujo (D).</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: It was a relatively quiet day at the polls and <a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/government-and-politics/4459290-18300-votes-cast-cass-county-turnout-more-last-non-presidential">voting was slow</a>, but not because there were any issues. Some voters in <a href="http://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/Voting-location-confusion-prevents-some-from-casting-ballot--485312411.html">Grand Forks</a> had issues with showing up at the incorrect polling places. And in the race for <a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/government-and-politics/4460191-gardner-still-expected-drop-out-after-winning-gop-primary">secretary of state</a>, Will Gardner won the Republican nomination although he had dropped out of the race last month According to the InForum, Gardner has notified party officials that he will follow through and formally withdraw. In November, Democrat Joshua Boschee will face incumbent Al Jaeger who is running as an independent.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: While election day was smooth for many South Carolina voters, it wasn’t perfect for everyone. In <a href="http://www.goupstate.com/news/20180612/voting-machines-at-one-spartanburg-county-precinct-forced-to-operate-on-battery-power">Spartanburg County</a>, one precinct was forced to operate on battery power. Some <a href="http://www.live5news.com/story/38405858/some-berkeley-county-voters-learn-polling-place-locations-have-changed">Berkley County</a> voters were greeted with polling location changes. Results were delayed in <a href="http://www.wspa.com/news/primary-results-delayed-in-greenville-co-due-to-broken-vote-counting-machines/123522348">Greenville County</a> due to broken counting machines. Results were late in <a href="http://wpde.com/news/local/results-trickling-in-late-for-florence-county-elections">Florence County</a>. Eight voting machines in <a href="http://www.wbtw.com/news/grand-strand/eight-voting-machines-in-horry-county-not-closed-properly-nearly-300-votes-unaccounted-for-/1236809593">Horry County</a> were not closed properly which delayed the tallying of votes. The election was also an opportunity to debut the state’s <a href="http://www.live5news.com/story/38385180/palmetto-project-gives-i-voted-stickers-a-makeover-in-time-for-primaries">new “I Voted” stickers</a> that were provided by the nonprofit Palmetto Project.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Election day in the commonwealth was marked by relatively low <a href="http://www.wvva.com/story/38405216/the-latest-registrars-report-low-turnout-across-virginia">turnout</a>. Voters <a href="http://wina.com/news/064460-064460-people-finding-new-polling-places-okay-in-albemarle-county/">Albemarle County</a> found their new polling places with few problems. One issue that did arise for voters and poll workers in the Washington, DC-area of Virginia forced them to decide between their civic duty and celebrating the <a href="https://wtop.com/washington-capitals/2018/06/area-poll-worker-feels-forgotten-by-caps-parade-date-selection/">Stanley Cup victory</a> of the Washington Capitals. Voting absentee to attend the championship parade was a valid excuse, but poll workers had a tougher choice to make. Anecdotally, Northern Virginia registrars didn’t report problems with poll workers not showing up.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>After more than 118,000 Los Angeles County </strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-county-missing-ballots-update-20180608-story.html"><strong>voters were left off</strong> the rolls</a> due to a “printing error,” Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan said that he is seeking an independent investigation into what happened and how. According to the Los Angeles Times, Logan said it appears that corrupted data resulted in voters’ names not being printed. Logan told the paper nothing can be ruled out yet, even sabotage. “There’s nothing to indicate initially that there was anything malicious,” Logan said. “But we need to exhaust everything.”</p>
<p><strong>The Voter Participation Center is at it again</strong> this election cycle. More than 380,000 Floridians will be receiving <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/06/12/group-to-flood-florida-with-voter-registration-forms/">voter registration forms in the mail</a>, many to people who are already registered to vote. The mailing has of course generated complaints from voters that supervisors of election must now deal with. &#8220;Unfortunately, and historically, the VPC and CVI pull information for their mailings from various unverified sources,&#8221; Brevard Supervisor of Elections Lori Scott told the Tampa Bay Times. &#8220;Previous mailings have resulted in voter registration applications being sent to deceased persons, minor children and even pets. Mailings have also been sent to registered voters, which creates <a href="http://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20180613/okaloosa-supervisor-of-elections-warns-of-potentially-misleading-mailouts">unnecessary confusion and concern</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In 2016, more than 1 million Washingtonians,</strong> many of them young people, were eligible to register to vote, but did not. Now Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and Secretary of State Kim Wyman (R) are joining forces and launching the <a href="https://www.auburn-reporter.com/news/inslee-wyman-launch-governors-student-voter-registration-challenge/">Governor’s Student Voter Registration Challenge</a>. The Governor’s Student Voter Registration Challenge asks all of Washington’s public higher education institutions to participate: 34 community and technical colleges and six, four-year universities. “Democracy works best when all voices are heard, and statistics show that not enough young people take the time to register and vote,” Wyman said. “We need to turn that around.”</p>
<p><strong>In other voter registration news,</strong> Voto Latino announced this week a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/voto-latino-voter-registration/index.html">new push to register 1 million</a> voters by 2020. The group will be focusing its attentions on Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The group plans to spend about $7 million on the push.</p>

The bill would ask voters to decide this November whether to add this paragraph to the constitution: &#8220;Photo identification for voting in person.

<p><strong>Utah:</strong> A new law now on the books allows voters to keep their <a href="http://www.good4utah.com/news/local-news/new-law-lets-voters-prevent-the-state-from-selling-their-voter-registration-information/1237363068">voter registration information</a> provide and not available for sale.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The Ninth Circuit heard arguments last week about whether or not it should reverse dismissal of a case brought by former Poway Mayor Don Higginson challenging the constitutionality of the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-hears-challenge-to-california-voting-rights-act/">California Voting Rights Act</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt has blocked the state of Indiana from enforcing a 2017 law allowing election officials to remove voters from the rolls that were <a href="http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2018/jun/09/federal-judge-blocks-indiana-from-enforcing-voter-purge-law/">flagged through the Crosscheck program</a>. &#8220;While the defendants have a strong public interest in protecting the integrity of voter registration rolls and the electoral process, they have other procedures in place that can protect that public interest that do not violate the NVRA,&#8221; Pratt wrote in granting a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> A three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals has ruled that the Douglas County District Court must call a grand jury to <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2018/jun/08/appeals-court-douglas-county-must-call-grand-jury-/">investigate alleged misconduct in the secretary of state’s office</a>. According to the Lawrence Journal-World, Steven X. Davis, of Lawrence, who had run for a seat in the Kansas Legislature in 2016 and who is running in a different district this year, filed petitions in August 2017 calling for a grand jury to investigate general allegations that Kobach’s office had mismanaged the state’s voter registration system and had been “grossly neglectful with respect to their election duties.”</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> Voice of the Experienced and eight convicted felons have appealed their <a href="http://www.katc.com/story/38384681/suit-on-parolee-voting-rights-goes-to-louisiana-high-court">felon voting-rights lawsuit</a> to the state’s highest court. Their suit argues that the state’s constitution allows those no longer imprisoned to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Priorities USA, a voting rights organization, has filed a suit in Cole County on behalf of a 70-year-old Jackson County woman over the state’s <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213116779.html">voter ID law</a>. “For voters who are unable to navigate these new and unnecessary procedural hurdles, the path to casting an effective ballot is fraught with uncertainty and unwarranted threats of criminal penalties,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Judge Charles Temple has stepped aside in the <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/judge-steps-aside-from-voting-law-case-citing-friendship-with-states-attorney/21242037">constitutional challenge</a> to a 2017 tightening the state’s voter registration law because his friend is now part of the state’s legal team.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A lawyer for Whitney Brown, who has been charged for voting while still on probation, argues that the charges should be dismissed because the law has <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article212824524.html">“toxic, racist origins” and is unconstitutional</a>. Brown’s attorney argues that the law violates the state constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has denied the state’s request to suspend a lower court’s order that loosened the state’s <a href="https://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/government-and-politics/4458765-federal-appeals-court-denies-states-request-nd-voter-id-case">voter ID law</a>. Given the proximity of the primary, the denial was without prejudice leaving the door open for the state to seek another stay.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> In a 5-4 ruling, the United States Supreme Court has upheld Ohio’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/us/politics/supreme-court-upholds-ohios-purge-of-voting-rolls.html">process of purging voters from the rolls</a>. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, said federal laws allowed such notices as part of a process to cull inaccuracies from the voting rolls. A key provision, he wrote, “simply forbids the use of nonvoting as the sole criterion for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use it that way.” In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote that the goal of ensuring the accuracy of voting rolls did not justify erecting obstacles to prevent eligible voters from casting ballots. “The purpose of our election process is not to test the fortitude and determination of the voter, but to discern the will of the majority,” he wrote, quoting a Senate report.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> State District Judge Ruben Gonzalez has denied a new trial to Crystal Mason who was sentenced to five years in prison <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article212899734.html">for voting while still on probation</a>. Gonzalez is the same judge to sentenced Mason earlier this year. Mason’s attorneys vowed to take the original trial to the appellate court.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The territory’s highest court has upheld a newly enacted law that the there should be a <a href="https://stjohnsource.com/2018/06/08/supreme-court-upholds-single-board-of-elections/">single Virgin Islands board of elections</a> and that district board members that are continuing to meet and refusing to select officers for the unified board are in violation of the law. Following the ruling, the territory’s <a href="http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/ag-to-elections-board-actions-taken-separately-invalid/article_9098e1a1-5be5-5b92-9b63-38f39b84e3eb.html">attorney general</a> backed it up by saying that “all actions taken by the district boards subsequent to August 1, 2017 are null and void.”</p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> This week, the Los Angeles County board of supervisors voted to unanimously fund a to <a href="http://abc7.com/politics/new-voting-system-approved-by-la-county-board-of-supervisors/3595736/">revamp the county’s voting system</a> using Smartmatic. The contract could reach $282 million. &#8220;The contract is a performance-based contract based on key deliverables and service-level agreements,&#8221; Registrar-Recorder Dean Logan said according to ABC 7. The system will employ touch-screen ballots. Neighborhood polling sites will be replaced by regional polling centers. Paper ballots will record each vote and be fully auditable. The system will go through mock elections later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> This week, the Pennsylvania Auditor General announced a <a href="http://www.witf.org/state-house-sound-bites/2018/06/-pas-voter-registration-system-will-be-audited-over-hacking-concerns.php">review of the commonwealth’s voting and registration process</a>. According to WITF, Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said the review will focus on the security of the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors&#8211;or SURE&#8211;system, which tracks registration data on the state and county level. DePasquale said he would work with the secretary of state’s office to come up with a plan to replace the 16-year-old SURE system.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/news/2018/5/25/job-civic-data-research-fellow">Civic Data Research Fellow</a>, Center for Technology and Civic Life</strong> — “What’s on my ballot?” is the number one question that voters look for online &#8211; but the answer to that question is harder to find than you might think. With nearly 8,000 offices responsible for running elections in America, the basic information that voters need to participate in elections is often poorly formatted and hard to find &#8211; if it’s online at all. At the Center for Technology and Civic Life, we think all voters should be able to find this information online, and we need your help! In 2016, our ballot data reached between one-third and one-half of all voters in the country, and we expect 2018 to be even bigger.
