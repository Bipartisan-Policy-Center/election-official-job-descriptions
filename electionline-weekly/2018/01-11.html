							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>What to watch in 2018</strong><br /><em>In a busy year, here are 10 things we’ll definitely be watching</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>We here at a electionline love a good list, maybe not as much as the folks at BuzzFeed, but we do enjoy them and so while we keep our eyes on everything happening in the elections world, as we kick off this very busy mid-term election year, we thought we’d list the big 10.</p>
<p>As we move closer to Election Day 2018, it will be interesting to see how many of these items remain an issue and what new items have been added to the list.</p>
<p>So here, no particular order, here are the 10 things we’ll be watching closely in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>New voting machines </strong>— voters in several states and many counties will face new voting equipment when they hit the polls this year. Will poll workers be ready? Will voters be able to handle the changes?</p>
<p><strong>2. Voter ID</strong> — this year will mark the first major roll out of voter ID in several states including Iowa, Missouri, Texas and West Virginia. The secretaries of state in Iowa, Missouri and West Virginia have spent a lot of time (and continue to do so) on education campaigns about the law and Texas’ law remains embroiled in litigation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Automatic voter registration</strong> — currently <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx">nine states and the District of Columbia</a> have approved legislation allowing for automatic voter registration although only four — Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Vermont — have implemented it yet. The approach in the states and DC varies. Some are opt-out, others are opt-in, some retroactively add voters to the rolls while others start from a certain date. What impact, if any, will AVR have on turnout in those states and will any of the remaining states and DC get theirs up and running before November 2018? Also, how many other states will introduce legislation to move in this direction and what type of AVR will they seek to implement?</p>
<p><strong>4. Turnout</strong> — mid-term elections turnout always falls off from a presidential year, but given the current political climate, will that be the case in 2018 and if there is a drop off, how big will it be?</p>
<p><strong>5. Cybersecurity</strong> — the 800-lb <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/42-states-havent-upgraded-their-election-equipment-in-over-a-decade-and-russia-knows-it">Russian</a> in the room this year is cybersecurity. The <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/368348-homeland-security-speeds-up-election-security-aid-to-states">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a> announced this week that it is prepared to help every state that wants help securing their systems for 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>6. New California voting system </strong>— in 2016 the General Assembly approved the <a href="https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/09/22/75741/challenges-mount-as-rollout-of-new-california-voti/">Voters’ Choice Act</a> that allows counties to run elections by mail with Election Day vote centers. Although many Californians already vote-by-mail, no counties have strictly run on a by mail/vote center system. A handful of counties will introduce the new way of voting this year.</p>
<p><strong>7. Secretary of state races</strong> — the top election position in 24 states is up for grabs this year. While many of the sitting secretaries of state are seeking re-election, some like <a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/">Ohio’s Jon Husted</a> and <a href="https://www.sos.ks.gov/">Kansas’ Kris Kobach</a>, cannot/will not be running again. We’ll have more on these races in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>. <strong>Legislation</strong> — although election years don’t tend to be as busy legislatively as non-election years (we know, we know, EVERY year is an election year) legislators across the country have already been busy introducing bills. Everything from early voting to automatic voter registration to vote-by-mail to no excuse absentee voting.</p>
<p><strong>9. Fake news/ voter suppression </strong>— Facebook, Twitter and other platforms have vowed to get the fake news in check, but perpetrators of fake news often quickly find new ways to spread their misinformation campaigns. With many Americans wary of the main stream media and fake news on the rise, what impacts, if any, could that have on elections?</p>
<p><strong>10. Special elections</strong> — every year is filled with special elections, but with the prevalence of the #metoo campaign and other situations pushing legislators at all levels to resign, will 2018 prove to be a big year for special elections. Some state legislators are already working on changing the rules about how vacated seats are filled in order to avoid costly and usually low-turnout special elections.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Fallout continued this week from President Donald J. Trump’s decision to disband the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (PACEI).</p>
<p>Elections officials from across the country weighed in on the decision including: <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/03/trump-voter-fraud-commission-california-alex-padilla/">California</a>, <a href="http://www.koaa.com/story/37187534/colorado-politicians-react-to-decision-to-disband-voter-fraud-commission">Colorado</a>, <a href="http://wnpr.org/post/connecticuts-top-election-official-says-end-election-fraud-commission-ominous-sign">Connecticut</a>, <a href="http://mycn2.com/politics/grimes-responds-to-disbandment-of-trump-s-voter-fraud-commission">Kentucky</a>, <a href="https://www.necn.com/news/politics/Secretary-of-State-William-Galvin-Welcomes-Demise-of-Trumps-Election-Fraud-Commission-468039033.html">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="http://krwg.org/post/secretary-state-toulouse-oliver-statement-president-trump-s-election-commission-dissolving">New Mexico</a>, <a href="http://statenews.org/post/secretary-state-speaks-out-shutdown-trumps-voter-fraud-panel">Ohio</a>, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180104/dissolution-of-voter-fraud-commission-hailed-by-ri-secretary-of-state">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="http://www.vermontbiz.com/news/2018/january/04/condos-agrees-president-dissolving-election-integrity-commission">Vermont</a>, and <a href="https://buckrail.com/secretary-murray-right-defy-feds-applauds-trumps-decision-dissolve-election-commission/">Wyoming</a>.</p>
<p>Members of PACEI spoke out as well including New Hampshire Secretary of State <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/secretary-of-state-gardner-says-despite-end-of-commission-hell-continue-to-work-for-accessible-trustworthy-elections/14746741">William Gardner</a>, Wood County, West Virginia Clerk <a href="http://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2018/01/mark-rhodes-talks-end-of-election-commission/">Mark Rhodes</a>, Kansas Secretary of State <a href="http://wkms.org/post/kris-kobach-what-led-disbandment-controversial-election-commission">Kris Kobach</a>, <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/blackwell-lawsuits-democrats-fault-for-end-voter-fraud-panel/9VOx1PCLiVO2LpKPgj95gL/">Ken Blackwell</a> from Ohio and <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/06/alabama-election-official-trumps-voter-fraud-commission-poorly-thought-out/1009618001/">Alan King</a> from Alabama.</p>
<p>In his decision the president said that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would take over the investigation, but a report from Reuters said that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-dhs/dhs-election-unit-has-no-plans-for-probing-voter-fraud-sources-idUSKBN1EU1YF?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews">DHS’ election security</a> unit has “no immediate plans to probe allegations of electoral fraud.”</p>
<p>Even though there seem to be “no immediate plans” to probe potential election fraud, a spokesperson from DHS said this week that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach would <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article193647529.html">not be advising</a> the agency when it does investigate voter fraud claims.</p>
<p>As for what data PACEI had already collected from states, the White House says that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/white-house-says-it-will-destroy-trump-voter-panel-data-send-no-records-to-dhs/2018/01/10/e70704a8-f616-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html?utm_term=.de7dad6e66cb">data will be destroyed</a> and not turned over to DHS.</p>
<p>However, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap continues to pursue the paperwork that a judge had previously ruled he should have. Dunlap has asked the <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/01/09/maine-secretary-of-state-asks-court-to-force-trump-to-turn-over-voter-fraud-commission-documents/">U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia</a> to intervene to secure access to the documents. According to the Portland Press Herald, the request also asks the court to temporarily block the commission from transferring any of the documents to DHS while it considers its final decision.</p>
<p>In non-PACEI news, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) said this week that the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/08/senate-intel-panel-issue-election-security-advice-soon-thwart-foreign-meddling-primaries-russian-med/1012601001/">Senate Intelligence Committee</a> will soon issue recommendations to help states thwart efforts to hack election systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think there&#8217;s a real sense of urgency,&#8221; Warner said in an interview with USA TODAY. &#8220;The one thing we do know with certainty is that Russian interference in our elections did not end on Election Day 2016.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., also has indicated that he expects the committee to provide security advice to states early this year.</p>
<p>During a meeting held by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Bob Kolasky, the acting deputy undersecretary in Homeland Security’s cyber unit, acknowledged a <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/368348-homeland-security-speeds-up-election-security-aid-to-states">backlog of risk and vulnerability assessments</a> which would have had states waiting up to nine months for the assessments.</p>
<p>“I am here today to tell you we have the ability now to meet all the state requests that we have received,” Kolasky said during a keynote address. We want all the rest of the states to sign up, and if they do we believe we will be able to do those risk and vulnerability assessments onsite before the midterm elections. That is a significant shift of our own resources.”</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p>III. Election News This Week</p>
<p><strong>An analysis by <em>The Washington Post</em> found</strong> that thousands of Virginia voters <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/virginia-wrong-districts/?utm_term=.5668bd9d9da8">may be registered in the wrong state House district</a>. In a statewide analysis, <em>The Washington Post</em> found addresses of about 6,000 registered voters that appear to lie outside a map of the assigned House district. If their turnout tracked the state average, more than 2,800 mistaken state House votes could have been cast in November. Six of the 100 delegate races were decided by fewer than 500 votes. The paper said the problem comes from the “state’s labor-intensive voter registration system that allows incorrect details to be recorded.”</p>
<p><strong>Native American advocates have spent the last few months gathering stories</strong> from throughout Indian Country about difficulties tribal members face when casting a ballot and the advocates hope these stories will <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/groups-document-voting-rights-abuses-in-indian-country/">help tribal members wield more influence in elections</a>. “Some of the problems they were facing actually were issues we thought we’d taken care of long ago,” said OJ Semans, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member and executive director of Four Directions. “If you don’t keep your eye open and the communication open, things will reverse.” The groups have already held a hearing on the issues in Washington and have plans to hold other hearing in Arizona, Oregon, California, New Mexico and Oklahoma. “What we’re trying to show is people don’t have equal opportunities to vote, to register to vote and to participate in Indian Country than you would see in maybe a more urban setting,” James Tucker, a pro-bono attorney for the Native American Rights Fund said at the Washington hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Using the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau</strong>, the state of California has added <a href="http://www.signaltribunenewspaper.com/?p=36300">six new languages</a> to the 2018 election-language assistance requirements. The new languages include Panjabi, Hmong, Syriac, Armenian, Persian and Arabic. That brings the total number of languages covered by Election Code Section 14201 to 13. The existing languages include English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>E<strong>lections offices may still be closed in parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands,</strong> but that has not stopped the work of the board of elections. This week the board voted <a href="http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/election-board-defunds-primary-race/article_c3f867bd-0aa5-5d03-953c-ed4cbb3b05fc.html">not to provide funding for a primary election</a>. The board voted unanimously to reprogram the $150,000 budgeted for the 2018 primary to the general fund. In making their decision the board cited their objections to including Democratic party races as part of the primary process.</p>
<p><strong>The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has produced a free</strong> to download white paper on how electoral institutions can deal with the growing problem of hate speech. Although IFES’ focus is largely international, given the current climate we thought elections officials in the United States might be interested in <a href="http://www.ifes.org/publications/countering-hate-speech-elections-strategies-electoral-management-bodies">Countering Hate Speech in Elections: Strategies for Electoral Management</a>. According to IFES, the white paper aims to help electoral management bodies better understand the range of issues surrounding hate speech during the electoral cycle, the regulatory and non-regulatory options that may be brought to bear, and how to build partnerships with stakeholders to ensure that elections are free, fair, inclusive and safe.</p>
<p><strong>We’re not sure that this would be possible everywhere, but we love</strong> that when the Taylor County, West Virginia commission received some negative feedback about relocating polling places, the commission decided to <a href="https://mountainstatesman.com/article/commissioners-give-a-voice-to-the-people-with-precinct-poll-surveys">survey all registered voters</a> in the affected precincts. The commission reviewed the survey responses — about 40 percent were returned — at a recent meeting and decided to go with the will of the people which sent the voters back to their original polling places. “I think we should let the votes stand for themselves,” Commission President Orville Wright said at the meeting according to the <em>Mountain Statesman</em>. “They people have decided, and we should go with their decision.”</p>

In addition to serving on the board of elections, Bennett also served as a county legislator and an election clerk in the town of South Valley. “Laura worked at the Board of Elections and at that time the Democrat Party was strictly grass roots,” County Clerk James Griffith told the <em>Salamanca Press</em>. “Laura ran a print shop at the old Democratic Headquarters on Main Street in Salamanca. Her car could be seen there until the wee hours as she printed flyers, scratch pads and posters. She always had ink on her somewhere,” he added.</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation:</strong> Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) has introduced a bill that would end a longtime quirk with the Postal Service that has some rural northern <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2018/01/10/mccaskill-bill-addresses-northern-missouri-mailing-quirk/1022632001/">Missouri residents with an Iowa mailing address</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> With the spotlight off for now, lawmakers in Alabama are looking for ways to streamline the state’s <a href="http://www.wiat.com/news/local/state-republicans-sponsor-bill-that-would-change-special-election-laws/903907131">special election process</a>. SB-18, sponsored by Sen. Gerald Dial has introduced a bill that would require the governor to appoint a person to a vacancy in the office of U.S. Senate and issue a writ of election to fill the office for the remainder of the term at the next general election occurring more than one year after the vacancy occurs.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Sen. Mike McGuire has introduced a bill that would establish a process for election officials to notify voters when their <a href="http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php/news/community/53942-sen-mcguire-introduces-bill-to-ensure-all-votes-are-counted">vote-by-mail signature mismatches the one on file</a>. The bill would also require voters whose signatures don’t match be given the opportunity to correct the discrepancy. The bill was recently approved by the Senate Elections Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> A bill that would allow elections officials to count the ballots of voters who cast an early vote or absentee ballot, but then <a href="http://www.therepublic.com/2018/01/09/01092018cr_dead_voters/">die before Election Day</a> has been approved 9-0 by the Senate Elections committee.</p>
<p>The Senate Elections committee also approved a bill that would allow for <a href="http://wvik.org/post/senate-panel-advances-bill-allow-no-excuse-absentee-voting#stream/0">no-excuse absentee voting</a>. The Indiana Clerks Association has expressed its support for the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Rep. McKenzie Cantrell has filed House Bill 98 which would <a href="http://www.whas11.com/news/politics/louisville-lawmaker-files-bill-requiring-special-elections/505290626">require a special election</a> when an unexpected vacancy occurs on a local council.</p>
<p>Also in Kentucky, House Bill 23, which would <a href="http://mycn2.com/politics/bill-which-would-move-statewide-office-elections-to-even-numbered-years-passes-house-committee">change the election year</a> of governor, lieutenant governor and state constitutional officers from odd number years to even-numbered years has been approved by the House Committee on Elections, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Paul LePage (R) has announced his intentions to bring forward legislation that would require Maine voters to show a <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2018/01/05/politics/lepage-again-calls-for-stricter-voter-id-law-in-maine/">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> The City of Rockville council is considering a proposal from its board of supervisors of elections that would allow the city to <a href="http://www.mymcmedia.org/rockville-considering-vote-mail-elections/">conduct elections by mail</a>. Under the proposal, every registered voter would receive a ballot which they could return by mail, to a ballot drop box or in person. There would be Election Day vote centers as well.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, the City of Greenbelt approved a measure to <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/greenbelt-lowers-voting-age-to-16-for-city-elections">lower the voting age in local elections to 16</a>. In order to be able to vote in local elections, 16 and 17-year-olds&nbsp;must be a resident of Greenbelt and must be registered in Prince George&#8217;s County.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge L. Scott Coogler ordered a lawsuit filed by the Greater Birmingham Ministries, Alabama NAACP and a group of individuals against the state over its voter ID law be dismissed. According to <em>Al.com</em>, part of Coogler&#8217;s court order reads &#8220;&#8230;a person who does not have a photo ID today is not prevented from voting if he or she can easily get one, and it is so easy to get a photo ID in Alabama, no on is prevented from voting.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Kane County Judge David Akemann has ruled that there were enough signatures on petitions to put a question on the ballot about the fate of the <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180110/judge-referendum-on-aurora-election-law-can-go-on-march-ballot">Aurora election commission</a>. If approved, the county clerk will take over the duties of running Aurora’s elections.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Judge Julie Robinson has set a March trial date for the case of Fish v Kobach in which the plaintiffs are challenging Kansas’ <a href="https://www.wibwnewsnow.com/voter-registration-suit-continues-forward-trial-scheduled-march/">proof-of-citizenship</a> law. Robinson also <a href="http://hppr.org/post/court-fight-over-kansas-voting-rights-will-exclude-some-evidence">tossed aside some testimony</a> including from Hans von Spakovsky. According to HPPR, the courts said von Spaovsky lacks direct knowledge or academic training related to some of his claims.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Felony <a href="https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Ballot-tampering-nbsp-charge-nbsp-dropped-for-12480751.php">ballot tampering</a> charges have been dropped against Grout Twp. Clerk Linda Birgel. “The bottom line is, with all the evidence and everything we had, there is insufficient evidence that (Birgel) did anything to defraud or impact the election in any way,&#8221; Midland County Prosecutor J. Dee Brooks told the <em>Midland Daily News</em>.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Without providing a reason, the New Mexico Supreme Court turned away a legal challenge to the implementation of <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/court-clears-way-for-ranked-choice-voting-in-city-election/article_b12b039c-f590-11e7-b711-9f456ef43212.html">ranked choice voting</a> in Santa Fe. Therefore, a decade after voters approved moving to the new system, they will use it for the first time this spring.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously found that North Carolina’s Republican lawmakers <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/state_region/court-throws-out-congressional-district-map-again/article_0555122b-3723-5b6b-9a68-e733c784b299.html">violated the Constitution’s equal-protection clause</a> when they drew the state’s new congressional maps. “On its most fundamental level, partisan gerrymandering violates ‘the core principle of republican government … that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around,’” the majority opinion states.</p>
<p>In other North Carolina legal news, Richard Robert Rawling, 59 of Cary pleaded guilty to <a href="http://www.wral.com/durham-elections-worker-pleads-guilty-to-altering-vote-counts-in-2016-primary/17247689/">failure to discharge a duty of his office</a> and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended to a year on probation and a $500 fine. Investigators determined that Rawling ran, or ordered subordinates to run provisional ballots through tabulators more than once and made changes to the ballot count.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Ohio’s <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-supreme-court-voter-purge-20180110-story.html">voter roll purge case</a> this week and according to reports from those in attendance, the justices appeared sympathetic to the state. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, Justice <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/justice-system/anthony-kennedy-PEPLT00008042-topic.html" title="Anthony Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a> said states are &#8220;trying to protect their voter rolls&#8230;What we&#8217;re talking about are the best tools to implement that reason, to implement that purpose.&#8221; Kennedy&#8217;s vote often is decisive in voting cases that otherwise split conservative and liberal justices.</p>
