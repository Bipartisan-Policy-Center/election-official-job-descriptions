							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>William &amp; Mary hosts election law symposium</strong><br /><em>Symposium features war game simulating election security dispute</em></p>
<p>By Anna McMullen &#8217;18;<br />Rebecca Green and Amy McDowell, Election Law Program Co-Directors; and<br />Reiko Dogu, ELP Program Manager</p>
<p><strong>Forward by Tammy Patrick of The Democracy Fund</strong></p>
<p>A wise man once said that election administrators need to also be IT Managers; I think he would agree that in the current climate they also need to be security experts.</p>
<p>Election professionals have increased the focus of their attention to security issues since the 2016 election cycle given the knowledge of increased threats from nation-state adversaries. “Threat-landscape”, “penetration testing”, and a slew of new initialisms and acronyms are now part of the election administrator’s lexicon.</p>
<p>The good news is that there is support from all levels of government, as well as the non-profit and for-profit sectors, in ensuring that our democratic processes are protected.</p>
<p>Yet, there has been one area that had not garnered as much attention until last week: that of statutory/legal coverage, precedence, and the availability of what guidance an election official has at their disposal should they find that their system was attacked.</p>
<p>Do our existing laws provide a clear path forward should an attack be successful?</p>
<p>How do contingency plans and state of emergency statutes speak to this issue, if at all?</p>
<p>Who is responsible and authorized to make certain decisions about the protection of our systems?</p>
<p>These questions, and more, were contemplated last week at the William and Mary Law School event.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>12th Annual Election Law Symposium</strong><br /><strong>Election Data Security:&nbsp; Testing the Critical Infrastructure Designation</strong></p>
<p>On April 12, the <a href="http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/electionlaw/">William &amp; Mary Election Law Program</a> hosted a unique symposium aimed at expanding understanding of the role of courts in promoting election security. The symposium focused specifically on the critical infrastructure designation pursuant to the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2014.</p>
<p>Following opening remarks by Symposium student Co-Chairs Camden Kelliher ’21 and Alexis Dalton ’20, the event kicked off with a war game simulating an election security dispute in the fictional state of “Flichigan.” The law of Flichigan combined the Virginia election code with provisions from the Michigan state constitution as the basis for the exercise.</p>
<p>In the fictional scenario, Flichigan experienced a hack of its voter registration database in Flichigan’s most populous county, Bayne County. The hack occurred several weeks prior to Flichigan’s U.S. Senate primary elections in August 2018. The hacker changed registration information of roughly one hundred Flichigan voters, resulting in mass confusion at Bayne County polling places on the day of the primary. Bayne County election officials worked to efficiently resolve the matter by issuing provisional ballots and engaging in an audit process following the primary to ensure an accurate count. The winning candidate won in a landslide.</p>
<p>As the November general election approached, Secretary of State John Ruth—the state’s chief election official—hired an outside vendor to audit the security of the state’s election system. Secretary Ruth immediately implemented all recommendations that the vendor made. On this basis, Secretary Ruth believed that the necessary steps were taken to ensure the general election would be secure. Mary Barrett, General Registrar of Bayne County, was not convinced. She invoked a federal statute that enables non-federal entities to request that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conduct a security assessment.</p>
<p>Because, as of January 2017, elections are designated as critical infrastructure to be afforded special protection under the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2014, DHS gave priority to Barrett’s request. Barrett requested specifically that DHS conduct a security audit of Bayne’s voter registration system, a request that would require the cooperation of the Secretary of State in providing access to DHS. Secretary Ruth, skeptical of federal meddling in state election matters and concerned that such access could subject Bayne data to enhanced risk, refused DHS access to Bayne County’s voter registration system. In response, Registrar Barrett sought a writ of mandamus to compel Secretary Ruth’s cooperation, a request which a Flichigan trial court denied. Registrar Barrett immediately appealed, leading to the oral argument at the Election Law Symposium’s war game: Bayne v. Ruth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.venable.com/political-law-practices/">Venable political law</a> attorney Meredith McCoy ’12 argued before the bench as counsel for Bayne County’s General Registrar. John Davisson of the <a href="https://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) (an organization on the forefront of advocating for voter privacy) argued on behalf of Secretary Ruth.</p>
<p>The mock judges presiding over the argument were Edgardo Cortes, Former Commissioner for the Virginia Department of Elections and current advisor on cybersecurity and elections at the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/voting-rights-elections">Brennan Center</a>; David Becker, Executive Director of the <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/">Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</a>; and Mark Listes, Policy Counsel at the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Ms. McCoy argued that Bayne County should be permitted to request DHS assistance because the Flichigan statute places the authority over voter registration and list maintenance processes with county election officials. State statute also organized Flichigan’s electoral process in a decentralized manner; each county has its own Board of Elections with decision-making authority. McCoy highlighted local registrars’ authority with several examples that demonstrated that the state’s chief election official serves a guiding role, but lacks authority to compel local registrar action under the state statutory scheme.</p>
<p>McCoy argued that the appeal centered on voter registration, a responsibility of Flichigan counties, as opposed to election purity which is a state responsibility. McCoy emphasized the importance of a decentralized election system, arguing that such a system promotes election security because there is no central location or single security protocol that a would-be hacker could access, thus compromising all state voter data. McCoy argued that Congress’ decision to provide “non-federal entities” with the opportunity to request assistance from DHS overrode the Secretary of State’s refusal to comply.</p>
<p>On behalf of Secretary Ruth, Mr. Davisson argued that the Flichigan chief election official, not local registrars, is responsible for ensuring Flichigan elections are secure and is thus the only person with authority to request the DHS audit. Davisson maintained that Congress, when it passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2519/text">National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014</a>, never intended to empower local registrars to request assistance from DHS. That power, Davisson advocated, more naturally falls to the state’s chief election official who is responsible for maintaining the statewide voter registration database. Davisson conceded that Flichigan statute delegated to local registrars supervisory power over voter registration lists in their own counties, but nevertheless asserted that since the state maintained the centralized voter registration database, the Secretary of State should make all decisions related to its security.</p>
<p>After argument concluded, the panel retired to deliberate, returning a 2-1 verdict in favor of the state and denying the writ of mandamus.</p>
<p>The majority agreed with the Secretary of State that security should be handled centrally, not locally. They asserted that local registrars’ state constitutional duty to maintain “the purity of elections” extended to maintenance and upkeep of the voter registration records but did not extend to making unilateral cybersecurity decisions. The dissent agreed with the Registrar’s argument that maintenance of the voter records indicated an implicit duty to ensure data security.</p>
<p>“I think it’s very difficult to make the case that anyone in the…local jurisdictions has the right at any point in time to tell a federal agency to come in and scan a state-owned system,” Mock Judge Becker opined. “I think you need to show extraordinary need for that…. So ultimately I didn’t see any extraordinary need there to impose federal jurisdiction over a state.”</p>
<p>Following the war game, William &amp; Mary Professor Rebecca Green, who co-directs the Election Law Program, moderated a debrief of the trial, during which questions arose regarding the realism and scale of the fictional scenario. Questions also delved into real-life election security issues.</p>
<p>Green asked the mock judges to weigh in on the question of partisanship. What if Secretary Ruth and Registrar Barrett belonged to different political parties, a fact that might give the appearance that partisan politics drove their decision-making? How should judges navigate politically-charged disputes when it comes to election security? The mock judges pushed back, noting that election officials are accustomed to working in hyper-partisan environments every day. Professionalism would therefore dictate that state and local officials would focus intently on the shared goal of securing the state’s elections, despite differences on how to accomplish this goal. The war game, after all, featured no bad actors or villains (besides the hacker!) Both Secretary Ruth and Registrar Barrett sought to secure Flichigan elections—they just had different opinions on how to get there.</p>
<p>Green also noted the recent real-life <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/ransomware-cyberattack-information">ransomware attack in Atlanta</a> that locked city employees out of all municipal computer systems. Hackers threatened to delete the city’s data unless the city paid $51,000 to the hackers. Green wondered, if a ransomware attack hit a state’s election system, should the federal government step in to help? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-election-hacking/">Quoting</a> an Obama cybersecurity official who suggested that “expecting every state and local government system to be able to go up against nation-state actors is … patently ridiculous,” Green questioned whether election security is in fact best addressed at the state and local level or whether there should be a greater federal role. Participants responded by noting that communication is key. DHS and state and local officials have worked diligently to open lines of communication to allow nimble response to threats that can incorporate federal expertise as needed.</p>
<p>Another point explored was the hot button issue of voter privacy and how best to protect voter data if the federal government becomes involved in an election security issue. Mr. Davisson, counsel for EPIC, raised the concern that voters submit their information to the state for purposes of participating in democratic processes. He cautioned that exposing voter data to the federal government could subject that data to use for other purposes. With this point in mind, the panel discussed how, in most states, voter data is publicly available to campaigns, to get-out-the-vote organizations, and others. Allowing voter data to be accessed through a public records search serves an important policy goal of enhancing public trust in election administration, increasing participation, and providing an oversight mechanism to ensure that the data is accurate. While panelists agreed on this basic proposition that voter data should be accessible, there was less agreement on the question of who ultimately “owns” voter data—voters themselves, local registrars, or the state?</p>
<p>The symposium concluded with a panel discussion focused on election security and the courts. Moderator Tammy Patrick of the <a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, Kemba Walden of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall of the <a href="https://cdt.org/">Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a>, joined the discussion. Walden noted that this scenario is very relevant to the question of DHS involvement and explained that when DHS receives a request for assistance, it verifies that all necessary consent is obtained from the proper authorities prior to proceeding. Walden also clarified the effect of a critical infrastructure designation. As discussed, requests to protect critical infrastructure rise to the top of the list of DHS priorities. For his part, Joe Hall also emphasized the importance of security surrounding voter registration information. He explained that voter registration information is very useful in the de-anonymization of other records. For example, anonymized medical records are sometimes shared publicly for use in research. These records have many pieces of personal data removed to hide the identity of patients. Voter registration information can be used to repopulate that personal data and has been used in some instances to identify patients. Therefore, the security of state voter registration databases is of paramount importance to individual privacy interests.</p>
<p>In all, the Symposium highlighted numerous core challenges that face election administrators as they work to secure U.S. elections in 2018 and beyond. What was clear from the assembled gathering is that a lot of smart minds are on the job.</p>

<p>In keynote remarks at a cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/383571-homeland-security-chief-warns-of-seen-and-unseen-consequences-to">warned the Russians and other countries</a> looking to interfere in the U.S. election.</p>
<p>“The United States, as you know, possesses a spectrum of response options both seen and unseen, and we will use them to call out malign behavior, punish it and deter future cyber hostility,” Nielsen said, according to The Hill.</p>
<p>“Our cyber defenses help guard our very democracy and all we hold dear. To those who would try to attack our democracy to affect our elections, to affect the elections of our allies, to undermine our national sovereignty, I have a simple word of warning: Don’t.”</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) announced</strong> that he would use his executive authority to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/nyregion/felons-pardon-voting-rights-cuomo.html">restore the voting rights</a> of formerly incarcerated residents who are still on parole or probation. The decision will restore voting rights to approximately 35,000 people. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, the move amounts to a legal sidestep of the Legislature which has opposed restoring the voting rights of ex-felons. “I’m unwilling to take no for an answer,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I’m going to make it law by executive order,” he added, continuing, “With active intervention, we can bend the arc toward justice.”</p>
<p><strong>Sacramento and Fresno counties in California will both now</strong> be required to provide ballots and other voting materials in Hmong. Cha Vang, executive director of the Hmong Initiative said that in the past some Hmong speakers had been reluctant to participate in elections because of the language barrier. “These new changes will empower first-time voters, further educate experienced voters and creates a climate that encourages civic participation,” Vang told CBS 13.</p>
<p><strong>Late last week, Acting Pennsylvania Secretary of State</strong> Robert Torres announced that all counties will be required to have <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/news/2018/04/state_asks_counties_to_have_a.html">new voting systems with a paper trail by December 31, 2019</a>. It’s expected to cost between $95 million and $153 million although spokeswoman Wanda Murren told Penn Live the state hopes to lower the costs by offering volume purchasing options through a state program, grants and other strategies. <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philly-wont-have-new-voting-machines-in-place-for-2020-election-commissioner-says/">Philadelphia</a> has said they will not be able to meet the 2020 deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Steubenville police have recovered a </strong><a href="http://www.heraldstaronline.com/news/local-news/2018/04/bullet-fired-through-board-of-elections-office-window/"><strong>bullet</strong> that was fired through a window</a> at the Jefferson County, Ohio board of elections last week. According to the <em>Herald-Star</em>, Diane Gribble, county board of elections director, said there was a loud noise around 4:10 p.m. on April 12 and a board employee said he thought something had come through the south ground-floor window. She said police were notified and responded, with officers finding a hole in a wall in the computer server room. Bulletproof glass will be installed in some windows at the BOE and security around the building will be increased.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson found Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article209268109.html">contempt of court</a>. In her ruling, Robinson referred to Kobach as disingenuous and according to the<em> Kansas City Star</em>, she chastised him for failing to treat the voters in the ongoing case the same as all other registered voters in accordance with a previous court order.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Baton Rouge has upheld a lower court’s ruling that the state law that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/louisiana/articles/2018-04-13/court-louisiana-can-deny-vote-to-felons-on-parole">prohibits felons on parole on probation from voting</a> does not violate the state’s constitution. Felons on parole or probation are still in a &#8220;custodial&#8221; setting and still serving part of a criminal sentence, Judge Toni Higginbotham wrote in the main opinion, joined by Judge Allison Penzato. &#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; understanding of the constitutional phrase as meaning only physical imprisonment would lead to absurd results, because it disregards that a person can legally be under an order of imprisonment without being physically in prison.&#8221; Higginbotham wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> The state’s highest court heard oral arguments about the implementation of the voter-approved <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/supreme-court-hears-arguments-ranked-choice-voting-still-no-ruling">ranked-choice voting</a> in time for the upcoming June primaries. According to Maine Public Radio, during a 35-minute hearing, nearly all seven justices appeared skeptical of the Republicans&#8217; arguments, and some wondered why the court was asked to solve a problem that Legislature wouldn&#8217;t, or couldn&#8217;t. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/17/maine-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-ranked-choice-elections-for-june-primaries/">the court ruled</a> that the law should stand for the June elections.</p>

Spranger was found guilty of lying about her residency on her election paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> The ACLU, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Missouri and the Kansas City-area chapter of the AFL-CIO has sued the state claiming that the Department of Revenue is <a href="http://fox2now.com/2018/04/17/missouri-sued-for-alleged-voter-registration-law-violation/">not automatically updating voter registration</a> after address changes and is not providing registration information to all voters.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann is requesting that two lawsuits, one filed by the Mississippi Center for Justice and the other by the Southern Poverty Law Center be merged since both are seeking the same thing — to <a href="http://starkvilledailynews.com/content/mississippi-seeks-merge-2-voting-rights-suits">restore voting rights to ex-felons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: An appeals court has ruled that the state’s <a href="http://www.adirondackdailyenterprise.com/news/local-news/2018/04/court-foil-makes-ballots-viewable/">Freedom of Information Law</a> covers the electronically scanned images of ballots taken from voting machines. The state Supreme Court’s Appellate Division, Third Department made the decision in the case of Kosmider v. Whitney. Essex County was sued after a FOIL request by Essex County Democratic Committee Chairwoman Bethany Kosmider to see the cast-vote records from the 2015 election was denied.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Visiting Judge Martin Lowy certified six more ballots in the contested GOP primary in Kaufman County.

<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The government of the USVI has sued the territorial elections board in Superior Court claiming that the board has <a href="http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/government-sues-elections-board/article_362fe979-7d07-5087-8bfb-f2ed49ab551f.html">violated the territory’s election laws</a>. According to the <em>Virgin Islands Daily News</em>, a complaint filed in Superior Court by Assistant Attorney General Ariel Smith, the board has violated the requirements of territorial law by failing to meet as a single board, and by failing to elect board officers, as required by Act 7982. The lawsuit seeks a declaration from a judge that the members of the district boards failed to follow the law, Smith wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> J. Christian Adams, a former member of the disbanded presidential election commission has been sued by a group of plaintiffs lead by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.
