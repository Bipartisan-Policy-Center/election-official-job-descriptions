														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Impacts of registration and ID laws on transgender voters</strong><br /><em>State elections officials strive to accommodate all voters</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Voters come in all shapes, sizes, colors, ages and gender. Most of that information, other than age, is irrelevant to a voter’s eligibility to register and cast a vote. However, for some voters, the question of gender on a voter registration form can present a problem.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/how-many-adults-identify-as-transgender-in-the-united-states/">report</a> from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, in 2016, an estimated 0.6 percent of adults in the United States, or about 1.4 million individuals identify as transgender. Populations vary by state and by age group.</p>
<p>Hawaii, California, Georgia, and New Mexico all have 0.8 percent of their populations that identify as transgender where was North Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota have just 0.3 percent of adults that identify as transgender.</p>
<p>More young adults, aged 18 to 24 identify as transgender (0.7 percent) than do those 65 and older (0.5 percent).</p>
<p>“We understand that collecting demographic information can sometimes be helpful, but we are unaware of any compelling reason to include gender in the voter registration process,” said Jay H. Wu, communications manager for the <a href="https://transequality.org/">National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Electionline reached out to the elections directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and heard back from 34 of them and the District. Whether or not states collect gender information on voter registration forms varies with most of the responding states saying they do not request that information, or that it is optional.</p>
<p>Of the 34 states and the District that responded, 15 do not ask for the information, 13 have a box on their voter registration forms for gender, but do not require it, six require a perspective voter to complete the gender and North Dakota does not have voter registration.</p>
<p>Of those six that do require gender information <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/">Virginia</a> law does require the information be gathered, the Administrative Code cites that gender is not material for registration.</p>
<p>“Gender is a required field on the voter registration application form under Va. Code Section 24.2-418(A). However, the State Board of Elections (SBE) and the Department of Elections (the Department) has determined that this information is not material for eligibility or registration purposes,” explained Chris Piper, Virginia’s new elections commissioner. “As a result, Administrative Code 1VAC20-40-70 cites gender as being not material for registration, and prohibits general registrars from denying an applicant who does not provide this information.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year in <a href="https://sos.idaho.gov/">Idaho, the secretary of state’s office</a> proposed legislation that would have done away with the gender requirement on the state forms.</p>
<p>“With concerns nationally about protecting personal information, we looked at what would be required in order to vote,” explained Tim Hurst, deputy secretary of state. “Gender is not a piece of information we needed to keep since both men and women have equal rights in voting.”</p>
<p>Hurst said the state had not experienced a problem to date, but the proposed legislation was meant to avoid the possibility of a problem. Unfortunately, according to Hurst, the legislation is dead for this year.</p>
<p>A check with Wendy Underhill at the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> did not find any other pending legislation regarding gender requirements on voter registration forms.</p>
<p>Although there is no other legislation currently pending, that doesn’t mean that other elections offices aren’t thinking about it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/">Washington</a>, after questions were raised by one of the county elections officials in 2016, the state broadened the response field so now, instead of just asking male or female, the form lets a perspective voter fill in whatever gender they wish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sos.state.nm.us/">New Mexico</a> Director of Elections Kari Fresquez said there has been some discussion of at least broadening the options from male and female, but there has been no formal legislation push at this point.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://portal.ct.gov/sots">Connecticut</a> asks for gender on the voter registration form and it is an optional field,” explained Gabe Rosenberg, communications director for Secretary of State Denise Merrill. “This has not been a topic that has come up recently in Connecticut, but we are likely to discuss it internally and get feedback from stakeholders going forward.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">Colorado</a>, instead of asking “sex” on the form/online – the state asks for “gender identity.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We understand that this doesn’t cover all possibilities, but it was our hope that it might be more broadly inclusive,” explained Judd Choate, director of elections. “In addition, we have made it a free form field on the hard form and plan to add “other” as an option online soon.&nbsp; But, likely that won’t happen until this summer.”</p>
<p>Todd Valentine, director of elections for the <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/">New York State Board of Elections</a> said that more than 20 years ago gender was a mandatory field on the state’s voter ID form, but now it’s optional because the information isn’t used for anything.</p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong><br /><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx">Voter ID</a> is another area where transgender voters could run into problems. Seven states are strict voter photo ID states while another 10 are non-strict photo ID states.</p>
<p>Wu, with the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund, which is a 501(c)4 said that the center did not hear of any transgender being denied their franchise in 2016.</p>
<p>“We are concerned, however, about the effects that the Trump administration’s anti-trans rhetoric and actions may have in emboldening poll workers or election officials to give trans voters trouble,” Wu said.</p>
<p>None of the responding states that have photo ID laws on the books-strict or non-strict-reported any known problems with transgender voters attempting to vote. And all those responding with photo ID requirements stressed the efforts the elections officials take to make sure that every voters vote counts.</p>
<p>Kea Warne, deputy secretary of state, elections services for the state of <a href="https://sdsos.gov/">South Dakota</a> said although the state asks for photo ID, transgender voters do have other options.</p>
<p>“If the election board cannot determine that the voter’s photo on their ID matches the voter, then the election board will state that the ID you presented does not appear to be you,” Warne said. “You may explain why the photo does not match and you may present other forms of identification to assist us in confirming your identity.”</p>
<p>Warne also added that a voter without photo ID or other documentation to back up the photo ID can still sign an affidavit attesting to who they are.</p>
<p>Iowa and West Virginia are both introducing their voter ID laws this year. Kevin Hall, communications director for the <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">Iowa secretary of state’s office</a> noted that not only is Iowa not a strict photo ID state, but that the barcode on the back of the ID card is the key and provides much more relevant information than the photo on the front.</p>
<p>“The law requires precinct election officials to consider all of the information presented by the person prior to determining that person is not eligible, including changes to the voter’s physical appearance and time elapsed since the photo was generated,” Hall said. “Additionally, the Voter ID card, provided at no cost to registered voters who do not possess a valid Iowa driver&#8217;s license or non-operator&#8217;s ID, does not contain a photo.”</p>
<p>Donald Kersey, elections director and deputy legal counsel for the <a href="http://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">West Virginia secretary of state’s office</a> said the state’s ID law was written in a way so as to give the secretary’s office leeway.</p>
<p>“West Virginia law requires poll workers to ensure the photo ‘is truly an image’ of the voter. Because there is no additional guidance, we interpret that provision to provide poll workers broad deference, which is consistent in other sections of election law (e.g. poll workers can challenge a voter’s registration on the spot, challenge a ballot, and require a voter to voter provisional for a variety of codified reasons),” Kersey explained. “Therefore, we instruct our counties to encourage poll workers to be fair, impartial and objective, especially because we do not want to require any voter to vote provisional unless it’s absolutely necessary.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sos.alabama.gov/">Alabama</a>, where a voter must show a photo ID—or have elections officials vouch for the voter or cast a provisional ballot—Assistant Director of Elections Clay Helms said that to his knowledge no transgender voter has had an issue with the state’s ID law.</p>
<p>Helms also said that information about transgender voters is not included in poll worker training although it may be something the state will look into in the future.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/sos/">Michigan</a>, Elections Directory Sally Williams said elections workers are provided guidance for when a license photo does not match the person standing in front of them, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>“We direct election workers (inspectors) as follows: As a first step, the election inspector should take into account the age of the photo and any explanations the voter may wish to offer (weight gain or loss, hair style or facial hair alterations, different eyeglass frames, etc.). If such considerations resolve the matter, the election inspector should issue a ballot to the voter,” Williams explained. “If questions over the voter’s identity remain, the election inspector should ask to view any other acceptable forms of picture identification that the voter may have in his or her possession.”</p>
<p>If that still does not resolve the issue, Williams said the voter may cast a provisional ballot.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://elections.wi.gov/">Wisconsin</a> has a strict photo ID law, Michael Haas, election commissioner said that the law is written that the photo on the ID “reasonably resemble” the voter.</p>
<p>“To our knowledge, there have not been any voters who have been denied a ballot because their photo ID did not resemble them,” Haas said. “It is also part of the training for clerks what NOT to look for on a photo ID. &nbsp;Poll workers and clerks are taught to only look for the voter&#8217;s name, photo, and expiration date and that they should NOT be looking at other fields like address, gender, citizenship, or driving privilege status.”</p>
<p>Haas also added that he is aware of the elections commission receiving several calls from transgender voters in advance of an election to confirm the voting process, which is something that the National Center for Transgender Equality recommends.</p>
<p>The National Center for Transgender Equality has <a href="https://transequality.org/issues/resources/voting-while-trans-preparing-voter-id-laws">tips</a> for voting as a transgender person and a Voting While Trans <a href="https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/voting%20while%20trans.pdf">checklist</a> to help transgender voters prepare for casting a ballot. The tips include confirming your voter registration before Election Day, making sure that the information on your driver’s license matches what’s on your voter registration card and, where allowed, consider voting by mail.</p>
<p>The site also has some advice for elections officials and poll workers with the most important probably being, transgender voters are not doing anything wrong or trying to deceive you—they are just being themselves.</p>

<p><strong>The Congressional Task Force on Election Security,</strong> which does not have any Republican members, introduced a bill this week seeking more than <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/democrats-plan-to-secure-midterm-elections/">$1 billion in funds</a> to help state’s secure their voting systems. The bill also includes minimum security standards for all US election systems.</p>
<p>The proposal outlines 10 recommendations for securing election infrastructure such as ensuring that all voting systems have a verifiable paper trail, it calls on voting equipment vendors to prioritize voting infrastructure security, it provides funding for states to upgrade their voter registration databases.</p>
<p>The bill also expands the oversight role of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.</p>
<p><strong>In other news, according to <em>The Hill</em>,</strong> Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have written to Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia) demanding “immediate” <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/372926-judiciary-democrats-demand-immediate-hearings-on-election-hacking">hearings on cyber vulnerabilities</a> in U.S. election infrastructure.</p>
<p>“We believe the threat is urgent,” wrote the Democrats, led by ranking member Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “We cannot afford to ignore the mounting evidence of a coordinated effort to undermine the most basic and essential aspects of democratic process.”</p>
<p><strong>In a follow-up to last week’s “breaking” news</strong> from NBC about <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/373423-homeland-security-calls-nbc-report-on-election-hacking-false">Russian hackers</a> “successfully penetrating” US voter roles in 2016 has the U.S. Department of Homeland Security pushing back.</p>
<p>“Recent NBC reporting has misrepresented facts and confused the public with regard to Department of Homeland Security and state and local government efforts to combat election hacking,” Jeanette Manfra, the department’s chief cybersecurity official, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p></p>

Murray had been accused of inappropriate behavior by two women and had already announced that he would not run for governor or seek re-election as secretary of state. In his resignation <a href="https://www.sheridanmedia.com/news/secretary-state-resigns97858">statement</a>, Murray said, “I’ve come to the realization that I am unable to focus entirely on serving the good people of Wyoming while simultaneously needing to process all the fallout from these allegations for which I have issued previous statements. At all times during my tenure as Secretary of State I’ve upheld the trust and fiduciary duties of my Office to the highest of any and all standards. Deputy Secretary of State Karen Wheelers will serve until Gov. Matt Mead appoints a new secretary.</p>
<p><strong>After eight long years, voters in Santa Fe, New Mexico</strong> <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/ranked-choice-system-gets-mixed-reception-among-early-voters/article_76a5ec48-d7b9-5db0-ad3a-0477a3dd0331.html">finally began using ranked choice voting</a> as a way to choose their locally elected officials. Early voting kicked off this week and according to the Santa Fe New Mexican, reactions to the new system were mixed. The paper conducted exit poll interviews with 20 of the several dozen residents who cast ballots in the first hours after polls opened for early voting revealed an array of sentiment, most saying they were either fans of the new system or indifferent to it, and only a handful offering a negative review. “I think it forces you to pay more attention to the candidates,” voter Lynn Hopkins told the paper. “You have to really think about, well, who would my second choice be? And so you listen to the candidates more closely. And you do your research. I think that’s a good thing.”</p>
<p><strong>Each year, the Travis County, Texas Tax Office, which oversees voter registration</strong> for the county, conducts a YouthCam-Student PSA Contest. Middle and high school students are invited to create a 15-, 30-, or 60-second PSA around the year’s selected theme, which was <a href="https://tax-office.traviscountytx.gov/psa">“Register. Be Counted. Vote!”</a> for this year. There are three English categories and three Spanish categories. First place in each category will receive $500 and some prizes; second is $250 and prizes; and third place is $100 with prizes. Winners were announced earlier this year and we would highly encourage you to <a href="http://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/travis-county-voter-registration-youth-psa-contest-winners-are-in/269-518855186">check them out</a>, there is some really great stuff here.

<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> Secretary of State Denise Merrill announced her plans this week to ask legislators to support a bill that would scrub voter birth dates from registration records and give people the option of requesting that their <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Move-to-shield-voter-identity-information-12614019.php">information be kept from the public</a>. According to the <em>Connecticut Post</em>, Merrill said that the proposals, which she expects will be raised for public hearings in the legislative Government Administration &amp; Elections Committee, are the result of requests for more safety from voters.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Legislation that would have <a href="http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Voter-information-legislation-stalls-in-state-session-473461933.html">shielded basic personal information</a> contained in voter registration files stalled last week however legislation that would protect the information of those under 18 who are pre-registered seems to be moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> A non-binding opinion issued by Attorney General Curtis Hill has killed a bill that would have allowed elections officials to <a href="http://wboi.org/post/ag-opinion-sidelines-bill-allow-dead-peoples-votes-count-0#stream/0">count the ballots of voters who voted early or by mail, but then die before Election Day</a>. The bill had been approved by the Senate and was now under consideration in the House. Hill said a constitutional change would be required to count the votes.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> A bipartisan bill has been introduced to the House that would <a href="http://iowapublicradio.org/post/bipartisan-bill-would-restore-voting-rights-iowa-felons#stream/0">restore the voting rights</a> of Iowa felons who have completed their sentences. Currently, ex-felons in Iowa have to have their voting rights reinstated by the governor.</p>

<p>Also this week, the Senate elections committee heard testimony on Senate Bill 229. Under the bill, the county commissioners in Shawnee, Sedgwick, Johnson and Wynadotte would <a href="http://www.cjonline.com/news/20180213/kansas-senate-bill-would-remove-kris-kobachs-authority-to-appoint-elections-commissioners">appoint their own elections commissioners</a>. Under current law, the election commissioners in those four counties are appointed by the secretary of state.</p>

House Bill 774 would create a study committee to look at voter enfranchisement for nonviolent felons who have completed their sentences. HB 803 would change the number of needed certified poll managers per precinct. HB 937 would stagger the terms of election commissioners and HB 804 clarifies how photo ID must present during a municipal election.</p>
<p>A bill that would create a commission to study the issue of <a href="http://www.djournal.com/news/felony-voting-proposal-still-alive-in-legislature/article_d4aecac4-fa74-59db-8243-4e78afb90254.html">restoring voting rights to ex-felons</a> has unanimously been approved by the House and is now pending in the Senate Elections Committee.

<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: A bill that would have moved New Hampshire to a <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/alterantive-voting-IRC-approval-redistricting-15527300">ranked choice voting</a> system was defeated this week. This is the third time that some variation of ranked-choice voting has been proposed in New Hampshire. No previous attempt has made it out of committee, either.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The General Assembly is considering a <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nj-voting-rights-access-automatic-voter-registration-20180211.html">host of election reform bills</a> that would expand the franchise in the Garden State.

The bill would include school districts, community college districts, flood control districts, special zoning districts, soil and water conservation districts, and water and sanitation districts. In 2022, the law also would include conservancy districts. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver and county clerks support the bill.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has added $7 million to his budget to cover the cost of implementing <a href="http://auburnpub.com/blogs/eye_on_ny/cuomo-adds-m-to-ny-budget-proposal-for-early-voting/article_710f71cc-4033-5451-86d9-31406cacd59c.html">early voting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Lumped in with a bill that redirects funds from a pipeline development to education was language that repackages the state’s <a href="http://www.bladenjournal.com/news/16691/class-size-fix-elections-board-rewrite-heads-to-governor">bipartisan elections board</a>. Under the bill, which is now on its way to the governor, the new board would have nine members with governor appointing four Republicans, four Democrats and one independent. Democrats argue that the legislation goes against a recent court ruling from the state’s Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: A bill introduced on behalf of Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea would <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180208/gorbea-proposes-moving-date-of-sept-primary--poll">move the state’s primaries</a> to the third Tuesday in August beginning in 2020.

<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Under HB35, a pilot program would be created to make it an option to implement <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900009775/two-bills-to-significantly-affect-voting-in-utah.html">ranked choice voting</a> in certain nonpartisan elections. HB141 would allow election officers to reduce the <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900009775/two-bills-to-significantly-affect-voting-in-utah.html">early voting</a> period to a minimum of two days from the 14 days currently required. Both bills are now going to the full House.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> A procedural vote by legislators has derailed a bill that would allow Arlington County to implement <a href="http://www.insidenova.com/news/arlington/bill-on-instant-runoff-voting-hits-procedural-roadblock-in-richmond/article_ffe391da-101f-11e8-bab0-179c196d89be.html">ranked choice voting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> In a party line vote, the House has approved an <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/feb/12/house-passes-automatic-voter-registration-bill/">automatic voter registration</a> bill.

<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Advocates are threatening to sue the state for failing to provide <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2018/02/12/disability-rights-group-threatens-sue-texas-not-offering-voter-registration-services">voter registration services</a> to residents with disabilities. According to <em>The Dallas Morning News</em>, under the National Voter Registration Act, Texas&nbsp;must provide the&nbsp;services to people who receive job training from the state. The Coalition of Texans with Disabilities said&nbsp;the Texas Workforce Commission has failed to do so&nbsp;since taking over the state&#8217;s job training responsibilities&nbsp;in September 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyers for the coalition allege that each year, between 74,000 and 100,000 Texans with disabilities are not being offered voter registration services.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, a judge has given permission for the Dallas County District Attorney’s office to examine any <a href="http://www.fox4news.com/news/judge-allows-dallas-county-elections-officials-to-examine-suspicious-mail-in-ballots">suspicious mail-in ballots</a> in advance of the March primaries. The decision came after elections officials in the county noticed hundreds of suspicious mail-in ballot applications, including at least four that were requested by dead voters.</p>
