							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>A site grows in Brooklyn</strong><br /><em>The Voting Information Project moves to Democracy Works, Inc.</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>This week, following a months-long process, <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en">The Pew Charitable Trusts</a> and <a href="https://democracy.works/">Democracy Works, Inc.</a> announced that Democracy Works will be the new organizational home of the <a href="https://votinginfoproject.org/">Voting Information Project</a> (VIP). The transition was effective Monday, June 18.</p>
<p>“We are honored to follow The Pew Charitable Trusts as the new stewards of this important program, and excited to build on the work that’s been done for the past 10 years,” said Maria Bianchi. Bianchi previously served as the project manager for VIP within Democracy Works, she will now serve as the program director. “</p>
<p>Democracy Works has been working on VIP since 2014, and Bianchi said Democracy Works is committed to preserving the great partnerships that have been established with states. The experience for participating states will not change. Additionally, the data will continue to be a free resource available through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Civic API</a>.</p>
<p>“In the four years that we have managed the project’s data and technology components, Democracy Works has embraced VIP’s future as our own,” Bianchi said.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 as a joint effort of state and local officials, The Pew Charitable Trusts, and Google, VIP uses an open format to make election data available and accessible to a variety of platforms, bringing cutting edge technology to ensure that all eligible Americans have the information they need to cast a ballot.</p>
<p>“When we launched VIP in 2008, our goal was that every American would be able to use simple technology to find out voting information,” says Doug Chapin who directs the <a href="http://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/436824-2/">Program for Excellence in Election Administration</a> at the University of Minnesota and help found the project while at Pew. “And today, they can.”</p>
<p>Since its inception, VIP has hit numerous milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, VIP received more than 120 million impressions from voters looking for election information.</li>
<li>10 states now use the customizable, embeddable VIP tool.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In 2017 alone, VIP covered 165 elections at the state and local level.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The VIP embeddable tool is offered in 17 languages, including, English, Spanish, Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Hmong, Japanese, Karen, Khmer, Korean, Laotian, Oromo, Russian, Somali, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We are excited to support the next chapter of the Voting Information Project and are thrilled to be working closely with Democracy Works,” said Megan Ryskamp, who leads civic partnerships for Google. “We believe that making the world’s election information accessible and useful is important for democracy, and have been excited to contribute over the last decade.”</p>
<p>While VIP is now available in 46 states and the District of Columbia, some folks weren’t so sure about it when it first launched a decade ago.</p>
<p>“At first, I was unsure of how useful the VIP could be,” said <a href="https://www.pascovotes.com/">Pasco County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley</a>. “I had this ridiculous belief that voters in my jurisdiction would primarily utilize my own website for voting information. I then realized that contrary to my ego, voters were a tad more likely to use Google to find voting information. This of course is in addition to <a href="http://gettothepolls.org/" target="_blank">GetToThePolls.org</a> and the Civic API. Bottom line, it helps voters get invaluable information in an efficient in a convenient manner and helping their most important stakeholder (aka The Voters) is the primary goal of any and all in the elections administration arena.”</p>
<p>Corley was a member of the VIP Planning Group to help determine what the next steps for VIP should be as Pew was phasing out its elections work.</p>
<p>“One of the primary concerns of the Planning Group was finding a stable and established organization that could not only sustain the VIP but take it to a higher level. Clearly, Democracy Works is that organization and I’m confident they will take the VIP and make it even better. I’m excited to see where they take it,” Corley said.</p>
<p>So what’s next for VIP and how might it change Democracy Works? It will cost Democracy Works about $2 million a year to keep VIP up and running and Bianchi said that will be core to both the organizations regular fundraising efforts and a dedicated fundraising push to create a strategic group of foundations and tech companies that can advise and support the work in the years to come.</p>
<p>Bianchi said Democracy Works is looking forward to growing VIP over the coming years, especially at the local level.</p>
<p>“I’m especially passionate about expanding our support for local elections. Our vision is that voters should be able to find this information for every election they’re eligible to vote in,” Bianchi said.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>This week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules &amp; Administration held a hearing on preparations for the 2018 midterm elections. A number of state and local elections officials testified about what their states and counties are doing to prepare for November. Those testifying included <a href="https://www.benningtonbanner.com/stories/condos-backs-election-security-bill-in-congress,542739">Vermont</a> Secretary of State Jim Condos, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-voting-chief-urges-u-s-senators-to-shore-up-election-security/486069892/">Minnesota</a> Secretary of State Scott Simon and <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/blunt-hearing-on-election-cyberthreats-detours-into-ashcroft-prompted-scrum/article_d3a0c05f-944b-529d-a524-72eb88959959.html">Missouri</a> Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. The full hearing may be viewed <a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/hearings/watch?hearingid=CBF9F353-5056-A066-6059-0DDC12293F30">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sens. James Lankford, (R-Oklahoma), and Amy Klobuchar, (D-Minnesota) failed to get parts of their bill, the <a href="https://statescoop.com/bill-to-help-states-secure-election-absent-from-defense-spending-package">Secure Elections Act</a>, included in the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill would have made it easier for state elections officials to get the security clearances necessary to briefed on cyber threats.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed that the NDAA did not include provisions from the Secure Elections Act,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/zte-ban-ndaa/?__hstc=188609527.6cd96c3ae72d4118aed941b070534a53.1522919465612.1529487479978.1529520680500.10&amp;__hssc=188609527.1.1529520680500&amp;__hsfp=733254344">Lankford told CyberScoop</a>. &#8220;However, I will continue to work with my colleagues to have revised election security legislation enacted into law.”</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>Voters in the District of Columbia went to the polls this week and the only real news to report, administratively, was the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/19/dc-primary-sees-low-voter-turnout/">low turnout</a>, just around 18 percent.</p>
<p>Since there wasn’t really any news from the District (this is a good thing), we thought we’d review some lingering issues from other recent primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The June 5 primary saw the first statewide roll out of the <a href="https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/state-and-regional/voters-without-ids-a-small-share-of-primary-electorate/article_22e22066-478b-5f02-8445-a87b2e38ed97.html">new voter ID law</a>. According to the <em>Sioux City Journal</em>, while hundreds of voters chose to sign an affidavit rather than present the required photo ID, the numbers were relatively small compared to overall turnout. Some counties did not track the numbers but others found signed affidavits to represent less than 1 percent of turnout. “We did have some upset voters,” Travis Weipert, the Johnson County auditor and president of the Iowa State Association of County Auditors told the paper. “A lot of people continued to say, ‘It’s my constitutional right to vote. I shouldn’t have to show my ID and answer a lot of questions.’” Weipert also noted that the new requirement slowed the voting process.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> More than a week after the election, the results of Maines <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/results-nation-s-first-ranked-choice-voting-election-mills-and-golden-win-nominations#stream/0">first-ever statewide ranked choice voting</a> election are finally in. While officials had hoped to have those results on Tuesday, a <a href="http://wgme.com/news/local/ranked-choice-ballot-count-delayed-due-to-memory-stick-issue">memory stick issue</a> delayed the count. Once counting finally began, it took four rounds of ranked choice to determine the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and one round of ranked choice to determine a Democratic candidate for the 2nd Congressional District.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Due to an error by poll workers, at least 43 <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/43-double-votes-may-prompt-redo-of-clark-county-election/">voters may have cast ballots twice</a> in a Clark County race that currently has a razor-thin margin of victory—four votes. “Because the number of discrepancies is higher than the difference in the candidates’ totals, (the registrar) is unable to certify the results of this race and is calling for a special election to resolve the contest,” county spokesman Dan Kulin wrote in a statement. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria and the county board all agree that a new election is necessary. In a redo election, every registered Republican who voted during the primary would receive a mail ballot by July 3. The ballots would be due by 7 p.m. on July 17 and could be mailed in or dropped off in person. The election will cost an estimated $135,000, Gloria told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: South Dakota Secretary of State Shantel Krebs told the State Board of Elections that they have until August 15 to come up with a <a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/after-pennington-county-election-bungle-krebs-says-paper-backups-needed/article_9b9a1502-dbeb-5f17-a10f-70b95d66ebb5.html">plan to ensure that problems with e-poll books</a> that arose during the primary don’t happen in November. Part of the plan should include paper copies of voter registration lists. At the meeting with the SBOE, Krebs had the e-poll book vendor on hand to explain what happened and to apologize for the primary problems. According to the <em>Rapid City Journal</em>, the state board also recommended legislation for the 2019 session Monday that would require paper backups at vote centers, places where any registered voter from a county can vote.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> What happens if you throw an election and <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/long-day-for-workers-in-montgomery-county-s-f-/article_c534573d-dc9a-5f85-a1b5-0bea690acf1e.html">no one bothers to show up</a>? It certainly makes for a very long and boring day for poll workers and that’s exactly what happened in one precinct in Virginia during the state’s June 12th primary. Montgomery County’s F-3 precinct, which is on the Virginia Tech campus saw no in-person voters on election day. Registrar Connie Viar said that’s the first time that’s happened in at least 20 years. Four people did vote absentee. The F-3 precinct is one of two on the Virginia Tech campus. The other precinct has 11 people vote in-person and six absentee. Viar chalks the lack of voters up to the fact that students are not currently on campus at Tech and she anticipates a greater turnout in the fall. It cost the county $1250 to run the two polling places.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>According to an internal memo obtained by the <em>New York Post</em></strong>, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has ordered parole officers to <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/18/cuomo-orders-parole-officers-to-help-eligible-ex-cons-register-to-vote/">provide voter registration forms to their former-inmate</a> clients during office and home visits. The paper says the memo requires that parole officers must provide formerly incarcerated individuals “with voter registration forms, related complementary documents and assistance with the registration process….” “The Parole Officer must be prepared to assist the parolee with filling out the registration form and the Parole Officer is responsible for providing information regarding the location of the local Board of Elections,’’ the memo states. The move follows an April executive order to reinstate voting rights to all released felons even if they are still serving parole or probation.</p>
<p><strong>Follow simple instructions</strong>. The 2018 primary in Colorado marks the first time independents will be able to cast a ballot in the previously closed primary system. Every independent voter in the state received a Democrat and Republican ballot in the mail with instructions to only cast one. Well, seems that some folks aren’t following the enclosed instructions and are <a href="http://www.timescall.com/news/elections/ci_31953528/colorado-voters-unaffiliated-primary-voters">returning both a Democratic and Republican ballot</a>. Overall, the numbers have been fairly low. In <a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2018/06/19/unaffiliated-colorado-voters-return-two-ballots-so-their-votes-wont-count/714815002/">Larimer County</a>, at least 159 people have returned two ballots which invalidates them both. In <a href="http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_31955368/fremont-county-has-received-more-than-5-000">Freemont County</a>, 33 people have returned both ballots. In <a href="http://www.timescall.com/news/elections/ci_31953528/colorado-voters-unaffiliated-primary-voters">Boulder County</a> so far 85 people have returned both ballots. In <a href="http://gazette.com/two-ballots-arent-better-than-one-hundreds-of-primary-votes-wont-count/article/1627804">Denver</a>, the ballots of 215 (3.4 percent) of voters have been rejected. However, in El Paso County, almost 600 independent voters have turned in both ballots to-date. Officials have been doing their best to remind voters just to vote one ballot. Earlier this week, two <a href="https://bartels-on.sos.state.co.us/index.php/2018/06/20/shout-it-from-the-mountaintop-all-about-u-voting-just-one-ballot/">staff members from the secretary of state’s office</a> climbed one of Colorado’s 14’ers with message to just vote one!</p>
<p><strong>Millennials in Philadelphia are trying to prove their detractors wrong</strong>. For the third-straight election, <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/millennial-voter-turnout-increased-2018-primary-philadelphia-20180618.html">Millennial voters have out-paced voters</a> in every other generation, which have actually seen decreased turnout. “The numbers are remarkable, that this is the third time in a row that this has happened,” City Commissioner Al Schmidt told the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>. Voter turnout&nbsp;shot up 29 percent among&nbsp;those&nbsp;between the ages of 18 and 34, according to data released by Schmidt’s office. For those aged 35 to 49,&nbsp;participation&nbsp;dropped by 5 percent. It fell 21 percent for voters between the ages of 50 and 64, and sunk 12 percent for those aged 65 and up. To be clear, Millennial voter turnout is still the lowest of all the generations, but it is on the increase.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of turnout, the City of Los Angeles held an election this week</strong> to determine whether or not to create a second neighborhood council in Koreatown. According to LAist, some people reported waiting more than three hours to vote. City elections officials said. more than 19,000 people turned out to vote. “<a href="http://laist.com/2018/06/20/yesterdays_koreatown_election_was_b.php">We have not seen anything like this before</a>,” Tom Reindel, public services administrator for the Los Angeles City Clerk-Election Division told LAist. “There weren’t any seats being filled. This was simply a vote about dividing an existing neighborhood council into two.” Although there are still almost 2,000 provisional ballots to count, the residents voted 98.53 percent to 1.47 percent not to create a second council.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) have introduced a bill that will amend the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180620/sherrod-brown-introduces-bill-to-stop-voter-purges">National Voter Registration Act</a> to clarify that a state may not use someone’s failure to vote or respond to a state notice as a reason to remove them from active voter rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Gov. Rick Snyder has signed legislation into law that will require ballot secrecy sleeves to include the addition of the Libertarian Party, as well as changing ballot voting instructions due to new <a href="http://www.upmatters.com/news/local-news/gov-rick-snyder-signs-legislation-giving-michigan-voters-more-options-on-the-ballot/1251873915">voting machines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Assemblyman Kevin J. Rooney (R-Bergen) has introduced a bill that would prohibit the use of <a href="http://parsippanyfocus.com/2018/06/17/citing-safety-concerns-rooney-bill-prohibits-using-schools-as-polling-places/">schools as polling places</a>. Rooney introduced the bill after a poll worker was arrested for possession of heroin during the June 5 primary. “This incident underscores the vulnerability of our schools when used as polling places,” Rooney told the Parsippany Focus. “We don’t need to take unnecessary risks by leaving our doors wide open. This bill is a reasonable and necessary security measure to help protect our students and staff.”</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Following party line votes in the House (61-40) and Senate (23-11) a bill that altered <a href="https://www.wral.com/legislature-oks-changes-to-early-voting/17630055/">early voting schedules</a>, eliminating a popular half-day of voting on the Saturday before an election, was approved by the General Assembly on Friday, less than 48 hours after it was unveiled.</p>
<p>Also in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper (D) <a href="https://www.wral.com/cooper-vetoes-elections-judiciary-bills/17631549/">vetoed Senate Bill 486</a> that would have required background checks on state and county election workers, set parameters for vendors of e-poll books and barred losing primary candidates from switching parties and running as a third-party candidate in the general election. On Wednesday, by a 74-42 vote, the House voted to <a href="https://www.wral.com/vetoes-on-judicial-elections-bills-fall/17641615/">override</a> Cooper’s veto.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> A San Luis Obispo County superior court judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the county clerk’s office at the behest of a candidate for county supervisor. Attorneys for Lynn Compton accused the clerk’s office of <a href="http://www.keyt.com/news/politics/judge-issues-restraining-order-against-slo-county-clerk-s-office-in-supervisor-race/754914064">violating elections code</a> by accepting corrections of vote-by-mail ballot envelopes after the deadline. The judge ultimately denied the challenge and <a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/politics-government/election/article213548364.html">lifted the restraining order</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Lawyers for Gov. Rick Scott’s administration are asking the federal court to step aside in a suit filed by the League of Women Voters over <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/06/17/rick-scott-fires-back-in-election-year-early-voting-lawsuit/">early voting on college campuses</a>. The state’s lawyers argue the case should be heard in state court. &#8220;A state court, interpreting state law, can decide the case on narrow, statutory interpretation grounds and, perhaps, avoid any constitutional issues,&#8221; the state&#8217;s brief said.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, the city of Anderson and its former mayor will pay $30,000 to a former city worker who filed a lawsuit alleging she was arrested for trying to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/indiana/articles/2018-06-17/anderson-former-mayor-to-pay-30k-in-ballot-lawsuit">deliver her mother’s absentee ballot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> In a 118-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson has struck down the state’s <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2018/jun/18/federal-judge-strikes-down-kansas-proof-citizenshi/">proof-of-citizenship law</a> saying that it violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. According to the Lawrence Journal-World, Robinson ordered Kobach&#8217;s office not to enforce the law against any voter registration applications in Kansas. And citing what she called Kobach&#8217;s &#8220;well-documented history of avoiding this Court&#8217;s Orders,&#8221; she spelled out specific steps the Secretary of State&#8217;s office must carry out to ensure that all voters are registered in the same way, regardless of whether they have shown proof of citizenship. In addition, Robinson ordered Kobach to attend at least six hours of continuing legal education courses focusing on civil rules of procedure and evidence. Kobach has said he will <a href="http://www.koamtv.com/story/38453218/kobach-says-hell-appeal-voter-registration-ruling">appeal</a> the ruling.</p>
<p>Also in Kansas, the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a class action lawsuit against Kobach over the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article213391584.html">Crosscheck</a> program that put the personal data of more than 900 voters at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down Minnesota’s ban on wearing <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/06/14/supreme-court-strikes-down-minnesota-voter-clothing-law">political apparel</a> at polling places. In a 7-2 ruling, the court said the state’s limits on political clothing violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that &#8220;if a state wishes to set its polling places apart as areas free of partisan discord, it must employ a more discernible approach than the one Minnesota has offered here,&#8221; adding that Minnesota &#8220;has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Miguel Hernandez, 28 has pleaded guilty to a single count of using an <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/06/20/dallas-man-jail-voter-fraud/">unlawful method of returning a marked ballot</a>. According to CBS DFW, he was accused of visiting a woman in April and collecting her blank absentee ballot, then filling it out and forging her signature before mailing it to the county. Dozens of senior citizens in West Dallas and Grand Prairie filed complaints about receiving mail-in ballots they had not requested.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/news/2018/5/25/job-civic-data-research-fellow">Civic Data Research Fellow</a>, Center for Technology and Civic Life</strong> — “What’s on my ballot?” is the number one question that voters look for online &#8211; but the answer to that question is harder to find than you might think. With nearly 8,000 offices responsible for running elections in America, the basic information that voters need to participate in elections is often poorly formatted and hard to find &#8211; if it’s online at all. At the Center for Technology and Civic Life, we think all voters should be able to find this information online, and we need your help! In 2016, our ballot data reached between one-third and one-half of all voters in the country, and we expect 2018 to be even bigger. We’re looking for a set of 2018 Civic Data Fellows to help us standardize the nation’s ballot information, so that all Americans can find information about what will be on their ballot in November. Civic Data Fellows will work closely with our Research Associates and Director of Civic Data to collect and standardize information about candidates and referenda from across the country. If you love democracy, researching obscure facts, and turning chaos into order, this is the job for you! <strong>Salary:</strong> $48,000. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply, <a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/news/2018/5/25/job-civic-data-research-fellow">click here</a>.</p>
