							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Picking a candidate is as easy as 1…2&#8230;3</strong><br /><em>Ranked choice rolls out in Maine, picks up steam elsewhere</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Earlier this month, with the nation, and no doubt some folks around the world watching, Maine conducted the United States’ first statewide election using the ranked-choice voting system.</p>
<p>Voters in Maine first <a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/how_does_ranked_choice_voting_work">approved</a> the use of ranked-choice voting in 2016 for a roll out in 2018 and while there were lawsuits right up to just about the last minute seeking to halt the implementation of the system, voters headed to the polls on June 12 and although the <a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/mainers-weigh-in-on-using-ranked-choice-voting">reviews</a> were mixed from voters, overall the rollout was deemed successful.</p>
<p>“It went as smoothly as we could have hoped,” <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/">Secretary of State</a> Matthew Dunlap said. “We had tremendous support from the town clerks, as well as our partners in Elections Systems and Software and General Courier. They brought a lot of reliable expertise to the process.”</p>
<p>For Maine’s implementation of ranked-choice voting, instead of counting the ballots at that city/county level, all the memory sticks were transported via courier to the capital where they were counted.</p>
<p>That transport was part of what lead to higher costs for the primary, which cost the state about $360,000 instead of $250,000 on average for a plurality-primary.</p>
<p>“However,” Dunlap said, “we did it on the cheap. There was no overtime involved, and we minimized the technology we could acquire and deploy. Going forward, we’ll need more of a budget. We had originally estimated $1.5 million for the initial rollout.”</p>
<p>This was not the first foray into ranked-choice voting in Maine. The city of Portland has used ranked-choice voting in the past and Dunlap said that was helpful to the statewide process, particularly to helping explain to voters so they could easily understand their part in the process. Dunlap said it also gave the state a predictive model to look at, which was helpful.</p>
<p>Although the roll-out proved successful, Dunlap said that it was definitely a learning lesson and will inform their work moving forward. And with voters stopping a referendum to repeal the use of ranked-choice, it will be used again.</p>
<p>“Everything we did, we did for the first time. We developed a much better idea of what we should test ahead of time, and also that being transparent in the process served us very well,” Dunlap said. “We were also mindful that the weather was very cooperative—something that isn’t so guaranteed in November. That understanding will help inform our timelines going forward.”</p>
<p>It remains unclear if Maine’s successful rollout will encourage other states to implement ranked-choice voting, but Dunlap has some thoughts for those in the weeds of implementation.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to move forward without consensus. Our process was dogged by disagreement within the legislature and a lack of foresight in implementation by the proponents—for example, the initiated legislation made no accounting for ballot retrieval, rulemaking, or budgetary needs,” Dunlap said. “Now that we’ve been through all that, those jurisdictions that are interested could look at our experience for what to do and not do.”</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico<br /></strong>Early this year, <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/santa-fe-turns-out-in-city-s-first-ranked-choice/article_b306198d-0542-50d2-9c77-157ff79e2780.html">Santa Fe New Mexico</a> rolled out ranked choice voting for the first time. Voters that we talked to were pleased with the roll out and by-and-large felt that the education campaign around the roll out was satisfactory.</p>
<p>It took four rounds to determine a winner, but the <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1142413/webber-leads-in-first-round-of-ranked-choice-voting.html">results</a> were known by the next day.</p>
<p>“I had never really heard of it [ranked-choice voting] before this, but it was well explained and pretty well administered,” said Ambassador Bill Richardson who also served as New Mexico’s governor from 2003 to 2011. “My candidate did not win, but I decided that I like the system because my third choice won so that meant my vote counted.”</p>
<p>Richardson voted early in the March municipal election and said that the poll workers working at city hall early voting site were informative and helpful about the new voting system. Richardson noted that the only confusion he heard about was from a friend who wanted to know if there was going to be a runoff election, which he explained there was not, thanks to ranked-choice voting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fairvote.org/">FairVote</a>’s Rob Richie pointed out that in Santa Fe, which has a large Hispanic population and had little time to implement the new system due to lawsuits, turnout increased by more than 10 percentage points and that 99.9 percent of mayoral voters cast a valid ballot, and 96 percent of those ballots were still counting for a finalist after more than a third of ballots went from one of the three defeated candidates to next choices.</p>
<p>“What we’ve come to believe is that sensible ballot design and instructions is the key for voters handling their ballot,” Richie said. “What then becomes important is explaining why to rank candidates and how it might affect outcomes. It’s obviously important for voters to trust the outcome, and that’s why we spend more time now working with candidates, civic groups and journalists after a jurisdiction begins to use RCV.”</p>
<p>Santa Fe resident Matthew Ruybal voted absentee in the March primary and said that while he was aware of ranked choice voting system, he didn’t know too much about it.</p>
<p>“The [absentee] ballot did come with an instruction sheet and how to fill it out,” Ruybal said. “It was helpful, but there was a lot of social media, test ballots and community ‘trainings’ held [before the election]. It took about a minute to fill out.”</p>
<p>While the system was easy to use, Ruybal isn’t so sure he’s sold on the concept.</p>
<p>“After using the new system, it wasn&#8217;t complex, but having to vote for every candidate seems unnecessary, especially for ones I don&#8217;t agree with,” Ruybal said.</p>
<p>Another city in New Mexico — <a href="http://www.las-cruces.org/departments/city-clerks-office">Las Cruces</a> — will be rolling out ranked choice in 2019. The city council unanimously adopted ranked-choice voting earlier this month. At the time of the vote, Councilmember Jack Eakman <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/2018/06/04/las-cruces-city-council-adopts-ranked-choice-voting/671612002/">said</a>, &#8220;I have received so many comments in favor of ranked-choice voting that I&nbsp;myself am going to be behind this resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elections in Las Cruces are conducted by the <a href="https://www.donaanacounty.org/elections">county</a>, but according to City Clerk Linda Lewis, the city’s public information officer will be working the county on education/outreach to voters. Lewis said that officials have spoken with their counterparts in Santa Fe about implementation.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about offering voters this option and are planning our campaign to inform voters. We plan on working with a coalition of community partners to inform voters about the change,” explained Scott Krahling, <a href="https://www.donaanacounty.org/elections">Dona Ana County clerk</a>. “Our office has a nonpartisan Election Advisory Council that is a coalition of community partners who can help us make sure accurate information is widely distributed.”</p>
<p>Krahling said the county is are already working with partners who have worked on successfully implementing RCV and are incorporating lessons learned.</p>
<p>“We want to offer people the opportunity to demonstrate the new style, and engage with us on why this changes is so important to the future of democracy,” Krahling said. “Given that communities have successfully implemented RCV with much shorter windows of time, I’m very optimistic and excited about doing the hard work to make this a success.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s next?<br /></strong>So what’s next for ranked-choice voting? Will we see more states adopting the voting system or will cities and counties, like Benton, Oregon, continue to take the lead.</p>
<p>“The last year of ranked choice voting elections provides a great opportunity to focus on how lessons from RCV in practice can be applied to address problems with elections like expensive runoffs and crowded primaries,” Richie said. “With the general trend toward jurisdictions and election vendors increasing readiness to run RCV, with best practices easily available from the <a href="https://www.rankedchoicevoting.org/">Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center</a>, and with more candidates getting the playbook on how to run effective RCV campaigns, we’ve seen a string of well-run RCV election. In each case, RCV surpassed expectations &#8212; in increased voter turnout, in clearly effective voter use of the system, and in the generally more civil tone and increased substance of the campaigns.”</p>
<p>Richie said that the successful roll out in Maine shows that ranked-choice is not too difficult for voters to understand, an argument that opponents of the voting system often argument. Using the system, 99.7 percent of gubernatorial voters cast a valid ballot.</p>
<p>“It’s natural to want to make sure that voters can handle changes to their ballot, but ranked choice voting holds up quite well to scrutiny,” Richie said. “Maine, for example, is in the bottom half of states in income and about average in its percentage of high school graduates.”</p>
<p>By early 2019, FairVote expects to have four regional coordinators supporting local reformers, with the goal of a stand-alone organization or at least a group of people to connect with in every state.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting for us to see the wide range of policymakers and reformers showing interest in RCV for different reasons &#8211; like saving money and increasing turnout by folding runoffs into one election and addressing the issue of low percentage winners in crowded fields,” Richie said. “That interest has come from the likes of the editorial boards of the New York Times and Washington Post, but also charter commissions in small towns and state legislators in states in every part of the country.”</p>
<p><em>(Editor’s Note: FairVote, an organization supportive of ranked-choice voting, receives <a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/portfolio/entry/fairvote">general support</a> from Democracy Fund, but not for the expressed purpose of RCV.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>The Center for Civic Design, an organization that works to ensure election materials are clear for voters, receives general support from Democracy Fund and has <a href="https://civicdesign.org/projects/rcv/">provided information</a> and best practices on the implementation of ranked-choice voting.)</em></p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>Voters in five states headed to the polls, mailboxes and ballot drop boxes this week for primaries. And in Mississippi and South Carolina, voters went back to the polls for primary runoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> Voters — Democrats, Republicans and independents — cast ballots this week in the state’s first “open” primary and that presented one of the largest problems for the primary. As we previously reported, independent voters received both a Democratic and Republican ballot with the instructions to <a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/06/26/wayne-williams-primary-election/">only cast one</a>. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/colorado-independents-now-vote-primaries-thousands-votes-wont/story?id=56070408">Unfortunately</a> more than 1,000 voters statewide cast both ballots which invalidated their vote. In <a href="https://www.montrosepress.com/free_access/ballot-snafu-to-delay-primary-results/article_80b92f9e-7967-11e8-b7b6-8bcee971cb79.html">Montrose County</a>, due to a printing error, officials were forced to hand-count ballots. A vendor printed the incorrect barcode on the ballot. Overall turnout was about 54 percent which is the highest <a href="http://www.reporterherald.com/news/election/ci_31973457/secretary-states-office-primary-turnout-highest-since-2010">primary turnout</a> in state history.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Things got off to a rough start for Maryland’s primary when over the weekend the state announced that around <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-maryland-voter-registration-errors-20180623-story.html">18,000</a> change of address/party were not recorded through the state’s Motor Vehicle Administration. On Monday, the state admitted that the number of affected voters was much higher, closer to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-voting-snafu-update-20180625-story.html">80,000</a>. Affected voters were required to cast <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-provisional-ballot-analysis-20180626-story.html">provisional ballots</a> and the state will not have a handle on how many of those were cast till after press time. The state’s MVA provided county elections offices with a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-provisional-update-20180627-story.html">spreadsheet</a> of those impacted by the problem in hopes of helping counties speed up the provisional process. Officials called the failure a “<a href="https://statescoop.com/maryland-officials-blame-programming-error-for-mishandling-of-80-000-voter-registrations">programming error</a>.” Other than provisional ballots there were a handful of other issues on Tuesday in the Old Line State. A polling place in <a href="http://www.wbal.com/article/321696/3/hampden-polling-location-experiencing-issues-on-election-day">Hamden</a> got off to late state because poll workers could not access the building. A power outage forced one <a href="http://www.nottinghammd.com/2018/06/26/essex-voting-location-changed-due-to-power-failure/">Essex</a> polling place to relocate. Voting was extended an hour in three precincts after they opened late in <a href="https://patch.com/maryland/northbaltimore/voting-extended-3-precincts-baltimore-board-elections">Baltimore</a>. Also in Baltimore, a polling place had to be relocated after it was discovered it was infested with <a href="http://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/polling-location-moved-in-baltimore-due-to-fleas-and-mice">fleas and mice</a>. Baltimore’s mayor has called for a review of the problems found at the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-ci-pugh-election-review-20180627-story.html">city’s polling places</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> There were few reported problems throughout Mississippi for the primary run-off and <a href="http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Vote-turnout-low-for-run-off-elections-486615591.html">turnout</a> was reported to be light. Results were delayed by a few hours in <a href="http://www.desototimes.com/news/technology-glitch-during-election-part-of-progress/article_87040952-7a5a-11e8-a534-1301be85b147.html">DeSoto County</a> due to a computer glitch.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: New Yorkers went to the polls on Tuesday faced with relatively empty ballots since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/nyregion/new-york-primary-congress-state-federal.html">state and local primaries</a> will be held in September. Even with relatively light turnout, there were some problems like <a href="http://gothamist.com/2018/06/26/voters_primary_confusion_nyc.php">late-opening polling sites</a> in New York City. And in <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-metro-staten-island-voter-conservative-republican-20180626-story.html">Staten Island</a>, a voter was accused of casting ballots in both the Republican and Conservative party primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Voting was delayed in multiple locations in <a href="https://www.fox23.com/news/multiple-polling-places-delayed-in-tulsa-county/777350505">Tulsa County</a> where voters in one polling place were forced to <a href="http://ktul.com/news/local/ballots-cast-in-car-trunks-as-polling-location-is-late-to-open">vote out of the back of an SUV</a>. There were <a href="http://www.koco.com/article/voters-report-having-to-ask-for-ballots-containing-sq-788-officials-say/21948901">various complaints</a> about ballots for State Question 788, which would legalize medical marijuana. In <a href="http://www.stwnewspress.com/news/payne-county-election-board-addresses-complaints-about-access-to-sq/article_fbda6aac-7977-11e8-b42d-2b57e532aec1.html">Payne County</a>, voters complained that poll workers were not handing out both the party primary ballot and the state question ballot. Bryan Dean, spokesman for the state board of elections said that while problems did happen, they <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/election-board-official-says-voters-are-getting-their-ballots-for/article_c62d17bf-18e4-5a5b-b7b6-773468250a8d.html">were not widespread</a>. “As the counties got a few of those (calls), they called the precincts where they had some issues, they dealt with that, they followed up and they got all the poll workers on the right page,” Dean told the <em>Tulsa World</em>. In <a href="http://www.normantranscript.com/news/government/county-election-board-slowed-down-by-high-absentee-ballot-numbers/article_4b6dbcd5-e390-5eed-af39-8603e3e1fff4.html">Cleveland County</a>, the vote count was slowed by a high number of absentee ballots.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Voters went back to the polls in the Palmetto State on Tuesday and they faced a few issues, but <a href="http://www.abccolumbia.com/2018/06/26/state-election-officials-no-major-voting-problems-at-polls/">no major voting problems</a>. Polling locations or elections offices in Colleton, Abbeville, Saluda and Spartanburg counties <a href="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/article213836799.html">lost power</a> over night after thunderstorms, but all precincts were up and running in time for Tuesday morning. One polling place in <a href="http://www.indexjournal.com/news/breaking/the-latest-power-outage-has-voters-in-donalds-casting-paper/article_1eccec07-32ed-5939-9548-fdd493fc63af.html">Abbeville County</a> was forced to use paper ballots because of a power outage.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> All but two counties cast their <a href="http://kuer.org/post/some-results-hang-balance-while-vote-mail-ballots-are-counted#stream/0">ballots by mail</a> this primary season and overall things seemed to go well, however in <a href="http://sanpetemessenger.com/2018/06/22/impromptu-voting-locations-being-arranged-due-to-undelivered-ballots/">Sanpete County</a>, Clerk Sandy Neill had to set up special polling places and extend hours after hearing many reports about ballots not arriving.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>A move to vote-by-mail in Utah</strong> has <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/06/25/new-study-suggests-utahs-by-mail-voting-boosts-turnout-among-millennials/">increased turnout overall</a>, especially among Millennials and other low-propensity voters, a new study has found. The study, conducted by Pantheon Analytics and commissioned by <em>Washington Monthly</em> magazine showed a 5 to 7 percentage point turnout increase in the state’s 21 counties that vote by mail in 2016 compared to the eight counties that voted primarily on Election Day. And the by mail counties also saw the greatest increase in engagement among low-propensity voters.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier this year, the city of Anchorage</strong> rolled out, by all accounts, a successful first attempt at <a href="http://mustreadalaska.com/elections-division-no-vote-by-mail-for-anchorage-in-state-elections/">vote-by-mail</a> for the city’s municipal elections. The city was hoping to build on that success by using vote-by-mail for the November general election, but the state Division of Elections said no. According to a local blog, the explanation given is that to change the existing&nbsp;precinct-based system for state elections would require legislation to significantly modify Alaska State Statutes. &nbsp;such as AS 15.20.800. Voting by mail. (a) “The director may conduct an election by mail if it is held at a time other than when the general, party primary, or municipal election is held.” If Anchorage votes want to vote-by-mail in the upcoming statewide elections, they will have to do so the old fashioned way, by applying for their ballots in advance.</p>
<p><strong>This week, the All Pueblo Council of Governors</strong> approved a resolution to support New Mexico’s Native American Voting Task Force. “With the 2018 General Election approaching quickly, the Council’s support will give the task force more tools and avenues to reach voters in tribal communities and help them expedite their work,” said New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. “I’m proud of what the task force members have done so far to identify areas of need for Native voters and to build relationships with the Council and other tribal leaders to begin addressing those needs. I applaud the Council for recognizing how crucial this task force is to strengthening democracy in New Mexico.” The Native American Voting Task Force in 2017 to improve election participation in New Mexico’s pueblos and tribal communities. The task force, which consists of ten members from various tribes and pueblos across the state, is charged with advising the Secretary of State on engaging Native Americans in the electoral process. The task force is working to boost voter registration in tribal communities, develop educational voting materials in Native languages and increase voter turnout among Native Americans.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that would require return ballot envelopes to have <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2018/06/21/postage-mail-ballot-bill/">prepaid postage</a>. Some counties currently pay for return postage and others do not. Counties would cover the costs initially (estimated at $5.5 million in 2016 statewide) and then be reimbursed by the state. The measure had previously been approved by the House, but amendments to the Senate bill will need to be reconciled with what the House approved before going to Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk.</p>
<p>Also in California, the Assembly Elections Committee, by a 5-2 vote, approved SB 759 which establishes a process for election officials to notify voters when their vote-by-mail <a href="https://kymkemp.com/2018/06/27/every-vote-counts-bill-approved-in-assembly-elections-committee/">signature mismatches</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> This week, the Legislature failed to override seven vetoes from Gov. Dannel Malloy, including one of a bill that would have allowed town clerks to choose an <a href="http://wshu.org/post/connecticut-legislature-fails-override-malloys-vetoes#stream/0">election-day registration location</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> The House has approved <a href="https://delawarestatenews.net/government/same-day-registration-and-early-voting-pass-delaware-house/">two elections-related bills</a>. One would allow early voting and the other would allow same-day voter registration. Both bills were approved along party lines and now move to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: This week, Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) held an hours long hearing on his proposal that would <a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2018/06/dc-teens-could-get-right-to-vote/">lower the voting age</a> in the District from 18 to 16. The bill would also require schools to provide every 16-year-old with a voter registration form.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The House has approved a bill that would move Massachusetts to an <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/06/massachusetts_house_passes_aut.html">automatic voter registration</a> state. Under the bill, anyone who applies for or updates their license at the department of motor vehicles or applies for MassHealth and is eligible to register will automatically be registered unless they choose to opt out.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The Senate has approved a bill that would allow residents of the Garden State to register or update their <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/senate-passes-online-voter-registration-bill/">voter registration online</a>. The legislation requires the state to find a secure Internet platform to assure the accuracy and integrity of the registration process, and uses digitalized signatures from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission database.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Gov. Roy Cooper (D) vetoed a Republican-led piece of legislation that would have altered <a href="https://www.wral.com/cooper-lets-3-bills-become-law-citing-consumer-concerns/17653997/">early voting</a> and eliminated a popular day of it. The Legislature is expected to work on an override. The General Assembly was able to muster enough votes to <a href="https://www.wral.com/general-assembly-overrides-governor-on-hog-farm-suits-early-voting/17658716/">override</a> Cooper’s veto.</p>
<p>A proposed constitutional amendment that would require voters to show a <a href="http://wlos.com/news/local/voter-id-constitutional-amendment-clears-north-carolina-house">photo ID</a> in order to vote has been approved by the House. With 72 votes needed to put the amendment on the ballot, it received 74. The amendment moves to the Senate next.</p>
<p>The Senate has given final approval to a proposed constitutional amendment that would <a href="https://www.wral.com/new-board-of-elections-appointments-amendment-on-the-ballot/17660162/">change the way the state board of elections is appointed</a>. Under this proposal, four of the eight members would be chosen by the minority leadership in the House and Senate and four by the majority. The governor would have no say over appointments to the board of elections.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> The Toledo city council is considering legislation that would allow potential voters to register whenever they have an <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2018/06/25/Toledo-s-utilities-department-municipal-court-could-soon-offer-voter-registration.html">interaction with a city agency</a>, from paying their water bill to doing business at municipal court. “This is a way for us to increase voter registration and make sure that everyone has the opportunity to have their voice heard in the most important piece of our democracy,” Councilman Nick Komives, who introduced the legislation, told The Toledo Blade.</p>
<p>Also in Ohio, the Senate has given final approval to Senate Bill 135 which will distribute $<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2018/06/ohio_lawmakers_ok_1145_million.html">114.5 million</a> among the state’s 88 counties to purchase new voting machines in advance of the 2020 election. The legislation includes $10 million for counties that have purchased new equipment since 2014.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has reaffirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction in a challenge to <a href="http://www.metnews.com/articles/2018/votebymail062518.htm">California’s Voters’ Choice Act</a>. The ruling means that the five counties that have opted into the new voting system—San Mateo, Madera, Napa, Nevada and Sacramento — will not have to set up neighborhood polling places in November and may continue to use the vote-by-mail/vote center hybrid system.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: The League of Women Voters, acting on behalf of six University of Florida and Florida State University has filed suit in U.S. District Court seeking to order Gov. Rick Scott’s administration to allow <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/06/21/league-seeks-court-order-to-allow-early-voting-on-campus/">early voting sites on state college and university campuses</a>. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the League is challenging Secretary of State Ken Detzner&#8217;s interpretation of state election laws to exclude campus buildings for early voting. Detzner&#8217;s office denied the city of Gainesville&#8217;s request to use the UF student union building for early voting in the 2014 city election.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, in advance of next month’s hearing <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/court-urged-to-reject-state-rights-restoration-process">felon voting rights restoration</a>, attorneys for nine former felons have filed a 72-page brief asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a ruling by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker that struck down the state’s system for restoring voting rights.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is asking a state appellate court for a new hearing to determine whether the Douglas County District Court should be required to summon a citizen-initiated grand jury to investigate allegations that his office has <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2018/jun/25/kobach-asks-new-hearing-local-effort-summon-grand-/">mishandled voter registration applications</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Mario Obdulio Orellana, 57 has been indicted on five counts including <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Salvadoran-Immigrant-Indicted-For-Voter-Fraud-in-Texas-486283181.html">voter fraud</a> and false representation of U.S. citizenship. Prosecutors allege that Orellana illegally obtained a U.S. birth certificate, passport and social security number. He used those to register and vote in 2016 election.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, three women were arrested in Hidalgo County and charged with various types of <a href="https://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_d1ac17a4-79b2-11e8-a817-e70d5da6e867.html">voter fraud</a>. Sylvia Arjona was charged with four counts of unlawful assistance of a voter, Sara Ornelas was charged with three counts of unlawful assistance and Marcela Gutierrez was charged with 10 counts of unlawful assistance and one second-degree felony count of illegal voting.</p>
<p>Visiting Judge Joel Johnson has tossed the results of a May runoff election for justice of the peace in Kleberg County and has <a href="https://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2018/06/26/judge-tosses-kleberg-county-justice-peace-votes-orders-new-election/730354002/">ordered that a new election be held</a>. While the evidence ultimately showed that seven of the votes cast in the May 22 runoff election were invalid, Johnson did not declare one of the candidates the winner because there was ultimately no way to prove for whom those individuals voted.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The State of Wisconsin and the U.S. Department of Justice have reached a settlement over how the state <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/22/wisconsin-u-s-dept-justice-reach-agreement-ensuring-electronic-absentee-ballots/726372002/">transmit ballots to overseas voters</a>. Under the agreement, regardless of why a voter is overseas—military deployment, foreign service work, because they feel like it—they will now be able to receive their ballot electronically.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Tech</strong>: According to an article in <em>The New York Times</em>, eight of the tech industry’s most influential companies — Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Google, Oath, Snap and Microsoft — met with U.S. intelligence officials to discuss <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/technology/tech-meeting-midterm-elections.html">preparations for the 2018 midterms</a>. The company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s newly formed “foreign influence” task force. According to the Times, eople who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told — repeatedly — that no specific intelligence would be shared.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> While some elections officials rely heavily on social media, one Illinois county election official will be <a href="https://www.ilnews.org/news/statewide/social-media-will-be-illinois-first-line-of-election-hacking/article_6d97c4c8-7883-11e8-9a46-77401620dff5.html">staying off Facebook on election day</a> for security reasons. &#8220;Locally, [the voter file] is not live. We cannot be hacked,&#8221; McLean County Clerk Kathy Michael told <em>Illinois News Network</em>. &#8220;So the only thing that could disturb a voter is if something gets on social media.&#8221; The idea, Michael said, is to&nbsp;make sure hackers can&#8217;t use social media to spread false information about closed polls or problems with voting machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> This week, the secretary of state’s office announced that it will take longer than expected to <a href="http://www.knoe.com/content/news/Delay-to-choose-company-to-replace-Louisiana-voting-machines-486364841.html">replace the state’s voting machines</a>. Originally a bidder was expected to be selected this month, but that has been pushed off indefinitely according to the <em>Associated Press.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/news/2018/5/25/job-civic-data-research-fellow">Civic Data Research Fellow</a>, Center for Technology and Civic Life</strong> — “What’s on my ballot?” is the number one question that voters look for online &#8211; but the answer to that question is harder to find than you might think. With nearly 8,000 offices responsible for running elections in America, the basic information that voters need to participate in elections is often poorly formatted and hard to find &#8211; if it’s online at all.
