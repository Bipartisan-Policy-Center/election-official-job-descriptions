							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election 2018 Preview: What to watch on Election Day</strong><br />
<em>Ten things to watch on November 6</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>This is it. The end is finally nigh…well at least (we hope) for the 2018 election cycle.</p>
<p>Although millions of voters have already cast their ballots in record number either through early voting, absentee voting or vote-by-mail, millions more will head to the polls on November 6 and cast their ballots in what has become, for a variety of reasons, one of the most watched elections of our time.</p>
<p>It’s been a very busy two years since the last nationwide election to say the least. Federal, state and local officials have spent thousands of hours and dollars beefing up election security. In addition to that, voters will face new laws, new voting machines and new voting sites on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to watch on Tuesday and electionline will be doing Election Dispatches through the day. And while we will not doubt be following everything, these are 10 things we will be paying special attention to.</p>
<p>Good luck and may the gods of democracy have mercy on our souls!</p>
<p>Oh, and as Agatha Christie said in Death Comes at the End, “Sometimes what you think is an end is only a beginning.” November 3, 2020 is only 728 days away!</p>
<p><strong>Election Security</strong> —While all eyes are already on the midterms in anticipation of the outcome, everyone will also be keeping a very close on election security. Counties and states have worked tirelessly since the 2016 to bolster their election security, especially cybersecurity. Will it be enough? Also on the security front, tempers are running high in America and there have already been several instances of minor violence and intimidation at early voting sites, will everyone remain calm on Election Day?</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong> —Hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people registered to vote in the waning days of the 2018 election cycle. Some counties struggled to get the voter registrations processed before early voting began. Come Election Day, will all those registrations be processed and voters find their names on the rolls? And in Georgia, will the thousands of suspended voters be able to cast their ballots without issue?</p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong> — Issues with voter ID arise every election, but this year,<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/voteridfaq.html"> Iowa</a> and<a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/showit2vote"> Missouri</a> will see the first, large-scale, statewide roll out of their voter ID laws. Missouri’s was mired in litigation till about two weeks before the election. Are poll workers prepared to know what to ask for? Are voters prepared to show the required IDs? And in<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/north-dakota-voter-identification-registration.html"> North Dakota</a>, after the U.S. Supreme Court failed to take up the case, the state’s voter ID law, which requires a valid street address is on the books. Many Native Americans living on reservations may be impacted. Will they get the necessary ID in time?</p>
<p><strong>Turnout</strong> — Americans have turned out in record numbers for early voting this year. Will that impact overall turnout? Will voters turnout in record — for a midterm — numbers on Election Day as well? Are elections officials prepared for crowds? Will there be lines? Will polls have to stay open late?</p>
<p><strong>Displaced Voters</strong> — Voters in several states, including North Carolina, Florida and Texas are displaced from their homes due to natural disasters. While the voters in<a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2018/02/02/265637/displaced-harvey-victims-with-suspended-registration-can-still-vote/"> Texas</a> have been displaced for a year now, the displacement only recently occurred in<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article220556925.html"> North Carolina</a>, Florida,<a href="https://www.thepostsearchlight.com/2018/10/26/hurricane-michael-has-forced-changes-to-precincts-for-election-day-voting/"> Georgia</a> and other states. Will these displaced voters be able to cast a ballot? Will they face issues if they show up at their designated polling places on Election Day? How will the counties in the<a href="https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/changes-made-to-voting-because-of-hurricane-michael/1555293642"> Florida Panhandle</a>, especially Bay County, pull off Election Day?</p>
<p><strong>New Machines/Technology</strong> — Thousands of voters will be using new voting machines for the first time this election. Are voters and poll workers ready? Will this slow down or speed up the process of casting ballots? Will the voting booth technology help speed up election night? Some voters encountered problems with electronic voting machines during early voting, will those problems persist? Additionally, jurisdictions in several states are using e-poll books for the first time. How will roll out go?</p>
<p><strong>Litigation</strong> — It seems like, in the lead up to the 2018 midterm election, there was a lawsuit filed almost every day. From polling place location to voter ID, to absentee ballot acceptance. Will all these suits be settled by Tuesday and if so what impact may they have? Will more lawsuits be filed as a results of Tuesdays’ process or outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Secretary of State Races</strong> — There are 24<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2018/10-25/"> secretary of state seats</a> up for grabs this election cycle with eight of those being open seats. In addition to those 24 seats, there are several governor’s races that may determine the future of the state’s election authority.</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Measures</strong> — As we reported a few weeks ago, there are eight statewide<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2018/10-11/"> ballot measures</a> that will cover voter ID, ballot harvesting, election-day registration, automatic voter registration, citizens-only voting, ex-felon voting, and no-excuse absentee voting. There will also be at least 10 local elections-related measures covering everything from voting rights for 16-year-olds, approval voting, instant runoff voting and non-citizen voting.</p>
<p><strong>Vote by Mail</strong> — More and more people are choosing to<a href="https://www.apnews.com/ef43bc7426f5430e8005b9eb336def7f"> cast their ballot via mail</a>. Will those ballots get to elections officials on time? Will there be issues with signature matches? How long will processing and counting all those ballots take?</p>
<p>And finally there are the unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>As Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said back in 2002,  “But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don&#8217;t know we don&#8217;t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.” There are things that may happen on Election Day that no one could anticipate happening and elections officials live by the unknown unknowns rule. Will there be any unknown unknowns on Election Day 2018 and if so, what impact may they have and at what level?</p>

							<h2>ADA Compliance at the Polls</h2>
														<p><strong>ADA Compliance at the Polls</strong><br />
<em>What Everyone Needs to Know about Accessible Elections and Voters’ Rights</em></p>
<p>Tammy Patrick, Senior Advisor to Democracy Fund’s Election Program<br />
Michelle Bishop, Disability Advocacy Specialist for Voting Rights at the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN)</p>
<p>With more voting options than ever before—early voting centers, in-person absentee, and postal delivery of ballots—millions of Americans have already weighed in on the 2018 midterm elections. It is certainly an exciting time and we’re inspired by the work that elections officials, administrators, and poll workers across the country are doing to ensure that our elections systems are secure, and that all votes are counted accurately.</p>
<p>At the Bipartisan Policy Center’s recent<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/events/are-we-ready-to-run-our-elections-2/"> Are We Ready to Run Our Elections?</a> event, Matt Masterson, Director of the Election Task Force (ETF) at the Department of Homeland Security, raised an important point about accessibility, stating: “if our systems aren’t accessible to eligible voters, there is great insecurity in that.” So, let’s look at what election officials can and should be doing to make certain that polling places are accessible, and what voters need to know about their rights.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Compliant Election Administration</strong><br />
The vote is the one right on which all our other rights depend, and equal access to that vote is vital for a healthy democracy. At the most basic level, all voters want to be treated equally and allowed the same opportunities to the information and practices offered to their friends, family, and neighbors. Administrators on the front lines of our democracy can be one of the most important  both physical access to election services and information in formats that work for all voters.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice sets federal accessibility standards to specifically aid election officials in making certain that their polling locations are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The<a href="https://www.ada.gov/votingchecklist.htm"> ADA checklist</a> defines what needs to be provided: adequate parking with van access aisles, unimpeded paths, curb-cuts, entrances not requiring use of stairs so that all voters can enter and cast their vote. This checklist for polling places is the gold standard for ensuring polling place accessibility, and its requirements benefit everyone, including older adults, a parent pushing a stroller, or anyone with a temporary injury that requires crutches or a boot. In cases where accessible polling places are difficult to locate, the jurisdiction must either provide remedies such as temporary ramps and propping open manual doors, or alternatives such as curbside voting as part of a comprehensive program to service those voters who face barriers.</p>
<p>This is where instructions to voters and information become critical, and there are resources available like the<a href="https://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/"> Center for Civic Design Field Guides</a>. Voters should be apprised of what options they have at the polls. Providing information on official websites, in mailers, and outreach campaigns need to be done in a variety of formats. Many voters utilize assistive software to navigate through websites and election information sites should allow for those interfaces to work effectively by adhering to online accessibility standards. Providing information in large print, Braille, and audio formats also expands the pool of voters who can engage in the process in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Some of the best programs leverage<a href="https://www.lavote.net/home/voting-elections/community-voter-outreach/voting-accessibility-advisory-committee"> advocacy networks</a> in the community to help identify challenges voters may face, suggest solutions, and get information out to the electorate. No one knows more about running elections than our elections administrators, but no one knows more about what people with disabilities need than actual people with disabilities. Inviting disability advocacy organizations and voters with disabilities into the election planning process creates new solutions to vexing accessibility problems.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Voter Rights</strong><br />
As a Commissioner with President Obama’s Presidential Commission on Election Administration (Tammy) and a long-time disability rights advocate taking calls to voter assistance hotlines whenever polls are open (Michelle), we have heard firsthand when voters are being denied their rights at the polls. Too often there are stories of a voter’s competency being challenged, denial of voting assistance by a person of the voter’s choosing, or lack of the ability to cast a private and independent ballot as required by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). Some fundamental voter rights are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voters have the right to request reasonable accommodations in registration and voting.</strong> If you are a voter who knows you may need assistance, contact your local election officials in advance to find out what options you have and what you need to do to be certain that services will be available when, and where, you want them.</li>
<li><strong>Voters have the right to assistance in voting by someone of their choosing (with a few exceptions).</strong> Voters may bring in someone to help them in casting their ballot if that person is not their employer or union representative. You can have someone help you in reading and marking the ballot if you want.</li>
<li><strong>Voters have the right to cast their ballot independently and privately.</strong> If you don’t want to have someone assist you, you have the right to vote independently and each polling place should be resourced with an assistive voting machine to enable you to do so. This equipment is enabled to present materials in large print, in an audio format, and also to link with many assistive devices like sip-and-puffs and paddles.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many areas voters also have the right to voting information in an alternative language as prescribed by the Voting Rights Act. Paper ballots and the assistive machines should offer voter instructions and the ballot itself in required alternative language(s).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/competent-poll-workers-bolstered-voters-confidence-in-2016">Americans rely on poll workers to help them understand and navigate election processes</a>. It is important that election staff are trained in the federal and state laws governing assistance and access, but also in some basic protocols. Poll workers often truly do want to be helpful, but may not know how. Training and<a href="https://www.csg.org/report_interactive.pdf"> resources</a> are available on chain of custody of ballots and voting equipment, security seals and locks, ID requirements and eligibility; election officials should also train on how to provide assistance effectively, how to interact with people with disabilities respectfully, and best practices to improve the voting experience.</p>

							<h2>eBenchbook Expands</h2>
														<p><strong>William &amp; Mary’s Election Law Program eBenchbook expands</strong></p>
<p>Wondering what the Virginia election code has to say about ID at the polls? Want to know how Florida and North Carolina election statutes accommodate hurricanes? Curious how Nevada statutes treat third-party candidates?</p>
<p>In advance of the November 6, 2018 election, the  <a href="https://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/electionlaw/">Election Law Program</a>, a joint project of <a href="https://law.wm.edu/news/stories/2016/election-law-web-tool-launched-five-months-ahead-of-national-elections-to-prepare-state-judges-for-possible-november-challenges.php">William &amp; Mary Law School</a> and the<a href="https://www.ncsc.org/newsroom/news-releases/2016/election-law-toolkit.aspx"> National Center for State Courts</a>, is proud to add to its collection of online state election “eBenchbooks” available at<a href="https://ebenchbook.wm.edu"> https://eBenchbook.wm.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The new update adds Nevada and North Carolina codes to the platform, as well as text-only codes from all remaining states. These additions present users with three stages of eBenchbook development.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://ebenchbook.wm.edu/alabama/"> first stage</a> houses just the text of the state election code. The<a href="https://ebenchbook.wm.edu/north-carolina/"> second stage</a> adds browsing menus, a search bar, and supplemental materials to each statute, such as case law and regulations (see Nevada and North Carolina for examples). The<a href="https://ebenchbook.wm.edu/virginia/statutes/%C2%A7-24-2-545-presidential-primary/"> final stage</a> “full” eBenchbooks incorporate in-text annotations from a bipartisan group of in-state election experts who annotate state election statutes on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>These annotations provide context for understanding how election laws operate in Colorado, Florida and  Virginia. To see an example of a fully-annotated statute that includes supplementary materials,<a href="https://ebenchbook.wm.edu/virginia/statutes/%25C2%25A7-24-2-103-powers-and-duties-in-general/"> click here</a>.</p>
<p>The eBenchbook project strives to make state election law more transparent, provide judges with meaningful context for election statutes, and provide opportunities for election law experts—who often  find themselves on opposite sides in court—to clarify the meaning of state election statutes outside the context of a live election dispute. The eBenchbook project aims to provide a tangible resource to judges hearing election cases and to help journalists and members of the public understand how state election laws operate.</p>
<p>“Election litigation, once a rarity, has become increasingly common since Bush v. Gore. The Election Law Program’s eBenchbook is a welcomed resource for judges deciding election related cases,” explains the Hon. Terry Lewis, a Leon County, Florida circuit judge who played a central role in Bush v. Gore in 2000.</p>
<p>Whether you are a judge, a lawyer, a journalist, or a citizen who wants to know more about the law of  elections, we welcome you to explore the site to see how election laws help to shape the contours of our democracy.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>Too much of a good thing? Last week, Christopher Krebs, Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate at the DHS said that elections officials are being inundated with all the<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dhs-election-officials-inundated-confused-by-free-cyber-security-offerings/"> free cybersecurity offerings</a> from private companies and those offerings are causing confusion. While Krebs said the free offerings are great, it may be too many too fast, especially at the local level.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that I am seeing with a lot of these companies offering free services is that the election officials down range are being inundated and they can&#8217;t really kinda contextualize this service vs that service, [and] what does it get them,&#8221; Krebbs said the Cyberlaw Podcast.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The Pew Research Center has a new survey out</strong> that says 55 percent of respondents said that they were not too or not at all confident that “election systems are secure from hacking and other technological threats.” Additionally, a 67-percent majority said either Russia or other foreign governments will likely attempt to influence various races in the midterm election. Despite their concerns about outside interference, nearly nine-in-ten (89%) have confidence in poll workers in their community to do a good job, and majorities say the same about local and state election officials. The<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/"> survey</a> of 10,600 adults was conducted between Sept. 24 and Oct. 7.</p>
<p><strong>It may be 2018, but elections officials in Arizona are still</strong> working off a<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2018/10/29/ducey-put-reagans-elections-manual-on-hold-after-county-recorders-complained/"> state-issued election procedures manual from 2014</a>. According to the <em>Arizona Mirror</em>, Secretary of State Michele Reagan submitted the 500+ page manual in March, but neither Gov. Doug Ducey nor Attorney General Mark Brnovich signed off on the manual. The manual provides guidance on how county elections officials are to conduct elections and execute election-related statutes. Once approved, the manual carries the force of law. Ducey spokesman Daniel Ruiz said the governor’s decision was the result of intense criticism from county recorders, who took issue with a number of the proposed manual’s provisions. He said Ducey was also concerned that there wasn’t enough time left before the election to implement the changes it contained. “Their preference was to retain the manual in its current state,” Ruiz the Mirror.</p>
<p><strong>In North Dakota, tribal activists and leaders are scrambling to get voters</strong> who live on the state’s Indian Reservations the<a href="https://www.apnews.com/a9b5d513c9b0489baf5d8b5fc880f03c"> necessary ID to vote</a>. “Fifteen dollars for an ID could mean the difference between a single mother buying milk for her children for three days or getting an ID to go vote,” Turtle Mountain Chairman Jamie Azure told <em>The Associated Press</em>. Tribes are handing out<a href="http://www.ktre.com/2018/10/31/thousands-native-voters-north-dakota-getting-free-ids/"> free IDs</a> in advance of the election and at polling sites on Election Day. They’re arranging special events, including a recent concert on the Standing Rock Reservation featuring musician Dave Matthews. On Turtle Mountain, about 100 people are coming in for free IDs each day, said Kandace Parisien, director of the tribe’s motor vehicle department, which is issuing them.</p>
<p><strong>In other Native American voting rights news</strong>, members of<a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2018/10/31/tribes-get-their-own-polling-places-some-for-the-first-time/"> several Nevada-based tribes will have their own voting location come Election Day</a>. In 2016,Pyramid Lake Paiute and Walker River Paiute tribes filed suit against Nevada, Washoe County and Mineral County over the lack of early voting and election day polling sites. A federal judge agreed that not providing the sites was a violation of the National Voting Rights Act. Now those two tribes and nine others will have voting sites. “For the first time in our tribe’s history, our tribal members will have a site on our reservation,” said Stacey Montooth, the community information officer for the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony (RSIC) and a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe.  “Our leadership understands the importance of the election.” According to the <em>Nevada Current,</em> At the polling site on the Walker River Paiute tribal land, which has about 400 registered voters enrolled in the tribe, people have been enthusiastic. “It’s a big turnout, a lot of people are loving it,” said Shawna Castillo, 35, who is a member of the tribe and a volunteer for the early voting polling site.</p>
<p><strong>Look what you made her do.</strong> Last month, pop star<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/10/30/taylor-swift-instagram-early-voting-phil-bredesen-senate/1822718002/"> Taylor Swift broke her political silence</a> and encouraged her millions of followers on Instagram to register to vote. Several states reported a bump in registration following the post. Now Swift has cast an early ballot in Tennessee and only time will tell if her decision to vote and share it on social media will boost voter turnout.</p>

														<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A trio of bills to<a href="https://www.monroenow.com/news/elections/legislation-improving-voter-security-clears-committee/article_b83c7232-db73-11e8-bf55-9f576d11127d.html"> enhance election security</a> have been advanced by the Assembly State and Local Government Committee. The three bills would allow the state to transition to paper ballots, use federal HAVA funds to pay for the new voting machines and encourage Congress to allot more money to purchase voting equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Rep. Pam Snyder has introduced House Bill 75 that would allow for<a href="https://www.wearecentralpa.com/news/new-bill-could-make-voting-easier-in-pa/1550211179"> no-excuse absentee voting</a>.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has up held a 2106 law banning groups from<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-11-01/court-upholds-law-barring-collection-of-mail-in-ballots"> collecting mail-in ballots</a> from voters and delivering them.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Leigh Martin May has<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/judge-declines-kemp-request-pause-absentee-ballot-injunction/BxTbpmoONQkedOLM4I7v1M/"> declined to pause</a> an injunction she ordered that changes how Georgia elections officials evaluate certain absentee ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to force Ford County to open a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kansas-lawsuit-seeks-to-open-second-dodge-city-voting-site/2018/10/26/e055c614-d953-11e8-8384-bcc5492fef49_story.html?utm_term=.9054c972c009"> second voting location</a> in Dodge City for the upcoming election.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> The state’s High Court has decline to hear the appeal of a ruling allowing the state to deny the<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/louisiana/articles/2018-10-31/louisiana-high-court-upholds-block-on-paroled-felons-voting"> right to vote to felons</a> on probation or parole. Chief Justice Bernette Johnson split from her colleagues, calling the law plainly unconstitutional. She acknowledged a law passed this year allowing felons on parole or probation to vote after five years of freedom, but said that law doesn&#8217;t go far enough.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Former Moorhead City Council member Mark Altenburg has filed suit against the city alleging that Moorhead violated state law when changes were made to<a href="https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2018/oct/29/lawsuit-challenges-moorhead-election-changes/"> polling places</a> after Dec. 31, 2017. The suit was<a href="https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2018/oct/31/moorhead-election-lawsuit-dismissed/"> dismissed</a> for being filed in the wrong jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: On Thursday, a judge brokered a<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/judge-refuses-to-stay-order-blocking-new-voter-registration-law-offers-compromise/24234066"> tentative deal</a> over SB3 however on Friday, the state’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/voter-registration-law-upheld-in-new-hampshire/"> Supreme Court</a> ruled that the law will remain in place for the 2018 midterms but let the door open for further litigation after the midterms.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: An independent candidate for Bergen County sheriff has filed suit against the county clerk in Superior Court claiming the clerk<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2018/10/28/bergen-county-sheriff-sues-clerk-election-saudino/1762994002/"> violated state law</a> by failing to give notice of the public drawing for the ballot order, and has created confusion and bias by putting an unnecessary gap between candidates&#8217; names on the supplemental ballot mailed to residents.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe has filed a suit against the state arguing that the “<a href="https://www.kvrr.com/2018/10/30/tribe-sues-north-dakota-over-voter-id-requirements/">provable street address” requirement</a> for voters is unconstitutional. The suit argues that the 911 system of assigning addresses, the state’s solution for those on Reservations is, “incomplete, contradictory and prone to errors on reservations.”</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> By a 2-1 vote, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2018/10/court-orders-ohio-boards-of-election-to-count-provisional-ballots-in-midterms-for-certain-voters-purged-from-rolls.html"> votes cast by people purged from the rolls</a> between 2011 and 2015 must be counted if they still live in the same county of their last registration and if they are not disqualified from voting because of a felony conviction, mental incapacity or death.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins ordered the Shelby County Election Commission to allow voters with incomplete voter registration applications to<a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/2018/10/25/shelby-county-voter-registration-fixes-ordered-chancellor/1765176002/"> fix deficiencies and vote regularly</a> on Election Day. According to <em>The Commercial Appeal</em>, it’s a system already being used during early voting, but one the commission has said is unfeasible and even inconsistent with state law if used on Election Day. On Wednesday, the<a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2018/10/31/shelby-county-memphis-voting-court-halts-injunction-against-election-commission/1835485002/"> Court of Appeals</a> of Tennessee halted most of the injunction saying that those with incomplete registrations will cast provisionals.</p>
<p>Also in Tennessee, District Judge Thomas Parker has dismissed an effort to have the Department of Security conduct a cybersecurity assessment of Shelby County’s<a href="https://dailymemphian.com/article/921/Federal-court-dismisses-challenge-aimed-at-voting-machines"> touch-screen voting machines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> According to <em>The Monitor</em>, The appeal of a judge’s ruling to<a href="https://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_5ce73d70-d800-11e8-9c99-17cd9a90fcab.html"> void the Mission mayoral June runoff</a> will be accelerated, the 13th court of appeals ruled Monday, allowing the case to take precedence. The original case revolves around allegations of illegal vote harvesting.</p>
<p>The Dallas County, GOP has filed a lawsuit targeting an unknown number of<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2018-elections/2018/10/31/dallas-republicans-file-lawsuit-casting-suspicion-mail-ballots-democrats-deny-voter-fraud"> mail-in ballots</a> saying that they are likely fraudulent. According to the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>, the reason, Republicans allege in a lawsuit, is that Democratic former state Rep. Terri Hodge, a felon, assisted voters on a large number of absentee ballots.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Jeffrey Hartman, 73 of Westminster, Maryland pleaded guilty to<a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2018/10/27/voter-fraud-investigation-results-in-conviction-in-morgan-county/"> voting illegally</a> in Morgan County, West Virginia.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Website Security</strong>: A new<a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/executive-perspectives/state-county-authorities-fail-at-midterm-election-internet-security/"> study</a> by McAffee found that counties in more than a dozen swing states have<a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/swing-state-county-websites-lack-security-mcafee-finds"> elections websites that lack basic security measures</a> and are not identified as government related. “We found that large majorities of county websites use top level domain names such as .com, .net and .us rather than the government validated .gov in their web addresses,” the study found after examining 20 swing states. “Our findings essentially revealed that there is no official U.S. governing body validating whether the majority of county websites are legitimately owned by actual legitimate county entities.”</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong>:<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/25/660436884/long-line-to-vote-a-pizza-delivery-service-will-send-a-pie-to-crowded-polling-pl"> Pizza to the Polls</a> uses social media to determine if and where there are lines forming at voting locations and then they will send pizzas to those folks waiting in line to vote. In 2016 the group raised about $40,000 to send pizzas to voters in line.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Assistants</strong>: Alexa, tell me where my polling place is. Amazon announced this week that it is<a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-election-data-midterms/#2tGDIeLrOsqo"> beefing up the Alexa’s knowledge</a> base of including where to vote, real-time results, and even explanations of ballot measures. Now you&#8217;ll be able to ask Alexa where your polling place is or who&#8217;s leading in any particular race, and it&#8217;ll respond with a real answer instead of just kicking you to a web search.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Oregon Elections Director Steve Trout met with officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security this week over a “huge increase” of<a href="https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-elections-director-says-government-seeing-huge-increase-in-phishing-attempts"> phishing attempts</a> in the elections office. &#8220;I probably had one or two phishing emails last year and I’ve probably had 12 to 15 in the last three or four months,&#8221; he told reporters during a news conference on Tuesday. Trout remains confident in the process though. &#8220;This election is the most accurate and secure that we’ve ever had in Oregon,&#8221; Trout said.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> A group of University of Texas professors enlisted the help of their students to create the<a href="http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2018/10/just-in-time-for-the-midterms-bevote-is-uts-nonpartisan-voting-mobile-app/"> BeVote app</a> to help students register to vote, find their polling places and be informed about election information. According to <em>Alcalde</em>, English Professor Hannah Wojciehowski, Associate Professor of Game Development Paul Toprac, and Strass Institute Director Susan Nold decided to find a way to engage students to vote. The trio signed up students in Natural Sciences, the School of Information, Fine Arts, and others to design and program a mobile app to enhance the voting experience for UT students.</p>
