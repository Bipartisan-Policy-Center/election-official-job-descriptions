							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Access denied<br />
</strong><em>Keeping voter sites secure while still keeping them accessible</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>Recently some Georgia voters living overseas attempted to access the state’s online voter registration database only to find that their access was denied.</p>
<p>Instead of access to the state’s online voter registration portal, overseas voters found an access denied warning along with contact information for assistance.</p>
<p>In an effort to secure the state’s website and OVR database, the<a href="http://sos.ga.gov/"> Georgia secretary of state’s office</a> made the choice to block international IPs from accessing the voter registration portal on their website.</p>
<p>According to a spokeswoman for the secretary of state’s office, the portal will be open from Sept. 18 to Election Day.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of sympathy for the states on these issues because they are caught between wanting to make an increasing number of online services freely available to voters and an exponential escalation in threats,” Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat of the<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/"> US Vote Foundation</a> and<a href="https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/home.htm"> Overseas Vote Foundation</a>. “Not too long ago, this was being done without problems like what they face now. The attacks from hostile foreign powers are very real. These attacks are very real and bots can bog down these open services with SPAM just so many times before a state will want to put barriers up.”</p>
<p>However, Dzieduszycka-Suinat cautioned that blocking foreign IP addresses and locking overseas voters out of their services is the wrong kind of barrier.</p>
<p>“It won&#8217;t really do anything to dissuade a hacker. It will only turn away real voters. A hacker, or even a determined voter, will just get onto a VPN and to a US IP address, and guess what? They&#8217;re in,” Dzieduszycka-Suinat said.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/"> Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> said that they reached out the Georgia secretary of state’s office for a better understanding of what was happening, but information appearing on social media is what concerned FVAP most rather than individual state policies.</p>
<p>“We are aware of reports that other states may also be limiting access to their websites from foreign-based IP addresses so we will continue to monitor social media. We are actively working to encourage states to leverage us as a key resource for access in light of any new cyber security protocols,” said FVAP Director David Beirne. “What will be especially interesting is to see if the impact of a whitelisting cybersecurity policy, or special access for known entities, will affect the ability of military and overseas voters to retrieve their electronic blank ballots &#8212; or if the impact is limited to online voter registration systems.”</p>
<p>The US Vote Foundation and Overseas Vote Foundation as well as FVAP portals remain open to overseas IPs. According to Beirne, FVAP leverages a content delivery network which provides duplicate web servers for U.S. and worldwide distribution to offset internet latency in other countries. FVAP also maintains a web application firewall to dynamically mitigate intrusion attempts.</p>
<p>We reached out to some of the states with the<a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/public-workforce-salaries/military-civilian-active-duty-employee-workforce-numbers-by-state.html"> highest percentages</a> of members of the armed services, and that offer online voter registration and the response was mixed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/">Virginia</a> Elections Commissioner Christopher Piper said that the commonwealth does not comment on specific election security protocols, however, quick check by a friend overseas, living in one of the former Soviet republics, found that Virginia’s online voter registration<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/index.html"> portal</a> remains accessible to overseas IP addresses.</p>
<p>According to Hillary Rudy with the<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado secretary of state’s office</a>, most international IPs have access to Colorado’s online voter registration site. Colorado does have network blocks in place on some nations due to a high volume of attacks coming from the region. The Colorado Department of State also blocks IP addresses attempting to attack its systems, no matter the source of the traffic, until the attack stops.</p>
<p><strong>Whitelisting and Blacklisting</strong><br />
One way that states can secure their sites—and some are already employing—is whitelisting and blacklisting.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2018/07/whitelisting-may-be-future-system-security"> FedTech</a>, the use of<a href="https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-google-blacklist"> blacklisting</a> as a form of cybersecurity protection is common, but it requires ­security ­personnel to keep a permanent eye out for any ­malware they want to block from an agency’s IT ­environment.<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1728/whitelist"> Whitelisting</a> lets IT teams grant advance permission for specific, trusted items (such as applications or URLs) to run on the network, instead of blocking access to previously identified risks and threats.</p>
<p>Colorado employs both.</p>
<p>“We use whitelisting based on known users as well as blacklisting of known malicious IPs. Whitelisting and blacklisting is done both by in-house staff and through threat intelligence platforms,” Rudy explained. “The cost to a jurisdiction of using automated threat sharing feeds is dependent not only on the cost of the feed itself (in our case, approximately $10,000 annually), but also based on the ability of technical infrastructure to ingest or consume those feeds and apply them automatically.”</p>
<p>Beirne from FVAP said that whitelisting versus blacklisting isn’t an either/or proposition and that FVAP would also offer that neither is a single solution to cybersecurity, but both operate as part of a comprehensive approach. Whitelisting conveys a sense of limiting access which is accurate for more sensitive areas of a website.  Blacklisting is a recognition of known bad actors or those of a particular reputation.</p>
<p>Beirne said it’s important to recognize the need for an audit of traffic prior to whatever form of security it implemented.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that whitelisting holds value, but the relative benefit needs to be weighed against the relative cost of limiting access,” Beirne said. “For example, an audit of web traffic historically can help identify the need for blacklisting against known bad actors and only whitelist those portions of a website that require a deeper level of privileged access to some portion of a system on the backend.”</p>

														<p>According to Common Cause all<a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2018/aug/30/white-house-agrees-to-destroy-documents-collected-by-kobach-led-commission/"> sensitive voter registration information</a> gathered by the now-defunct Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has been destroyed in accordance to an agreement between the Administration and Common Cause.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s now-disbanded voter fraud Commission was flawed from the start,” Paul Seamus Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation of Common Cause, said in a statement. “Common Cause and its 1.2 million members celebrate the end of this litigation and the destruction of the commission’s illegally collected voter data.”</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Fallout from the September 4 primary in Maricopa County continued this week. A report from the <em>Arizona Republic</em> noted that some voters were denied the right to vote because they presented<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/08/31/arizona-elections-maricopa-county-tribal-ids-not-accepted-some-polling-places/1140311002/"> tribal IDs</a>, although those IDs are acceptable under Arizona law. Analysis has shown that the delayed openings in Maricopa County affected 95 precincts and as many as<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/08/31/maricopa-county-recorder-voting-issues-polling-place-machines-malfunction-fontes-arizona-primary/1150414002/"> 270,000 voters</a>. On Tuesday, Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes posted a<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/04/maricopa-county-recorder-adrian-fontes-facebook-live-comments-election-day-vote-problems/1197767002/"> video</a> to Facebook Live apologizing for the problems. The county has approved $200,000 to<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-09-05/county-to-consider-audit-of-arizona-voting-problems"> audit</a> the election.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong><a href="https://www.atholdailynews.com/Election-2018-19925235"> Turn-out</a> on Massachusetts post-Labor Day primary was higher than expected, but the higher turnout did not seem to impact operations, which, for the most part, were smooth in the commonwealth. With only a few dozens votes separating candidates in a Democratic primary for a U.S. House seat, the secretary of state’s office ordered all ballots<a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Ballots-in-tight-Massachusetts-House-race-are-ordered-sealed-19965335"> impounded</a> in anticipation of a recount. In<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_32117287/lowell-clerk-about-100-counted-ballots-not-included"> Lowell</a>, about 100 votes cast at one polling place were not included in the unofficial election totals. Human error resulted in the wrong reporting of results from<a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/09/how_one_two-time_incumbent_was.html"> Fitchburg</a> City. In<a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/newton/newton-voter-turnout-heat-malfunctions"> Newton</a>, heat caused some issues for poll workers, including machine malfunctions.</p>

														<p><strong>The U.S Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina</strong> has<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article217846725.html"> subpoenaed voter records from the state board of elections and 44 counties</a>. The SBOE, the subpoena came at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>, among the state records from Jan. 1, 2010 through Aug. 30, 2018 that were requested: all voter registration applications, federal write-in absentee ballots, federal post card applications, early-voting application forms, provisional voting forms, absentee ballot request forms, all “admission or denial of non-citizen return forms,” and all voter registration cancellation or revocation forms. The request includes executed official ballots, including vote-by-mail and early ballots that are traceable to the voters who cast them. One local election official told the Outer Banks News that the request would be “<a href="https://outerbanksvoice.com/2018/09/05/feds-subpoena-dare-currituck-42-other-countys-voting-records/">devastating</a>” to preparations for the midterms.</p>
<p><strong>Elections officials in Hawaii do just about everything they can</strong> to get residents registered to vote. They set up booths at festivals and on college campuses and send staff to the monthly naturalization ceremonies with registration forms in hand. But, according to an article in the Honolulu Civil Beat, the one thing you won’t hear the officials tell anyone is to actually go vote. “It’s not on us.<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2018/09/why-the-hawaii-elections-office-doesnt-do-more-to-encourage-voting/"> We can’t send out the message to go vote</a>,” elections office spokeswoman Nedielyn Bueno told the<em> Civil Beat</em>. “It’s important for folks to know how to do it, it’s up to the individual to know, ‘I’m ready to vote.’” Bueno also noted that it’s not possible for the state to use federal funds to promote voting and that the office has unsuccessfully requested state funds in the past to boost its voter education efforts</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, you just have to spend some money</strong>. This week the Cerro Gordo, Iowa auditor’s office announced that it would spend $4,425 to retain RBM Election Support Services through the general election in November. The company will<a href="http://www.kimt.com/content/news/Cerro-Gordo-Co-auditors-office-retaining-on-site-support-during-November-election-492456401.html"> troubleshoot issues</a> during ballot processing, assisting poll workers, result posting, post-election processing, and assisting with equipment that processes ballots. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good use of taxpayer dollars to make sure our elections are good and clean elections. It&#8217;s imperative to democracy,&#8221; Mark Suby of Mason City told KIMT.</p>

He was 93. Riley was known as the “father of vote-by-mail” in Oregon elections. “His leadership, practices and policies are still in place today, 30 years after leaving office,” Roger Nyquist, Linn County Board of Commissioners chairman told the <em>Albany Democrat-Herald</em>. “The standard that Del set in Linn County government will be in place for a long time.” Current Linn County Clerk Steve Druckenmiller told the paper Riley&#8217;s pursuit of a vote-by-mail system for Oregon “changed the way elections are held in a profound way. He took a lot of ridicule, but was a visionary and changed the face of elections in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, many counties in Utah and California. This movement is growing nationally and that is thanks to Del.” He ran for the Linn County Clerk’s position in November 1966, was elected and took office in January 1967. He held the position for 18 years.</p>

														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The State of Arizona has<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-agrees-to-make-amends-to-disenfranchised-voters/"> reached an agreement</a> with several groups including Mi Familia Vota, Promise Arizona and the League of Women Voters of Arizona who had threatened to sue over about 300,000 potential voters who weren’t offered a required chance to register to vote when they contacted the state’s Department of Economic Security or the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. Affected voters will get a bilingual letter explaining that they should have been offered the chance to register to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Mark walker heard arguments this week over whether or not 32 Florida counties should provide<a href="http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Federal-Judge-considers-suit-to-require-bilingual-ballots-in-32-counties-492535521.html"> bilingual ballots</a> for the November elections. The suit was brought by Mi Familia and other organizations on behalf of the influx of Puerto Rican voters the state has seen since Hurricane Maria. A coalition of counties argued before Walker that there simply is not time to provide the ballots in Spanish.

														<p><strong>California:</strong> This week the California Department of Motor Vehicles announced that it sent the secretary of state’s office 23,000<a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article217891745.html"> erroneous voter registration records. Accor</a>ding to the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, the DMV said the errors stem from technicians toggling between multiple screens and registration information being improperly merged. According to the agency, 1,600 residents did not complete a voter registration affidavit and had their information sent to the secretary of state, which maintains the state’s list of registered voters.  In some cases, people were registered in the wrong party. Some customers who wished to opt out of the program were added. The department said the inaccurate customer information largely affected “voter preferences such as, vote-by-mail options, language and political party selections.”</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> A second company (Hart InterCivic) that lost a bid to provide<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/technology/article217702960.html"> new voting machines</a> to the state of Louisiana has sent a letter to the Office of State Procurement supporting a letter sent by another losing bidder.

Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax told <em>The Oklahoman</em> it&#8217;s a good first step toward implementation of the state&#8217;s online voter registration system, which is still years away. &#8220;We have been testing this significantly over the past few weeks. We also had the (Oklahoma) Cyber Command test this for security, and it passed muster with them last week,&#8221; Ziriax said during a meeting of the board on Tuesday according to the paper. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been wanting online voter registration for a long time. While this is not full-blown online voter registration, it&#8217;s still a big step forward in modernizing elections in Oklahoma and I&#8217;m very happy to be moving forward with it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: As a result of what’s being called<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180831/5000-ri-voter-records-caught-in-computer-glitch"> an IT snafu</a> with the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles’ automatic voter registration system, the new and updated voter registration records of at least 5,000 people were not processed. According to the <em>Providence Journal</em>, there was an issue with “missing fields” in the program that transfers the information from the DMV to the secretary of state’s office. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea asked the state board of elections to<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180905/ri-elections-board-oks-late-additions-to-voter-rolls-after-registration-snafu"> include those voters</a> on the rolls for next week’s primary.</p>
