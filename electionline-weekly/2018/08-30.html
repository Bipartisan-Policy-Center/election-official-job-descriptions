							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>News Analysis: Class is in session<br />
</strong><em>From coursework to security audits colleges are electing to help</em></p>
<p>This weekend marks the unofficial end of summer (sob) and co-eds across the country are headed back to ivy-covered campuses (if they aren’t already there) for another academic year.</p>
<p>While places like<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/D3P"> Harvard</a>, the<a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/cspg-initiatives/election-academy"> University of Minnesota</a> and the<a href="https://voter.engr.uconn.edu/voter/about%20us/"> University of Connecticut</a> have been working with state and local elections officials for a while now, a new crop of elections-related programs are popping up at campuses across the country.</p>
<p>This is just a snapshot of some of the partnerships and programs we’ve seen pop up over the summer. If you know about one that we missed, let us know.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted<a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/media-center/press-releases/2018/2018-07-12/#gref"> announced a collaboration</a> between the secretary of state’s office and Ohio’s community colleges.</p>
<p>“To maintain the integrity of our elections, we must constantly be working at both the state and local levels to innovate and improve our elections security measures,” Secretary Husted said. “While this can sometimes be a daunting task, Ohio’s two-year colleges are well-positioned and have the expertise to help us achieve these goals.”</p>
<p>Counties will be able to spend some of their HAVA 2018 funds to pay local community colleges help guide and assist them in complying with cybersecurity requirements.</p>
<p>“Federal entities like the National Security Agency (NSA) and the DHS are realizing the many ways two-year colleges can assist in reducing cyber vulnerability and enhancing data security,” said Jack Hershey, President and CEO of the Ohio Association of Community Colleges. “Several of Ohio’s community colleges have already stepped up to the plate to take active roles in this effort.”</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/local/clark-state-election-board-team-protect-ballots/A0eCZMV6Dx5fnR147nbL5I/"> Clark County</a> board of elections and Clark State Community College were one of the first to announce a partnership.</p>
<p>“We will assist them with a cybersecurity audit of their equipment, software and their election equipment to ensure proper security standards,” Clark State Cybersecurity Professor Dan Heighton told the Springfield News-Sun. “We are auditing their currently existing equipment to make sure they meet industry standards.”</p>
<p>In Indiana,<a href="https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/ball-state-program-teaching-security-to-election-officials"> Ball State University</a> has partnered with the secretary of state’s office to provide training to elections officials in security procedures. The Certificate Program in Election Administration, Technology and Security will welcome its first 21 students this fall. The program will welcome new students every six months and is open to county clerks, election officials and those who want to do those jobs in the future.</p>
<p>“Today’s election official really needs to be an information technology specialist, unlike in the days without electronic equipment,” program co-director Bryan Byers told WFYI.</p>
<p>Hendricks County Elections Clerk Tammy Dooley will be part of the<a href="http://www.flyergroup.com/news/local_news/dooley-selected-for-election-security-class/article_4d9662e5-0d99-5444-bc58-6ecf82ba8710.html"> inaugural class</a> at Ball State.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be chosen to participate in the CEATS program,&#8221; Dooley told the Hendricks County Flyer. &#8220;This program will help me to be more proficient in a number of areas, for example, election and procedural law, personnel training and management, and cybersecurity just to name a few. This program is the first in the state that meets such a diverse need to aid election administrators in adapting to an ever-changing election environment to better serve the voters of our community.”</p>
<p>The secretary of state’s office is providing grants of up to $2,500 to attend the courses.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy announced the creation of the new<a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/harris-public-policy-announces-first-its-kind-initiative-inform-cyber-policy"> Cyber Policy Initiative</a> (CPI). According to the university, the academic initiative will advance the emerging field of cyber policy and examine the intersection of national security, politics and technology.</p>
<p>CPI’s first collaboration was at DEF CON’s Voting Village where they provided free cybersecurity training to state and local elections officials.</p>
<p>Teaching the next generation</p>
<p>While many of the partnerships mentioned are programs where colleges and universities work directly with state and local elections officials, there are also a few programs out there teaching the next generation a thing or two about elections and election administration.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital-democracy"> University of Michigan</a> offers a course to students called Security Digital Democracy. According to the write up of the course, taught by Associate Professor J. Alex Halderman, “…[i]n this course, you&#8217;ll learn what every citizen should know about the security risks&#8211;and future potential — of electronic voting and Internet voting. We&#8217;ll take a look at the past, present, and future of election technologies and explore the various spaces intersected by voting, including computer security, human factors, public policy, and more.</p>
<p>And it’s not just all election security and training.<a href="http://news.wjct.org/post/unique-fsu-course-explores-floridas-legal-battle-over-felon-voting-rights-it-unfolds"> Florida State University</a> is offering a course that covers the state’s ongoing legal battle over felons’ voting rights. According to WJCT, the class of about 20 students is open to graduate and undergrad students. It brings in students from the Colleges of Law, Social Work, and Social Sciences and Public Policy.</p>
<p>Mark Schlakman, senior program director of the FSU Law School’s Center for Advancement of Human Rights told the local television station that the idea of the class was to have students, whose fields of study are related to the issue, discuss it as the legal battle unfolds.</p>
<p>The class also relies on guest speakers who are familiar with the judicial system and voting rights. During one class, Leon County Sheriff Walk McNeil discussed the impacts of recidivism.</p>
<p>“One of the things that, as I talked to those persons who were coming back, is that, there is no hope,” McNeil said. “When you take hope away from a person, and you say, ‘You are forever not a citizen of your community, because you don’t have the fundamental right of every citizen.’”</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>According to several published reports, it was at the behest of the Administration that the<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-blocks-bill-protect-elections-173459278.html"> Secure Elections Act</a> was held up. According to Yahoo News, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, “We cannot support legislation with inappropriate mandates or that moves power or funding from the states to Washington for the planning and operation of elections,” she added. However, the White House gave no specifics on what parts of the bill it objected to.</p>
<p>Officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, Microsoft and Facebook<a href="https://statescoop.com/feds-facebook-and-microsoft-brief-state-election-officials-on-cyberthreats"> held a call with state elections officials</a> last week to brief them on the latest threats to voting systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the 2018 midterms just around the corner everyone in the election and cybersecurity community must remain vigilant,&#8221; Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos, who leads the National Association of Secretaries of State, said in a DHS press release. &#8220;It is clear that Secretaries of State, state election officials, federal agencies and private sector partners are working diligently together to defend against foreign threats in order to protect our democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden’s (D-Oregon) bill that would require all states to provide paper ballots/backups picked up two key endorsements this week. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Kamala Harris (D-California) have both signed on as co-sponsors of the<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-only-election-security-bill-that-matters-picks-up-t-1828698233"> Protecting American Votes and Elections (PAVE) Act</a>.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> State elections officials are investigating<a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2018/08/27/palpable-evidence-of-voter-fraud-in-primary-election/"> irregularities with absentee ballots</a> in one Anchorage House race. Included in the questionable ballots are seven absentees requested in the names of dead people. According to Alaska Public Radio, officials first noticed the irregularities before the August 21 primary and their review of the ballots in that has continued. In addition to ballots for dead voters, two ballots were requested and cast although the voters said that they did not request, nor cast the ballots. “The integrity of our elections is vital to our democracy,” Josie Bahnke, the state elections director, said in the statement to APM. “The division will continue to look into this matter throughout the week and remove any ballots that we determine should not be counted.”</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> There may be 15 counties in Arizona, but most of the news from primary day 2018 came from one—<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/28/arizona-election-officials-blame-insight-enterprises-voting-problems/1125974002/">Maricopa</a>. As of 6 a.m. Tuesday when polls were scheduled to open, 62 sites were not operational. All sites were eventually up and running by 11 a.m. The secretary of state’s office had sought to<a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/primary-election-arizona-polling-10763135"> keep polling sites open later</a> than the 7 p.m. close, but the county’s board of supervisors denied the request. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes placed the blame squarely at the feet of Insight Enterprises, a Tempe-based contractor that had been hired to set up voter check-in equipment who Fontes claimed did not send enough technicians to set up. According to <em>The Arizona Republic</em>, Fontes and the company are odd overs the number. Fontes claimed the company was hired to send 103 technicians, the company claims it was contracted for 83 for set up. A document The Arizona Republic obtained from the county Wednesday reveals some of the problems could have stemmed partly from a<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/29/maricopa-county-election-issues-may-have-stemmed-misunderstanding-lack-backup-plan/1138905002/"> misunderstanding</a> between the Maricopa County Recorder&#8217;s Office and the contractor it hired to set up electronic voting systems at the polls. The county’s board of supervisors chairman has ordered an<a href="http://www.azfamily.com/story/38990224/maricopa-county-board-of-supervisors-chairman-orders-audit-contractor-responds-to-claims-they-didnt-do-their-job"> audit</a> of the election to find what exactly went wrong. Although election day is over, that doesn’t mean the election is over and<a href="https://news.azpm.org/p/news-articles/2018/8/29/136057-thousands-of-mail-in-provisional-ballots-remain-uncounted-in-pima-county/"> Pima County</a> still has about 19,000 mail-in ballots at the recorder’s office awaiting verification. In the<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2018/08/28/gaynor-holds-healthy-lead-over-incumbent-reagan-for-secretary-of-state/"> race for secretary of state</a>, Republican incumbent Michele Reagan was defeated by businessman Steve Gaynor who will face Democrat Katie Hobbs in the general.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Although it was a rainy day in parts of the Sunshine State, that didn’t stop voters from<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/08/28/primary-voter-turnout-nears-2-million-will-easily-break-2014-total/"> turning out</a> in large numbers and while there were<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/08/28/minor-problems-reported-at-a-small-number-of-florida-polling-locations/"> minor problems</a> reported at a small number of polling locations, the large turnout did not lead to long lines and frustration. In<a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/video/news/breaking-ballot-issues-reported-at-some-polling-locations-in-duval-county/77-8233865"> Duval County</a>, ballots were wider than what the scanning machine would accept. The problem affected about<a href="https://www.wokv.com/news/local/some-duval-county-ballots-not-being-accepted-precinct-machines/CwvnjF3xJcOTnmDRfIFR5K/"> 1,700 ballots</a>. One voter in<a href="https://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/local-govt--politics/new-some-minor-glitches-complaints-palm-beach-county-voting-sites/y0aed8lExb1XA4WCXdLijP/"> Palm Beach County</a> was originally turned away because he was a no party voter, even though he should have been allowed to vote for judicial races. He was eventually able to vote. After a snafu about her address, one<a href="https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2018/08/28/fort-myers-voting-day-issue-leaves-voter-unable-cast-ballot/1126027002/"> Lee County</a> woman was unable to vote. One<a href="http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Local-residents-name-mistakenly-removed-from-voting-list--491930341.html"> Leon County</a> voter was unable to vote because they were mistakenly removed from the voter rolls. In<a href="http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20180829/ballot-mix-up-shuts-out-10-voters-from-daytona-beach-commission-race"> Volusia County</a>, a ballot mix-up in Daytona Beach mean that 10 voters who live within Zone 1 were unable to vote in the city commissioner’s race. And finally, in<a href="http://www.newsherald.com/news/20180829/goat-vote-panama-city-man-brings-goat-to-vote-in-florida-primary"> Bay County</a>, one Florida Man showed up at his Panama City polling place with his emotional support goat in tow to cast his ballot. According to the News Herald, the goat remained outside while the resident voted. We are very, very sad to report that there seem to be no photos of the goat at the polling place.</p>
<p><strong>Guam:</strong> Residents of the island territory of Guam went to the polls for their primary on Saturday and Guam Election Commission Executive Director Maria Pangelinan said although there were<a href="https://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2018/08/25/no-major-election-problems-says-guam-election-commission-director/1093828002/"> some minor problems</a>, like precinct officials not reading the instruction cards to voters and a curbside voter who had to wait to vote, overall things went well. There were<a href="https://www.guampdn.com/story/news/local/elections-2018/2018/08/26/gec-starts-tabulate-ballots-guams-primary-election/1097630002/"> two formal complaints</a> filed with the GEC though, one about electioneering and other regarding a provisional ballot. Pangelinan said both issues would be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> ES&amp;S and Johnson County officials are<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article217387680.html"> blaming faulty software code</a> for the delayed reporting of results during the August 7 primary. “The slow reporting of results was unacceptable and we apologize,” Tom Burt, president and CEO of Election Systems &amp; Software, said in a statement Monday. “We know the election office and other Johnson County government leaders put their faith in us and we let down our valued partners.”</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> According to The Timberjay, St. Louis County officials are requiring that Tower City Clerk-Treasurer Linda Keith<a href="http://www.timberjay.com/stories/county-orders-elections-re-training-for-tower-clerk,14321"> undergo elections re-training</a> in Duluth after a county investigation revealed a host of significant errors, violations of state law, and failures to follow election procedures during the Aug. 14 primary. “The additional training is necessary due to the severity and number of issues identified during the investigation,” wrote St. Louis County Deputy Auditor Phil Chapman, who supervises elections for the county.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> The biggest issue that seemed to arise during Tuesday’s primary runoff was a Bible quote that referenced “the left” and “the right” on a sign outside of a<a href="https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/elections/church-changes-message-on-sign-outside-polling-place-after-complaints/article_f804e072-0f3d-5fe4-bc53-16337862bd0a.html"> Tulsa County</a> polling place. After the county reached out to the church with complaints about the sign, the church changed the sign so it simply read “Vote!”</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina:</strong> During a special election runoff this week voters in parts of<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article217436975.html"> Richland County</a> faced delays when voting machines in about a dozen precincts had problems. Voters were offered paper ballots instead.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Clerks across the state of Michigan have been receiving requests</strong> from a mystery organization that<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/24/michigan-ballots-foia-presidential-election/1083737002/"> wants copies of all the ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election</a>. According to <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>, clerks across Michigan are reporting receiving identical Freedom of Information Act requests seeking copies of the ballots and other records from the election. The FOIA requests come from someone named Emily, no last name given, with the United Action Group. A New York post office post is listed along with a phone number and email address. &#8220;It’s unnerved a lot of the clerks,&#8221; Michigan Director of Elections Sally Williams told the paper, &#8220;Rightfully so. I’m hoping we find out a little bit more about these requesters and what they’re seeking to do.” In addition to election day ballots, the FOIA request also seeks absentee ballots, envelopes the absentee ballots were mailed in, records listing the names of voters who requested absentee ballots and provisional ballots, both counted and uncounted. Williams has reached out to other states, but no one else seems to have received such a request. The Detroit News is reporting that<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/08/28/voting-nonprofit-sent-mystery-foias-michigan/1120399002/"> Priorities USA Foundation</a> contracted a third party to send the public record request.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate recently announced</strong> that<a href="https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/iowa-adds-tribal-ids-as-approved-voter-identification/article_180265d8-0205-5f18-8eda-593ab43f0b26.html"> Tribal ID cards</a> from will be accepted for voter and election day registration. “After meeting with a representative of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa and learning more about the tribal enrollment process and tribal identification documents, I felt confident recommending to the Legislature that tribal identification cards be considered proof of identity at the polls on Election Day,” Secretary Pate said. “The Sac and Fox Tribe has been a great partner in this process, and I want to thank them for their willingness to discuss this issue and for providing my staff with a copy of a tribal ID card to place on our educational materials.”</p>
<p><strong>Ride-sharing program Lyft announced last week</strong> that it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/lyft-is-offering-reduced-and-free-rides-on-election-day/"> will offer half-priced and free rides to polling places</a> on November 6. According to <em>Tech Crunch</em>, Lyft said that it’s going to give out 50 percent off promotional codes to partners that encourage turnout like Vote.org, Nonprofit VOTE and TurboVote. On the day of the election the company said it will also provide a product integration that will help voters find their polling places to make it even easier to cast their ballot.</p>
<p><strong>The people behind the March For Our Lives have come up with</strong> a unique way to get people registered to vote. The group is selling t-shirts with an American flag on the front and the area that is usually blue with white stars is actually<a href="http://www.qrcodepress.com/american-students-design-qr-code-merchandise-for-upcoming-midterm-elections/8535086/"> QR code that will automatically take someone to a portal to register to vote online</a> once it’s scanned. According to <em>QR Code Press</em>, the shirt was designed by Jammal Lemmy, a former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkview, Florida. The idea to add technology, according to Lemy, occurred by accident. He happened to be working on t-shirt graphics of American flags and<a href="http://www.qrcodepress.com/greater-change-qr-codes-could-help-homeless-people-in-the-uk/8535021/"> advertorials featuring QR codes</a> at the same time and decided to combine them. We think this is a pretty cool idea and can only imagine how else QR codes could be used to get folks registered and then out to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon Secretary of State Dennis Richardson</strong> (R) released a<a href="https://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/404665-302421-secretary-of-state-dennis-richardson-says-hes-still-on-job-despite-fatigue"> video update about his health</a> this week. Richardson, 69, was diagnosed with brain cancer in June but has remained on the job throughout. &#8220;Other than feeling tired, please know that I&#8217;m doing well as I fight this illness,&#8221; he said.

Voters would have two days before the election results are certified to return a valid signature.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: After a three-judge panel removed<a href="https://www.wral.com/former-gop-governors-call-on-legislature-to-drop-amendments/17792238/"> two constitutional amendments</a> from the November ballot, last week the House passed new language for the amendments in an attempt to get them back on the ballot. One of the amendments sets up a new State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Litigation</strong>: The Brennan Center has sued the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that DOJ failed to produce many documents concerning voter registration that the Center had sought through a<a href="https://www.nyunews.com/2018/08/26/news-nyu-law-brennan-center-lawsuit-against-us-department-of-justice/"> FOIA request</a> more than a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes has upheld the state’s 2016 law that<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article217363755.html"> bans groups from collecting early mail-in ballots from voters</a> and delivering them. The plaintiff in the case said that her free-speech rights were being violated by the ban, but Rayes saw it differently and said he found little evidence that Congress intended to rule out state laws such as this one. An<a href="http://www.azfamily.com/story/38976829/appeal-filed-over-ruling-on-collection-of-mail-in-ballots"> appeal</a> has been filed.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Gershwin Drain has denied the state’s emergency motion to prevent voters from casting<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-allows-straight-party-voting-in-michigan/"> straight-ticket ballots</a>. On August 1, the Detroit federal court issued a permanent injunction against the law. The secretary of state’s office appealed the ruling and requested the emergency stay.</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, Promote the Vote, organizers of a<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/michigan/articles/2018-08-29/lawsuit-seeks-placement-of-voting-measure-on-michigan-ballot"> ballot initiative</a> that would allow for same-day voter registration as well as no-excuse absentee voting have filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding their initiative be placed on the November ballot. According to the <em>Associated Press</em>, the plaintiffs accuse state election officials of improperly rejecting 24 &#8220;incomplete&#8221; signatures included in a 500-signature random sample of 432,000 that were submitted in July.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Superior Court Judge Stuart Minkowitz has ruled that the<a href="http://www.njherald.com/20180826/vernon-must-pay-county-to-program-voting-machines"> costs of programming electronic voting machines</a> at primary election polling places are a municipality’s responsibility and not the county’s. According to the <em>New Jersey Herald</em>, Minkowitz’s decision was prompted by Vernon&#8217;s refusal to pay a $2,863.80 bill from the Sussex County Board of Elections for costs accrued in the run-up to last year&#8217;s primary.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Nineteen foreign nationals ranging from age 26 to 71 have been<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/north-carolina-illegal-voters.html"> charged with illegally voting</a> in the November 2016 election in North Carolina, the Justice Department announced. Nine of the 19 were also charged with falsely claiming American citizenship to get on voter rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> In a written opinion, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said that<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2018/08/28/election-judges-can-carry-guns-polling-places-ag-ken-paxton-says-new-opinion"> election judges will be permitted to carry guns</a> at polling places. Election judges in Texas aren’t poll workers per se but, according to the <em>Dallas Morning-News</em>, the “final arbiter in case of a dispute in the outcome a race. The election judge is also required by law to “preserve order” and “prevent breaches of the peace” at their polling place.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The Utah Supreme Court decided Friday that the<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/08/24/utah-supreme-court-deals/"> Count My Vote initiative</a> will not appear on the Nov. 6 ballot, rejecting arguments that the state’s referendum process is unconstitutionally tilted and unfair. According to <em>The Salt Lake Tribune</em>, Count My Vote collected more than 132,000 verified voter signatures to qualify initially for the ballot, but opponents torpedoed it by convincing a relatively small amount of people in two Senate districts to withdraw signatures during a 30-day review window.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The Washington Supreme Court has ruled that Initiative 940 may appear on the November ballot. Counties had been unable to begin work on<a href="http://www.dailysunnews.com/news/2018/aug/29/ballots-be-printed-time/"> producing and printing ballots</a> while awaiting the court ruling.</p>
