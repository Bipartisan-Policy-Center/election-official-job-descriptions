							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>FVAP release its 2017 Annual Report</strong><br /><em>Report provides assessment of 2017 efforts and plans for 2018</em></p>
<p>The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) has released its 2017 <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Reports/TabB_2017Report_20180301_v10_Final.pdf">Annual Report</a> to the President and Congress.</p>
<p>The report provides an assessment of FVAP’s activities supporting the special elections for federal office in 2017 &#8212; and FVAP’s preparations for the 2018 election cycle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much of FVAP&#8217;s 2017 activities represent an examination of the 2017 election cycle, and how we&#8217;re enhancing our products and services for 2018,” said David Beirne, director of FVAP. “We take tremendous pride in hearing stories about how election officials leverage our online tools, training resources, policy support, and marketing materials to help our military and overseas citizens while saving their own valuable resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using lessons learned since the 2016 election cycle, FVAP further explored how to reduce obstacles by improving its resources throughout the Department of Defense, establishing mechanisms to expand voter awareness, and enhancing measures of effectiveness to refine its research approach to identify exactly what challenges remain with UOCAVA voters.</p>
<p>Obstacles to UOCAVA voter success vary depending on the voter’s location, access to resources, training opportunities, and the availability of voter assistance. To reduce these obstacles, FVAP made progress in the following key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving key absentee voting forms – FVAP made key adjustments to its registration and ballot request form and absentee backup ballot using a combination of form development best practices, focus groups, and public comment.</li>
<li>Realigned Voting Assistance Guide – to reflect changes to absentee voting forms, absentee voting instructions, and State and local election official contact information.</li>
<li>Enhanced FVAP.gov website and portal – improvements to site usability are ongoing based on comprehensive web analytics data and key site achievement metrics such as site visits and the number of form downloads.</li>
<li>Revamped training for Voting Assistance Officers (IVAO) – changes reflect greater content alignment across training modules and platforms.</li>
<li>Conducted Installation Voting Assistance Officer Workshops – this new training guided IVAOs in setting up Voting Assistance Offices that are in compliance with UOCAVA and Service instructions.</li>
<li>Initiated examination of alternative methods for roll out of IVA offices.</li>
<li>Enhanced customer service metrics to isolate trends among voters, election officials, and Service members submitting inquiries to the FVAP call center.</li>
</ul>
<p>FVAP’s efforts in 2017 effectively set the foundation for execution of its voting assistance program across the Department for 2018 as well as possible longer term enhancements for 2020. FVAP will continue to monitor and measure how these changes effectively reduce obstacles to voting success throughout the 2018 election cycle</p>
<p>&#8220;Research and data were major themes within the 2017 Report to Congress,” Beirne said. “I&#8217;m very proud of the data and research we&#8217;ve been able to conduct, due in part to successful relationships with fellow government agencies, our cooperative agreement with the Council of State Governments, and election officials. As the Report to Congress summarized FVAP&#8217;s path going forward, the election community can continue to rely on FVAP for quality UOCAVA research and data.&#8221; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>II. Federal-State Updates</p>
<p>According to CNN, in a letter sent to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), the highest-ranking Democrats on the House Oversight, Judiciary, Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and House Administration committees have asked Ryan to intervene in their ongoing efforts to get the Department of Homeland Security to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/politics/election-hacking-letter-ryan-dems/index.html">turn over documents</a> related to the targeting of state election-related systems by Russian hackers.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security is giving states a chance to game out how they may respond to an election day cyberattack. According to Reuters, the department began its biennial “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/states-game-election-cyber-threats-in-homeland-security-drills">Cyber Storm</a>” exercises on this week, working with more than 1,000 “players” across the country, including state governments and manufacturers, to test how they would withstand a large-scale, coordinated cyberattack aimed at the U.S.’s critical infrastructure such as transportation systems and communications. This is the sixth time the program has run over three days. There are seven states participating.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>In what may come as news to some,</strong> the U.S. Postal Service has always <a href="http://www.nogalesinternational.com/news/confusion-over-voter-registration-at-post-offices/article_b9a41888-3ccb-11e8-b463-ff9911d126f2.html">prohibited the display of voter registration materials</a> in their local branches. It was certainly a surprise to Santa Cruz County, Arizona Recorder Suzanne Sainz who said she was flummoxed recently when a staff member tried to drop off voter registration materials at the post offices — as they’ve been doing for more than 20 years — and were told no. Sainz was told by a postal worker and local supervisor that the policy was new, however, Peter Haas, a spokesman for the USPS told the Nogales International that the materials have never been allowed. “It’s just unfortunate because everybody goes to the post office and it’s convenient for a lot of people,” Sainz told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla recently announced</strong> that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-teenagers-preregister-voting-1523032069-htmlstory.html">100,000 16- and 17-year-olds have pre-registered to vote</a> since the state kicked off a program to get them registered in 2016. “This is a big milestone,” Padilla said. “I’m optimistic it’s going to translate into action at the ballot box.” State officials reported that more than 10% of the total number of pre-registrations have come in just the last few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>After a protracted legal battle</strong>, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper (D) has finally appointed members to the <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/press-releases?udt_2226_param_detail=186">state board of elections</a> and to <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/press-releases?udt_2226_param_detail=188">all county boards of elections</a> including: <a href="https://ansonrecord.com/news/6303/new-anson-county-board-of-elections-members-sworn-in">Anson County</a>, <a href="https://www.goblueridge.net/">Ashe County</a>, <a href="http://www.brunswickbeacon.com/content/county-elections-board-members-appointed-officers-selected">Brunswick County</a>, <a href="http://www.morganton.com/news/state-appoints-burke-elections-board-members/article_c701a21c-33a6-11e8-bad4-87f4d13318a3.html">Burke County</a>, <a href="http://www.shelbystar.com/news/20180403/cleveland-county-election-board-sworn-in">Cleveland County</a>, <a href="https://outerbanksvoice.com/2018/04/06/ross-tillett-join-elms-warnecki-on-dare-board-of-elections/">Dare County</a>, <a href="http://www.rhinotimes.com/news/new-guilford-county-elections-board-breaks-election-business-log-jam/">Guilford County</a>, <a href="http://www.thepilot.com/news/governor-appoints-new-leadership-to-moore-county-board-of-elections/article_dbd60e5c-39dd-11e8-8a27-b3ca57904415.html">Moore County</a>, <a href="http://www.personcountylife.com/news/2018-04-11/Front_Page/Elections_board_adds_4th_member.html">Person County</a>, <a href="http://www.reflector.com/News/2018/03/31/Two-attorneys-two-mayors-make-up-new-Pitt-Co-elections-board.html">Pitt County</a>, <a href="http://www.tryondailybulletin.com/2018/04/06/polk-adds-fourth-member-to-local-board-of-elections/">Polk County</a>, <a href="http://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20180330/county-board-of-elections-adds-new-member-new-party">Randolph County</a>, <a href="https://www.yourdailyjournal.com/news/79750/richmond-county-elections-board-members-sworn-in">Richmond County</a>, <a href="https://www.robesonian.com/news/109561/elections-board-take-oath">Robeson County</a>, <a href="https://www.clintonnc.com/news/28964/bass-to-lead-new-look-board">Sampson County</a>, <a href="https://www.laurinburgexchange.com/top-stories/14789/scotland-boe-adds-member">Scotland County</a>, <a href="http://www.shelbystar.com/news/20180330/faces-on-cleveland-county-elections-board-to-change">Shelby County</a>, <a href="https://www.mtairynews.com/news/60313/elections-board-members-announced">Surry County</a>, <a href="https://www.hcpress.com/news/new-watauga-board-elections-approves-early-voting-plan-may-8-primary-elections.html">Watauga County</a>, <a href="http://wilsontimes.com/stories/fourth-wilson-elections-board-member-sworn-in,120602">Wilson County</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-294">Observations on Voting Equipment Use and Replacement</a>&nbsp;&#8211; United States Government Accountability Office, April 11, 2018: This report focuses on voting equipment used during the 2016 general election; what factors jurisdictions consider when replacing voting equipment; and perspectives on federal voting system guidelines. Findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurisdictions with an estimated 63 percent of the population nationwide used optical or digital scan equipment as their main voting equipment, while jurisdictions with 32 percent of the population used DREs.</li>
<li>An estimated 93 percent of the population did not experience equipment errors or malfunctions on a very or somewhat common basis.</li>
<li>Four key factors were identified when jurisdictions consider replacing voting machines: meeting voting system standards and requirements; cost; maintenance considerations and timely vendor support; and overall performance of the equipment.</li>
<li>Stakeholders generally indicated the current voluntary federal voting system guidelines and related testing processes provide helpful guidance, cost savings, and assurance that certified equipment meets certain requirements. Some stakeholders expressed concern that parts of the guidelines could discourage development of innovative equipment. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which is responsible for developing the federal guidelines, is currently updating them with stakeholder input.</li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) has introduced legislation that would <a href="https://wamu.org/story/18/04/10/vote-16-d-c-bill-lower-voting-age-local-federal-elections/">lower the city’s voting age</a> to 16 for all local and federal elections. While other jurisdictions have lowered the voting age for local elections, DC would be the first to do the same for federal elections. There are currently about 12,000 16-and 17-year-olds in DC.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The Legislature has forwarded a bill to Gov. Jeff Colyer that would transfer control of <a href="http://www.cjonline.com/news/20180406/senate-house-adopts-bill-to-alter-election-budgeting-in-four-kansas-counties">election expenditures</a> in Shawnee, Sedgwick, Johnson and Wyandotte counties to the elected county commissions instead of the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> By a 7-2 vote, the House and Governmental Affairs committee has approved a bill that would allow felons on probation or parole to <a href="http://www.theadvocate.com/article_539eac3c-3dcb-11e8-a868-536f8b432a06.html">regain their right to vote</a> after a five year cleansing period following their release.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> A 17-17 vote has scuttle a last-minute attempt to resolve issues surrounding the <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/05/attempt-at-legislative-fix-for-ranked-choice-voting-falters-in-maine-senate/">implementation of ranked choice voting</a>. The joint order would have triggered a new bill to clarify that Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap is authorized to expend the funds necessary to conduct a ranked-choice primary. The bill also would have authorized Maine State Police, at Dunlap’s direction, to retrieve ballots as needed and return them to Augusta for a centralized tabulation by Dunlap – an additional step to determine winners in a ranked-choice vote.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-bill-that-allows-automatic-voter-registration-becomes-law-without-gov-hogans-signature/2018/04/06/fb506504-3995-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html?utm_term=.3b3888d15f43">Automatic voter registration</a> will be the law of land in the Old Line State in July 2019 even though Gov. Larry Hogan (R) did not sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, with just hours to go before the close of the 2018 legislative session, the General Assembly approved House Bill 1331 which requires the state administrator of elections to <a href="http://www.govtech.com/policy/Maryland-Lawmakers-Clear-Election-Security-Bill-as-Session-Closes.html">report security breaches</a> and significant attempted violations within a week of their discovery to the state board of elections, governor, legislative leaders and attorney general.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, the Rockville City Council unanimously voted to move city elections to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/rockville-becomes-first-city-in-maryland-to-adopt-mail-in-voting-system/2018/04/10/a2028982-3cba-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?utm_term=.e5b8f5f90f9c">vote-by-mail format</a> beginning on November 2019. The city made the moves in hopes of increasing voter turnout in local elections, which currently hovers around 15 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong>: For the eighth straight year, a bill that would have required Nebraskans to show a <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/for-eighth-year-voter-id-amendment-defeated-in-legislature/article_c37ed2e7-9242-58d4-9fbd-648eab411cec.html">photo ID</a> when voting has failed to move forward in enough time in the Legislature. State Sen. John Murante of Gretna, who <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/trio-of-bills-offer-options-for-enacting-voter-id-rules/article_5123446c-fbf0-11e7-9aa1-e3c93981a45a.html" target="_blank">introduced Legislative Resolution 1CA</a>, told the <em>Omaha World-News</em> he is exploring the possibility of going directly to voters via an initiative petition drive.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Nevadans for Election Reform have filed the “<a href="https://nevadansforelectionreform.org/greater-choice-greater-voice-initiative/">Greater Choice—Greater Voice</a>” initiative with the secretary of state’s office. The initiative seeks to replace the state’s current partisan closed primary system with a single election in November using ranked choice voting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Under A.10230, New York taxpayers would have the option to <a href="http://legislativegazette.com/persaud-ortiz-bill-would-provide-voter-registration-to-new-yorkers-through-tax-filings/">register to vote when submitting their state tax returns</a>. The legislation would also create additional security in elections by only allowing potential voters to register with the proper identification needed to file tax returns.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has vetoed Senate Bill 521 which would have required local registrars to <a href="http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Northam-vetoes-8-bills-including-2-related-to-voter-information-479299483.html">investigate the list of registered voters</a> whenever it exceeded the estimated number of people 18 and over.</p></p>

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Former Flagler County Supervisor of Elections <a href="http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20180405/former-flagler-elections-supervisor-kim-weeks-found-guilty-on-7-felony-counts">Kimberle Weeks</a> has been found guilty of seven felony charges. A jury found Weeks guilty on six counts for interception of wire communication and an indictment of disclosure of wire communication. Each of the third-degree felonies carry a maximum five-year prison sentence. Sentencing has been delayed to an undetermined date.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, Spiro Colaitis, 57, of Manhasset, New York has <a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2018/04/09/ny-man-charged-voter-fraud-after-casting-pensacola-vote/500468002/">charged with voting twice</a> in the 2016 election. Once in Florida, where he was charged and once in Nassau County, New York.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Officials in DuPage County officials announced this week that they plan to take legal action against Liberty Systems, LLC, one of the county’s <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180409/dupage-election-officials-to-take-legal-action-against-election-vendor">elections vendors</a> which caused election results to be delayed until late election night.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Justice Michaela Murphy announced this week that the Committee for <a href="http://www.wabi.tv/content/news/Ranked-voting-group-joins-lawsuit-against-Secretary-of-State-479186593.html">Ranked Choice Voting</a> can be a party to a lawsuit seeking to force Secretary of State Matt Dunlap to implement ranked choice voting in June. The <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/maine-supreme-court-asked-weigh-use-ranked-choice-voting-primaries">Maine Supreme Court</a> has been asked to weigh-in on the implementation. The court will address several very <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/11/here-are-the-questions-on-ranked-choice-voting-to-be-posed-to-maines-high-court/">specific questions</a> about the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire:</strong> Superior Court Judge Charles Temple has denied the state’s second attempt to have a challenge to 2017’s <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/nh-primary-source-judge-denies-states-request-to-dismiss-challenge-to-voting-law/19747743">Senate Bill 3</a> dismissed. According to WMUR, in the ruling, Judge Charles Temple stated that if the NHDP’s allegations are true, SB 3 law has caused, and will result in, Democratic candidates receiving “disproportionately fewer votes.”</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> In a unanimous decision, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled this week that Nashville must hold its <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/04/10/tennessee-supreme-court-rules-nashville-must-hold-special-election-may-mayor/502591002/">special election to replace the mayor</a> in late May instead of August. The ruling overturns a decision by the Davidson County election commission which had wanted to hold the election in August. The election has been set for <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/04/11/nashville-mayor-election-date-2018-may/506731002/">May 24</a>.</p>

														<p><strong>VII. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>National:</strong> This week, Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-elections-initiative/" target="_blank" title="Facebook Announcement">announced the launch of a new research initiative</a> that will enable <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-commission-examine-social-media-s-effects-elections-n863886">independent researchers</a> to perform an assessment of the role the social platform plays in elections. Democracy Fund and Omidyar Network have joined an <a href="https://www.hewlett.org/newsroom/hewlett-knight-koch-foundations-with-other-funders-will-support-independent-research-on-facebooks-role-in-elections-and-democracy/" target="_blank" title="Hewlett Foundation Newsroom">effort</a> led by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to support this potentially important step toward addressing how Facebook’s algorithms and vast storehouses of data are shaping elections, the social fabric, and democratic life. The committee is expected to address misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda; polarizing content; promoting freedom of expression and association; protecting domestic elections from foreign interference; and civic engagement. It will answer two critical questions: Does Facebook have the right systems in place to fight misinformation and foreign interference? And how can Facebook help make social media a net positive for democracy?</p>
<p><strong>National:</strong> <em>CyberScoop</em> has an interesting story about a <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/voting-machine-dmca-exemption-security-research-hearing/">battle between cybersecurity experts and voting machine makers</a>. According to the piece, Section 1201 of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) made it illegal to bypass security measures to prevent access to copyrighted material, although the U.S. Copyright Office has created exemptions over the years. Now the office is considering expanding those exemptions security researchers and voting machine vendors, who are at odds on the exemptions, are voicing their disagreements.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The Maricopa County recorder’s office is asking the board of supervisors for almost $4 million to expand the county’s <a href="http://kjzz.org/content/633647/maricopa-county-recorder-requests-almost-4m-expanded-voter-check">voter check-in system</a>. The county is seeking a system that will allow it to scan a voter’s driver’s license to look them up in the poll book.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, this week a senior White House official told <strong>Reuters</strong> that the hack of the state’s election database in 2016 was not done by the Russian government, but by “<a href="http://ktar.com/story/2017026/report-arizona-voter-database-hacked-by-criminals-in-2016-not-russia/">suspected criminal actors</a>.”</p></p>
