							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two new cybersecurity tools for elections officials</strong><br /><em>Security handbook and information sharing now available</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>While states and localities are awaiting their share of the $380 million allotted by Congress to upgrade elections cybersecurity, there are two, totally free ways that they can start beefing up their security now.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center for Internet Security</a> (CIS), a nonprofit that harnesses the power of the global IT community to safeguard private and public organizations against cyber threats recently released A Handbook for Elections Infrastructure Security and also launched the Elections Infrastructure Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/elections-resources/">A Handbook for Elections Infrastructure Security</a> is designed to help elections officials and their technical support teams defend the systems and networks used to conduct elections.</p>
<p>“We had two fundamental goals with the handbook: 1) to provide technical recommendations that are practical and actionable for elections officials and 2) to help bridge the communications gap between the technical and non-technical folks that need to work together to secure elections,” explained Dr. Mike Garcia, who has held positions at <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> and was the chief author of the handbook. “While the best practices include some technical language, the document as a whole is intentionally written to be understood by a non-technical audience.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Handbook for Elections Infrastructure Security:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes details on 88 best practices</li>
<li>Identifies high and medium priority for those best practices</li>
<li>Addresses the different ways aspects of elections systems are connected to each other and the internet</li>
<li>Addresses auditing, incident response planning and response, and contracting for services</li>
</ul>
<p>According to CIS, the handbook reflects the reality that the most significant risks to voting infrastructure affect those components with network connections. Examples include many voting registration systems and election night reporting systems, both of which may carry substantial cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p>While these types of attacks can cause disruptions and undermine public confidence, they are similar to those in other sectors with networked systems where well-known mitigations exist.</p>
<p>The handbook is closely tied to the CIS Controls, which undergo regular revisions. So CIS will update the handbook if it’s warranted by changing conditions and periodically to keep references to the CIS controls tied to the latest version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But it’s important to emphasize that the handbook won’t be out of date any time soon,” Garcia said. “The approaches to manage risks will continue to mature and occasionally new risks emerge, but identified best practices don’t really stop being good to do. So implementing a given best practice won’t all of a sudden become a bad idea.”</p>
<p>In addition to the handbook and signing up for EI-ISAC (more info below), Garcia recommended the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s cybersecurity training for non-IT folks and noted that CIS is always happy to talk people through the most important things they need to know. He added that one of the best ways an election officials can learn highly applicable information is to have an assessment of their systems. Either a self-assessment or one conducted by an independent party.</p>
<p>“We know elections officials have been hard at work securing their systems and managing all kinds of risks,” Garcia said. “We believe that a risk-based approach is the only way to manage in an evolving environment and get the results we all want to see.”</p>
<p><strong>Elections Infrastructure Sharing and Analysis Center<br /></strong>CIS has long been home to the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), starting this spring is also home to an information sharing center just for elections. The <a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration">EI-ISAC</a>, which is available to any state/local/county elections official to participate in, will provide early warnings of cyber system threats, security vulnerability and training opportunities.</p>
<p>“The MS-ISAC does very important work, but it&#8217;s spread across many areas of need. By creating a specific unit to address the needs of election security, the EI-ISAC can provide more targeted and timely information to election officials,” explained Judd Choate, director of elections for the state of <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">Colorado</a>, immediate past-president of <a href="https://www.nased.org/">NASED</a> and the first NASED representative to the Executive Committee of the DHS <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/gcc">Government Coordinating Council</a> (GCC).</p>
<p>“Further, for those election officials or IT professionals in states and localities around the country that have been less engaged in the national security conversation, the addition of a specific unit dedicated to elections cyber security will clarify who to contact and its importance to the daily work of cyber security,” Choate said.</p>
<p>When the Department of Homeland Security designated elections critical infrastructure, NASED volunteered to help in any way possible, including participating on the GCC, serving as guinea pigs for the new EI-ISAC, and engaging with outside groups like <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/">Harvard&#8217;s Belfer Center</a> and the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election Data and Science Lab</a>. As for the actual decision to create an election infrastructure ISAC, NASED had seven of the 27 representatives on the GCC when it voted to create the EI-ISAC in February. &nbsp;Each of those members supported its creation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although NASED has been leading the charge on the EI-ISAC, Choate encouraged all elections officials to sign up.</p>
<p>“The EI-ISAC isn&#8217;t just a good tool for election officials, it&#8217;s an absolute necessity,” Choate said. “My office has advised all Colorado counties to join the EI-ISAC. Nearly 50 percent of our counties have done so. I know other states represented on the EI-ISAC Advisory Board are doing the same. Not only do you get the IT security alerts in real time, you also get access to a wide array of specialized intrusion prevention and monitoring. &nbsp;If you are reading this and wondering if you should sign up for the EI-ISAC, the answer is ‘yes.’”</p>
<p>Choate noted that protecting voter registration databases from remote intrusion, which is the main function of the EI-ISAC is only the first step. He said all election officials should be thinking about the vulnerability of their election systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I protecting my voter registration database, including web application firewalls, multi-factor authentication, and database logs to track usage and changes?</li>
<li>&nbsp;Am I prepared for a denial of service attack &#8211; on election day or any other day?</li>
<li>When I send the personally identifying information (PII) of my voters, am I properly protecting that information against exposure?</li>
<li>Are all my counties properly protecting the voter registration database through password protocols and a workable security plan?</li>
<li>Am I providing software for my counties to help them protect against malware, ransomware, etc.? &nbsp;</li>
<li>Do I need to audit my county or employee security protocols to make sure they are doing what they say they are doing?</li>
<li>Should I purchase software to improve emergency communications with election officials &#8211; just in case?</li>
<li>Are my local jurisdictions reusing removable media (thumb drives), which exposes those systems to malware?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Should I purchase encrypted thumb drives for my counties that can be reset after each usage, so malware isn&#8217;t transferred to my voting system.</li>
<li>Have I created a specific training for my counties that helps them understand cyber security vulnerabilities and protect against them? &nbsp;</li>
<li>Am I considering conducting a table top exercise for my state like the one Harvard&#8217;s Belfer Center rolled out last week? &nbsp;</li>
<li>Does my voting system vendor have appropriate security protocols and partners with me to monitor their security?</li>
</ol>
<p>“And this is only the visible part of the iceberg,” Choate said. “Schedule a meeting &#8211; in fact, schedule a reoccurring meeting &#8211; with your IT team to go over every potential vulnerability in your election office, system, and processes. Don&#8217;t be the weak link.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Forty-three years after the municipality of Anchorage was created</strong>, the city has had its <a href="http://www.ktva.com/story/37881249/thousands-of-ballots-await-muni-election-count">largest voter turnout ever</a>. This year was also the first year that the city conducted its election entirely by mail and with election-day vote centers. According to KTVA, the office of Municipal Clerk Barbara Jones says so far, 78,602 ballots have been received. That total is higher than any turnout figures dating back to the municipality&#8217;s founding in 1975, including&nbsp;the 71,099 people who voted in 2012’s election. Perhaps helping spur turnout was a controversial “bathroom bill.” Only time will tell if it was Proposition 1 that ginned up turnout, or the state’s switch to vote-by-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Utah County, Utah has </strong><a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014330/recount-utah-county-election-will-be-vote-by-mail-after-all.html"><strong>reversed course on its decision</strong> to abandon the county’s new vote-by-mail system</a> after city leaders throughout the county expressed their anger about the decision. According to the Deseret News, commissioners and Clerk Bryan Thompson initially decided against holding an all vote-by-mail election during the county&#8217;s budget process in December, hoping to save taxpayer money and put the county&#8217;s voting equipment to good use. Although the decision was made in December, it didn’t become common knowledge until late March and that’s when the county was inundated with calls asking them to rethink their decision. &#8220;Our responsibility as representatives is to govern, to respond and to listen to constituents, and that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re doing here,&#8221; Utah County Commission Chairman Nathan Ivie told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Elections This Week</strong>: Primaries, special elections and municipal elections were held in several places this week including Alaska, where the city of <a href="http://www.ktva.com/story/37872611/more-than-60000-ballots-returned-in-anchorage-elections">Anchorage</a> conducted its first-ever vote-by-mail election. At press time, turnout was roughly 28 percent which was higher than the 2015 municipal elections. In a special election in <a href="http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/37867776/voters-in-goose-creek-using-paper-ballots-after-machines-malfunction">Goose Creek, South Carolina</a> voting machines malfunctioned in the early hours of voting and voters had to switch to back-up paper ballots. Spring elections were held in Wisconsin this week although the weather didn’t feel exactly <a href="http://fox11online.com/news/local/polling-places-voters-battle-snowy-conditions">spring-like</a>. Despite the <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/west/news/brookfield/2018/04/03/selfies-signs-ducks-wisconsin-election-commission-gets-plenty-odd-complaints-election-day/483419002/">usual odd questions</a>, things seemed to go relatively smoothly in the Badger state although one Milwaukee polling place was briefly evacuated because of a <a href="http://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-polling-place-evacuated-because-of-suspicious-package/19677566">suspicious package</a>. In Missouri, turnout was slow in Joplin, but there were no reported issues with the state’s new <a href="http://www.joplinglobe.com/news/voter-turnout-in-joplin-slow-so-far-but-no-issues/article_7ffe697a-3759-11e8-8a1a-8be6b193206a.html">voter ID law</a>. Snow wasn’t the issue in Missouri like it was in Wisconsin, but <a href="http://www.kfvs12.com/story/37863507/polling-places-prepared-for-tornado-chances">potential tornadoes</a> were. There were some <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/columbia-voters-on-fairview-road-unexpectedly-redirected-to-new-polling/article_ba67a3b0-3763-11e8-a85d-7712d961eef8.html">confused voters</a> in Boone County after Clerk Taylor Burks reduced the number of polling places in anticipation of a low turnout.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: <strong><a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/apr/03/arkansas-elections-board-gets-new-chief-1/">Heather McKim</a></strong> has been selected to oversee the office of the state board of election commissioner in Arkansas. <strong><a href="https://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/wurtz-named-hall-elections-superintendent/">Lori Wurtz</a></strong> has been named the Hall County, Georgia elections superintendent. Former Connecticut Secretary of State <strong><a href="http://www.wfsb.com/story/37872913/former-secretary-of-state-is-running-for-ct-governor">Susan Bysiewicz</a></strong> is running for governor.</p>
<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong>: Former Duval County, Florida Supervisor of Elections <strong><a href="http://www.jacksonville.com/news/20180402/tommie-bell-banks-1926-2018-supervisor-of-elections-for-13-years">Tommie Bell Banks</a></strong> died on April 1. She was 91. Although she “only” served as the supervisor of elections for 13 years, Banks worked in the elections office for 48 years and was the first woman to hold an elective countywide office. “She was always smiling,” her son-in-law Tom Papania told the Florida Times-Union. “She said to her staff that we work for the public. They don’t work for us. When you go to the counter, I want you to be courteous and always have a smile on your face.” She started as a temporary clerk typist and became chief deputy in 1964 she was appointed supervisor in July 1986 and won a special election that year. She won her first full term in 1987 and ran unopposed for her second and third terms before retiring in 1999.</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Senate Bill 403, which would have moved the state to a <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/bill-replace-georgia-electronic-voting-machines-falls-short/E3Y3rDmP3WhtbYRvKnaGGK/">paper-ballot system</a> died at midnight on March 30 at the end of the legislative session. The House had approved an amended version of the bill earlier in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> This week, the Elko County commission voted to put off implementing the use of <a href="http://elkodaily.com/news/local/county-votes-down-spanish-language-ballots/article_125756db-577b-5040-81e1-a8648f525716.html">Spanish-language</a> ballots and election materials until it becomes federally mandated.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico:</strong> Not a legislative change, but Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver has <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1154625/toulouse-oliver-adopts-some-new-voting-rules.html">approved new rules</a> this week that clarify the handling of provisional ballots and will make it easier for blind voters to cast an absentee ballot, among other changes.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The House is considering a bill that would <a href="http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/bill-would-aid-disabled-voters-1.2320896">make it easier for voters with disabilities</a> to cast a ballot in the Commonwealth. According to the <em>Times-Tribune</em>, Currently, with physician certification, disabled and bedridden voters are added to a permanently disabled absentee ballot list. But individuals are required to confirm their health status every four years. The bill, which has been approved by the Senate, would eliminate that provision.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The Legislature has approved Bill 32-0189 which will <a href="http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/legislature-orders-primary-elections/article_1fd52351-2f91-5f45-810f-54529c04eed3.html">fund primaries</a> in the U.S. territory after the territorial elections board had voted not to fund primaries.</p></p>

												<div data-id="4" class="article-wrapper  item-4">
							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;IV. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Secretary of State Mark Martin has filed a motion asking the state’s Supreme Court to compel Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray to rule whether she’ll grant a motion to block the enforcement of the state’s <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arkansas/articles/2018-03-29/arkansas-asks-high-court-to-intervene-in-voter-id-lawsuit">voter ID</a> law for the May 22 primary. On Wednesday, the state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2018/04/04/arkansas-supreme-court-declines-to-intervene-in-voter-id-case">declined to intervene</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> The Denver District Attorney’s office has dropped a <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/04/03/grand-jury-secretary-state-wayne-williams/">grand jury probe into the secretary of state’s office</a>. “My office has since received additional documents which the Secretary of State’s Office provided voluntarily and yesterday I met with attorneys representing Secretary Williams and Deputy Secretary Staiert,” DA Beth McCann said in a statement. “I am requesting the Grand Jury withdraw the subpoenas that had previously been issued and my office will close the grand jury investigation at this time.”</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom has ruled that Broward Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes has a program in place “that <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-reg-broward-elections-supervisor-prevails-over-acru-20180330-story.html">makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters</a> from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of death or change of address.” According to the <em>Sun-Sentinel</em>, Bloom said the American Civil Rights Union, which filed suit against Snipes because of the potential for voter fraud, had not proven that the Broward elections office violated the National Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>Also in Florida this week, Gov. Rick Scott (R) has <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/04/04/gov-scott-appeals-judges-ruling-on-voting-rights-for-felons/">filed an appeal</a> to U.S. District Judge Mark Walker’s ruling that would have given Scott and the state’s three cabinet members until April 26 to come up with a plan to restore the voting rights to those previously incarcerated.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> John Daniel Martin, 35 has been charged with giving an underage man alcohol and tobacco <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/supporter-mayor-elect-charged-with-vote-buying/k9XD43gP0JTcphh9nLLHXJ/">in exchange for his vote</a>. The secretary of state’s office is also investigating the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Kennebec Superior Court Judge Michaela Murphy has ruled that state election officials should continue to implement <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/judge-rules-ranked-choice-voting-should-be-implemented-june-primaries">ranked choice voting</a> for the June primary elections. &#8220;The uncertainty that halting the ranked-choice voting implementation process at this late date would cause is significant. Clarity, stability and public confidence are essential to ensure the legitimacy of Maine elections,&#8221; Murphy wrote in her 14-page ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> St. Paul City Councilmember Dai Thao formally entered a plea of not guilty to three counts of <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2018/04/02/city-council-member-dai-thao-pleads-not-guilty-to-three-charges/">election misconduct</a> for helping a voter cast her ballot in 2016. A jury trial has been tentatively scheduled for May 29.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota:</strong> U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland has ruled that North Dakota must expand the types of <a href="https://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/government-and-politics/4427188-citing-native-americans-cherished-right-vote-federal-judge">acceptable IDs</a> in order to cast a ballot. Hovland’s ruling prevents the state from mandating that IDs include a “current residential street address” and expands the valid forms of ID to include more tribal documents.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia ruled this week that Texas is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/03/federal-judge-hands-texas-loss-voter-registration-lawsuit/">in violation of the federal National Voter Registration Act</a> for failing to register residents to vote when they update their drivers’ license information online. According to the <em>Texas Tribune</em>, it wasn’t immediately clear how Garcia will direct the state to comply with the law; Garcia indicated he will provide more details in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Crystal Mason, 43 has been sentenced to five years in prison for <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2018/03/29/texas-felon-didnt-even-want-go-vote-gets-prison-time-voting-illegally">casting a ballot in 2016 while still on supervised release</a> for a 2011 conviction for tax fraud.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative nonprofit, has sued Harris County in an effort to force the county <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Non-profit-group-sues-Harris-County-over-voter-12791252.php">make records available on how it stops non-U.S. citizens from voting</a>. According to the Houston Chronicle, the group said it is seeking to promote the integrity of elections and that previous Harris County Tax Assessor-Collectors, who run voter registration in the county, had indicated that people who are not U.S. citizens do get registered to vote and cast ballots.</p></p>
