<p><strong>Exit Interview: Amber McReynolds</strong></p>
<p><span class="wf_caption" style="max-width: 341px; margin: 7px; float: left; display: inherit;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Amber1.jpg" alt="Amber1" width="341" height="192" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin: auto;" /><span style="max-width: 341px; text-align: center; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Amber McReynolds courtesy of Denverite</span></span></p>
<p>Long-time Director of Elections Amber McReynolds is leaving <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html">Denver Elections</a>, but she’s not leaving elections.</p>
<p>After administering elections in Denver for 12 years, McReynolds will depart later this month to become the Executive Director of the <a href="https://www.voteathome.org/">National Vote at Home Institute</a>.</p>
<p>During her tenure in Denver, the county/city’s elections department was known for innovative ideas such as <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2015/1502-electionlineweekly-february-12-2015">eSign</a>, <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2015/1579-electionlineweekly-may-14-2015">Ballot TRACE</a> and a program allowing <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2018/2398-electionlineweekly-january-18-2018">homeless residents</a> to serve as poll workers. The Division has won several national and international awards stemming from these innovations and others.</p>
<p>As she wrote about in an April <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/a-voter-centered-approach-to-elections-bd0fc1269229">Medium</a> post, McReynolds believes in a voter-centered approach to elections.</p>
<p>“As a dynamic, highly complex, and decentralized ecosystem, the election administration field involves commitment by federal, state, and local election officials but also technologists, stakeholders, advocacy groups, and above all — voters,” McReynolds wrote. “Let me say that again. Voters are the key and making their experience meaningful, accessible, and secure is our ultimate responsibility. We must continue to improve our service delivery to voters, respond to their needs, and facilitate a fair and accessible process. I believe this process must be free from partisan politics and must be centered around doing what’s right for all voters, regardless of political persuasion.”</p>
<p>We caught up with Amber as she was preparing for her final days at Denver Elections and asked her some questions for one of our exit interviews.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why are you choosing to leave public service now?<br /></strong></em>I have been blessed to lead an incredible and talented team at Denver Elections.&nbsp;We have transformed the voting process to make it more effective for voters and I think this new opportunity gives me a chance to continue to help other states re-imagine what is possible to improve the voting process for all voters.&nbsp;So, my new role is still serving the public, just perhaps in a more indirect way. I’ll always be a public servant.</p>
<p><em><strong>What attracted you to taking on the role at Vote At Home?</strong></em><br />I receive calls and emails weekly from states and jurisdictions across the country asking me how they can make their offices or state processes look like Colorado’s system.&nbsp;I have been speaking all over the country about Denver’s transformation and how we modernized our election system and improved the voting experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that there is much to do to enhance and improve the process across the country.&nbsp;As an experienced election official, I believe I can help others and the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition will give me a chance to do that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>What advice would you give someone just getting started out about working the field of elections?<br /></strong></em>I am grateful to work in this office and in this role and I have loved it each and every day.&nbsp;I’m passionate about election administration and I believe that finding a role that you are passionate about is the key to being successful.&nbsp;I always encourage new election officials to approach this profession in curiosity and think about what is possible, re-imagine what could be, and look for creative ways to serve voters.&nbsp; Voting is our ultimate right and voters deserve an awesome experience! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the field of elections has so many amazing opportunities for a variety of disciplines including technology, data analytics, communication, marketing, process improvement, customer service, database administrators, graphic designers, researchers, lawyers, accountants, political science, operations, logistics, emergency management, and many more. &nbsp;It’s an exciting field and expanding the diversity of disciplines within the field is important to improving the voting process overall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you do not need a specific major or background but you need to be passionate, curious, and committed to the subject. I also think it is important for professionals new the field to seek mentors and learn from others.</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s the one thing you wish you could have accomplished while in Denver, but weren’t able to?<br /></strong></em>Oh what a list! &nbsp;Well, I’m an eternal optimist and I believe that very little is impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, first we have been working on a plan to consolidate our municipal and run-off election and utilize ranked choice voting.&nbsp; I believe this is a good path forward for voters and for election administration and will save taxpayer funds in the process.</p>
<p>Secondly, voter registration trends in Colorado show a 45 percent increase in unaffiliated voters in recent years – now 38% Unaffiliated, 30 percent Democrats, 30 percent Republican.&nbsp;Of this, 50 percent of 18-24 year old voters are unaffiliated.&nbsp;To me, voters are always telling us something with trends and data and it is important to constantly review our laws and policies to ensure they support voters.&nbsp; Many states do not require you to affiliate when you register to vote and given this trend in Colorado, I believe our state should consider this policy change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, I believe there is need for further reform with our primary system to make it more effective and operationally efficient. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, there are statutory changes that would improve voting access in Colorado including allowing 17 year olds who will be eligible to vote by the General Election to vote in the Primary (Ohio does this currently).</p>
<p>Fifth, I believe that implementing pre-paid/business reply postage for mail ballots and adjusting the timelines for receiving the physical ballot (due to USPS operational changes) are needed to ensure voted ballots are received.&nbsp;I have other ideas about statutory changes but that is a good summary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sixth, I believe there are still some enhancements to make with regards to the delivery system for military and overseas voters and voters with accessibility challenges. &nbsp;Denver has made progress on these initiatives and that will continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Denver is also ready to rollout a new Campaign Finance Filing system that will tremendously improve the reporting system and access to information.&nbsp; The team working on this has done an outstanding job and I can’t wait to see the final product this fall.</p>
<p><em><strong>Denver elections has done a lot of unique and innovative things (eSign, homeless poll worker program), what is it about Denver that made that possible?<br /></strong></em>We have a culture of curiosity and creativity and we focus on doing what is right for the customers we serve.&nbsp;We truly care about delivering exceptional service and improving the voting experience.&nbsp;Our team is incredible and have many amazing ideas to achieve this mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could create the perfect voting system, what would it look like? And no fair just saying vote-by-mail!<br /></strong></em>I believe the future is ballot delivery (not actually the term vote by mail).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colorado was designed to be an automatic ballot delivery system complimentary to voter registration modernization reforms.&nbsp;I believe connecting the registration process with balloting so that it is seamless is critical to an effective voting system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now the delivery mechanism is a paper ballot delivered by USPS and in the future that may be different.&nbsp;I could envision a system that allows a voter to login to their voter registration record, their ballot is displayed, they can mark the ballot and click print (or perhaps save it to their phone) and then physically submit it to us in a secure drop-off location or at a vote center, already marked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m an optimist with regards to new ideas and believe that if creative election professionals, talented technologists along with security specialists, and other collaborators work together, we can solve our greatest challenges with access and security.&nbsp; I also believe that voters will and should advocate for system changes they want to see.&nbsp;</p>

She’s also on Twitter (@AmberMcReynolds) and maintains a work-related <a href="https://medium.com/@ambermcreynolds">Medium account</a>.</p>

<p>During a television interview, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California), head of the House Intelligence Committee supported the idea of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/26/devin-nunes-suggests-banning-electronic-voting-sys/">banning electronic voting machines</a> and relying solely on paper ballots.</p>
<p>“The one thing we’ve been warning about for many, many years on the intelligence committee is about the electronic voting systems. Those are really dangerous in my opinion, and should not be used,” Nunes, said in an <a href="http://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/398949-house-intel-chair-calls-for-ban-on-electronic-voting-systems" target="_blank">interview</a> aired on Hill.TV’s “Rising.”</p>
<p>Although President Donald J. Trump has waffled on his support of securing the nation’s elections and the threats faced by state and local officials, during a speech in New York this week, <a href="https://www.axios.com/pence-stands-by-intel-community-in-call-to-increase-election-cybersecurity-007f7a72-d5f1-477f-a5a7-bb957b95b813.html">Vice President Mike Pence</a> seemed to whole-heartedly accept the potential threat to the nation’s voting system and praised state and federal efforts to secure the vote.</p>
<p>An amendment to the “minibus” appropriations bill by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), which would have allocated <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2018/08/01/senate-election-funding-johnson.aspx">$250 million in federal funding</a> to replace outdated voting machines, provide security training for election workers, upgrade voter registration software and fund other state and local election initiatives was blocked by Senate Republicans this week. Sen. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) opposed the amendment because Congress has already approved $380 million for election funding this year.</p>

<p><strong>A new study from the Texas Civil Rights Project finds</strong> that a majority of the state’s high schools are <a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/texas/article/Texas-schools-don-t-comply-with-voter-13121293.php">not complying with state law that requires them to provide voter registration form to students at least twice a year</a>. According to the <em>San Antonio News-Express</em>, only about a third of the state’s 2,600 high schools requested voter registration forms from the secretary of state’s office and that 82 out of 232 counties (35 percent) did not have a single high school request a voter registration form. The paper noted that it’s not clear how many schools reached out to counties for voter registration forms instead of the state. The report recommends that the Secretary of State further train schools, mail voter registration forms to all high schools instead of making them request the forms and develop a better tracking method to identify schools that are complying with the law.</p>
<p><strong>The Indiana secretary of state’s office has released a plan</strong> to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-lake-consolidation-plan-st-0802-story.html">cut almost a third of Lake County’s precincts</a>. After county officials failed to come up with a plan to consolidate the precincts, the state stepped in. Under the new plan, the secretary of state’s office cut 170 of the county’s current 523 precincts. “My office has worked diligently to craft a reasonable plan that is fair to the citizens of Lake County,” Secretary of State Connie Lawson said, in a statement. “Under this plan, county residents will realize roughly $700,000 in savings over the next four years, yet will be minimally impacted by a shift in some polling locations.” Gary, Hammond and East Chicago each lost nearly half of their voting precincts. “I’m really disturbed and concerned about these amounts of cuts,” Lake County Clerk Michael Brown told the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. The consolidation will begin in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Non-citizen voter registration has gotten off to a slow start</strong> in San Francisco. According to the <em>San Francisco Examiner</em>, <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/slow-start-non-citizen-voter-registration/">just one non-citizen voters so far has registered to vote</a>. In 2016 voters approved Proposition N which allows documented non-citizens to register and vote in school elections. Advocates who had supported Proposition N are now cautioning people about registering for fear that this information could be used against them. “A lot of people in the community felt that the department should destroy records and not do the normal processes for getting people registered,” Department of Elections Director John Arntz told the <em>Examiner</em>. “But there is nothing in the law that dictates the department to do anything differently — all that happened was there was a change in the definition of a voter in San Francisco for the school board elections.”</p>
<p><strong>The Pennsylvania Department of State has reviewed voter records</strong> and determined that as many as 8,698 people may be registered to vote who are not actually eligible for registration. According to the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, the review first uncovered 11,198 potentially <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/voter-system-glitch-pennsylvania-non-citizens-registration-motor-voter-20180727.html">ineligible voters on the rolls</a>, prompting the agency to undertake a process of confirming registrations. That resulted in 2,500 people being removed from the list recently. But about 8,700 of those registrants remain on the rolls across 64 counties, and those counties will now be tasked with confirming their eligibility or removing them from the rolls. “The counties will complete the process of confirming eligibility of the remaining registrants using the information provided by the Department of State,” agency spokesperson Wanda Murren said. “It is premature to estimate the county findings, because many of the registrants may be eligible voters.”</p>
<p>T<strong>he Los Angeles County board of supervisors have approved a plan</strong> to <a href="http://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-latest-news/los-angeles-county-board-of-supervisors-approves-plan-to-increase-inmate-voter-registration-242310">get as many inmates in the county jail registered as are eligible</a>. According to KHTS, the board of supervisors will create a task force to oversee the process. “Engaging all individuals in these efforts, including those with justice system-involvement, is critical,” said Supervisors Mark Ridley-Thomas and Sheila Kuehl within their motion for the plan. The plan will use inmate welfare dollars to fund the outreach. A verbal report is expected in 90 days, just before the November election, with a full written report to follow 30 days later.</p>
<p><strong>The Broadway cast of Hamilton are </strong><a href="http://www.playbill.com/article/broadway-cast-of-hamilton-will-host-voter-registration-at-richard-rodgers-theatre"><strong>not throwing away their shot</strong> to get thousands of people registered to vote</a>. On August 4, the cast will conduct a voter registration drive for New York residents in front of the famed musical’s Richard Rodgers Theatre. According to <em>Playbill</em>, members of the cast who participate in the registration have been trained by voter registration volunteers from the Hispanic Federation. &#8220;Voting honors our democracy; honors our founding fathers; and honors the spirit of our show,” producer Jeffrey Seller told Playbill. “We want to do our part to help all citizens participate in an election that will deeply affect the direction of our country.”</p>
<p><strong>In other elections entertainment news</strong>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-to-bring-female-voting-rights-story-to-television-idUSKBN1KM5RH">Secretary Hillary Clinton will partner with director Stephen Spielberg</a> to bring a book about women’s fight for voting rights to television. Clinton will be one of four executive producers on the show which is being developed for cable or a streaming service. “It’s [The Woman’s Hour by Elaine Weiss] about the women who fought for suffrage nearly 100 years ago. We stand on their shoulders, and I’m delighted to have a hand in helping to tell their stories,” Clinton said on Twitter.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) has introduced legislation that would prohibit and penalize the knowing spread of misinformation, such as incorrect polling locations, times or the necessary forms of ID in order to suppress voter turnout. McCaskill’s bill, the <a href="http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/mccaskill-introduces-bill-to-prohibit-and-penalize-voter-disinformation/article_aaad7d7e-90f4-11e8-902d-d7c8b94271e2.html">Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act</a>, which she introduced with U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Doug Jones (D-AL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) would prohibit and penalize intentionally and knowingly spreading misinformation to voters that are intended to suppress the vote, including the time and place of an election and restrictions on voter eligibility. The penalty for engaging in these deceptive acts would be a fine up to $100,000 and/or up to five years imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Officials are working on legislation for the implementation of <a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/state-lawmakers-working-on-legislation-to-regulate-automatic-voter-registration/1329277847">automatic voter registration</a>, which has been approved by the Legislature, but not yet <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/07/legislature_sends_automatic_vo.html">signed by the governor</a>. According to WWLP, House and Senate negotiators filed a compromise bill with the House clerk&#8217;s office that would require voters to opt-out rather than opt-in. Eligible citizens would automatically be registered to vote when they interact with the RMV.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Gov. Roy Cooper (D) has vetoed ballot language approved by the Legislature including the language for a constitutional referendum on <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/nation-world/north-carolina/article_eed5f9d0-edf7-5f6d-80d7-c97905e9b275.html">voter ID</a>.

														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> The Alabama NAACP, Greater Birmingham Ministries and three individual voters, argued before the 11th Circuit last week that the state’s <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/11th-circuit-hears-naacp-challenge-to-alabama-voter-id-law/">photo voter identification law</a> was specifically crafted by lawmakers to discriminate against thousands of black and Latino voters. According to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>, In January, U.S. District Judge L. Scott Coogler ruled that the 2011 law, which requires absentee and in-person voters to show photo ID in order to cast a ballot, is constitutional. Coogler found no evidence that the Alabama legislature passed the law with “racially discriminatory intent or for a racially discriminatory purpose.”</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> A judge has <a href="http://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20180726/judge-dismisses-augusta-commission-candidates-complaint-about-traffic-jam-costing-her-votes">thrown out an election complaint</a> from a losing candidate in the race for August commission on procedural grounds. The losing candidate had complained that an afternoon gas leak, which caused traffic to be rerouted, was mishandled and may have cost her votes.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson has imposed more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-orders-kobach-to-pay-more-than-26000-for-contempt/2018/08/01/b2b76f26-95e9-11e8-818b-e9b7348cd87d_story.html?utm_term=.0bf3edcbef4e">$26,000 in sanctions</a> against Secretary of State Kris Kobach as punishment for his “contemptuous behavior” during the state’s proof-of citizenship legal battle.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: For the third time in a little more than a year, a panel of three Superior Court judges was asked to weigh the <a href="https://www.wral.com/judges-hear-arguments-over-state-elections-board-for-third-time/17726774/">legality of a revamped State Board of Elections</a> and Ethics Enforcement. According to WRAL, there was no word on when the judges would rule on the case, but it&#8217;s likely that any decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: During testimony before the state’s Supreme Court, Libertarian candidate for secretary of state Roland Riemers <a href="http://inforum.com/news/government-and-politics/4480223-libertarian-candidate-disputes-recount-statute-north-dakota">challenged the state’s election process</a> and questioned why ballots are not a matter of public record. &#8220;Mr. Riemers, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s unusual that people aren&#8217;t allowed to rummage through ballots,&#8221; Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle later told him. &#8220;And there&#8217;s good reason for that.&#8221; According to <em>InForum</em>, Riemers officially received 247 votes in the statewide primary election as the only Libertarian on the ballot. He needed 300 votes to be nominated for the November ballot and maintain the Libertarians&#8217; ballot status. He is challenging the state’s interpretation of the recount law.</p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> Elections officials in San Francisco are <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Possible-new-election-twist-for-voters-who-want-13109151.php">considering moving to new ballot-counting machines</a> that would not only speed up the process of counting ranked-choice ballots, but would also allow voters to rank up to 10 candidates. San Francisco has long had a limit on three candidates per ranked-choice vote because the city’s ballot-counting system could not handle more. According to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, the new vote-counting machines look a lot like their black, boxy predecessors. But the paper ballots themselves will be redesigned: In most cases, voters will fill in ovals, rather than complete broken lines, to mark their selections. Sections of the ballot for ranked-choice contests will also look different, featuring a layout that ranked-choice proponents say will help eliminate voter confusion and mismarked ballots.</p>
<p>Also in California, a report prepared by IBM Security Services found that it was <a href="https://statescoop.com/incompatible-file-formats-resulted-in-los-angeles-county-dropping-118-000-voters-during-california-primary">incompatible software and clashing file formats</a> between the state’s official voter list and Los Angeles county’s system that left 118,000 people off the voter rolls during the June primary.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: After a successful pilot program using two counties during the primary, the West Virginia secretary of state’s office <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/morgantownnews/news/voatz-mobile-election-system-set-to-open-up-for-november/article_ddd3c67e-583f-5abf-abb7-da187bf249db.html">plans to roll out the use of Votaz</a> — a block chain voting system — statewide for overseas voters in November. “I think it was a great opportunity for our military voters to take advantage of a method in which they could access their ballot a lot easier,” Monongalia County Clerk Carye Blaney told <em>The Morgantown News</em>. “Of course, the first time you do things, you recognize things you can improve upon for the future, but I think all 11 military voters who used it in our county were pleased with it.” According to the secretary of state’s office, Voatz is still undergoing the last of four technology audits before it can be given the green light. After that, Secretary of State Mac Warner will make Voatz optional for the state’s county clerks to use in November, but it won’t be mandated.</p>
