														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Longtime Boone County, Mo. Clerk Wendy Noren dies</strong></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“It is complete now</em><br /><em> 2 ends of time are neatly tied</em><br /><em> A one way street</em><br /><em> She&#8217;s walking to the end of the line</em><br /><em> And there she meets</em><br /><em> Faces she see&#8217;s in her heart and mind…”</em><br /><em>&#8212; Tomorrow Wendy</em>, Concrete Blonde</p>
<p>On March 11, longtime Boone County, Missouri Clerk Wendy Noren lost her battle with cancer. She was 63.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Noren3.jpg" alt="Noren3" width="355" height="317" style="margin: 7px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />News of Noren’s death spread quickly throughout the elections community and she was remembered by her colleagues for her dedication to the voters of Boone County and for her tireless efforts to make the process better for them and ultimately for all of us.</p>
<p>“Wendy Noren was a strong protector of the people&#8217;s right to be heard. She was always looking for innovative ways to better serve the voters. No matter your political party, Wendy was always willing to listen. We will miss Wendy&#8217;s leadership and knowledge on election issues,” said Missouri Secretary of State <a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/">Jay Ashcroft</a> (R)</p>
<p>Noren first joined the Boone County clerk’s office as a deputy clerk in 1978 and was elected to her first term as county clerk in 1982. After serving the voters of Boone County for almost 30 years, Noren stepped down on June 23, 2017.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20180311/wendy-noren-long-time-boone-county-clerk-dies-after-lengthy-battle-with-cancer">then-Clerk Chris Kelly</a>, when he hired Noren, she reprogrammed the entire election system herself to make sure it was tamper proof.</p>
<p>“Wendy was a firecracker, a leader with almost encyclopedia knowledge of elections, local government, technology, and politics. She was a mentor and a guide for many in the field (whether they were new or experienced),” said Adam Ambrogi, program director, elections at <a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">The Democracy Fund</a>. “I spent many hours with Wendy, discussing issues of importance on national election issues, and found her advice invaluable, and her passion for serving her voters invaluable. &nbsp;I, and many professionals in the field will miss her deeply.”</p>
<p>She served as a member of the <a href="http://www.naco.org/">National Association of Counties</a> advisory board to the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> from 2004 until 2017. The EAC issued a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2018/03/12/eac-commissioners-issue-joint-statement-honoring-wendy-noren/">joint statement</a> on the passing of Noren and Chairman Tom Hicks added his own thoughts.</p>
<p>“There were five or six people who were truly instrumental in what would become the Help&nbsp;America Votes Act, and Wendy was one of those people. She brought the passion of ‘little guy’ to the room, always standing up for local rights and common sense to the discussion,” Hicks said. “When the bill became law, she continued that work, fighting for small jurisdictions and all voters as she served on the EAC’s Board of Advisors and TGDC. She will be missed, but never forgotten for her commitment to the elections process.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing of Noren’s passing, Commissioner Matt Masterson, took to Twitter to offer a series of tweets about Noren’s importance to the elections community. This week he told us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Wendy&#8217;s preparation and attention to detail was legendary. She is one of only a handful of people that I know that have read the VVSG cover to cover and even tabbed it for follow up and questions she had. No one out-prepared Wendy,” Mastserson said. “We will miss her contributions, wit, and friendship, but we will honor her legacy by continuing our work to create a common data format for voting systems and ensuring secure and accessible elections.”</p>
<p>Noren was the only local election official named to the <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/">National Academy of Sciences</a> Committee on the Interoperability of Voter Registration Databases and was involved in the creation of the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/HAVA41.PDF">Help America Vote Act</a> and was a member of the <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/history/archives/milestones-in-NAS-history/organization-of-the-nrc.html">National Research Council</a>. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Noren1.jpg" alt="Noren1" width="568" height="384" style="margin: 7px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: right;" /></p>
<p>“Wendy was innovative, dedicated and good-hearted. She was a great friend of mine and so many others across Missouri and the country,” said former Secretary of State <a href="https://www.letamericavote.org/">Jason Kander</a>. “Wendy was a model public servant that genuinely cared about democracy and took maintenance of it personally. She spent her career making sure that every eligible voter in Boone County got the chance to cast a ballot, and her ideas became a national model. Everyone that cares about elections owes Wendy a debt of gratitude for her tireless work, and we&#8217;ll miss her.”</p>
<p>While staunchly a Democrat, Wendy earned respect for her work in elections from both sides of the aisle because of her dedication to the fairness of the system, no matter who was on the ballot.</p>
<p>“Luckily we will never lose what Wendy brought to election integrity and the election community. I feel honored to call her friend,” said former Maricopa County, Arizona Recorder Helen Purcell. “I cannot say enough about this special lady, there was not a more dedicated and knowledgeable person when it came to election technology and common sense procedures.”</p>
<p>Noren was honored by many organizations for her work in elections. She received the 1998 Rosemary Plitt Award and the 2014 Brite award, both commending her for her contributions to Missouri elections. In 1999, she was honored with the Distinguished Alumna Achievement award by Pi Beta Phi. In 2003 she won the Public Advocacy Award from Services for Independent Living and in 2013 the Missouri Assistive Technology Award for her efforts in making voting accessible. In 2015 she was presented the Women in Business Professional Excellence Award. In 2017, she was named the <a href="https://lwvmissouri.org/">League of Women Voters</a> Citizen of the Year and received the <a href="http://www.moclerkselections.com/">Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities</a> Innovator Award.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wendy was truly an icon of election administration. Her unique blend of creativity, pragmatism and fierce determination to improve the election process for voters propelled her from a respected voice in a small county in the middle of the country to national prominence,” said Conny McCormack, former Los Angeles County registrar-recorder/county clerk. “It was my privilege that we became close friends; I will miss her wit and laughter so very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June 2017, during a busy week when she was wrapping up a nearly three-decade career, packing up her belongings and saying good-bye to colleagues, Noren took some time to answer our questions for an exit interview. We’ve decided to rerun that exit interview and give Wendy the last word she so rightly deserves.</p>
<p><em><strong>When you got started in this business back in 1978, did you see yourself making a lifelong career out of it? What kept you running for re-election? </strong></em></p>
<p>While I loved the job from the first day I started I did not plan on doing it the rest of my life. My goal then was to prove to my parents I could do a “real” job so they would let me return to Europe to study art history. Each year I was in the job new challenges would arise that I felt compelled to overcome before I left. Every challenge conquered opened the path to a new one to take on. Before I knew it, I had been there over 35 years and had conducted 10 presidential elections.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’ve seen many changes in the administration of elections, what change to the process have you appreciated most? What change have you appreciated least?</strong></em></p>
<p>When I started all registrations were processed by typewriters and hand written changes – we had no computer. I live or die by the quality of my registration file on Election Day so the advances in technology have been what I appreciate the most. The Internet allows me to let the voter control their registration and for me to communicate quickly with thousands of voters through email and text messaging. I also appreciate the fact that election administration has become something researchers now pay attention to – that can only help our profession.</p>
<p>As far as the least appreciated change it is the current atmosphere of political distrust which makes it difficult for people to innovate. Innovation requires the ability to “do it wrong till you do it right”. Because no level of failure is allowed in our business it is extremely difficult for creative people to advance new programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>What would you say was your greatest accomplishment as an elections official?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think my constant embrace of new technology. I always tried to look at what other businesses were doing to get ideas. For example, the first time I saw a barcode used in the grocery store I knew it would help my office. Soon after I had barcodes added to our computer printed election day voter lists so we could update voter history records quickly and accurately. Most recently it was the text messages from airlines of flight status that I used as model for sending training reminders to poll workers and upcoming text messaging to voters of polling place changes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any regrets about your time in office? Anything you wish you would have accomplished but weren’t able to?</strong> </em></p>
<p>I very much wanted to conduct an election with early voting. Unfortunately Missouri has never been able to work out legislation that is satisfactory to the state and counties. I have so many voters who work shifts that make it difficult, if not impossible, to vote on Election Day. Missouri’s very strict absentee laws make it impossible for many people to get the chance to vote – except those willing to perjure themselves on the affidavit.</p>
<p><em><strong>What challenge/task/principle would you charge the rest of the elections community to carry on in your honor?</strong></em></p>
<p>While this applies to all election officials it applies most to election officials in college towns. I have always believed that I am the gatekeeper to young people’s entry in the election process. A good or bad experience the first time someone votes will carry with them throughout their life. If I fail to provide a good voting experience to a first time voters they may never return to the process. That is a responsibility we must all take seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>What will you miss most about being the Boone County clerk?</strong> </em></p>
<p>I worry my brain will atrophy without the constant stimulation that comes from always trying to create a better way of doing my work. Or frustrated if I think of something new that I cannot implement.</p>
<p><em><strong>What advice would you give to someone just getting started in the election administration business?</strong> </em></p>
<p>Read, read, read, read. At least once a year your state’s election code cover to cover. Take advantage of all of the research that is now being done on the administration of elections – this did not exist when I started. As often as possible check out the business sections of NY Times and Wall Street Journal to find new technologies. And of course, check Electionline every day to see what is going on with election administrators all over the country.</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s next for you, besides sleeping in on the next election day?</strong> </em></p>
<p>Spending time with family and cherished friends – many of whom I have neglected horribly over the years.</p>
<p><em>A celebration of Noren’s life will take place on Saturday April 7 at 3 pm at The Ballroom of the Tiger Hotel, 23 South 8th Street, Columbia, Missouri. Contributions in Wendy’s memory can be made to the True Life Fund, PO Box 121, 2000 E. Broadway, Columbia, Mo. 65201.</em></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>More than a dozen secretaries of state from both sides of the aisle have sent a letter to Senate leaders decrying a rider attached to the reauthorization of the Department of Homeland Security would allow the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/politics/secret-service-polling-places-white-house-elections/index.html">Secret Service</a> to be sent to polling places during a federal elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an alarming proposal which raises the possibility that armed federal agents will be patrolling neighborhood precincts and vote centers,&#8221; <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/03/12/20180309_letter.to.sen.leaders.re.dhs.reauth_final.pdf" target="_blank">according to the letter</a>, which was obtained by CNN.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Secret Service said the rider was grossly overstated and that it would only permit them to enter polling places with protectees.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The town vs. gown debate has ratcheted up a notch in one Maine town</strong>. Recently, Lewiston Mayor Shane Bouchard sent a letter to voters who registered to vote on election day last year <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/03/09/dunlap-calls-lewiston-mayors-letter-a-disservice-to-public-discourse/">laying out the state’s requirements for when someone declares residency</a>. Secretary of State Mathew Dunlap has called the letter a “disservice to the public discourse” and said that while the letter is factual, it “arouses unfounded fears in the minds of the voting public.” Lewiston is home to Bates College and about 1,800 students. According to the <em>Press Herald</em>, the students said Bouchard’s letter causes more confusion by only pulling select information on residency requirements from the secretary of state’s website while not stipulating voting rights. “I do not believe, in the context of voter participation, that offering foreboding warnings of dire consequences from failing to oblige administrative requirements attendant to establishing residency can be construed as anything other than an effort to discourage our fellow Americans from participating in their constitutional right to self-governance – whether you intend that to be the message or not,” Dunlap said in his written response to Bouchard.</p>
<p><strong>It was <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/snow-excuses/article_325608c7-2db0-5478-8186-b5f6c3d5c893.html">snow problem</a> for voters in New Hampshire this week</strong> as they were once again forced to make their way to area polling places during a blizzard. Although <a href="http://www.newburyportnews.com/news/local_news/nor-easter-leads-to-low-voter-turnout-in-seabrook/article_e253c140-e6fa-599c-9e3a-1de6dece20d9.html">turnout was down</a>, the storm raging outside did not stop poll workers and elections officials from doing their jobs, nor did it stop voters from getting to the polls. The storm did present some problems though. One snow-covered voter in Peterborough got their ballot wet and the ballot proceeded to <a href="http://www.ledgertranscript.com/Town-and-school-election-turnout-16179009">jam the machine</a>. “It goes through a very thin slot that only a piece of paper is allowed to go through,”&nbsp;Town Moderator Roland Patten told the M<em>onadock Ledger-Transcript</em>. “We tried using a credit card and we tried using a jackknife and we got one piece out but there is another piece that’s still left in there.”</p>
<p><strong>We’ll give them an A for effort.</strong> This week during a special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional district elections officials in several counties reported receiving angry phone calls from people who thought they could cast a ballot but were <a href="http://triblive.com/local/regional/13416922-74/special-election-for-18th-district-spurs-confusion-over-voting-eligibility">angry to find their polling place closed</a> or were turned away from open polls. The district runs through portions of several counties. “Some are just kind of confused because they see ads on TV and signs on the road, so they thought they were included,” Melanie Ostrander, the Washington County’s assistant director of elections told the <em>Post-Tribune</em>. And the issues weren’t just limited to the Pittsburgh area, voters in the <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-lehigh-valley-special-election-confusion-20180313-story.html">Allentown area</a>, some 300 miles away, complained to elections officials when they found polling places closed.</p>
<p><strong>With roughly 94 percent of the population at the Cook County, Illinois Jail eligible to vote</strong>, organizers recently organized the <a href="http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/local/cook-county-jail-inmates-get-chance-to-vote">first-ever, jail-wide, in-person early voting day</a>. Each division of the jail was equipped with a private voting booth, an attorney, and staff from the Chicago and Cook County Board of Elections.</p>
<p><strong>The Porter County, Indiana board of elections has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-porter-county-election-st-0309-20180308-story.html">returned election duties the county clerk</a> </strong>from the voter registration office for the first time about 50 years. According to <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, the move comes after the director in voter registration, sent a letter to some election board and party officials stating that she would no longer handle elections because doing so ran afoul of state statute. Members of the county council raised concerns about the fate of the responsibilities last month because of the letter. Two part-time employees in the voter registration office will move to the county clerk’s office. Porter County was the only county in the state where election duties were handled through the voter registration office.</p>
<p><strong>Evanston, Illinois’ city clerk has received a cease and desist letter</strong> from the Cook County clerk’s office. For what you may ask? Distributing <a href="http://evanstonnow.com/story/government/bill-smith/2018-03-08/79398/stickers-become-sticky-issue-for-clerk">“I Voted” stickers</a> outside of early voting sites. In a letter from the county clerk’s office, Legal Advisor Daniel P. Madden says that the city clerk’s status as a local election official “is in no way related to the conduct of early voting.” The letter says that Evanston City Clerk Devon Reid is also violating a statute that bars anyone from distributing materials within a 100-foot campaign-free-zone around voting sites.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: Iowa Secretary of State <strong><a href="http://whotv.com/2018/03/10/iowa-secretary-of-state-announces-campaign-for-third-term/">Paul Pate</a> </strong>has announced that he will seek a third term.

Louisiana Secretary of State <strong><a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/03/tom_schedler_not_resigning.html">Tom Schedler</a></strong> announced this week that he would not be resigning, but also that he would not seek re-election.</p>
<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/2018/March/08/VicWork_obit-08Mar18.htm">Victor Work</a></strong>, the former Ulster County elections commissioner who resigned last year to spend more time with his family, has died. Ashley Dittus, who replaced Work as elections commissioner said Work “warm, kind and fair. He always had a story to tell and the best ones we shared over a drink, preferably Glenlivet.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.scpr.org/news/2018/03/12/81585/joaquin-avila-architect-of-the-california-voting-r/">Joaquin Avila</a></strong>, former leader of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has died. He was 69. Avila was a civil rights attorney and is credited with being the chief architect of the California Voting Rights Act. According to Southern California Public Radio, he was a point man in the Hispanic civil rights battle and argued voting rights cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1996 he was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Genius Award. Most recently Avila was director of the National Voting Rights Advocacy Initiative at the Seattle University School of Law. Avila is survived by his wife, three children and a brother.</p></p>

<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: A ballot initiative which would have put the a question in front of voters about whether or not they wanted <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota/articles/2018-03-12/independent-redistricting-initiative-falls-short-of-ballot">control of redistricting</a> taken from legislators and instead given to an independent commission has failed to gather enough signatures to make the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The Legislature has approved a <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/03/08/do-you-want-to-register-to-vote-utah-enacts-widespread-election-law-changes-including-election-day-registration-here-are-all-the-changes/">series of election reform measures</a> that would require drivers to tell the state department of licensing whether or not they want to register to vote. They would still have to opt-in to register to vote. Also under the bill, residents will now be able to register and vote on election day and voters who fail to vote in back-to-back vote-by-mail elections would be removed from the vote-by-mail list.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> This week Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray heard arguments in a lawsuit challenging the state’s <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/mar/12/arkansas-judge-opens-hearing-new-requirement-voter/">voter ID law</a>. The lawsuit by voter Barry Haas contends that the law, enacted last year, circumvents a 2014 Arkansas Supreme Court ruling that struck down a previous voter ID measure. Attorneys for the state say the restriction is a way to verify a voter&#8217;s registration.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> According to the <em>Indianapolis Star</em>, in the latest development in an ongoing lawsuit over <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/03/09/marion-countys-elections-federal-judges-handscould-federal-judge-force-marion-county-add-more-voting/373244002/">early-voting access</a> in the state&#8217;s largest county, plaintiffs have asked&nbsp;U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker to&nbsp;order the Marion County&nbsp;Election Board to add additional voting sites before the May 8&nbsp;primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> A group called The Public Interest Legal Foundation has sued the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to obtain a copy of the state’s <a href="http://wnpv1440.com/2018/03/09/voter-registration-lawsuit-filed/">voter registration records</a>. A spokesman for the organization cited their concern about non-citizens voting as reason for filing the suit.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> A former longtime Metro councilman and current head of the Nashville chapter of the NAACP — who now says he&#8217;s running for mayor — <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/03/12/lawsuit-nashville-mayoral-election-must-may-not-august/416068002/">sued the Davidson County Election Commission</a> on Monday, seeking to force the city to hold Nashville&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/03/09/nashville-mayoral-election-set-august-but-legal-challenge-awaits/410390002/" target="_blank">next mayoral election</a> in May instead of August.&nbsp;The suit argues that the decision to hold the election in August violates the Metro Charter and state law. It seeks an election on&nbsp;either May 1, when the city&#8217;s local primary election is scheduled, or between May 21 and May 25. This week Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/03/14/judge-rules-keep-nashville-mayoral-election-august/423941002/">ruled that the election will be in August</a>.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Isac Dakuyo, 45 of Martinsburg has been charged with <a href="https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/man-accused-of-lying-on-voter-registration-form-in-berkeley/article_be4a9820-23fe-11e8-84a8-e33243e2274c.html">one felony count of perjury</a> for lying on a voter registration form about his citizenship.</p></p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> This week, Secretary of State Alex Padilla announced a <a href="https://www.techwire.net/news/state-using-social-media-site-to-boost-voting.html">partnership with the social media network Nextdoor</a> that will provide election information to the voters in the five counties that are adopting the state’s Voter Choice Act this year. Nextdoor is a free private social network for neighborhoods that&#8217;s available on Web, iOS, and Android. Messages will inform voters about the changes coming to their elections, provide reminders about election deadlines, and direct them to the vote centers in their county. Nextdoor already reaches 92 percent of neighborhoods in the five counties adopting the Voter’s Choice Act in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Wisconsin Election Commission will be rolling out <a href="http://www.wkow.com/story/37717687/2018/03/Tuesday/elections-commission-to-use-electronic-polling-devices">e-poll books</a> in elections next month. “We’re hoping those assessments will be completed by May or June which we believe will give us enough time to implement anything they are able to identify with those assessments,” Meagan Wolfe, Interim Director of the commission told WKOW.</p></p>
