							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Six steps for the 6th</strong><br />
<em>The right actions and words now and on Nov. 6 will increase public trust</em></p>
<p>By Jennifer Morell<br />
Democracy Fund</p>
<p>The work of running an election continues to be under a microscope. Misconceptions and misunderstandings about what election officials do or don’t do seem to be consistently in our daily news feed.</p>
<p>Increasing the public’s trust in your elections is as much about the accuracy and validity of the processes you complete as it is about finding meaningful ways to communicate that work.</p>
<p>Below are six examples of common practices that can be enhanced to strengthen confidence in your election.</p>
<p><strong>Open-door testing.</strong> Showcasing your public logic and accuracy (L&amp;A) test is a great opportunity to explain how your voting system operates and the tests and checks performed to ensure it functions properly during your election. Look beyond the legal language you’re required post and tell the public why it matters and why they should attend. This is also a great time to invite candidates, party officials, and other stakeholders to observe the process and discuss the tremendous amount of preparation going on behind the scenes. Encourage the media to observe and report on your L&amp;A test by giving them the opportunity to get stock footage of election setup.</p>
<p>Also, consider broadcasting the event on social media. Opening your doors to explain the relevance of this test, as a way to ensure the voting equipment is operating correctly and has not been tampered with, is an important element to increasing trust in your election. Finally, think about how you can use<a href="https://electiontools.org/tool/infographic-design/"> infographics</a> to take voters behind the scenes of some of your other critical functions like how<a href="https://www.arapahoevotes.com/sites/default/files/2017-10/2017%20Ballot%20Lifecycle%20Infographic_WhiteBkgrd.pdf"> ballots are processed</a>, results are uploaded, or the process for conducting a post-election audit.</p>
<p><strong>Information ambassadors.</strong> You’ve trained poll workers to check in voters and issue ballots, but have you given them the tools and training to be your election information ambassadors? Poll workers often become the voice and face of your office on Election Day and should be an integral part of your communication plan. Despite their best efforts to do and say the right thing, it only takes one misinformed (or poorly trained) poll worker to sow doubt on the validity of your process.</p>
<p>Have you provided them with clearly defined talking points for the questions they may be asked or scenarios that might come up? Is there a clear channel of communication for notifying you when things don’t go as expected? What are the expectations and guidelines if they are approached by a journalist or challenged by a voter? All of this should be clearly documented in a clear and simple set of guidelines that everyone has at the ready.</p>
<p><strong>Review communication plans.</strong> Communication is a fundamental component of cybersecurity. Most likely you have a plan to communicate a cyber incident with state and federal officials.  Have you mimicked that plan for staff and poll workers in your own office? What is the protocol for someone who sees a suspicious email, misinformation on social media, or suspicious activity with voting equipment? Who is the first line of communication? How will the issue be documented? How will you know if it has been resolved? The Belfer Center’s<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/election-cyber-incident-communications-coordination-guide"> Election Cyber Incident Communications Coordination Guide</a> is a great tool that can be adapted into a local plan. Don’t forget to include protocol for regular check-ins throughout Election Day to ensure things are running smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Master the password problem.</strong> A unique, complex password for every component of your voting system and every user is here to stay. Labels and sticky notes with user names, passwords, and hints are a thing of the past. Nothing will discredit the great work you have done like a visitor spotting a password posted next to your EMS workstation. But with so many usernames and passwords, how can the cybersecure election professional remember them all? A password management system is the answer. If you haven’t seen it already, take the 5 minutes to read and share the Center for Democracy and Technology’s<a href="https://cdt.org/files/2018/09/2018-08-29-Election-Security-Passwords-6.pdf"> field guide for passwords</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Check those forms.</strong> A solid ballot reconciliation process and chain of custody is not only good election practice but should be a critical component for post-election audits and certifying your election. Reconciliation forms and custody logs designed poorly can lead to inaccuracies or incomplete forms. It’s not too late to review the guidelines from the Center for Civic Design for creating<a href="https://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/effective-poll-worker-materials/"> effective poll worker materials</a>. It also helps to have someone outside of your office try and complete the forms unassisted to determine if the instructions are clear and the form follows a logical order.</p>
<p>Once reconciliation forms are returned to the election office is there a clear assignment to validate the information recorded? There is a tendency on Election Night for poll workers to force the math to work so they can be done. Is someone reviewing chain of custody forms and noting any discrepancies? Are they filled out legibly? Both the reconciliation forms and chains of custody logs provide evidence to validate the way your election was conducted. Make sure poll workers and staff understand their relevance to the integrity of the election.</p>
<p><strong>Lights, camera, action!</strong> There is a reason actors rehearse and bands practice. When you only have one day (or a handful of days) to get it right, practice really does make perfect. Nothing sparks doubt about the validity of your election like voters and candidates seeing poll workers or staff disagreeing about a process or providing contradicting statements to the media about your office protocol.  Walking and talking through the motions of your most critical processes ensures everyone gets it right, all the necessary supplies and components are in place, and everyone involved can communicate the process accurately and confidently, especially when you practice the worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>Although you&#8217;re in the weeds of the 2018 midterms, it&#8217;s never too early to start thinking about future elections. Before 2020, some states may adopt risk-limiting audit (RLA) procedures. An important first step in a RLA is thinking about how you organize, track and store paper ballots.</p>
<p>A ballot manifest is a log or spreadsheet showing how individual ballots or batches of ballots are stored. The basic components include fields indicating the ID of each individual scanner, a unique number or precinct for the scanned batch, the total number of ballots scanned in the batch, and an ID number to indicate the container the ballots are stored in. Additional best practices include maintaining standard batch sizes, verifying the number of ballots being scanned prior to scanning [using a precision scale to weigh ballots and get a piece count can be quicker, and more accurate, than having someone hand count each batch], and reconciling the ballot manifest to the number of ballots scanned into the election tabulation system on a regular basis.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how small changes to a routine process can increase voter confidence and trust in your elections.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>According to <em>Politico</em>, there is a new push to get the<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/09/24/secure-elections-act-tries-another-comeback-349699"> Secure Elections Act</a> moving forward. Sen. James Lankford is expected to introduce a revamped version of the bill after the September 30 government funding deadline.  “As I like to say, we’re now fighting over nouns and verbs and prepositions to try to figure exactly how things are working, to make sure it lines up with everyone,” Lankford told Politico.</p>
<p>That being said, Lankford told <em>The Hill</em> that there is<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/408368-lankford-election-security-bill-wont-pass-ahead-of-midterms"> no way</a> the Secure Elections Act will be approved by Congress ahead of the November elections. “The House won’t be here after this week so it’s going to be impossible to get passed,” Lankford said of the bill.</p>
<p>One place where Congress does seem to be moving forward is on the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2018/09/25/the-cybersecurity-202-congress-poised-to-allow-dhs-to-take-the-lead-on-federal-cybersecurity/5ba915ba1b326b7c8a8d162c/?utm_term=.c2fa04d110d7"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act</a>, which has been in the works since the Obama administration, looks like it could be approved by the Senate soon. It was approved by the House last year. Under the bill, the Department of Homeland Security would be given a stand-alone cybersecurity agency, similar the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas has stepped in</strong> on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters in Bexar County who have complained that<a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Election-drainage-ACLU-says-Bexar-County-13257097.php"> Spanish translations</a> for last week’s runoff election made no sense. The Spanish-language materials were translated using Google Translate. “The issue we have with that is that it generates translations that are literal and not always meaningful for the reader,” ACLU legal consultant Matthew McCarthy told the <em>San Antonio News-Express</em>. Specifically, in this case the words “election runoff’ were translated into “election water runoff” in Spanish. The ACLU also sent letters to 35 other counties warning that they could be violating the Voting Rights Act for not providing sufficient Spanish translation.</p>
<p>A<strong> report from the<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2018/09/21/county-audit-blames-faulty-equipment-no-back-up-plan-for-election-day-mishaps/"> Maricopa County, Arizona auditor’s office</a> </strong>has concluded that malfunctioning voting equipment and the lack of a back-up plan led to 62 polling locations opening late during Arizona’s August primary. According to the <em>Arizona Capitol Times</em>, The Maricopa County Internal Audit Department conducted a review of the election-day problems and found they were tied to the county e-poll books and ballot printing system. In a written response to the auditor’s report, the recorder’s office said that it had already addressed many of the issues and disputed some others. The<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/26/arizona-election-day-issues-maricopa-county-recorder-adrian-fontes-insight/1420986002/"> contractor</a> working with Maricopa County has released a report to The Arizona Republic saying when their technicians arrived, they found a plethora of problems.</p>
<p><strong>The Wisconsin State Elections Commission has unanimously agreed</strong> to allow local clerks to<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/25/21-000-milwaukee-voters-go-back-rolls/1420715002/"> reinstate the voter registrations</a> of thousands of Wisconsinites who were removed last year. For the city of Milwaukee that means about 21,000 people will be returned to the rolls.</p>
<p><strong>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla announced</strong> this week that<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/200K-16-And-17-Year-Olds-Have-Pre-Registered-To-13256892.php"> 209,577 16- and 17-year-olds have pre-registered to vote</a>. According to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, since the state’s statewide voter registration database was certified in 2016, more than 104,00 of the pre-registered teens have turned 18 and are now eligible to vote.</p>
<p><strong>A recent poll by the University of North Florida</strong> has found overwhelming support for Amendment 4 on Florida’s November ballot. Under Amendment 4, Floridians with felony convictions would<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-felon-voting-rights-poll-20180924-story.html"> automatically have their rights restored</a> upon completion of their sentence or probation. The poll found that 71 percent of potential voters support the amendment. It needs 60 percent approval to pass. According to the <em>Orlando Sentinel</em>, The referendum was placed on the ballot following a statewide petition campaign by Orlando resident Desmond Meade and his group Floridians for Fair Democracy, which successfully gathered more than 799,000 certified signatures. “We are excited that Amendment 4, through the hard work of an energetic grassroots movement, is uniting Floridians across the Sunshine State under the simple belief: when a debt is paid, its paid,” Meade said in a statement. “Regardless of party, gender, or race, Floridians strongly support Amendment 4.”</p>
<p><strong>In other news from the Sunshine State,</strong> Floridians are facing one of the longest ballots they have ever seen and many supervisors of elections have been encouraging voters to vote-by-mail or vote early. To bring home just how long the ballot is — four feet —<a href="https://www.voteseminole.org/"> Seminole County Supervisor of Elections</a> Michael Ertel, who is 6’1 and Assistant Supervisor of Elections Rebecca Quinn, who is 5’1 stood with the ballot between them. Hopefully everyone in Florida is busy studying their sample ballots and voter guides.</p>

							<h2>Legislative News</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: U.S. Sen. Tom Udall (D-New Mexico), vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D- Minnesota.), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, introduced<a href="https://www.ladailypost.com/content/udall-klobuchar-introduce-resolution-recognizing-50th-anniversary-indian-civil-rights-act"> S. Res. 631, a Senate resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Indian Civil Rights Act</a> and the importance of expanding voting rights access for American Indians and Alaska Natives.  “This resolution recognizes the resilience and determination of Native peoples in the United States in their fight for equal access to the polls,” Udall said in a statement. “Time after time, for centuries, Native Americans have been denied their fundamental right to make their voices heard in our democracy. And, time after time, Native voters have successfully fought – in the courts and in the halls of Congress – to secure their constitutionally guaranteed right to exercise the franchise.”</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Jerry Brown recently signed Assembly Bill No. 2218 into law which will require the secretary of state’s office to come up with an optional<a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2018/sep/24/2020-people-voting-mail-will-be-able-track-their-b/"> ballot tracking system</a> for counties.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Under House Bill 4671, state election law would be changed to allow a city or township to<a href="https://www.michigansthumb.com/news/article/Bill-could-shuffle-election-duties-for-area-clerks-13248309.php"> engage its county clerk or the state Bureau of Elections</a> to handle the maintenance of their voter registration database. It would also allow the city or township to engage its county clerk or the clerk of another city or township to administer election-related administrative matters on its behalf.</p>
<p>The Michigan House has approved legislation that would allow Michigan to offer<a href="http://www.wkar.org/post/online-voter-registration-passes-state-house#stream/0"> online voter registration</a>. The bill was approved with bipartisan support and moves now to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Sen. Sam Thompson has introduced a bill that would<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/thompson-introduces-vote-fraud-bill/"> expand penalties</a> for voter fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The Butler County commission unanimously approved a new policy that will allow voters to take their cell phones with them into the polling place and to take<a href="http://butlerradio.com/cell-phones-now-allowed-inside-butler-co-voting-precincts/"> ballot selfies</a>.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> The Arkansas Supreme Court hear oral arguments last week on the legality of the state’s<a href="https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2018/09/20/voter-id-law-before-the-arkansas-supreme-court"> voter ID law</a>. According to the <em>Arkansas Times</em>, Jeff Priebe, attorney for the plaintiff, argued that the 2017 law was an attempt to circumvent a similar law passed in 2014 that was struck down by the Arkansas Supreme Court. A change was made that allowed voters who didn&#8217;t have an ID to cast a provisional ballot and sign an affidavit and the vote is supposed to be counted unless other problems are found.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Secretary of State Brian Kemp has filed a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/georgia-officials-to-appeal-paper-ballot-ruling-to-11th-circuit/"> notice of appeal</a> after U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ruled that although there will be no paper ballots in November, the Coalition of Good Governance had validly stated a claim that the machines used in the state’s election are vulnerable to hacking the case may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> U.S. District Judge Brian Wimes has ordered Missouri officials to<a href="http://www.kcur.org/post/judge-orders-missouri-officials-comply-motor-voter-law#stream/0"> provide voter registration information</a> to residents seeking to update their addresses at motor vehicle offices or by mail. According to KCUR, Wimes ordered the state to begin doing so immediately.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Lizaida Camis, 55 of Hoboken has been charged with violating the Travel Act for causing mail to be used to aid<a href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2018/09/hoboken_woman_conducted_vote_by_mail_bribery_schem.html"> voter bribery</a>. Camis allegedly paid voters $50 in 2013 to apply for mail ballots and then cast them for candidates that she worked for at the time.</p>
<p>Also in New Jersey, an appellate court has ordered the Passaic County clerk’s office to<a href="https://www.tapinto.net/articles/judge-rules-ballot-designed-by-passaic-county-clerk-illegal"> draft new ballots</a> for November 6 saying the clerk’s decision to include blank columns on the ballots of 15 of the county’s 16 towns was unlawful.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Spencer McKinnon, 20, has been charged with<a href="http://www.fosters.com/news/20180926/man-20-charged-with-double-voting-in-durham-and-mass"> voting in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts</a> in the 2016 general election. He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: In a split decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit suspended a federal judge’s April ruling mandating the state accepts IDs and supplemental documentation with a current mailing address as<a href="http://grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4503700-appeals-court-ruling-setback-native-americans-challenging-north"> proof of ID in order to vote</a>. According to the <em>Grand Forks Herald</em>, the appeals court noted North Dakota is the only state without voter registration and has a “legitimate interest in requiring identification and a showing of current residence to prevent voter fraud and to safeguard voter confidence.” It said the state would be “irreparably harmed” without a stay as requested by Secretary of State Al Jaeger.</p>
<p>Also in North Dakota, Hannan Yassin Aboubaker of Shakopee, Minnesota entered an Alford plea on a Class A misdemeanor “<a href="http://www.brainerddispatch.com/news/crime-and-courts/4504377-minnesota-woman-pleads-guilty-rare-north-dakota-double-voting-case">election offense</a>”. Aboubaker was accused of submitting an absentee ballot in Minnesota as well as voting in person in Fargo.</p>
