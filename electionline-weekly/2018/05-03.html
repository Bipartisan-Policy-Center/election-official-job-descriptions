							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself from phishing</strong><br /><em>Variety of ways available to protect personal and professional email</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Next week, the <a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, in partnership with <a href="http://www.reed.edu/">Reed College</a>, will release into the wild a new survey for local election officials (LEOs). The <a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/blog">survey</a> is looking to understand LEO’s views about roles, responsibilities and challenges of their work as well as amplify the voices LEOs in national, regional and state conversations about election administration.</p>
<p>Hours of work have gone into determine what information the survey will seek to find out and developing the questions.</p>
<p>And in today’s hyper sensitive cybersecurity environment, almost as many hours have gone into determining how the survey should be conducted so those who receive it feel secure in responding to unsolicited emails.</p>
<p>According to Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the <a href="https://cdt.org/">Center for Democracy and Technology</a>, phishing is one of the number one threats in cybersecurity, not just to election officials, but to everyone.</p>
<p>“It’s consistently the tactic used to get into systems around the world and we have evidence that it was likely how credentials to the Arizona voter registration database were stolen and then put up for sale on the dark web.” Hall said.</p>
<p>Hall said we know from the Reality Winner leak that around 120 state and local election officials were spear-phished &#8212; which is targeted phishing rather than opportunistic phishing &#8212; by Russian military intelligence (the GRU).</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, even with good training we are only able to reduce phishing attacks to about 50 percent, meaning there&#8217;s a good chance 60 or so election officials clicked on links or opened attachments sent by the Russians,” Hall said. “Hopefully those jurisdictions know now that they were targeted and have taken measures to mitigate phishing attacks.”</p>
<p>And phishing is so successful because as Hall said, it relies on social engineering. Essentially, rather than trying to find a flaw in the technical security of a system, ne’er-do-wells lean on the human element and try to get access to data, systems or install malware by tricking people into thinking they must click on a link or attachment or lulling them into a sense of security so that they click out of habit.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have to tell your readers that as more people come online, we can all expect to receive more email, meaning that the sheer scale of this problem is not going to get better as people are inundated in coming years with email,” Hall said. “And email, for all of its flaws &#8212; it is very difficult to secure &#8212; is still the lowest common denominator in terms of communicating online. As we move away from email and to messaging platforms like Signal/WhatsApp/Wickr/etc, email may become less of a problem.”</p>
<p>So how can you know if an email is safe to open and a link OK to click on? Short of picking up the phone and calling the sender — and who wants to do that?! — Hall had several things that people can do to ensure their online safety:</p>
<p>1. Be aware. Does a given email seem fishy? For example, did you just get an email that says, &#8220;Bob would like to share something on Dropbox&#8221; but you don&#8217;t use Dropbox to share files? That&#8217;s a good sign that you might want to wait and call Bob. Also, there may be obvious flaws in the message&#8230; for example, we once caught a phishing attempt from Chinese hackers because they misspelled the name of the staffer they were masquerading as.</p>
<p>2. Much more important than awareness is eliminating entirely the ability for you or your staff to get phished. It&#8217;s very important that for business systems and personal accounts that you turn on something called two-factor authentication. Two-factor is something you are probably already familiar with and may not realize it; for example, when you log into your bank while traveling, they may require you to enter in a temporary PIN number that they text to your phone. Why is this important? Because it&#8217;s highly unlikely that an attacker would have both your password and your phone, making it much harder for them to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://twofactorauth.org/">handy list</a> of all the online services that allow you to turn on two-factor. And common business operating systems (Windows/365, Google/Gsuite, Mac OS, Linux) all support some kind of two-factor so that you can enforce it across all your staff.</p>
<p>3. At some point, we all need to think hard about adopting an email standard called DMARC. DMARC, put simply, is a way to make sure that email from your domain cannot be spoofed. It essentially uses cryptography to &#8220;sign&#8221; good messages from all users on a domain like&nbsp;<a href="http://cdt.org/">cdt.org</a>. This means phishing attempts can&#8217;t provide that kind of mathematical proof (because they can&#8217;t log on to the system yet!) and all spoofing-based phishing attacks never even reach potential victim&#8217;s inboxes.</p>
<p>4. Finally, you may have seen some people have email programs that put a layer of indirection between the user and the URL&#8230; that is, some businesses use what is called &#8220;link rewriting&#8221; software like that provided by <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/essentials-URL-Defense-upgrade">Proofpoint</a>. This works by allowing their software to scan all email as it arrives and it replaces every URL with something that looks like&nbsp;<a href="https://proofpoint.com/check=http:/example.com">https://proofpoint.com/check=http://example.com</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>What happens here is that when someone clicks on it, there is a moment where Proofpoint can check the URL against know malware and phishing domains and warn the user or even prevent them from visiting the suspicious URL.</p>
<p>All of Hall’s recommendations are possible for personal and work email. He also recommended that elections officials put their own personal accounts into the <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Google Advanced Protection Program</a>, which is designed to entirely eliminate phishing attacks—even from nation-states.</p>
<p>“This isn&#8217;t available for more than personal Google/GMail accounts right now, but personal accounts are often used to get access to institutional accounts, so this is a great place for election officials to start in terms of state-of-the-art protections,” Hall explained.</p>
<p>For the Democracy Fund/Reed College survey, administrators are taking a multi-pronged approach to reassure LEOs that the emails they will receive next week are legit.</p>
<p>In addition to the survey email, which will come directly from <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>, the survey administrator, an email will come from Paul Gronke, director of the <a href="http://earlyvoting.net/">Early Voting Information Center</a> and professor at Reed College, to let survey respondents know they have been selected to respond and they should keep an eye-out for the survey.</p>
<p>The Democracy Fund/Reed College team has been in direct contact with the <a href="https://www.nased.org/">National Association of State Election Directors</a> and the <a href="http://www.naco.org/">National Association of Counties</a>, who agreed to communicate with their members. They have also given a heads up to the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>, the <a href="http://www.nass.org/">National Association of Secretaries of State</a> and the <a href="http://iaogo.org/">International Association of Government Officials</a>.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached out to several validators who can let LEOs know that the survey is coming, and more importantly, that the survey is from a trusted source,” explained Natalie Adona, senior research and learning associate for the Elections Program at the Democracy Fund. “We certainly respect that election officials across this country have real, ongoing concerns around cybersecurity&#8211;which includes (but isn’t limited to) email phishing attempts. We realize that some LEOs will not have heard of Democracy Fund or Reed College, and might be skeptical about opening-up a link contained in an email from someone/organization that they don’t know.”</p>

							<h2>Mobile Voting</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Mobile Voting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five ways to make sure mobile voting works for you and your voters</strong></p>
<p>By Paul McGrane, chief deputy clerk and<br />David Levine, elections director<br /><a href="https://adacounty.id.gov/elections/Home">Ada County, Idaho</a></p>
<p>Ada County, Idaho (which includes Boise) introduced food truck voting &#8212; aka mobile voting &#8212; in 2016, and it was an instant hit. Early voting records were set, and voters from across the county expressed their appreciation for the added convenience. Rather than waiting until Election Day, or trekking to city hall to vote early, voters could cast ballots before grocery shopping, after going to the library, or on their lunch breaks. But that success was not pre-ordained. Here are 5 factors to consider when weighing – and implementing &#8212; mobile voting.</p>
<p>1) Check the Law<br />Be familiar with the polling place requirements in your jurisdiction. Is a mobile polling station permitted? If it does, what are the laws governing when and how you can use it? It’s not just election law &#8212; if you need to be ADA compliant, you have to make sure your mobile unit meets the requirements.</p>
<p>2) Make sure you have access to Utilities<br />You need power for lighting, HVAC, and equipment. Where reliable power is not available, you have to carefully weigh the costs of alternative solutions.</p>
<p>If you have the money, purchasing a generator for the mobile voting unit can help ensure that it is up and running the entire time it is available to the public. If you don’t, make sure you have enough cable to reach the power source at each location you’ll be using and that the source has enough capacity. If capacity is limited, a short could occur, preventing the mobile voting unit from operating at its maximum level.</p>
<p>Costs can be kept down by limiting voting operations to daylight hours. Extending mobile voting unit hours into the evening can require enhanced or emergency lighting equipment, which costs money and may entail additional training. &nbsp;This makes places that offer lighting at night – such as shopping center parking lots –good candidates. And for your people’s sake make sure there are restrooms in the vicinity.</p>
<p>3) Assess the Need<br />More and more jurisdictions are offering early voting. In most jurisdictions, an early voter can cast his or her ballot in person, at a “normal” polling place open for early voting, or by mail. For jurisdictions that offer several ways to vote early and are compact or have many early voting locations, mobile voting may not be a high priority.</p>
<p>But if you offer fewer opportunities to vote early and/or have many voters that live far from early voting polling places, mobile voting can help maximize the number of citizens who successfully cast a ballot.</p>
<p>4) Plan and Rehearse<br /> Carefully plan how mobile voting will be administered. Choose locations that will welcome a mobile voting unit, don’t appear to favor some candidates over others, and offer plenty of parking.</p>
<p>Make sure there are at least two knowledgeable election workers at the mobile station, one of whom is an experienced manager who can ensure that the process goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Staffing efficiency can be enhanced (and costs reduced) by having one of your poll workers double as the driver of the mobile unit. Make sure that the RV (if that’s what you use) is in good operating condition and that the first time the worker drives it is not the first day s/he is staffing it in an election.</p>
<p>5) Get the Word Out<br /> Mobile voting only works if voters know about it so they can use it. As you do with all of your conventional early polling places, put out information in the press and on social media (it’s 2018) about the mobile voting unit, especially where it will be at what times on what days. In the year you first use a mobile unit you can expect extra media and public interest. Take advantage of it!</p>
<p>Information about where and when mobile voting is being offered, and who can do mobile voting, is critical. In Ada County, voters who can take advantage of mobile voting are continuously reminded that any eligible Ada County voter can use the mobile facility because it operates like an ordinary early voting site, and early voting sites may be used by any Ada County voter (unlike Election Day, when voters can only vote in their assigned precincts).</p>
<p>Implemented carefully after solid planning, mobile voting is a potential godsend for election administrators. It increases the convenience of voting, and election officials control access to it, unlike traditional polling places, where access is often controlled by someone who works in the building. It can also serve as an emergency backup – an alternate polling place if a regular location becomes inaccessible on Election Day due to a building mishap or power outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/04/tom_schedler_resigns_as_secret.html">Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler</a> (R) has announced that he will resign</strong> from office next week. His decision comes after an employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Schedler in February. Shedler, who has been on the job since 2010 has previously announced that he would not seek re-election. Kyle Ardoin, Schedler’s first assistant, will replace him until an election can be held for a new secretary of state—most likely to coincide with the November 6 election.</p>
<p><strong>On Tuesday night, the Knox County, Tennessee elections </strong><a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/05/01/deliberate-cyberattack-crashes-knox-county-election-website-officials-say/571557002/"><strong>website crashed</strong> due a “deliberate” and widespread” cyberattack</a>, officials told The <em>Knoxville News Sentinel</em>. The site went down around 8pm and no vote tallies were affected, just the public’s ability to seek election results on the county’s site. The website appeared to come back online just before 9 p.m., and it ran smoothly — for the most part — for the rest of the night. The county had 11 security experts working to resolve the problem.&nbsp;According to Richard Moran, the IT director for the county, the site crashed from a massive amount of traffic that appeared to be coming from “many, many servers all over the country and all over the world.”</p>
<p><strong>Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman (R) has asked Gov. Jay Inslee (D) for <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/politics/article/Connelly-Wyman-asks-authority-for-prepaid-12876461.php">emergency spending authority</a></strong> in order to fund prepaid postage for the 2018 election cycle. In her request, Wyman argued that what’s good for one county — King, which is considering paying return postage — should be <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/secretary-of-state-urges-king-county-to-postpone-prepaid-postage-plan-for-mail-in-ballots/">good for all counties</a>. &#8220;The reality is, while this decision may appear to only affect King County voters, it has a statewide impact on the remaining counties,&#8221; Wyman said according to the <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em>. “We have to treat every voter in the state fairly and equally, and do everything we can to avoid confusing voters.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In New York, about 930 voters responded to a field survey</strong> by Senate Democrats trying to find out <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/04/30/more-new-yorkers-would-vote-if-elections-were-on-a-weekend/">what would make them more likely to vote</a>. According to the survey, 62 percent said they’d be more inclined to do so if an election was held on a weekend. And 79 percent said they would be more likely to vote if polling places were open for multiple days prior to Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, in Vigo County, Indiana, the school corporation has </strong><a href="http://www.pharostribune.com/indiana/news/article_4e6abd1a-4513-5360-bf51-c1cdd14a22e2.html"><strong>finally found a way</strong> to get students to the polls</a>. After the corporation decided not to bus the students, the superintendent committed to getting the students there and this week two central office administrators took students in their personal cars to the Vigo County Annex, where early voting was occurring, during lunch period so the students wouldn’t miss school. At Terre Haute North, on primary day, a school protection officer will walk the students to a nearby vote center during lunch. Following the 2018 primary, the school superintendent will meet with area high school students and the county clerk to try and <a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/vigo-schools-helps-transport-students-polls-taxpayer-money-146583/">come up with a permanent plan</a>. “I think it’s important to have this meeting, to craft something for the future that we have in place so we can think about not taking school time to vote, but have kids more involved,” Danny Tanoos told Indiana public radio.</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> The Voter Registration Individuals Criminal Justice Act passed the House Committee on State, Veterans and Military Affairs committee last week by a 4-3 vote. Under the bill, parolees would be <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/colorado-bill-aims-to-register-10000-parolees-to-vote/">pre-registered and automatically be able to vote</a> upon completion of their sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> House Majority Whip John Viola has introduced HB 400 which would allow residents of Delaware to <a href="http://www.wmdt.com/news/delaware/bill-introduced-to-allow-for-same-day-registration/737632910">register and vote on the same day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> A bill creating a pilot <a href="http://www.thegardenisland.com/2018/04/29/hawaii-news/vote-by-mail-bill-moves-on-at-legislature/">vote-by-mail</a> program on the island of Kauai for the 2020 election cycle passed out of a state Legislature conference committee.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Rep. Russ Jennings (R-Lakin) has introduced a bill that would <a href="http://kcur.org/post/kansas-legislature-wont-stick-kobach-contempt-bill-after-all#stream/0">prohibit the use any state money</a> for defense or penalties involved in a finding of contempt of court by state elected officials. &#8220;You pay your own bills if you get yourself in that kind of trouble,&#8221; Jennings told the <em>Kansas City Star</em>. The bill was approved 103-16. The provision was removed from the budget during negotiations with the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has <a href="http://www.themoreheadnews.com/news/bevin-vetoes-five-bills/article_19ba9a06-4a34-11e8-a0ae-b3831ecbe473.html">vetoed</a> House Bill 274 that would have altered the time to request an absentee ballot. Bevin’s veto message said it cuts in half the time to request an absentee ballot and he doesn’t support any additional burden on the right to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The Northampton city council is debating a resolution that, if approved, would have the council petition the state Legislature to officially <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/05/northampton_city_council_to_co_6.html">lower the voting age</a> in Northampton to 16.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: House Bill 1264 has been approved by the Senate. The bill attempts to clear up state <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/bill-restrict-voting-eligibility-advances-sununus-position-remains-unclear#stream/0">residency clauses</a> in order to register to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Sens. Joe Fain (R-Auburn) and Mark Mullet (D-Issaquah) plan to introduce legislation ahead of the 2019 session that would make the state <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/politics/senators-announce-legislation-to-pre-pay-mail-in-ballots/281-546640176">pay for return postage</a> on all ballots. A similar bill was introduced in the 2017-2018 session and died in the Senate Ways and Means committee. That bill had an estimated price tag of almost $3 million.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray ruled that when the General Assembly created the state’s <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/apr/27/long-awaited-ruling-puts-hold-on-state-/?f=news-arkansas">voter ID requirement</a>, it inserted an unsupportable contradiction into the state constitution. The 57-page order bars further enforcement of the ID requirement at least until a full trial can be held to determine the constitutionality of the law. The state <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/arkansas-judge-blocks-states-revived-voter-id-law/2018/04/26/83379096-49ae-11e8-8082-105a446d19b8_story.html?utm_term=.4fbadd6601e2">appealed</a> the ruling and late this week the Arkansas Supreme Court, in a 6-1 ruling, said that <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/arkansas-supreme-court-says-state-can-enforce-voter-id-law-ap_national656a45047efc4e9d998a61de714ad892">may enforce</a> the voter ID law for the upcoming May 22 primary.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The American Civil Rights Union is <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sb-acru-appeals-snipes-decision-broward-elections-20180430-story.html">appealing the ruling</a> of U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom that found Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes was following the state’s requirements to remove voters from the rolls. The group had argued in court that Snipes’ office was not moving quickly enough to remove those who had moved, died or otherwise become ineligible to vote. The ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> At a federal court hearing this week, voter advocacy groups argued that the state’s participation in Crosscheck will <a href="http://wbaa.org/post/federal-judge-hears-case-indiana-voter-list-maintenance-law#stream/0">illegally remove Hoosiers from the voter rolls</a>. According to WBAA, attorneys for the state argue the groups’ lawsuit is premature and speculative because the state hasn’t yet been able to use Crosscheck this year.</p>
