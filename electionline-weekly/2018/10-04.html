							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The long and the short of it</strong><br />
<em>Jurisdictions dealing with particularly long ballots this election</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline</p>
<p>The ballot in Seminole County, Florida is 56 inches long. If it was a human it would be tall enough to ride all the rides at Disney World, even Space Mountain!</p>
<p>In Pasco County, Florida, the double-sided 17-inch ballot could only ride a handful of amusement park rides, but at 34-inches long, it’s still a long one.</p>
<p>Longer ballots may lead to Election Day lines and in some jurisdictions could lead to a slower process on election night. Especially long ballots in the 2018 election cycle are forcing elections officials and voters alike to rethink how they cast and process their ballots.</p>
<p>“The longer ballot won&#8217;t directly delay results,” explained Michael Ertel, supervisor of elections for Seminole County. “But longer ballots do mean longer lines of voters.  At 7 p.m., those longer lines could mean the precinct will close later, thus the results would only be reported after the polling place closes.”</p>
<p>Brian Corley, supervisor of elections in Pasco County has also been stressing the importance of sample ballots.</p>
<p>“We have been and will continue to preach the importance of voters being #ElectionReady and each voter is sent a sample ballot in which they can do the research on the candidates and issues and show up to vote and by simply transposing their selections from their sample ballot to the actual ballot, it will greatly speed up the process for them and the other voters behind them.”</p>
<p>Ertel said the two-page ballot has also caused a significant change to the county’s spoiled ballot procedure for poll workers.</p>
<p>And elections officials in Florida are not alone. From coast to coast voters and election administrators will be faced with long ballots this year.</p>
<p>In St. Louis County, Missouri, voters will be faced with a 19-inch, front and back ballot, which may be the longest ballot in the county’s history. In addition to numerous candidates, there will also be 15 countywide questions/propositions for voters to wade through.</p>
<p>Eric Fey, the Democratic Director of Elections for St. Louis County said the elections office’s paramount concern was keeping the ballot on one page since voters and poll workers have never experienced a two card ballot. As a result they altered the font size on the ballot in addition to eliminating some headings. This is not optimal, but Fey said they thought having two pieces of paper was even worse.</p>
<p>“It is not costing us anything extra to print these ballots, but it is wreaking havoc with our ability to print in house and fold the ballots,” Fey said. “Our in house ballot on demand printers have a very difficult time duplexing (printing front and back) the 19” ballot. As a result, we have ordered more absentee ballots from our printer.”</p>
<p>Fey said the folding of the absentee ballots will make running these through the scanner problematic and it may very well take extra time to scan these ballots. That being said, Fey does not anticipate it taking any longer to process the ballots on election.</p>
<p>“What we are more worried about is the amount of time it will take people to vote. Missouri is an excuse only absentee state which means 90 percent of voters vote at their polling place on Election Day. We deploy DRE’s and paper ballots to every polling place. We don’t have any additional DRE’s to send out, so we anticipate a higher than normal amount voters switching over to paper ballots when the lines for the DRE’s get long,” Fey said. “We are sending additional paper ballots and voting booths to hopefully accommodate the influx. We have been timing some our absentee voters so far and it has been taking an average of about 9 minutes to complete the ballot.”</p>
<p>Voters in Denver will face their longest ballot since the state moved to a vote center/vote-by-mail format. In addition to candidates, the three-card ballot also includes multiple local initiatives. Denver Elections will spend about an additional $114,200 to print the ballot.</p>
<p>Although the city is vote-by-mail/vote center, Denver Elections has been very proactive about encouraging voters to complete their ballots at home and drop them off, early. State law allows Denver Elections to begin processing ballots before Election Day.</p>
<p>“As usual, we are advising voters to not wait until the last minute to vote. We have 28 24-Hour Ballot Drop-off Boxes available starting October 15 and most of our Vote Centers offer drive-through ballot drop-off, so there is no reason to wait until Election Day,” explained Alton Dillard, spokesman for Denver Elections. “If you’ll pardon the pun, you reach a point of diminishing returns when you grind through into Wednesday morning with the vote count so we are planning to wrap the count at Midnight and get our team rested so they can resume the count Wednesday morning.”</p>
<p>Dillard said in his meetings with local news room management he’s warning them about the three card ballot. The ballot itself contains language asking the voters to vote all cards and all sides as do the ballot instructions, which is a switch from the primary where unaffiliated voters were instructed to only return one ballot card. Dillard said Denver Elections will also continue to do strong social media campaigns once the ballots drop in a week or so.</p>
<p>In Yellowstone County, Montana, Elections Administrator Bret Rutherford has gone on the offensive with expectations about results. The county has a two-page ballot with the front page being candidate races and the back being initiatives. Rutherford<a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/regional_news/two-page-ballot-in-yellowstone-county-will-take-an-extra/article_c36b76c9-36da-503d-81d9-d7a16421f8d1.html"> announced</a> recently that the results from page one of the ballot will be available on election night and the results from page two will come the next day.</p>
<p>“The majority of the public interest will be for the races,” Rutherford said. “The second sheet has two initiatives.”</p>
<p>It will cost the county about $25,000 extra to print the ballot and despite the added time to count the ballots, Rutherford doesn’t anticipate it will take any longer for voters to vote on Election Day.</p>
<p>“Two pages will not affect the lines on election day,” Rutherford said. “We have plenty of overflow areas to use if people are in the booths for extended time.”</p>
<p>Additionally, a majority of the county’s voters typically cast their ballot by mail.</p>
<p><strong>Planning for the future</strong><br />
While ballots are now complete for the 2018 election, as more and more jurisdictions move to consolidate elections and voters are facing numerous initiatives, it’s never too soon to start thinking about the next long ballot.</p>
<p>Dana Chisnell and Whitney Quesenbery with the<a href="https://civicdesign.org/"> Center for Civic Design</a> have some great advice for elections officials.</p>
<p>“The most important message is to keep each contest on same page in a single column,” Quesenbery said. “Splitting a contest is the single biggest way to cause errors, because voters will often mark a candidate in each part of the contest.”</p>
<p>Citing the 2018 California primary with more than 28 candidates running for governor, Quesenbery said there were a few things that helped but did not completely solve the over-voting problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong headers extending across the 2 columns</li>
<li>Darker lines around the contests to emphasize the boundary</li>
<li>Stronger message in the header emphasizing the number of candidates.</li>
<li>Nothing else in the columns with the large contests</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the header for the large contests take up extra vertical space, so they call attention to themselves, and set the contest off from the one next to it.</p>
<p>With many counties being forced to move to two cards to accommodate all the candidates and ballot questions, Chisnell and Quesenbery said it’s important how elections officials talk about the ballot itself. Reinforce the number of pages and not the number of cards for example.</p>
<p>“Because the ballots are double-sided, the second most important thing is to put a navigation prompt at the bottom of the right hand column if at all possible. The typical banner across the bottom doesn’t work. It’s basically invisible,” Chisnell said. “In a study we (and friends) did in 2008 in Sarasota County, even the poll workers were unlikely to vote the second side without the prompt at the bottom of the column (versus then bottom of the card).”</p>
<p>There is more great advice in the Center for Civic Design’s Field Guide:<a href="https://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/designing-usable-ballots/"> Designing usable ballots</a>.</p>
<p>Two things everyone interviewed agreed about are open lines of communications with voters about what to expect at the polls and afterwards and if at all possible, vote-by-mail.</p>
<p>“Oh! AND — They should encourage people to vote by mail if at all possible because longer ballots will probably cause longer lines at the polling place,” Chisnell said in parting.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>According to Martin Matishak with <em>Politico</em>, the timeline for approving the<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/10/02/secure-elections-act-in-limbo-359335"> Secure Elections Act</a> is quickly slipping to 2019. The House is on recess until after the election the Senate is focused on judicial nominations. Also, Sen. James Lankford isn’t sure the revamped legislation would be ready for the post-election lame duck session.</p>
<p>At this point it’s getting the text done. And when we get the text done, get it moved,” Lankford told <em>Politico</em> last week. “I know that doesn’t sound like a deadline &#8230; If we can get it in the lame-duck, great. If we have to wait until early in the next session, great.”</p>
<p>In happier news, speaking at a cybersecurity event hosted by <em>The Washington Post</em>, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen highlighted many of the<a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2018/10/02/nielsen-election-cyber-dhs.aspx"> improvements in information sharing</a> across the federal government and with state and local officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, the information sharing is much stronger than it even has been before,&#8221; Nielsen said when asked what had changed in the department&#8217;s approach since 2016 according to <em>FCW</em>. &#8220;So [we&#8217;re] working very closely with the intel community, and the moment that we see something significant we are &#8212; in conjunction with the IC &#8212; sharing with our state and local partners. The sharing is quicker, faster, more tailored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also at the summit, Nielsen said DHS hasn’t seen any signs that<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2018/10/03/the-cybersecurity-202-no-indication-china-intends-to-interfere-with-midterm-elections-homeland-security-secretary-nielsen-says/5bb384431b326b7c8a8d17c5/?utm_term=.42053871eb73"> China</a> is seeking to interfere in the midterm elections by targeting election infrastructure.</p>
<p>This week, the Senate has approved the authorization of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) which would create an independent agency within the Department of Homeland Security—similar to FEMA. The legislation now must be taken up by the House.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>It happens every year, including this year.</strong> Voters get unsolicited voter registration forms in the mail, sometimes addressed to deceased family members or even pets. But in 2018 scam artists have taken it a whole different level, by calling voters instead of contacting them via mail. Officials in several states including<a href="https://www.kivitv.com/news/voter-registration-phone-scam-hits-idaho"> Idaho</a>,<a href="https://foxillinois.com/news/local/states-attorney-warns-of-voter-registration-scam"> Illinois</a>,<a href="http://www.desototimes.com/news/sham-voter-registration-calls-received/article_073876a0-c761-11e8-baea-27934bc62407.html"> Mississippi</a>, and<a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/politics/elections/turbovote-scam-asks-for-your-voter-registration-information/281-600576709"> Washington</a> have reported that voters are receiving calls from someone claiming to work with TurboVote and seeking personal information to register the resident and/or to send them an absentee ballot. Elections officials in the states where residents have received the calls are encouraging them to reach out to their offices or the local authorities. The National Association of Secretaries of State and The National Association of State Election Directors have reached out to their members to warn them about the scam and many statewide officials including those in<a href="https://www.klfy.com/news/local/louisiana-secretary-of-state-warns-of-potential-voter-registration-scam/1492899140"> Louisiana</a>,<a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/watch-out-for-voter-registration-phone-scam/23572701"> Maine</a>,  and<a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/state-election-board-warns-of-voter-registration-phone-scam"> Oklahoma</a> have reached out to state and local media to alert the public. On Thursday, TurboVote put out a<a href="https://www.democracy.works/blog/2018/10/4/alert-phone-scammers-pretending-to-be-turbovote"> statement</a>, which in part says, “While we are still gathering the facts, it appears that a scam is being perpetrated in our name. We recognize the seriousness of this issue and wanted to assure you that we are cooperating with state and local election officials, along with federal law enforcement, to provide whatever assistance possible as they pursue relevant leads.”</p>
<p><strong>Although the plaintiffs are seeking a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court</strong>, North Dakota is<a href="http://www.tribtown.com/2018/10/01/us-voter-id-north-dakota-4/"> moving ahead with plans to implement its voter ID law</a> in the November election. The law requires residents to provide a street address although some residents living on Reservations don’t have traditional street addresses and rely on post office boxes. The secretary of state’s office has notified the state’s five tribes about the law and how residents can obtain a no-cost residential street address. Tribal members need to contact the local 911 coordinator for a street address. Rolette County Emergency Coordinator Mike Stewart told <em>The Tribune</em> that residential street addresses have been assigned in 99 percent of the county including on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. Stewart said many people don’t necessarily realize they’ve been assigned a street address, which is where the secretary of state’s campaign comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson is encouraging county elections offices</strong> to<a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/lawson-urges-counties-to-approve-faulty-absentee-ballot-applications-sent-by-democratic-party.php"> accept faulty absentee ballot applications</a> that were sent out by the state Democratic Party. According to Indiana Public Media, state law requires applications for absentee ballots to include instructions about how to submit them. But applications distributed by the Indiana Democratic Party didn’t. And some counties denied some of those applications when voters submitted them. “If you got a mailing from the Indiana Democratic Party and in that mailing was an application for an absentee ballot, that you need to double check that your application is good and you will be receiving a ballot,” Lawson said. Lawson said she wants to ensure voters aren&#8217;t disenfranchised by the mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Although New York City is the most populous city in the country</strong>, only about 55 percent of New Yorkers went to the polls for the 2016 general election and Mayor Bill de Blasio has a plan, or in this case, a person, to fight voter apathy. This week de Blasio created the position of<a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/02/de-blasio-creates-165k-job-that-encourages-people-to-vote/"> chief democracy officer</a>, a $165,000-per-year position. But don’t look for a position description in the Job Postings, the slot has already been filled by Ayirini ­Fonseca-Sabune, a civil-rights lawyer. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, she’ll be developing voter registration drives, expanding civics lesson plans for teachers . . . and engaging local and national partners to engage people civically at all levels of government.</p>
<p><strong>That’s a lot of potential “I Voted” stickers to hand out!</strong> A record<a href="http://time.com/5411948/national-voter-registration-drive-record-midterm-elections/"> 800,000 people registered to vote</a> on National Voter Registration Day last week. Nonprofit VOTE, which coordinates NVRD had hoped to register 300,000 people. “Some us were saying, ‘Hey, maybe we’ll hit 400 or 500,000,” says Brian Miller, executive director of Nonprofit VOTE. “No one that I know of thought we would surpass 800,000 voter registrations. That surprised all of us. But I think it’s a sign of the interest in the midterms and the interest in having this unified day of action.” By comparison, the holiday drew in 771,321 voter registrations in 2016. In 2014 — the only other midterm election for which the holiday has existed — 154,500 people registered to vote. The holiday was first observed in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: Former Missouri Secretary of State<a href="http://www.startribune.com/kander-citing-mental-health-concerns-drops-out-of-kc-race/494949251/"> Jason Kander</a> announced that he has dropped his mayoral bid in Kansas City in order to focus on recovering from post-traumatic stress depression. Kander, who also founded Let America Vote said in his announcement he had been ignoring symptoms of PTSD and depression for more than a decade. We wish Jason well and look forward to seeing him again very soon. <strong>Benjamin Hovland</strong> has been nominated by President Donald J. Trump to serve as a commissioner on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Hovland is currently the acting chief counsel with the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: The House has passed a non-binding resolution<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-gop-passes-measure-blasting-allowing-non-citizens-vote-local-n913591"> opposing allowing non-U.S. citizens to participate in local elections</a>. Forty-nine Democrats joined 230 Republicans to approve the resolution 279-72. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., proposed the resolution after hearing from naturalized citizens who said they felt &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; by non-citizens taking party in school board elections. &#8220;This dilutes why people work so hard to become citizens. It dilutes an election as well,&#8221; McCarthy told NBC News. &#8220;I think only American citizens can vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of senators has introduced the<a href="https://www.ladailypost.com/content/us-sen-tom-udall-senate-democrats-introduce-native-american-voting-rights-act"> Native American Voting Rights of 2018</a>, legislation that will provide then necessary resources and oversight to ensure Native American have equal access to the electoral process.  The legislation would implement key provisions to ensure Native Americans have equal access to the ballot box, including the establishment of a first of its kind Native American Voting Rights Task Force, which would authorize funding for tribal-state consortiums to bolster Native voter registration, education and election participation efforts in tribal communities. The bill would also increase Native access to voter registration sites and polling locations and ensure equal treatment for tribal ID cards for voting purposes. Finally, the bill addresses the devastating effects of Shelby County by prohibiting states from undertaking discriminatory actions without Department of Justice agreement while emphasizing the importance of government-to-government consultation.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The House has approved a three-bill package that they hope will deter<a href="https://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/local/bills-defining-election-forgery-as-crime-gain-state-house-approval/article_3cc1a27e-d008-53ad-a76e-91283bd5e914.html"> election fraud</a> by clearly defining election forgery as a crime. Under the legislation, any person who knowingly makes, files or publishes a false document or document with false signatures with the the intent to defraud is guilty of forgery. House Bills 5992 (105-2), 6107 (91-13) and 6108 (93-14) now move to the Senate for consideration.</p>
<p>Also this week, the House has unanimously approved a package of bills that will allow Michigan to offer<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/03/michigan-online-voter-registration/1514029002/"> online voter registration</a>. The Senate must now concur with technical changes to the bill, but it appears likely that online voter registration will be in effect by 2020.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: State Assemblyman Anthony D’Urso has introduced ab ill that would allow locations that have been designated a<a href="https://theislandnow.com/rop-common/durso-bill-would-allow-schools-to-opt-out-for-voting/"> polling place</a> to decline to have voting there if they have a valid reason.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: This week, the Legislature agreed to provide the State Board of Elections with $400,000 to help with voter education about absentee voting in the wake of<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article219308765.html"> Hurricane Florence</a>, but the Legislature did not change any existing absentee voting laws as some had sought. The Legislature also agreed to extend the voter registration deadline by three days.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Next week, the Toledo City Council will consider a proposal that would give city employees paid time off to work at the polls on Election Day. The<a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/politics/2018/10/02/Toledo-city-workers-paid-time-off-polls-election/stories/20181002115?abnpageversion=evoke"> Precinct Election Official Leave Program</a> would not cover training, which would have to be done on the weekends or the employee’s own leave time.</p>

														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments this week over Arizona’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-considers-arizona-ballot-delivery-law/"> ballot-harvesting law</a>.
