							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>March for Our Lives nets thousands of new voters</strong><br /><em>State and local elections offices and nonprofits work the crowds</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>On Saturday, the March for Our Lives took place in dozens of cities throughout the United States and the world. At most of those events, voter registration was as important as the speakers and performers on the stage.</p>
<p>State and local elections officials, as well as national nonprofits that work in voter registration worked at rallies from coast to coast.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.headcount.org/">HeadCount</a>, a nonprofit that’s registered about 500,000 new voters since 2004, mostly at music events, partnered with <a href="http://votolatino.org/">Voto Latino</a>, the <a href="http://hiphopcaucus.org/">Hip Hop Caucus</a> and others to register voters in several cities including at the main march in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>According to Tappan Vickery, volunteer coordinator for HeadCount, the groups 2,000 volunteers registered more than 4,800 voters nationwide during the March for Our Lives.</p>
<p>“This was spot on for our target,” Vickery said. “We didn’t really know what to expect, and are really proud of our volunteers’ work.</p>
<p>In DC, there were about 800 volunteers who went through an hour-long training on voter registration before spreading out through the crowd that some estimated to be around 800,000 people. There were six drop-off points for volunteers to return the completed forms.</p>
<p>According to Vickery, all the forms are submitted to HeadCount’s central office in New York the next business after the event via FedEx.</p>
<p>“From there, we centrally process the forms pursuant to our arrangements with the states—send to state, county, municipality, etc.,” Vickery explained. “Every major election year we check with all the state offices to confirm our procedure prior to kicking off field operations.”</p>
<p>Volunteers tell the new registrants to expect their voter registration card in the mail in four to six weeks, or they can go to HeadCount’s website to verify their voter registration through their state’s website.</p>
<p>“If they do not get confirmed through either method, we ask them to let us know and we will follow up for them,” Vickery said.</p>
<p>When possible, HeadCount works with the state-specific voter registration form, but also has the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/Federal_Voter_Registration_03-08-2018_ENG.pdf">national mail voter registration form</a> on hand too. Volunteers were given a fact sheet so they knew what information registrants needed to complete and what states they could not register voters for — New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. New Hampshire, North Dakota and Wyoming do not accept the national mail voter registration form, and the registration laws in Texas and New Mexico, where there is a 48-hour turn-around time for signatures, are too burdensome to overcome for large events like this</p>
<p>“Having the federal form delivers value to where local orgs only use local &#8211; for example, in Nashville, Tennessee, there were multiple voter reg orgs but we were the only group with the federal form and registered 100 people in 17 states,” Vickery said.</p>
<p>Although 74 percent of the states now offer online voter registration, Vickery said HeadCount still largely relies on paper for their process.</p>
<p>“We are implementing tablets in the field in states, such as Colorado and Wisconsin, where so much accessibility is determined by their online systems,” Vickery said. “However, at many of our events, especially festivals, have limited or no Wi-Fi or cell services, paper is always going to have a major role in our efforts.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With personal security at the forefront, Vickery said HeadCount works hard to ensure that the information gathered from voters is secure. Volunteers are asked to turn in completed forms every 30 minutes and the forms are always in custody and control of team leaders.</p>
<p>Representatives from the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/">California secretary of state’s office</a> worked rallies in Los Angeles and Sacramento and <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/about-alex-padilla/">Secretary of State Alex Padilla</a> spoke at the Los Angeles rally.</p>
<p>According to Sam Mahood, spokesman for the secretary of state’s office, the Sacramento office completed 119 registrations/pre-registrations and the Los Angeles office, which partnered with the <a href="https://www.lavote.net/home/voting-elections">Los Angeles County registrar’s office</a> and <a href="http://yvoteca.org/">Yvote</a> registered/pre-registered 125 voters.</p>
<p>“Young people have consistently lag behind in both voter registration and voter turnout rates. Secretary Padilla wants to change that because our democracy is stronger when more citizens participate,” Mahood said. “It has been clear that many young people are engaging in our electoral process&nbsp;in the wake of the Parkland shooting. We had already seen a recent spike in pre-registration. The March for Our Lives event was geared towards young people and receiving a lot of attention. It made sense for our office to provide nonpartisan voter&nbsp;registration and pre-registration opportunities to the many, predominantly young, people who would be in attendance.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahood said that with a state as large as California, they receive voter registration forms, including the federal form, on a constant basis.</p>
<p>“Many groups get California specific voter registration forms from our office or county registrars ahead of big events, so we do not have many issues. Completed federal forms are acceptable. Federal forms get mailed to our office, and these forms do not include a field for voter’s county, so there can be a slight delay in processing time,” Mahood said.</p>
<p>In addition to the national efforts in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, the <a href="https://www.dcboe.org/home.asp?skip=Y">DC Board of Elections</a> participated in the event as well.</p>
<p>“DCBOE is committed to reaching our youngest voters and getting them registered for the 2018 election cycle,” said Rachel Coll, acting public information officer for the DCBOE. “We have held several registration drives at local high schools specifically for that reason. Given the projected high numbers of young people in attendance at the MfOL Rally, DCBOE hoped to engage large numbers of young eligible District residents.”</p>
<p>Coll, who worked the rally along with Policy Advisor Terri Stroud and Voter Outreach and Education Coordinator LaDwane White said they did have a few non-DC folks approach them about registering, but they pointed them in the direction of their home state’s voter registration. Although DCBOE didn’t register a large number of voters, attending the event was worthwhile.</p>
<p>“While we didn’t register many voters, we did have an opportunity to update voter registration information for several voters,” said Rachel Coll, acting public information officer for the DCBOE. “Additionally, individuals stopped by our table to ask questions about upcoming elections, pick up information, and thank us for attending the rally.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/03/24/hundreds-register-vote-boston-march-for-our-lives/QfObT1kQn3760fvWQ8AHKP/story.html">Massachusetts</a>, the secretary of state’s office coordinated with march organizers and registered about 400 to 500 new voters.</p>
<p>“I’m very pleased we did it. I think it was a great opportunity to transfer [demonstrators’] energy and concern into practical action,” Secretary of State William Galvin told the <em>Boston Globe</em>.</p>
<p>Volunteers maned a table by the entrance to Boston Common where the march was held and also fanned out through the crowds. Galvin told the paper that Saturday’s event was the largest haul of new voters from one event he could remember.</p>
<p>The League of Women Voters worked the crowds in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/march-our-lives-pushes-expand-voter-rolls-across-country-n859756">New York City</a> along with HeadCount. Diane Burrows, vice president of the League told NBC News that her group sent out 45 volunteers with clipboards and voter registration forms. Burrows told the network the day after the march that the League had registered more than 150 voters with forms expected back later in the week.</p>
<p>“The engagement has really increased and I think it’s an awareness,” Burrows told NBC. “People are really understanding the power of the vote and that’s what’s really motivating a lot of them. They’re figuring out the importance and power of civic engagement.”</p>

<p>According to <em>Cyberscoop,</em> a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the Senate Intelligence Committee have <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/secure-elections-act-reintroduced/">reintroduced legislation to bolster election cybersecurity</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/bipartisan-bill-calls-coordination-federal-state-officials-election-cybersecurity/">original</a> Secure Elections Act is intact: to facilitate communication between the federal government and the state and local offices that run elections, to expedite security clearances for those officials and to provide financial support for state election infrastructure. Changes include making funding available to local election jurisdictions and create an election security advisory panel, among other things.</p>
<p>U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner <a href="https://www.eac.gov/a-final-message/">Matthew Masterson</a>, who was not reappointed by Rep.

<p><strong>Following ballot issues in the November 2017 election that gained worldwide attention</strong>, the Virginia State Board of Elections <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/virginia/article_a207c1a2-2eb1-11e8-b50b-33799bdd6604.html">voted to update its ballot standards</a>. According to the Virginia Pilot, now all ballots will include these instructions: “if you want to change a vote or if you have made a mistake, ask an election worker for another ballot. If you make marks on the ballot besides filing in the oval, your votes may not be counted.” Other recommendations included allowing candidates to include familiar nicknames instead just their full legal name, a more readable font size and having ovals instead of boxes. Researchers say that with boxes, voters are more likely to make a different mark, such as an “x” or a check.</p>
<p><strong>A supplemental budget request has been submitted to the King County, Washington council</strong> for $381,000 to <a href="http://www.kentreporter.com/news/king-county-elections-seeks-funds-for-prepaid-postage-mail-in-ballots/">cover the cost of return postage for ballots in the 2018 primary and general elections</a>. King County Executive Dow Constantine submitted the funding request. “When I was elected, one of my commitments was to remove barriers to voting,” said Wise in a county news release. “As we increase access with prepaid postage and ballot drop boxes, we’re beginning to see a real impact.” According to the Kent Reporter, the amount actually spent is reliant on voter turnout and method as voters may use either a drop box or return ballots by mail. The county will only incur a charge for prepaid postage when a voter specifically returns a ballot by mail.</p>
<p><strong>Embattled Macomb County, Michigan </strong><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2018/03/27/spranger-macomb-county-clerk/463472002/"><strong>Karen Spranger is out of job</strong> after St. Clair County Circuit Judge Daniel Kelly ruled she had lied about her residency</a> therefore make her ineligible to be a candidate in 2016. Spranger claimed that a home in Warren, which media reports said was filled with “wall-to-wall garbage, feces and animals” was her home, but in his 17-page ruling Kelly said there is absolutely no proof of Spranger’s residency in Macomb County. According to the Detroit Free Press, controversy has surrounded her since she took office in 2017: she got kicked off her county computer for allowing non-county workers on it; fired her two top appointed deputies; sued the county over a litany of issues, and was named as a defendant in three other lawsuits, including a whistle-blower complaint in federal court filed by her former top aides. She was fined $100 for a county ethics violation; totaled her county car in a crash; filed a criminal complaint about the news media harassing her; and was caught on video pushing storage bins to a construction area before an office move she opposed.&nbsp;Spranger’s termination was effective immediately. Circuit Court Judge James Biernat appointed Kathy Brower, a longtime employee, as the <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2018/03/28/jacqueline-ryan-macomb-clerk-deputy/465458002/">temporary acting county clerk</a>.</p>

There were 26 entries in total and Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle, along with senior staff, judged the entries and selected winners in two categories- “Best Artwork” and “Most Original Artwork”. Paige Caldwell, a 10th grader, submitted the winning piece in the “Best Artwork” category and Hannah Gatof, a senior, submitted the winning piece in the “Most Original Artwork” category. &#8220;The 2018 Art Vote contest is part of the Lee County Supervisor of Elections efforts in engaging youth in the democratic process.

The Senate voted 33-14 to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot. The House already has passed it.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, lawmakers have approved a bill that will move the state to an <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-automatic-voter-registration-20180328-story.html">automatic voter registration</a> system.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> A bill that would have restored the <a href="http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/03/22/house-bill-minnesota-felons-voting-rights-falters/">voting rights to returning citizens</a> upon release from incarceration was put on hold by the House Public Safety Committee. According to the <em>Associated Press</em>, that move most likely kills the bill for the current legislative session.</p>
<p>The Senate State Government Finance and Policy and Elections Committee has approved a bill that would prohibit Minneapolis, St. Paul and other Minnesota communities from using the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-lawmakers-push-to-prohibit-ranked-choice-voting/478108843/">ranked choice voting</a> system. The vote was 5-4 along party lines. Secretary of State Steve Simon testified against the legislation. “I would hate to see the Legislature set a precedent of undoing or nullifying, in the case of those two cities, a popular vote where the citizens have spoken and they have said they want this system,” Simon said according to the <em>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Sen. Bill Eigel (R-Weldon Springs) has proposed legislation that would eliminate electronic voting machines in the state and replace them with a <a href="http://www.kmov.com/story/37812980/missouri-lawmaker-pushing-end-to-electronic-voting">paper ballot system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Gov. Tom Wolf (D) has introduced the <a href="http://www.pahomepage.com/news/governor-introduces-21st-century-voting-reform-plan/1081507400">21st Century Voting Reform Plan</a> which is a series of bills that include no-excuse absentee voting, same-day voter registration and automatic voter registration through the state’s licensing bureau.

<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Phillip Green has ruled that <a href="https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2018/03/23/judge-orders-stu-soffer-off-state-election-commission">Stu Soffer</a> cannot serve on both the Jefferson County and state election commission. Soffer will have to resign from one of the boards, although which one remains unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> U.S. District Court of Colorado Judge William J. Martinez has struck down a part of the <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/federal-judge-blocks-part-of-colorados-amendment-71-secretary-of-state-plans-appeal">voter-approved Amendment 71</a> which made it more difficult for people seeking to get a measure on the statewide ballot. Martinez ruled that requiring people hoping to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot to get signatures from at least 2 percent of the total number of registered voters in each of the state’s 35 Senate districts is unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> Almost two months ago, the state Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling that Bridgeport must conduct its mayoral primary for the third time. This week, the court released their detailed <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Supreme-Court-defends-3rd-Bridgeport-primary-12782261.php">26-page decision</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Judge Mark Walker has given Gov.

According to <em>The Hill</em>, Scott and his cabinet members need to create a system with “specific and neutral criteria to direct vote-restoration decisions,” and “meaningful, specific and expeditious time constraints.”</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Lawyers representing the Indiana State Conference of the NAACP and a group of Lake County voters are asking a federal judge to put on hold legal proceedings seeking to block the consolidation of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-lake-precinct-consolidation-lawsuit-delay-st-0325-20180323-story.html">Lake County’s small voting precincts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith has ruled that the <a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2018/03/28/snyder-wins-judge-rules-out-early-election-to-fill-conyers-congressional-seat">special election</a> to fill the congressional seat vacated by Rep.

A voter’s identity is verified using biometric tools like a thumbprint scan, then they vote using a mobile device. Their vote is recorded on a “chain” containing all the votes cast, where each vote is mathematically “proven” by a third-party participant.</p></p>
