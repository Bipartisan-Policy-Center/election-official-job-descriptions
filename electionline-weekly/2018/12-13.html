							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Reflections on the Election Audit Summit</strong><br />
<em>Foundational concepts of auditing and elections were pushed, stretched, and tested</em></p>
<p>By Clair De Soi, communications manager<br />
MIT Election Data &amp; Science Lab</p>
<p>Last week, over a hundred engineers, social scientists, legal scholars, election officials, and others invested in improving U.S. elections braved Boston’s dropping temperatures to participate in the<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/election-audit-summit"> Election Audit Summit</a>. A project of the<a href="https://www.vote.caltech.edu/"> Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project</a>, the summit was supported by<a href="http://electionlab.mit.edu"> MIT’s Election Data &amp; Science Lab</a>.</p>
<p>The two-day conference was designed to explore the intersections of the scientific, policy, and legal issues related to post-election auditing. As concerns over the integrity of the computer systems that manage elections in the United States increased following the 2016 election, the conference organizers began to develop ideas for a forum that would allow the scientific and election administration communities to collaborate and advance the ways we identify and prevent attempts to subvert the effective administration of elections.</p>
<p>What resulted from their efforts was not just a meeting of the minds to discuss technical innovations and methods in election audits. It was also a lively conversation of how we can, collectively, put those ideas into practice—the essential steps to setting audits up for success, and in doing so, secure both an election’s integrity and voters’ confidence in it. If you weren’t able to attend, recordings of every session are available online—but if you don’t have a day and a half to spend with them, we’ve also summarized a few of the major themes and takeaways for you here.</p>
<p>There were, of course, important discussions of the scientific side of things. “Elections are being run under more exacting tolerances,” said Charles Stewart III, a professor at MIT and one of the conference organizers, in the opening panel, underlining the need for election policies, equipment, and even the people involved to strive for new levels of technical precision and clarity. Presentations covered Bayesian and k-cut sampling methods, risk-limiting audit (RLA) strategies, the possibilities and challenges of end-to-end verifiability, and more. In parallel, participants discussed suggestions for how to explain complicated techniques to voters and policymakers in ways that are easy to grasp.</p>
<p>Foundational concepts of auditing and elections were pushed, stretched, and tested by participants over coffee in the hallways and during panels. How—and which—stakeholders should be involved at which stages of an election audit? Where and when should data be accessible, and to whom? What steps can we take to improve and normalize audits, build voter confidence in election processes, or deter malicious interference? Who might be a useful resource as we do so, beyond the usual #electiongeek suspects?</p>
<p>An important theme that emerged in nearly every panel was the absolute impossibility of effective innovation without connecting it directly to the mundane realities and complexities of election systems as a whole. “An audit is no better than the paper trail it uses,” offered Philip Stark of the University of California at Berkeley on the first morning; Whitney Quesenbery of the Center for Civic Design took that and ran with it, challenging attendees to consider “democracy as a design problem,” and to think more critically about the tangled implications of a decision as seemingly simple as the formatting of a single paragraph of ballot text.</p>
<p>Throughout the summit, we were lucky to have insights and expertise from folks around the country who have been in the weeds of audit implementation for years. A panel of Coloradan experts drew from their experiences to illustrate the necessity of a safe learning environment and layered trainings for election workers. To implement an RLA effectively, they emphasized, they had to “go slow to go fast,” planning ahead to provide enough time and space for workers to ask questions, make mistakes, and build their confidence. Stories from New Jersey, Indiana, Virginia, California, and Michigan—where a pilot RLA had wrapped up just a few days before the summit convened—also offered important lessons on successful audit research and implementation.</p>
<p>None of the panelists or participants pretended that audits offered a panacea. “There are no silver bullets in elections,” commented Matthew Masterson (of the Department of Homeland Security), in a closing discussion; a truth that perhaps no one understands better than those who work inside those elections. That said, we’ve gathered some of the best advice offered at the summit to offer to you here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make laws vague; make rules specific. Instead of codifying (one might say calcifying) all of your audit policies and procedures up front, give them the space to evolve. Allow yourself the capacity to improve and adapt as you gain knowledge.</li>
<li>Have empathy. To improve elections, academics must build relationships with election officials that are based on trust. Understand the needs of voters and stakeholders first, and provide recommendations that are actionable and digestible for election administrators.</li>
<li>Complex systems fail in complex, nonlinear ways. No one likes to dwell on failure, but Ben Adida of VotingWorks put on his Silicon Valley hat and called for the election community to do just that. Success gives us one set of lessons learned; what can the failures teach us?</li>
<li>Common. Data. Format. This could be an entire post on its own, but standards for a common data format came up repeatedly as an important element in ensuring that all states can conduct the most effective RLAs going forward.</li>
<li>Collaboration is key. As co-organizer Jennifer Morrell of Democracy Fund put it, collaboration is essential to solving many of the complex problems facing election officials today, including audits. Ultimately, this is a hinge on which the rest of these takeaways depend.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, where to from here? Beyond a few days of conversations, where does this Election Audit Summit put us?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, we hope that it provided fertile ground for new collaborations (see what we did there?) on post-election audits. Strong auditing procedures, conducted with transparency, can play a critical role in ensuring that voters have high confidence in the election process and integrity of the results. There’s a growing community of experts in academia, public service, and grassroots circles alike that are developing more scientifically rigorous approaches to auditing elections—the summit was just a taste. We hope you’ll stay tuned to what they’re doing (see, for example, our expanding and not at all exhaustive list of<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/election-audit-references"> suggested resources</a>), or dip a toe into a new collaboration yourself.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>North Carolina 9th District Update</strong>: While the investigation into what happened in North Carolina’s U.S. House District 9 race continues, state and local authorities are preparing for the very real possibility that the election will be done over. Both chambers of the state Legislature have approved a bill that would require<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article223011255.html"> another primary</a> to be held in the 9th District if a new election is mandated. One affected county,<a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2018/12/13/potential-new-election-district-could-cost-mecklenburg-county/"> Mecklenburg</a>, anticipates that a new election will cost around $500,000. Also this week,<a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2018/12/08/bladen-co-board-elections-vice-chairman-resigns-amid-absentee-ballot-probe/"> Jens Lutz</a>, the vice chairman of the Bladen County board of elections resigned. According to WBTV, Lutz was one of the first to sound the alarm about absentee ballots in the race.</p>
<p><strong>A scan by the U.S. Postal Service</strong> found that 29 of 33 uncounted ballots in the Iowa House 55 race were<a href="https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/kayla-koether-wants-absentee-ballots-counted-in-ia-house-race/article_04bb1a8b-e685-54e0-ae74-bcd5495d5992.html"> placed in the mail before the deadline</a> passed and the losing candidate—who lost by only nine votes—wants them counted. Democrat Kayla Koether filed legal action to have the ballots counted. According to <em>The Courier</em>, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate and Winneshiek County Auditor Ben Steines have filed a motion to<a href="https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-files-to-dismiss-koether-petition-to-have-votes-counted/article_77e39567-4490-56e5-9d8a-6b79272f2d02.html"> dismiss</a> Koether’s petition to county the 29 ballots. The petition argues that the court does not have jurisdiction over the matter.</p>
<p><strong>What once was lost, now is found</strong>. Recently the owners of a Huntsville, Alabama wine store discovered a box in the basement filled<a href="https://whnt.com/2018/12/10/1984-run-off-election-envelopes-found-in-wine-shop-basement/"> unopened election envelopes dating to 1984</a>. While they appeared to be sealed absentee ballots from 1984, Madison County Probate Judge Frank Barger said all of the envelopes had canvassing statements inside. WHNT said Barger, alongside sheriffs deputies, picked up the box of the materials. He said they will turn them over to the local Democratic party.</p>

<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong>:<a href="https://dailymemphian.com/article/1775/Pleasant-led-Election-Commission-through-changes-challenges"> O.C. Pleasant</a>, former chairman of the Shelby County, Tennessee election commission died over the weekend. He was 75. Pleasant was the longest serving member of the Shelby County election commission and served form the mid-1970s to 2009. For 24 of those years, he was chairman of the election commission. According to the <em>Daily Memphian</em>, after leaving the Election Commission in 2009, Pleasant remained involved in election issues through the Memphis Branch NAACP.</p>
<p>Saline County, Illinois County Clerk<a href="https://thesouthern.com/news/local/communities/harrisburg/saline-county-clerk-roger-craig-dies-two-weeks-into-term/article_ff758503-497b-5f18-95d2-fe902bab9365.html"> Roger Craig</a>, who was installed in office just two weeks ago has died. He was 57. According to the <em>Southern Illinoisan</em>, Craig ran against incumbent Kim Buchanan in the Republican Primary Election in March. At the time, he cited the battle between Buchanan and the county board as his reason for entering the race. Craig previously served as trustee for the Harrisburg Township.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/obituaries/rosanell-eaton-dies.html">Rosanell Eaton</a>, lead plaintiff in a North Carolina voting rights lawsuit that reached the U.S. Supreme Court died on December 8. She was 97. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, Eaton, an obscure civil rights pioneer in her younger years, became a cause célèbre after President Barack Obama cited her courage in his response to a 2015 article in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> about growing efforts to dismantle the protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Eaton was a lifelong devotee of voting rights. She registered to vote for the first time in 1942 at the age of 21 after facing down three white men who tried to stop her from entering the Franklin County, North Carolina courthouse.</p>

														<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Sedgwick County officials will plan to lobby their legislative delegation to introduce a bill that will allow the county to move to<a href="https://www.kfdi.com/2018/12/12/sedgwick-county-to-lobby-for-election-changes/"> vote centers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> The Town of Chevy Chase Council voted unanimously to<a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/government/chevy-chase-town-council-votes-unanimously-to-allow-non-us-citizens-to-vote-in-local-elections/"> extend voting rights to non-citizens</a> in local elections. Those now eligible to vote must have green cards, be in the country for diplomatic purposes or those working toward U.S. citizenship. “One of the reasons I think we were sympathetic was that we heard from non-citizens who have been residents in town for a long time and are eager to participate in democracy,” Mayor Barney Rush told <em>Bethesda Magazine</em>. “We care about having an inclusive community where people who wish to participate in our civic activities are able to do so, and this is one way people can contribute.”</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The Senate has approved legislation that<a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2018/12/06/michigan-senate-gop-votes-to-gut-recently-approved-voting-access-expansion"> would gut a recently-approved voter initiative</a>. The approved bills would cut off voter registration at 14 days ahead of election and allow a resident to opt out of automatic voter registration and would force voters to show more identification and prove citizenship before voting.</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, the House Elections Committee has approved a bill that will<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/12/12/ballot-selfie-legalization-bill-michigan/2287616002/"> legalize ballot selfies</a>. “The First Amendment right to free speech is primarily for political speech,” sponsoring Rep. Steven Johnson, R-Wayland told <em>The Detroit News</em>. “In today’s day and age, social media is often how people support their candidates and their causes.”</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A bill shaping the make-up of the<a href="http://www.wfae.org/post/bill-addressing-state-elections-board-passes-goes-governor"> North Carolina State Board of Elections</a> is on its way Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk. Under the bill the board would move back to five members, with all of them appointed by the governor. The board will also be split back into two parts, with an ethics commission taking on the role of ethics enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Senate Minority Chairman Raumesh Akbari is planning to sponsor legislation<a href="https://www.dailymemphian.com/article/1771/Akbari-to-push-automatic-restoration-of-voting-rights-for-low-level-felons"> automatically restoring the right to vote</a> for people with low-level felony convictions.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Delegate Charniele Herring is planning on introducing legislation to allow for<a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/virginia-politics/state-delegate-proposes-bill-to-ease-absentee-voting-laws-increase-voter-turnout/1653690954"> no-excuse absentee voting</a>. “It’s already happening in 38 other states and it’s time for us to get rid of our old ways of doing things,” Herring told WAVY.</p>

That’s more than reasonable.” Cox was sued after she moved the one Dodge City polling location outside of town about a mile from the nearest bus stop.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the winner-take-all system the commonwealth uses to assign its<a href="https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/elections/judge-rejects-challenge-to-winner-take-all-election-system/article_bb99faf8-e9a2-506d-b46e-3fbf913777d9.html"> Electoral College</a> presidential votes.

							<h2>EAVS Update</h2>
														<p><strong>Launch of the 2018 EAVS and New Resources</strong></p>
<p>David Kuennen, senior research program specialist<br />
U.S. Election Assistance Commission</p>
<p>With the midterm elections now behind us, the EAC has begun implementing the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/election-administration-voting-survey/">2018 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS)(opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
<p>The EAVS is the agency’s biennial survey that collects the most comprehensive nationwide data on election administration from nearly 6,500 local election jurisdictions across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.</p>
<p>Pollsters and journalists are already off to the races writing the first draft of history on the 2018 midterms. The EAVS allows us to tell the official election administration side of the story. From record turnout levels to shifts in voting methods, and changes in voting technology, we should have some really interesting things to say about how the 2018 elections were run and the changing landscape of U.S. elections.</p>
<p>This week, we are excited to launch the data collection period for the 2018 EAVS and share the data collection templates with respondents. Along with the new templates, the EAC and its implementing partner, Fors Marsh Group, are taking a number of steps to make the survey easier to complete, strengthen data quality and completeness, and improve accessibility of the data.</p>
<p>Some of these efforts include new resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-QjYixhhKU&amp;feature=youtu.be">Webinar: Overview of the 2018 EAVS(opens in new tab)</a> – Moderated by EAC Vice Chair Christy McCormick, webinar panelists discuss a number of topics helpful for respondents, including what’s new for the 2018 survey, the EAVS data collection timeline, resources available to respondents, and helpful hints for completing the survey.</p>
<p>A series of six “bootcamp” videos, which provide detailed section-by-section and question-by-question guidance for completing the survey. These include:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNWSPUp32U&amp;feature=youtu.be">Section A(opens in new tab)</a>, related to voter registration data;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saR-bP0AY4E&amp;feature=youtu.be">Section B(opens in new tab)</a>, related to military and overseas voting data;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzQwls6R99Y&amp;feature=youtu.be">Section C(opens in new tab)</a>, related to domestic civilian by-mail voting data;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t18j7AGIVbM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Section D(opens in new tab)</a>, related to polling place and poll worker data;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6lKpU-lj4w&amp;feature=youtu.be">Section E(opens in new tab)</a>, related to provisional ballot data; and</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYHPfFwp7Aw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Section F(opens in new tab)</a>, related to voter participation and election technology data.</p>
<p>While these resources primarily seek to help respondents complete the 2018 EAVS, we also hope that they can provide to other interested stakeholders insights into the data collected by the survey and the process we use to collect it.</p>
<p>EAVS respondents can find the data collection templates, instructions, and additional resources on the <a href="https://www.eavsportal.com/">2018 EAVS Portal(opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
<p>Look for more information about the 2018 EAVS in the New Year, as we plan to provide additional updates on the EAVS and related news!</p>

							<h2>FVAP Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>New voter registration/ballot request and back-up ballot forms on Federal Register now</strong></p>
<p>The current draft Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms are available for review and comment on the Federal Register until January 22 at regulations.gov.</p>
<p>The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) requires that the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) prescribe two standard federal forms. Both forms require review and public comment every three years. The FPCA (SF-76), can be used to register to vote, request an absentee ballot and update contact information, while the FWAB (SF-186) serves as a backup ballot if the voter doesn&#8217;t receive a requested ballot in time.</p>
<p>FVAP leveraged feedback from voters and election officials to update the forms to clarify their use and requirements.</p>
<p>The revised forms simplify instructions for voters and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification of National Guard classification for use of the form.</li>
<li>Alterations to the list of states requiring additional information.</li>
<li>Clarification of registration and ballot request instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form usability is an essential part of the redesign process. To help ensure the form is easy and intuitive from a voter&#8217;s perspective, please download and complete it as if you were registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot or voting the FWAB. Provide usability comments via the links below.</p>
