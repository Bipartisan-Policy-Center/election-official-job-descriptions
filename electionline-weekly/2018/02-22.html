<p><strong>The Price of Democracy: Splitting the bill for elections</strong><br /><em>New report from the National Conference of State Legislatures</em></p>
<p>By Wendy Underhill, National Conference of State Legislatures, and<br />Katy Owens Hubler, Democracy Research, LLC.</p>
<p><em>“The cost is one of the most important aspects of the problem of election administration. It is, of course, secondary to honesty, accuracy, and the convenience of the electors, but nevertheless is of great importance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>—Joseph P. Harris, Ph.D., &#8220;Election Administration in the United States,&#8221; 1934</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-price-of-democracy-splitting-the-bill-for-elections.aspx">new NCSL report</a>, “The Price of Democracy: Splitting the Bill for Elections,” is the result of two years of studying all things related to elections and costs, addressing questions such as: &nbsp;What are the costs associated with running elections? What state policy choices relate to costs? What funding mechanisms are in use in the states? Can money buy security?</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest takeaway from our work on election costs is this: Money matters.</p>
<p>Not that money is the only factor when making decisions about election policy. There’s also turnout, reliability, accessibility, accuracy and a host of other values. Democracy is not a place for cutting corners.</p>
<p>Here are 10 more takeaways for legislators and other policymakers:</p>
<p><strong>1. Elections aren’t priceless</strong>—it’s just that no one has put a price on them yet. Does the United States spend a billion dollars a year running elections? $10 million? No one knows. States know how much they spend on roads, health care, education and other big-ticket items, but no one knows how much they spend on elections, the backbone of democracy. State budgets typically do not include a dedicated line item for election expenses. Instead, they may be folded into the budget of the chief election official or other state agencies. At the local level, some election administrators, especially those who seek reimbursement for services they provide to other entities, may have a good cost analysis, but others may not. Good research on election costs is slim; data collection efforts are just beginning. States can facilitate collection of data that will help with comparisons within a state, and perhaps someday, across state lines.</p>
<p><strong>2. States are in charge of elections</strong>. The U.S. Constitution gives states the right to regulate elections. Two caveats: historically, states have authorized local jurisdictions to run elections, although that is changing. And, over time, federal requirements have set the framework for elections.</p>
<p><strong>3. Funding can come from different levels of government</strong>. Funding can, and to some extent does, come from three levels of government: local, state and federal. None of these is flush with cash. In 2002, with the enactment of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), approximately $3 billion was provided by the federal government to the states for upgrades to registration and voting systems. That money is largely gone, and state and local governments are figuring out a new plan. Each state has a somewhat different approach.</p>
<p><strong>4. Tech (and security) needs are the current drivers of election costs</strong> <strong>at the state level</strong>. While elections technology costs are just one part of the overall costs of elections, they are the driving cost in policy conversations, at least at the legislative level. That’s because most states are looking to replace their equipment before the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>5. Security requires good protocols, well-trained staff and adequate funding</strong>. In any IT environment, security is a big component. Elections systems require protection as good as—or better than—any other government or business process or service.</p>
<p><strong>6. States maintain and secure voter registration databases</strong>. The list of voters is kept at the state level, though the state works closely with local jurisdictions to update and maintain it. Security is an increasingly important consideration here, though much of the cost falls to states.</p>
<p><strong>7. States provide resources or assistance in other ways, too</strong>. Election costs can be broken down into many categories, some obvious and some less so. On top of sharing costs between different jurisdictions, paying for technology and voter registration databases, at least some states pay for: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Statewide voter information</li>
<li>Training for local election officials</li>
<li>Compensation for local election officials</li>
<li>Ballots or other supplies</li>
<li>Polling places&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Policy choices on how elections are conducted can affect overall costs</strong>. Legislators decide whether to maintain traditional Election Day, precinct-based elections, or to move toward alternatives such as using more pre-Election Day voting options—vote by mail, early in-person voting—or vote centers. The choices legislators make can affect the bottom line, even if it is often hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>9. States have choices on where to look for money to fund elections</strong>. These include direct appropriations, statewide bond measures and dedicated revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>10. Recently, states have used task forces to scope out their elections needs and options</strong>. Because elections are a shared responsibility, legislatures are asking that task forces—including legislators, executive branch administrators and local election officials—work to develop solutions for funding elections technology, approaching security and considering new options on how to run elections.</p>

<p><strong>Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton said his office</strong> has and county officials have agreed <a href="http://www.kxlh.com/story/37525566/stapleton-updates-review-process-for-problematic-mail-ballots">how to review questionable ballots</a>. Moving forward, county officials still will try to resolve any conflicts with non-matching signatures, but the secretary’s office and the commissioner of political practices will be notified. It will be up to the commissioner to decide whether or not to pursue cases where someone may have intentionally cast a false vote. “When you get to a point where you can’t de-conflict it, then forward it to (the commissioner’s) office, just like anyone else that has a campaign violation or suspects it,” Stapleton told MTN News. “What we’re looking for is consistency and following the law.”</p>
<p><strong>Gwinnett County, Georgia is required to hire about</strong> <a href="https://www.myajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/inside-gwinnett-quest-find-350-spanish-speaking-poll-workers/40FOoqvs5ad2SnCL7S9IPM/">350 bilingual poll workers</a> for the May primaries and November election and so this week, Elections Director Lynn Ledford is holding a first-ever “hiring event.” “I want to be optimistic,” Ledford told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “I have no idea what it’s going to be like.” To-date the county has only been able to secure about three dozen bilingual poll workers. An estimated 171,000 Latinos live in Gwinnett and the county is the first in Georgia to receive a Sec. 203 designation from the Department of Justice.</p>
<p><strong>Following a “B” grade from the Center for American Progress’ election security study</strong>, Alaska will no longer allow citizens or members of the military who live overseas to <a href="http://juneauempire.com/news/state/2018-02-21/boost-election-security-alaska-suspends-electronic-absentee-program">return their ballot via email</a>. In 2016, 8,411 ballots were returned electronically. “Alaska is suspending the return of completed ballots through a web portal in 2018 until a more secure solution is available. The Division will continue to accept voted ballots via fax and by mail,” Division of Elections Supervisor Josie Bahnke wrote.</p>
<p><strong>As students march on capitals throughout the nation</strong>, including our nation’s capital, to demand common sense gun laws, many on social media have talked about lowering the voting age. The City of Takoma Park, which did just that in 2013, and in response to some of the commentary on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TakomaParkMD/status/966302734835175425">tweeted out some pretty impressive statistics</a>. In 2013, youth turnout was 44 percent, overall it was 10 percent. In 2015 youth turnout was 45 percent, overall it was 21 percent and in 2017, youth turnout was 48 percent whereas overall voter turnout was 22 percent. While it doesn’t seem likely that too many states will pass legislation lowering the voting age this year, it will be interesting to keep an eye on the 18-24 turnout in 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> Legislation proposed by Secretary of State Denise Merrill would alter what information is <a href="http://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/State/Merrill-wants-to-protect-voters-privacy.html">publicly available on the voter rolls</a>. Under her proposed bill, voter roll information would still be publicly available for $350, but the birthdates of registered voters would no longer be included.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> This week the Senate unanimously approve a bill to allow Florida to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/article201301974.html">join ERIC</a>. The bill is now headed to the governor’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Senate Enrolled Act 9 is heading to the governor’s desk.

<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The House has advanced a bill aimed at resolving a dispute between the state’s four largest counties and the secretary of state’s office. Under the proposal, county commissioners would gain authority to decide salaries and approve budgets for the <a href="http://www.cjonline.com/news/20180221/kansas-house-moves-to-settle-shawnee-county-elections-budget-dispute-works-through-bills">appointees</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> The Senate effectively killed Senate Bill 190 that would have codified uniform rules to guide <a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/politics_and_government/debate-over-international-election-observers-ends-in-maryland-senate/article_a6b2be0f-e2a2-5cce-a3c0-06d0239ab6b8.html">foreign election observers</a>. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (D) gave up his gavel to join the debate on the senate floor and spoke at length about the fear of Russians hacking American elections. “This bill might have been ready for prime time four weeks ago or six years ago or four years ago or even two weeks ago, but what has happened now with the indictment of these 13 men showing how vulnerable our elections are &#8230; our elections are very easy to manipulate,” Miller said. “I don’t want these people in the room.”</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: A bill that would have prevented New Hampshire from sending voter data to <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/Senate-votes-to-stay-in-CrossCheck-voting-system-15589422">Crosscheck</a> was killed in the Senate. The bill was voted down 14-10 along party lines.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The Legislature has approved House Bill 98, which if signed by the governor would <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1134102/cooperative-session-ends-with-rush-of-bill-approvals.html">consolidate most nonpartisan elections</a> into one day in November.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The Senate State and Local Government Committee has voted down a bill that would have required an auditable <a href="http://nashvillepublicradio.org/post/tennessee-lawmakers-reject-plan-require-paper-trail-voting#stream/0">paper trail</a> for all voting machines. According to Nashville Public Radio, the measure had been opposed by state election officials, who say paper receipts are an unnecessary expense. Machines that spit out paper receipts would have cost Tennessee election commissions about $9.5 million up front, and they would have cost millions more to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The House Government Operations Committee has <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900010891/more-polling-places-other-changes-for-voters-under-bill-advanced-by-house-committee.html">approved HB218</a> sponsored by Rep. Rebecca Chavez-Houck (D-Salt Lake City). Under the bill, counties would be required to have at least one polling place for every 5,000 voters even if elections are conducted by mail. The only elections that could be handled entirely by mail under the bill would be those held solely for a referendum challenging a local tax law. The bill would also make same-day voter registration permanent throughout the state, would allow for voter registration to be automatically updated when license information is updated and would prohibit counties from sending mail ballots to voters who had not cast a ballot past elections.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> The House has approved a bill that would prevent the state from handing over <a href="http://digital.vpr.net/post/house-lawmakers-vote-conceal-voter-data-feds#stream/0">voter data</a> to the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: House Bill 3004 would codify a ruling from the state Supreme Court of Appeals regarding how the governor <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/politics/senate-passes-election-vacancy-bill-that-justice-vetoed-last-year/article_f1ce03fc-30f1-5128-b746-d21530015a57.html">fills vacancies</a> left by a constitutional officer, legislator or county commissioner.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The Justice Department’s Civil Rights division has sued Arizona and Secretary of State Michele Reagan claiming that the state <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/feds-sue-arizona-over-absentee-ballot-fiasco/">failed to give absentee voters enough time</a> to consider the finalized and official ballot ahead of a Democratic special primary election. “The inability of the state to transmit the final absentee ballots to UOCAVA voters receiving a Democratic Party ballot by the 45th day before the February 27, 2018 special primary election for the House of Representatives violates the United States of America under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act” wrote John Gore, an assistant attorney general with the civil rights division of the justice department. On Tuesday, the DOJ and the state <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/feds-arizona-settle-spat-over-rushed-absentee-voting/">reached an agreement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Supporters of <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2018/02/16/politics/maine-ranked-choice-voting-backers-file-suit-to-ensure-system-is-used-in-june/">ranked-choice voting</a> in Maine — joined by eight Democratic candidates — filed a lawsuit to ensure that the voting method is in place in time for the June primaries. The lawsuit comes two weeks before the deadline for Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap (D) to certify signatures designed to place on the June 12 ballot a referendum question that could decide the long-term fate of ranked-choice voting.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: This week, a judge heard arguments in a lawsuit challenging the state law that requires <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20180220/judge-considering-request-to-dismiss-nh-voter-rights-lawsuit">additional documentation from voters</a> who move to the state within 30 days of an election. According to Seacoastonline, lawyers for the state argued the lawsuit failed to allege any injury from the law. They said the plaintiffs had no trouble voting, arguing two were already registered voters and a third eventually voted in a local election.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Supreme Court Justice Thomas Nolan dismissed a petition to <a href="http://wamc.org/post/judge-rejects-petition-seeking-recount-saratoga-springs-charter-vote">recount ballots</a> in Saratoga Springs’ November charter vote. The petition sought a recount of all ballots cast in the City of Saratoga Springs by a hand or by a review of the image files, or .TIF files, scanned by the voting machines used in the election. The idea was to look for discrepancies. Nolan said there was no factual support for the petitioner’s request.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> A settlement agreement has been reached between the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission and San Juan County. The commission had sued the county arguing that its vote-by-mail system <a href="http://kutv.com/news/local/settlement-announced-to-create-equal-opportunities-for-navajo-voters">violated the voting rights of Navajo voters</a>. In the settlement agreement, the county has agreed to implement various measures to create equal opportunities for Navajo voters.</p>
