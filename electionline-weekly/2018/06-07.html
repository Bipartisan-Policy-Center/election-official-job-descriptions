							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>States, counties prepare for changing threat environment</strong><br /><em>Many resources available to elections officials</em></p>
<p>By Matthew V. Masterson, senior cybersecurity advisor<br />U.S. Department of Homeland Security</p>
<p>In my role at the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) and now with the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS), I’ve been fortunate to travel the country, interact with state and county election officials, participate in trainings, and witness the advances that officials are making to manage the risks to elections.</p>
<p>While securing election systems isn’t new for election officials, the threat environment changed in 2016 with nation-state actors targeting election systems. The good news is that, election officials are natural risk managers who constantly ask themselves what could go wrong and plan to respond. My job is to ensure that the federal government provides them with all the necessary threat, vulnerability and risk information in order to make those plans and respond.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly encouraged by the willingness of election officials across the country to engage with DHS and form a partnership. So far, officials across 48 states are engaged with us on election security efforts in some way whether through the sharing of information, use of our services or incident planning.</p>
<p>Their participation has been essential in forming an <a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration">Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center</a> (EI-ISAC), a similar model to what is used in the financial and electricity sectors. This organization provides specific information on malicious cyber activity that could be targeting election infrastructure.</p>
<p>With over 700 members the EI-ISAC is growing fast! This organization is free for election officials to sign up to receive election-specific cybersecurity information. I encourage all state and local elections to sign up at <a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration">https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration</a></p>
<p>State and local election officials are also readily leveraging the security services and assessments DHS provides. Whether it is scanning to make certain that the databases and websites are configured properly, or simply phishing training for members of their staff, the election community has embraced the resources DHS can provide as part of their multi-layered cybersecurity strategies.</p>
<p>For more information on the services DHS is providing to state and local officials go here: <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/election-infrastructure-security-resource-guide">https://www.dhs.gov/publication/election-infrastructure-security-resource-guide</a></p>
<p>And this is not to say that states that are not using DHS services aren’t taking the threat seriously, quite the contrary. I’ve been around the country and seen how seriously election officials are taking the threat and how they are continuing to mature as IT managers on top of all the other hats they wear.</p>
<p>For instance, in Indiana they are implementing two-factor authentication on their databases and increasing monitoring. Florida is deploying cyber navigators to their local officials to help support them. Orange County, California just published a comprehensive election security playbook. Denver, Colorado works collaboratively with city IT officials to provide real time threat sharing.</p>
<p>Many are utilizing third-party vendors or in-house services. DHS’s free services are but one of a variety of options that election officials are using to help protect, detect and recover from cyber risks.</p>
<p>State and local governments own and administer elections in this country, and DHS is there to support their efforts. We’re learning how to best help this community to manage their risk. Election officials are making very real progress in improving the resilience of the election process. To effectively learn how to best provide support, we have formal partnership bodies with government and private sector representatives that allow us to convene, share information, and build consensus on how to ensure the security of elections going forward.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2017/10/14/elections-government-sector-coordinating-council-established-charter-adopted/">Election Subsector Government Coordinating Council</a> is a representative body of 24 state and local election officials, the EAC, and DHS. It’s no accident that this council is made up overwhelming of state and local officials. Recently that group developed a guidance to help election officials determine how to use recent funding to better secure systems. The great thing about this document, is that it was developed by the election community, informed by the assessments being performed by DHS, and supports broad initiatives to advance security in both the near-term and for elections to come.</p>
<p>The Sector Coordinating Council coordinates between government and private industry, including the major vendors in the election equipment and services market. Vendors on the Sector council are taking advantage of DHS cybersecurity services and information sharing. Recognizing their important role in the process election system providers have been engaged and active partners with DHS.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it seems that so much has changed since 2011 when I first started working on elections in Ohio, but the reality is, that election community has always faced challenges, and maturing the security of this sector is just the next one. Election security has become a national priority – but for election officials, security and contingency planning has always been a priority.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that now, this new national attention is leading to the additional support, resources and recognition of the hard work across this community. I can say that Homeland Security is committed to that goal, and. Reach out to our Election Task Force at <a href="mailto:ElectionTaskForce@hq.dhs.gov">ElectionTaskForce@hq.dhs.gov</a> and let us know how DHS can help.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p>II. Primary Updates</p>
<p>The 2018 version of “Super Tuesday” occurred this week with voters in eight states heading to the polls and mailboxes. The day was a mixed bag administratively with fairly smooth sailing in some states, minor glitches in others and major headaches in some too.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Twenty-six counties in Alabama rolled out <a href="http://www.wbrc.com/story/38368035/electronic-poll-books-used-in-dozens-of-counties-during-alabama-primary">e-poll books</a> for the first time this election and overall the new voter check-in system seemed to work well with <a href="http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/government/electronic-books-a-hit-with-poll-workers-in-houston-county/article_090eba80-69be-11e8-8f67-cfebff8e9024.html">poll workers</a>. In <a href="http://www.dothanfirst.com/news/issues-with-voting-locations/1223407676">Dothan</a>, some voters were confused about new polling locations. There was a bit of a kerfuffle in <a href="https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/legislator_on_voting_snafu_peo.html">Mobile</a> when Rep. Barbara Drummond, who was on the ballot for re-election, went to the polling place to vote only to find out she had been removed from the rolls because she was dead. Turns out, her sister-in-law, who had passed away, had the same name. The chief clerk from Mobile happened to be the polling location and sorted out the problem. In exciting news, apparently there are <a href="https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/apparently_alabama_has_a_new_i.html">new “I Voted” stickers</a> in Alabama. The new stickers feature the stars and stripes in the shape of the state with the words “I Voted” on the stickers. And in the race for <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/alabama-man-charged-with-selling-stolen-auto-parts-online/">secretary of state</a>, incumbent Republican John Merrill will face Democratic challenger Heather Milam.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> With more registered voters than most states have residents, just about anything can happen in California on an election day. The two big stories out The Golden State this year was the roll out the state’s new vote-by-mail/vote center system and how more than 100,000 people were somehow left off the voter rolls in Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>Overall, the roll out of the <a href="http://fox40.com/2018/06/05/voter-turnout-in-sacramento-san-joaquin-counties-mostly-by-mail/">new voting system</a> seemed to <a href="https://www.theunion.com/news/elections/alls-quiet-on-the-vote-center-front-in-nevada-county/">work well</a>, although some voters did express their <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article212595404.html">sadness</a> about no longer relying on neighborhood polling places. And in <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article212680454.html">Sacramento County</a>, some voters who showed up at old polling places wondered if the ballots they left would be counted.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/voter-rolls-2018/">Los Angeles County</a>, at 1,530 voting locations, 118,522 voters were left off the polls due to what Los Angeles Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan said was a <a href="https://www.lavote.net/docs/rrcc/news-releases/06052018_E-Day-Release.pdf">printing error</a>. Entire streets were left off the rolls and even California’s <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/article212651354.html">more notable residents</a> were not immune. Logan appeared at a <a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2018/06/06/l-county-officials-demand-answers-after-more-than-118-k-were-left-off-voter-rosters/680031002/">special hearing</a> before the county board of supervisors on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There were a smattering of other problems throughout the state. In <a href="https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/2018/06/06/delays-plague-election-primary-results-but-tulare-county-officials-working-close-gap/676925002/">Tulare County</a>, election results were delayed on Tuesday night. In <a href="http://fox40.com/2018/06/05/amador-county-polling-places-run-out-of-ballots/">Amador County</a>, polling places ran out of ballots. A polling place was forced to relocate in <a href="http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/local/8402188-181/polling-place-relocates-for-sonoma">Sonoma County</a> due to wild fires. Voters in <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/long-lines-voters-casting-ballots-sf-city-hall/">San Francisco</a> faced long lines at some polling places. A <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-poll-evacuation-20180605-story.html">San Diego</a> polling place was briefly evacuated after a suspicious device was reported. Software glitches in <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/05/software-glitch-forces-san-mateo-county-voters-to-cast-provisional-paper-ballots/">San Mateo County</a> forced some voters to use provisional ballots.</p>
<p>And although there are still a lot of ballots to be counted at press time, incumbent <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2018/06/05/secretary-of-state-alex-padilla-atty-gen-xavier-becerra-head-to-runoffs/">Secretary of state</a> Alex Padilla (D) will face Mark Meuser (R) in November.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The biggest pre-primary concern, the roll out of the state’s <a href="http://whotv.com/2018/06/05/very-few-issues-at-polls-during-soft-rollout-of-voter-id-law/">new voter ID law</a>, turned out to be the least talked about issue of the day, although <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/election-officials-some-grumbling-about-id-requirement/article_0a4ace73-4593-5a7b-bcc9-a13e32c52e69.html">not everyone was happy</a> about it. And several counties ran into a new problem with the law…<a href="http://www.kwwl.com/story/38366902/2018/06/Wednesday/several-forgotten-ids-at-iowa-polls">left behind IDs</a>. The biggest issue that some voters seemed to face on primary day was an anonymous text message with <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/05/iowa-primary-2018-secretary-state-texts-voters-wrong-polling-place/665228002/">erroneous polling place information</a>. It turns out the text messages were mistakenly sent by a campaign. A software glitch in <a href="http://www.amestrib.com/news/20180605/system-glitch-affected-some-story-county-primary-voters">Story County</a> forced some voters to complete their voter eligibility forms manually. In <a href="http://www.nonpareilonline.com/news/election/primary-election-today-features-several-contested-races-water-main-break/article_398287ef-19d3-5f61-bfff-d4bc188a85df.html">Pottawattamie County</a>, a water main break lead to a change in polling places for Council Bluffs voters. And in the race for <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Democrat-DeJear-wins-secretary-of-state-primary-484659311.html">secretary of state</a>, incumbent Republican Paul Pate will face Democratic challenger Deidre DeJear.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Issues with a server kept two precincts in <a href="http://www.dailytimesleader.com/content/equipment-issues-hamper-primary-results-oktibbeha-county">Oktibbeha County</a> from being counted on election night, but other than that, it was a <a href="http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Election-Day-runs-smoothly-with-new-voting-process-484643331.html">quiet primary day</a> in Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> With a turnout of around 41 percent, the highest mid-term primary turnout since 1994, it was a <a href="http://www.ktvh.com/2018/06/secretary-of-state-stapleton-responds-to-primary-turnout-reporting-delays">more or less a smooth day</a>. “What we do here is look for big problems, and we didn’t have them,” Secretary of state Corey Stapleton told KTVH. “We didn’t have any equipment failures; we didn’t have ballots that didn’t feed into the system. We were able to avoid some of the pitfalls from the past.”</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Overall, it was a quiet day in The Garden State, but two issues stood out. First, in <a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/hoboken/hoboken-wrestles-polling-problems-during-primary-election">Hudson County</a>, voting irregularities were reported at multiple voting locations in Hoboken with one polling place opening three hours late due to voting machine problems. And in <a href="http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2018/06/election_worker_on_heroin_arrested_at_poll_cops_say.html">Passaic County</a>, a poll worker in the town of Wayne was arrested and charged with possession of heroin, being under the influence of a controlled substance, possession of paraphernalia and possession of narcotics in a motor vehicle</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1180881/slow-steady-and-routine-at-area-primary-election-polling-sites.html">Slow, steady and routine</a> are three words that were used to describe primary day in The Land of Enchantment. One thing that may have lead to a smooth election day were the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-mexico/articles/2018-06-04/nearly-100-000-cast-early-votes-in-new-mexico">number of early ballots</a> cast this year. <a href="http://www.krqe.com/news/politics-governement/elections/primary-election-day-plan-for-voters-displaced-by-ute-park-fire/1218412641">Colfax County</a> did have to put back-up plans into place for some voters who had been evacuated due to the Ute Park Fire. In the race for secretary of state, incumbent Democrat Maggie Toulouse Oliver will face Republican challenger Johanna Cox. Both ran unopposed.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: While Alabama saw a smooth roll out of e-poll books on Tuesday, things were anything but smooth for several South Dakota counties using the devices including <a href="https://www.aberdeennews.com/krebs-pollbook-voting-problems-are-between-vendor-counties/article_e473d374-68c1-11e8-95a5-f79d50af8c91.html">Brown</a>, <a href="http://www.drgnews.com/despite-electronic-pollbook-glitch-hughes-county-election-goes-well/">Hughes</a>, <a href="http://www.drgnews.com/hughes-hyde-sully-and-potter-among-sd-counties-having-issues-with-electronic-pollbooks/">Hyde</a>, <a href="http://www.kotatv.com/content/news/Software-failure-mars-election-night-here-and-in-8-other-counties-484783791.html">Pennington</a>, <a href="http://www.drgnews.com/hughes-hyde-sully-and-potter-among-sd-counties-having-issues-with-electronic-pollbooks/">Sully</a>, and <a href="https://www.yankton.net/community/article_3beb05f2-693d-11e8-bde3-6737d3a6cc90.html">Yankton</a>. The problems forced polls to <a href="http://cumberlink.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/the-latest-longer-poll-hours-in-some-south-dakota-counties/article_8dbc671c-6e20-5cb1-b987-fb17313b243b.html">stay open late</a> in several jurisdictions. Secretary of State Shatel Krebs, who lost her primary bid for U.S. representative issued a statement saying that the <a href="http://kelo.com/news/articles/2018/jun/05/secretary-of-state-issues-clarification-on-polling-problems/">e-poll book problem</a> was not statewide and that it was an issue between the individual counties and the vendor.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said this week</strong>, that it could <a href="http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_5b115888-680b-11e8-8d89-63c9a2dc16ff.html">cost up to $60 million to replace the state’s 10,000 aging voting machines</a>. Unlike most states where individual counties purchase and control voting machines, in Louisiana the state owns all the voting machines. According to Ardoin, between federal funds and money budgeted there is only about $10 million available. The state will receive oral presentations from three firms next week with the goal to replace the voting machines by 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps this is where some of our holiday cards have gone</strong>. Last month, the New York City Board of Elections received two packages of near 2,000 pieces of First Class mail from the U.S. Postal Service that included <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/absentee-ballots-left-stranded-brooklyn-post-office-after-election/">hundreds of absentee ballots that should have been counted in the November 2017 election</a>. According to WNYC, on package contained 533 absentee ballots postmarked on November 7 which should have been counted. Another package contained 280 ballots that were received after Election Day. &#8220;For some undetermined reason, some baskets of mail that were bound to the New York City Board of Elections were put off to the side at the Brooklyn processing facility and eventually discovered, and upon discovery, delivered to the Board of Elections,&#8221; New York City Board of Elections Executive Michael Ryan said. In a letter to the NYCBOE, the Postal Service alleges that there was an agreement for the BOE to come pick up the ballots.</p>
<p><strong>With less than a week to go till Maine’s </strong><a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/ranked-choice-voting-what-happened-when-some-mainers-took-test-run#stream/0"><strong>roll out</strong> of ranked-choice voting</a>, Maine Public Radio reporter Steve Mistler joined several voters as they filled out their absentee ballot using the new system. Mistler noted the voters seemed less confused about the new voting system than they did about the referendum question about whether or not to keep the new system in place. It’s an interesting listen about how people are making their choices with the new system.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon Secretary of State Dennis Richardson announced this week</strong> that he was <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/06/oregon_secretary_of_state_denn.html">diagnosed with brain cancer</a> in May and is currently undergoing treatment. &#8220;We caught it early. I have a treatment plan in place, and I have an exceptional support system here at work and at home,&#8221; Richardson wrote in a newsletter to constituents. In a video on Facebook, Richardson said: &#8220;I&#8217;m on the job. I&#8217;m going to continue. I absolutely will fulfill my responsibilities.&#8221; He promised to keep the public updated on his prognosis. We here at electionline would like to wish the secretary good luck in his battle.</p>

<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The clock is ticking on a lawsuit filed in July of 2017 that would force the state to use <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-tries-force-georgia-use-paper-ballots-2018-elections/ZAw8GHCMMPQqSRWe44OD1I/">all paper ballots</a> in the November 2018 election. According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the plaintiffs, a group of election integrity activists and voters, say the courts need to step in to safeguard democracy in Georgia.

At the Center for Technology and Civic Life, we think all voters should be able to find this information online, and we need your help! In 2016, our ballot data reached between one-third and one-half of all voters in the country, and we expect 2018 to be even bigger. We’re looking for a set of 2018 Civic Data Fellows to help us standardize the nation’s ballot information, so that all Americans can find information about what will be on their ballot in November. Civic Data Fellows will work closely with our Research Associates and Director of Civic Data to collect and standardize information about candidates and referenda from across the country.
