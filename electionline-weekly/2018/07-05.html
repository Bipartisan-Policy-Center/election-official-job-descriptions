							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Polling Place Profile</strong><br /><em>Looffs Lite-A-Line in Long Beach, California</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>There are unique polling places throughout the country. From a tractor bar in Iowa to a cemetery in Alabama, elections officials nationwide don’t just rely on schools and churches for polling places. Nowhere is that more the case than in California.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.longbeach.gov/cityclerk/elections/election-home-page/">Long Beach City Clerk</a>’s office recently had to find a new polling place and came up with one of the state’s more unique sites — Looffs Lite-A-Line, a type of ping pong bingo which can be played for a $1.25 a game. Winning jackpots range from $15 to $500.</p>
<p>“The April 10th, 2018 Primary Nominating Election was the first time Looff’s Casino Game of Skill was used as a polling place,” explained Tamela Austin, a specialist in the clerk’s office. “This site served as a great location to the voters in the district and this site was also used again in the June 5th, 2018 General Municipal Election.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Loofs.jpg" alt="Loofs" style="display: block; margin: 7px auto; border: 1px solid #000000;" /></p>
<p>According to Austin, after the owners of the old polling site informed the city that the location could not host in 2018, polling place recruitment staff scouted the area where the previous polling site had been. They walked and drove around the vicinity and asked businesses if they’d be interested in serving as a location.</p>
<p>“When a polling location is lost or not available for an upcoming election, it can become extremely challenging in finding a replacement site to accommodate voters,” Austin said. “When our staff approached Looff’’s Casino they didn’t require a lot of convincing.&nbsp;They were very open to hosting and easy to work with in getting us everything we needed to ensure a successful election day at this location.”</p>
<p>Austin said Samantha Spearman, owner of Looffs, was very accommodating and allowed elections officials to set up in an area that could easily accommodate the foot traffic and wheelchairs if necessary.</p>
<p>“When they came and asked, I didn’t even think about it,” Spearman <a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2018/06/04/historical-arcade-hosts-polling-place-continuing-family-legacy/?clearUserState=true">told</a> <em>The Long Beach Press-Telegram</em>.</p>
<p>Not everyone is always happy about change, but Austin said although there were no staff from the city clerk’s office on site during the elections, they did not receive any negative feedback about the new polling location either from poll workers or voters.</p>
<p>“This polling location was not very busy on election day, but offered voters a place to vote less than a mile away from their previous polling location, making it an easy transition for voters,” Austin said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For Spearman, what makes the idea of using Looff’s so special to her is that her mother, grandmother and great-grandmother had all served as poll workers in Long Beach. Her great-grandmother had even been a part of the suffrage movement before becoming a poll worker.</p>
<p>“It was like it was meant to be,” said told the <em>Press-Telegram</em>.</p>
<p>And in case you’re wondering, yes, it’s business as usual at Looff’s on election day, so while people were taking a chance with candidates up and down the ballot, customers at Loof’s were taking a chance of their own.</p>

<p><strong>County supervisors of elections in Florida are not happy</strong> about state requirements on <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/06/29/counties-fault-rick-scotts-staff-over-voting-money-restrictions/">how they may spend the $19.2 million in federal money for election security</a>. According to the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, the county officials are upset with a July 18 deadline to submit their applications for the money as well as a “use it or lose it” provision that would require the counties to return any unused funds by November. &#8220;The timing and the restrictions are somewhat devoid of logic,&#8221; Pasco Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley told the paper. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure why we have additional restrictions solely at the discretion of the secretary (Detzner) … It&#8217;s almost as if politics are permeating election administration.&#8221; The secretary of state’s office stresses that the funds are for this election cycle only. &#8220;The time lines are very tight,&#8221; Pinellas&#8217; Deborah Clark told the paper. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing time lines being set by people who don&#8217;t run elections.&#8221; The state’s two U.S. Senators have sent a <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/rubio-nelson-urge-election-officials-to-seek-help">joint letter</a> to the supervisors of elections encouraging them to use the money.</p>
<p><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii has issued a demand letter</strong> to the Hawaii Office of Elections vowing legal action if the state does not provide a <a href="http://bigislandnow.com/2018/07/03/aclu-demands-polling-place-for-pahoa-voters/">physical polling place for those voters on the Big Island</a> that have been displaced by the eruption of the Kilauea Volcano. “Hundreds of families in Leilani Estates, Pāhoa, Kapoho and surrounding areas have lost their homes. But the Office of Elections is only planning to let these people vote by absentee ballot—ballots that will likely be sent to the same homes that have either been destroyed by lava or are uninhabitable due to volcanic activity. The Office of Elections must provide a polling place for these folks to register and vote in person on election day, as provided by law,” ACLU of Hawaii Executive Director Joshua Wisch told <em>Big Island Now</em>.</p>
<p><strong>A burst water pipe in Manchester, New Hampshire’s City Hall</strong> has drenched some <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/public-safety/burst-pipe-damages-city-hall-soaks-basement-archive-20180704">election records</a> stored in the basement including ballots and other records from the 2016 election.

<p><strong>Mathematica Policy Research recently published a <a href="https://www.mathematica-mpr.com/our-publications-and-findings/publications/the-impact-of-democracy-prep-public-schools-on-civic-participation">study</a></strong> on The Impact of Democracy Prep Public Schools on Civic Participation. Democracy Prep is a New York City-based charter school network that serves low-income, minority students. The mission of the school is to “education responsible citizen scholars’ success in the college of their choice and a life of active citizenship. The study found a 98 percent probability that enrolling in Democracy Prep produced a positive impact on voter registration and a 98 percent probability that enrolling produced a positive impact on voting in the 2016 election. According to the study, Democracy Prep increases voter registration rates of its students by about 16 percentage points and increases the voting rates of its students by about 12 percentage points.</p>

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The Tampa city council has approved a resolution backing Amendment 4, which if approved by voters on November 6, would <a href="http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/tampa-city-council-supports-felon-voting-rights-measure">restore the voting rights</a> to approximately 1.6 million former felons.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The House and Senate have approved House Bill 335 which would reinstate the popular half day of <a href="https://www.wral.com/last-saturday-of-early-voting-restored/17663081/">early voting</a> on the Saturday before an election.</p>
<p>Also in North Carolina, the Senate gave final approval to an amendment that will ask voters this November whether or not they want to add a <a href="https://www.wral.com/voter-id-amendment-goes-to-voters/17664378/">photo ID for voting</a> requirement to the state constitution.

In his suit, attorney Spencer Scharff argues that only Congress has the right to regulate the U.S. mail and that when someone puts a ballot into an envelope, which has prepaid postage on it, it becomes mail and therefore the state cannot regulate what happens to it.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> According to the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, Secretary of State Kris Kobach will <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article214296094.html">not represent himself</a> in the state’s appeal of the proof-of-citizenship law.

<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has upheld the state’s <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/07/sjc_upholds_massachusetts_20-d.html">20-day voter registration deadline</a>. However, in its ruling, the court found that the Legislature has a duty to continually review the deadline to make sure it is no further from Election Day than what the Legislature “reasonably believes is consistent with the Commonwealth’s interest in conducting a fair and orderly election.”</p>

If this project continues, in ten more years, San Francisco will either have created new critical democratic infrastructure or will have wasted taxpayer dollars by perpetually planning for an unrealized future,” the report said. “What separates these two scenarios is strategic multilateral partnerships, open source best practices and culture, and strong commitment under unambiguous ownership.” According to the <em>San Francisco Examiner</em>, the report said that there is not a “clear project owner” to help move the project along.</p>

With nearly 8,000 offices responsible for running elections in America, the basic information that voters need to participate in elections is often poorly formatted and hard to find &#8211; if it’s online at all. At the Center for Technology and Civic Life, we think all voters should be able to find this information online, and we need your help! In 2016, our ballot data reached between one-third and one-half of all voters in the country, and we expect 2018 to be even bigger. We’re looking for a set of 2018 Civic Data Fellows to help us standardize the nation’s ballot information, so that all Americans can find information about what will be on their ballot in November. Civic Data Fellows will work closely with our Research Associates and Director of Civic Data to collect and standardize information about candidates and referenda from across the country.
