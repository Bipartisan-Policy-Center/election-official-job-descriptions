							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Creating a culture of proactive security</strong><br />
<em>Colorado’s EPIC TTX prepares for almost any scenario</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>There was a fire, a tornado, and the heating system went down in the ballot-tabulation room. There was fake news on social media and real news media in the room. Polls opened late and stayed open late.</p>
<p>The state voter registration database went down. Tabulation machines failed to tabulate. There were concerned citizens and advocates demanding to know what was happening.</p>
<p>And then there was Olga from Sputnik News who seemed overly curious about everything.</p>
<p>Those were just some of the scenarios and situations faced by Colorado county elections officials and staff participating in the <strong><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">secretary of state</a>’</strong>s EPIC table top exercise last week in Englewood.</p>
<p>The day-long EPIC TTX was based on a similar tabletop training exercise conducted by the Belfer Center in March of this year with 38 state elections officials and was designed to help prepare county elections officials and their staff for any and every possibility.</p>
<p>And based on reactions from county clerks in attendance, the effort of the secretary of state’s office was well worth it and many county clerk left Englewood vowing to put what they had learned into action immediately.</p>
<p>“I immediately met with my county administrator to discuss cyber security within my office and throughout our county offices, for both right now and what it could look like in the future,” said Eryn Wintz, <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/mineralcountycolorado/mineral-county-clerk-and-recorder"><strong>Mineral County</strong></a> clerk and recorder. “I also had a very honest discussion about my security and contingency plan that included actual practices and how to protect myself and by reflection the state by not being the &#8220;weakest link&#8221; because of limitations set by logistics or financial restraints.”</p>
<p>The morning was divided into two sessions. In the first hour-long session, the groups drilled through problems and situations that could arise in the five months leading up to Election Day. During the second one-hour session it was Election Day.</p>
<p>Moderators, which included elections officials from other states, national association staff and staff from the secretary of state’s office helped move the sessions along. All participants were assigned a role for the day, some of those roles are not who they are in real life.</p>
<p>Pulling off the EPIX TTX was a massive undertaking for the secretary of state’s office, but one that seems worth the effort. According to Judd Choate, director of elections, things went amazingly well.</p>
<p>“Better than even my most optimistic expectations,” Choate said. “Our county election officials have been effusive in their praise. More importantly, I know they walked out with a long ‘to do’ list that will lead to more security Colorado elections. So it was a huge success.”</p>
<p>Choate wasn’t always so sure it was going to be the success that it was though.</p>
<p>“Trevor Timmons (Colorado CIO), Caleb Thornton (Colorado elections legal), along with Jennifer Morrell (Democracy Fund), Amber McReynolds (Nationall Vote at Home), Dan Volkosh (Denver Elections) and I came home from the <strong><a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/election-officials-38-states-learn-fortify-elections-against-attacks">Belfer event</a></strong> in March and decided to roll it out for this election,” he explained. “That might have been a strategic error – because the time commitment was extraordinary, but I’m pleased we did it.”</p>
<p>There were three informal teams for 1) scenario development, 2) logistics, and 3) counties, moderators, and observers (press too) coordination.</p>
<p>“We will make several adjustments for future EPICs, but the basic format and scenarios worked very well,” Choate said.</p>
<p>The tabletop exercise cost about $100,000 because the state paid for all county and moderator travel. Over 300 people attended, most of whom needed reimbursement (hotel, meals, mileage). The state will use the new HAVA funds to pay for the training.</p>
<p>Following lunch, where <strong><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a></strong> <b> </b>Secretary of State Kirstjen Nielsen addressed the gathering and called Colorado’s elections the most secure in the nation, the participants met based on their roles during the exercises to debrief and come up with five to six takeaways from their roles.</p>
<p><strong>Communications and takeaways</strong><br />
The big takeaway from the day seemed to be communication. Either with the press, between the state and counties or between county clerks and their staff and the public, the importance of communication was brought up time and time again.</p>
<p>“Well since they hammered communication, I have to say that, right? No, really I think communication is vital,” said LaRita Randolph, <a href="http://www.dolorescounty.org/"><strong>Dolores County</strong></a> clerk and recorder. “Whether it means County to State, County to County &amp; County to voters. We all need to be on the same page &amp; good communication is the only way for that to be accomplished.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Choate said that one issue the secretary’s office had in pulling of the TTX was with the media.</p>
<p>“The press were a bit more demanding than we anticipated,” Choate said. “We will adjust to that in the future. At least the coverage was good.”</p>
<p>Communication was also something that Lori Mitchell, <a href="https://www.chaffeecountyclerk.org/"><strong>Chaffee Count</strong>y</a> clerk and recorder and current president of the <a href="http://www.clerkandrecorder.org/"><strong>Colorado County Clerks Ass</strong>ociation</a> said she could be learn a thing or two about.</p>
<p>“I thought I was a good communicator, but I learned that I have some work to do especially around involving more of or staff and others in our County Government,” Mitchell said. “Another valuable thing for me was to role play another position so that you learned about a different job than you normally do.”</p>
<p>Alton Dillard, the <a href="http://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html"><strong>Denver Elections</strong></a> PIO said for him it was interesting to interact with elections officials from jurisdictions of different sizes and learn what their experiences working with the media have been like. In a reversal of roles, Dillard portrayed a reporter during the EPIC TTX so he got to ask questions of participants that were based on the ones he gets on daily basis.</p>
<p>“The way it was set up, a lot of the people playing the PIO role weren’t PIOs in real life so it was an eyeopener for them too,” Dillard said. “As a 13 year Elections PIO, (and Dean of the Colorado delegation when it comes to specializing in election communications) EPIC also illustrated the evolving narrative around elections especially in today’s social media era and with elections security being front page news . The scenarios from the injects that occurred at EPIC could also occur overnight and that’s why it’s important to monitor your social media accounts constantly.”</p>
<p>Several county officials were overheard mentioning that they wished they had brought their PIOs with them to the event. Dillard said the one thing he hopes the clerks take back to their PIOs is the importance of making sure that they are looped in early and often and keeping their communications plan updated.</p>
<p>“Your communicator can’t be the last to know what may be going on in today’s environment,” Dillard said.</p>
<p>In addition to communication, there were lots of important takeaways from the day, but for Wintz from Mineral County, she said it was hard to just pick one.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the most important for me was a simple call to up my game. That encompasses so many things. The reality of the importance, the very real threat of infiltration, the target on Colorado that could by default be directed to the smallest and most rural counties,” Wintz said. “Also the appreciation for the people I have the privilege of working with, their tenacity, intelligence, and supportive nature.”</p>
<p>The secretary of state’s office even learned a thing or two during EPIC.</p>
<p>“We learned that it’s one thing to have a plan,” Choate said. “It’s another altogether to convey that plan to county election officials. So, we need to work on our communication strategy for basic election security as well as acute circumstances that require immediate action.”</p>
<p><strong>DHS participation</strong><br />
In addition to luncheon remarks by the DHS secretary, there were more than 15 DHS officials at EPIC moderating, observing and participating the training.</p>
<p>“Their contributions were essential to our success,” Choate said. “David Stern led a team of seven DHS trainers who flew in to serve as moderators (at no cost to us). They were especially important. I’m humbled by how much effort DHS is expending on helping states and localities secure elections. Between funding EI-ISAC, running and assisting in elections TTXs, and the extraordinary resources they have to offer, the DHS is clearly all-in on election security. The DHS election team even ripped off some fantastic “Last Mile” posters for us that each county took home to post in their office.”</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong><br />
Choate said the secretary’s office they would like to do reginal versions during one of their training cycles and do a full EPIC, with all counties represented on the odd years going forward.</p>
<p>The clerks in attendance that we spoke to all highly recommended that those states that haven’t done tabletop exercises like this really should.</p>
<p>“As Election Administrators, we have to take voter confidence seriously,” Randolph said. “Not just their perceptions, but also facts, and keep our elections secure.”</p>
<p>Mitchell from Chaffee County said that in addition to states doing a similar tabletop exercise, counties too should consider putting on their own TTX.</p>
<p>“Every state should replicate this exercise and adapt it to their voting model and procedures. It was so beneficial,” Mitchell said. “I want to do a scaled down version at the County level.”</p>
<p>And Choate said the Colorado secretary of state’s office is ready to help!</p>
<p>“The first thing I would say is – go all out. Your locals will learn more if you have them live it,” Choate said. “Second, there are a lot of people out there who can help. I’m happy to help for one, but DHS is a great resource, and all the election officials around the country who have been doing these themselves (NC, IL, WI, WA, WV, etc.). It’s a lot of work, so take your time and do it right. But, those of us who have lived it can help you cut some corners without missing the essential learning experience.”</p>
<p>Update on the News: Following the publication of our story last week about how states handle international IPs, we heard back from a few more states on their process. The story has been updated and can be found here.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>This week, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order authorizing sanctions against foreigners who meddle in U.S. elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt it was important to demonstrate the president has taken command of this issue, that it&#8217;s something he cares deeply about — that the integrity of our elections and our constitutional process are a high priority to him,&#8221; national security adviser John Bolton said, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The order calls for sanctioning any individual, company or country that interferes with campaign infrastructure, such as voter registration databases, voting machines and equipment used for tabulating or transmitting results. It also authorizes sanctions for engaging in covert, fraudulent or deceptive activities, such as distributing disinformation or propaganda, to influence or undermine confidence in U.S. elections.</p>

<ul>
<li>Elections should be conducted by human-readable paper ballots and voting machines that cannot be independently audited should no longer be used.</li>
<li>States should mandate risk-limiting audits.</li>
<li>Internet voting should not be used now and should only be used when there are guarantees of secrecy, security, and verifiability.</li>
<li>The integrity of voter registration databases should be routinely assessed.</li>
<li>Jurisdictions using electronic poll books should have a back-up plan in case the use of those systems is disrupted.</li>
<li>The designation of elections as critical infrastructure should continue.</li>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Vote-by-Mail News</strong>: Lots of vote-by-mail related news this week. In <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/New-vote-by-mail-law-raises-concerns-over-13224382.php"><strong>New Jersey</strong></a>, county clerks are expressing concerns that a change to the state’s vote-by-mail law may confuse voters. Under the law, voters who requested mail-in ballots for all future elections will continue to get them until they opt out. That&#8217;s a change from previous law that required officials to check in with mail-in voters to ask if they want to continue after the fourth general election since they signed up. Voters in Dawes County, <a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/community/chadron/news/dawes-county-moving-to-all-mail-elections/article_c086bf42-4def-5c75-9f77-6f8595005043.html"><strong>South Dakota</strong></a> will be voting by mail moving forward.

<p><strong>While elections officials along the East Coast are doing what they can to prepare</strong> for Hurricane Florence, officials in Jefferson County, Arkansas are faced with <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/jefferson-county-election-commission-building-experiences-water-damage"><strong>inoperable voting equipment and extensive water damage</strong></a> to the Jefferson County Election Commission after the building was hit by flash flooding and ceiling leaks from heavy rains this weekend. While the weekend’s rains exacerbated the situation, the problems really began back in the spring from a hailstorm that damaged the building. &#8220;It&#8217;s very concerning to me that if we don&#8217;t have voting machines and a building to use &#8212; it&#8217;s devastating if we don&#8217;t have an election,&#8221; Michael Adam, chairman of the Jefferson County Election Commission to KATV.</p>
<p><strong>This week, National Public Radio ran an interesting series of stories</strong> about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote"><strong>why Americans don’t vote</strong></a>. While some of the series does focus on barriers to voting such as lack of early voting or ID laws, most of the series focuses on the psychology behind not voting.</p>
<p><strong>This may be the geekiest of election geek things</strong>, be we think it sounds pretty cool. The Tennessee secretary of state’s office is hosting a workshop entitled “<a href="http://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20180908/secretary-of-state-invites-tour-of-election-related-records"><strong>Glorious Victory: Election Records at the Tennessee State Library and Archives</strong></a>,” where a veteran genealogist will show how election records can help with genealogy. The Tennessee State Library and Archives has documents directly relating to local, state and national elections, along with military election records from the early 1800s. The office regularly refers to the 1891 Enumeration List as an alternate to the 1890 Tennessee census. “Tennessee has a rich history of civic involvement,” said Tre Hargett, secretary of state. “These historical election-related records speak to this history and serve to encourage all of us to redouble our own civic efforts and carry on the important legacy and example of good citizenship demonstrated by our ancestors.”</p>

The proposed legislation would require that documentation like a valid U.S. passport, a certified birth certificate issued by a state, a consular report of birth abroad issued by the U.S. Secretary of State, or a naturalization certificate, or certificate of citizenship issued by the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security be presented when one registers to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed legislation that would provide funding to conduct the upcoming November election via <a href="http://www.themainewire.com/2018/09/veto-gov-lepage-blocks-bill-fund-ranked-choice-voting-november-elections/"><strong>ranked-choice voting</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> State elections officials have certified a <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/michigan-certifies-voting-rights-proposal-for-midterm/"><strong>ballot measure</strong></a> for the November 6 ballot that, if approved, would allow for same-day voter registration and no-excuse absentee voting.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Democrats have introduced a bill setting a requirement for how much in federal <a href="http://nj1015.com/dems-bill-pushes-murphy-to-move-faster-on-new-voting-machines/"><strong>election security funds</strong></a> must be used for new voting machines, an amount that is nearly twice as much as what the governor’s administration is planning.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: State Sen. Elaine Phillips (R-Nassau County) has introduced legislation that would <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/07/proposed-bill-would-let-schools-opt-out-as-polling-sites/"><strong>allow public schools to opt out of serving as polling places</strong></a> on Election Day. We need to let schools decide if opening their doors puts children at additional risk, and if more suitable sites should be found for Election Day voting,” Phillips told The New York Post.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals as has set an October 3 hearing to hear arguments in the legality of the state’s <a href="https://kdminer.com/news/2018/sep/09/appeal-ballot-harvesting-decision-headed-federal-a/"><strong>ballot harvesting ban</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2018/09/12/appeals-court-rejects-democrats-challenge-to-arizonas-voting-laws/"><strong>In other 9th Circuit news</strong></a>, a three-judge panel has said the Democratic National Committee could not produce “a single voter” to testify that it was harder for them to vote because of the state’s ballot-harvesting law. The court also said that the state’s rule that eliminates ballots cast outside of a person’s assigned precinct does not impose a burden on voters and that it is outweighed by the state’s need to conduct orderly elections.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> In a 27-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker partially sided with plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit that sought have elections officials in 32 counties <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article218012780.html"><strong>provide Spanish-language ballots</strong></a>. Walker ordered officials to provide sample ballots in Spanish, but did not go so far as to require bilingual ballots and poll workers. “Voting in a language you do not understand is like asking this court [to] decide the winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry — ineffective, in other words,” Walker wrote. “Courts have long held that the right to vote includes not only the right to physically enter a polling place and fill out a ballot but also the right to comprehend and understand what is on that ballot.”</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court turned down an appeal of a lower court ruling on Michigan’s <a href="https://wwmt.com/news/state/emergency-appeal-for-straight-ticket-voting-sent-to-us-supreme-court"><strong>straight-ticket voting</strong></a> mean voters will not be able to use a single mark to choose all the candidates from one party.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The New Mexico Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of a petition by the state Republican and Libertarian parties seeking to stop the implementation of <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/high-court-blocks-plan-to-restore-straight-party-voting/article_5ed179f8-7f4a-5c13-b3aa-894e9c341e34.html"><strong>straight-ticket voting</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: According to The Outer Banks Voice, federal prosecutors and ICE officials have revised their subpoena for voting records in 44 counties in North Carolina. In their revised subpoena, prosecutors have given officials <a href="https://outerbanksvoice.com/2018/09/06/feds-now-say-they-will-wait-until-january-for-ballots-election-docs/"><strong>until January</strong></a> to comply with the subpoenas. The state Board of Elections voted to <a href="https://www.wral.com/state-elections-board-to-challenge-federal-voter-records-subpoena/17826204/"><strong>fight the subpoenas</strong></a>, regardless of the deadline.</p>
<p>Also in North Carolina, Buffy Christina Quinn, 39 has been indicted on a felony charge of <a href="http://www.gastongazette.com/news/20180907/gaston-county-grand-jury-indicts-woman-for-voting"><strong>violation of election law</strong></a> for voting in the 2016 while she was still on probation.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The state has asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court’s ruling that found problems with how the state’s <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-dakota/articles/2018-09-10/appeals-court-hearing-arguments-on-north-dakota-voter-id"><strong>voter ID laws</strong></a> affect Native Americans. U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland in April agreed to expand the proof of identity Native Americans can use for North Dakota elections. The judge also ordered eliminating a requirement that those documents include residential street addresses, which sometimes aren&#8217;t assigned on American Indian reservations. The state argues the required changes could lead to voter fraud.</p>

														<p><strong>Texas:</strong> An article in the Longview News-Journal details the steps Texas is slowly but surely taking toward <a href="https://www.news-journal.com/news/local/online-voter-registration-taking-baby-steps-in-texas-area-officials/article_6abf99d2-b2ea-11e8-9329-eb857a192a49.html"><strong>online voter registration</strong></a>.

							<h2>Clearie Awards</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC “Clearies” Honor Innovation, Leadership in Election Administration</strong></p>
<p>By Brian Newby<br />
EAC Executive Director</p>
<p>What’s your secret to a successful election that serves the needs of voters? The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) invites you to tell the commission about your work and enter it for consideration in the third annual national competition for best practices in election administration.</p>
<p>The EAC clearinghouse awards, dubbed the “Clearies” for short, offer a great stage to celebrate and share innovative programs cultivated by election offices. In meeting our Help America Vote Act (HAVA) charge to serve as an informational clearinghouse for election officials, the EAC is pleased to recognize the forward-looking and effective efforts of election officials across America. These accolades are just one way the commission can meet the promise of HAVA and further its clearinghouse efforts.</p>
<p>As we travel the country and meet with election officials, we see first-hand countless fresh and innovative election initiatives deployed throughout the nation. The EAC established these awards to acknowledge the hard work, determination, and “can-do” spirit that election officials bring to even the most detailed of Election Day tasks. The EAC hopes you’ll consider entering this year’s competition so that we can honor your efforts and promote your successes.</p>
<p>As we did last year, the EAC is seeking entries for three categories: 1) innovations in elections, 2) best practices related to the recruiting, training, and retaining of election workers, and 3) accessibility for voters with disabilities. The 2017 winners of the Clearie awards can be found here and the work of others who submitted entries last year has been featured in the EAC’s blog and other resources throughout the year.</p>
<p>To make this year’s competition even more meaningful, the EAC has made the decision to dedicate the 2018 Clearies in honor of the life and legacy of Wendy Noren and R. Brian Lewis. Wendy Noran served as Clerk of Boone County, Missouri for over three decades and was an active member of the EAC’s Board of Advisors before her passing. R. Brian Lewis served as Counsel to the office of the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee before his passing and was an early and steadfast proponent of HAVA and election officials. Both were leaders in the field of election administration who will long be remembered for their hard work, integrity, and friendship. Their work is a beacon for the kind of innovation and dedication the EAC honors through the Clearies.</p>
<p>The deadline for your Cleary submissions is Friday, October 5th. To foster participation from all corners of the elections community, we purposely keep the Clearies entry process simple and straightforward. Applications from all perspectives and types of jurisdictions are encouraged to submit their work. And since we recognize that this is a busy time of year, submissions can be as simple as a half-page narrative or as complex as a series of documents and multimedia. All entries will be evaluated on their merit and previously set criteria, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficacy</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions should be sent by email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. While there is no set application, those applying should provide a brief summary of their program. They can also choose to attach any relevant documents, pictures, and links that support their submission. In the subject line, applicants should state which particular competition they are entering. If candidates have entries for more than one category, they should email them separately. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your entries to this year’s Clearies. For more information about the competition, please contact Patrick Leahy at pleahy@eac.gov.</p>
