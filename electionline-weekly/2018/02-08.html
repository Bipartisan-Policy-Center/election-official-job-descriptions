							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Orange County, Calif. Election Academy aims to educate voters<br /></strong><em>Classes help voters gain deeper understanding of process</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela once said that education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world and U.S. Rep. John Lewis once said that the vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ocvote.com/">Orange County, California Registrar of Voters</a> Neal Kelly is combining education and voting to create powerful nonviolent weapons in the form of informed voters through the county’s Election Academy.</p>
<p>The Election Academy is a six-course program that began in 2010 as an effort to expand the “superficial” knowledge that many, although well intentioned, candidates, campaigns and consultants have about elections are actually run.</p>
<p>“But, what we learned along the way was that there was also a strong desire among voters to gain a deeper understanding of the process — hence not only the birth, but the expansion of our Academy,” Kelley said.</p>
<p>To-date nearly 240 Orange County residents have participated in the Academy. Kelley said the residents taking the class is a real mix of people. He estimated that the average class is made up of 25 percent candidates and/or elected officials, 20 percent city, school district, special district employees, 10 percent students (college age) and 45 percent voters and interested members of the public.</p>
<p>All classes are held in the evenings at the registrar of voter’s office. Kelley is only minimally involved in the teaching of the classes.</p>
<p>“Not only do the subject matter experts around the office take place, but we bring in outside presenters as well—political reporters, ethics specialists, security specialists, etc.,” Kelley said.</p>
<p>A new session begins in late March and <a href="https://www.ocvote.com/community/orange-county-election-academy/election-academy-application/">applications</a> for the program are now being accepted.</p>
<p>Kelley said the courses offered have evolved over the eight years the program has been in existence, especially this year.</p>
<p>“In fact, the course offerings for 2018 have been heavily re-worked, including an entire section on security,” Kelley said.</p>
<p>The 2018 <a href="https://www.ocvote.com/community/orange-county-election-academy/election-academy-course-descriptions/">course offerings</a> include: Protecting Your Vote, a class on election security, Making it Count, a class on what happens election night after the polls close and It’s Official: Certified and Accurate, a class that walks students through the post-Election Day activities that lead up to the certification of the election.</p>
<p>The cost to the county, according to Kelley, is minimal because most of those involved with the program are salaried so there is little overtime or additional labor costs.</p>
<p>Although there has been some discussion about holding the classes online, Kelley said because there is so much hands-on instruction and tours involved with the classes it just seems more appropriate to hold the classes in person.</p>
<p>Obviously not all counties have the same resources that Orange County does, but Kelley said that shouldn’t stop them from creating their own election academy.</p>
<p>“Do it!” Kelley said. “Use their own or internal knowledge. The public is hungry for this info, and now, more than ever (in this climate) is the time ripe for us to push out as much ‘fact based knowledge’ as possible.”</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Jeanette Manfra, head of the cybersecurity department at the Department of Homeland Security has told NBC News that operatives working on behalf of the Russian government <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/russians-penetrated-u-s-voter-systems-says-top-u-s-n845721">successfully penetrated the voter registration rolls</a> of several U.S. states prior to the 2016 election. While NBC News labeled the report “Breaking” this does not appear to be anything new than what had previously been reported other than an official from the new Administration is going on the record.</p>
<p>In the report, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said he is concerned about the 2018 election because state’s seem to have done little to beef up their cybersecurity. Manfra disputed that claim saying “I would say they have all taken it seriously.”</p>
<p>Also this week, NBC News released an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/poll-most-americans-think-russia-will-interfere-again-2018-elections-n845076">NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll</a> that said 55 percent of Americans are not confident that the federal government is doing enough to prevent foreign interference in our elections. Additionally, 57 percent of Americans think it&#8217;s likely that Russia will try to influence this year&#8217;s midterms.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Laws are always changing and elections officials need to be ever vigilant</strong> to make sure that they are up-to-date. A perfect example recently popped up in Delaware. A 2013 amendment to the state constitution allowed most felons in the state to vote upon release from incarceration and a 2016 law allowed ex-felons to vote even if they still have a financial obligation. However, the state registration form and the state election department’s website had <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/03/delaware-changing-voter-registration-forms-amid-legality-concerns/300159002/">outdated information</a>. When the Campaign Legal Center brought this to the attention of state officials, they got right to work. &#8220;They are correct,&#8221; Election Commissioner Elaine Manlove told <em>The News Journal</em>. &#8220;And we will be acting on every one of their recommendations.&#8221; Manlove told the paper she is unsure why the voter registration documents were not updated after the General Assembly passed two new voter eligibility laws in the past five years. &#8220;I think maybe we thought our process didn&#8217;t change, or we just didn&#8217;t think about it at all,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><strong>What do you call it when early voting runs late?</strong> According to published reports, millions of Illinois voters could see a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-early-voting-delay-20180205-story.html">two-week delay to the start of early voting</a> due to ongoing candidate ballot challenges. Early voting was slated to start across Illinois on this week. However, due to objections to several candidates&#8217; paperwork that haven&#8217;t been resolved, ballots won&#8217;t be ready on time, Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman Jim Allen told the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. He estimated early voting will be available Feb. 21, possibly earlier. Officials in Cook, DuPage, <a href="http://www.galesburg.com/news/20180207/legal-action-delays-start-of-early-voting">Galesburg</a>, <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/news/20180207/nick-in-am-early-and-mail-voting-in-peoria-county-to-be-delayed">Peoria</a>, <a href="http://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/118994/early-voting-postponed-as-candidate-nomination-contested">Morgan</a>, and <a href="http://peoriapublicradio.org/post/ballot-dispute-delays-early-voting-mclean-county">McLean</a> counties as well as the City of <a href="http://www.wifr.com/content/news/Early-voting-within-Rockford-pushed-back-nearly-two-weeks-473019843.html">Rockford</a> in Winnebago County were also facing delays.</p>
<p><strong>Elections officials in Texas are receiving hundreds of incomplete mail-ballot applications</strong> forcing them to spend time and money to <a href="http://tpr.org/post/abbotts-mail-ballot-push-creates-backlog-county-election-workers">send rejection letters to the applicants</a>. The problem? Voters aren’t indicating whether they need a Republican or Democrat ballot for the primary. Why? Because the mail-ballot applications being sent by the campaign of Gov. Greg Abbott (R) are going to members of both party and voters, many of whom are seniors, cannot read small printed instructions that tell them they must request a specific ballot. “This application is about six-point type. A person of age — such as myself — I can’t read the application even with my glasses,” Glen Maxey, who heads the Texas Democratic Party’s mail ballot campaign told Texas Public Radio.</p>
<p><strong>The numbers are finally in and it’s going to cost</strong> St. Lucie County taxpayers $174,000 to repair the <a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/opinion/columnists/anthony-westbury/2018/02/07/irma-flooding-caused-174-000-damage-slc-elections-office-anthony-westbury/310682002/">damage done to the supervisor of elections office</a> following flooding from Hurricane Irma in 2017. Fortunately, according to Supervisor of Elections Gertrude Walker, no computers or voting machines were affected. This is not the first time the elections office has been flooded. It also suffered serious damage after Tropical Storm Fay in 2008 and has some issues every time there is heavy rain.</p>
<p><strong>Our good friends across the pond</strong> are celebrating 100 years of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/05/voting-rights-women-how-countries-stack-up/306238002/">women’s suffrage</a> (sorta) this week and here in the U.S. we’re looking forward to our centennial in 2020. <em>USAToday</em> has a list of when many countries allowed women to vote beginning with New Zealand in 1893 and most recently with Saudi Arabia in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> During his final state of the state address, Gov. Dannel P.

He also said that during his final year in office he would work to get early voting approved.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> — A House subcommittee has voted 10-0 to forward a bill that would make private most of the <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/02/01/should-voter-information-be-secret-lawmakers-say-yes/">personal data</a> associated with a registered voter. The House bill has the support of many of the state’s supervisor of elections. The Senate has yet to introduce a corresponding piece of legislation however the Senate has introduced a bill that would limit the public availability only of those 16- and 17-year-olds who are pre-registered.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> Secretary of State Lawerence Denney is seeking a 70 percent increase in his <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/feb/04/idaho-secretary-of-state-seeks-budget-boost-to-upg/">budget</a>. Most of the additional funds would cover a major upgrade to the state’s election software system.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong> — The Senate has approved SB2273 which would pull the state out of the <a href="http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/politics/illinois_senate_passes_crossch.php">Crosscheck</a> program. The 35-17 was decided along party lines with three Republicans abstaining. The bill next moves to the House.</p>
<p>Also in Illinois, under House Bill 4469, county jails would be directed to allow <a href="http://www.wsiltv.com/story/37414304/proposed-bill-would-allow-inmates-to-vote-from-jail">eligible inmates to vote-by-mail</a>. It would also establish a temporary polling place inside the Cook County jail.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Supporters of ranked choice voting in Maine have submitted more than the 80,000 signatures necessary for a “<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/02/02/ranked-choice-voters-submit-signatures-for-peoples-veto-ballot-initiative/">people’s veto</a>” which would mean sending the issue back to the voters in June. After the Legislature voted to delay implementation of ranked choice, which voters approved in 2016, supporters launched another petition drive that would in essence veto the legislature’s delay.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> The City of College Park is considering whether or not to <a href="http://www.dbknews.com/2018/02/07/college-park-absentee-voting-umd-city-council-elections-sga-no-excuse/">ease absentee voting rules</a> for city elections. Currently there are only five valid reasons for receiving an absentee ballot and one of those reasons is not attending classes at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The House has unanimously approved a bill that would provide more than $1 million in <a href="http://boxford.wickedlocal.com/news/20180206/house-approves-rep-jones-early-voting-amendment">reimbursements</a> to cities and towns for conducting early voting. The bill moves next to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> They League of Women Voters of Michigan, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and the state and Detroit branches of the NAACP have filed petition language with the state that if approved would allow the groups to circulate petitions to put an initiative on a future ballot to allow for <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/05/promote-vote-michigan-petition/110114218/">no-excuse absentee voting and same-day registration</a>.</p>

They will need to get about 2,900 valid signatures by July 10.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> With at least 330 different <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article198652129.html">initiative petitions</a> filed so far in 2018, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is seeking legislative relief. Ashcroft has asked lawmakers to overhaul the initiative process, including charging fees for filing initiative petitions and verifying signatures.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: The General Assembly has approved a bill that will move the <a href="http://auburnpub.com/blogs/eye_on_ny/assembly-passes-bill-to-change-date-of-state-primary-election/article_ee1554fc-0ade-11e8-ab42-5785ceeae203.html">state primary election</a> from Tuesday, September 11 to Thursday the 13th. Lawmakers had sought to move the bill not only because the election date coincides with the 17th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center, but also because it conflicted with Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The House and a House committee have approved bills that would restrict funding to <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/07/house-passes-election-reform-bill-opponents-deem-onslaught-against-our-initiative-and-referendum-pro/315164002/">ballot measure</a> committees from outside the state, and require circulators to give up more information on petition forms and on the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> By an 11-2 vote, the Memphis city council decide to put the question of whether voters will use <a href="https://www.memphisflyer.com/NewsBlog/archives/2018/02/06/voters-will-decide-whether-or-not-to-eliminate-council-runoff-elections">ranked choice voting</a> before the voters in November.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The House of Delegates has approved a <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2018/02/va-house-election-changes/?preview_id=17887716">series of election law changes</a> that were introduced in light of some of the issues that arose during the 2017 election cycle. By a 91-6 vote one of the bills approved would clarify the state’s recount rules and limit those to one recount. A second bill, approved 50-48 would permit the General Assembly to change district lines more often than every 10 years if the changes were meant to align the districts with new voting precinct boundaries. Under another bill, people voting absentee in-person ahead of an election would no longer be required to provide the last four digits of their Social Securitynumbers. And finally, the House approved a bill that would overhaul the state board of elections. The new board would be six members—three Democrats and three Republicans—and the board would appoint the state elections commissioner instead of the governor.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Barry Haas, a former poll worker, has filed suit against the state’s <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/feb/08/state-s-17-voter-id-law-fatally-flawed-/">voter ID law</a>. A previous law was ruled unconstitutional in 2014 and in 2017, the state Legislature approved a new law, Act 633. In his 23-page petition Haas is asking Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray to rule that the new law is also unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> A candidate for the special election for the District Two supervisor has sued the city elections department <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-District-2-candidates-sues-to-move-election-up-12544801.php">seeking to move the election</a> from November 6 to June 5. According to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, the plaintiffs cite an amendment to the City Charter passed in 2001 that election dates must minimize the time a political appointee spends in office to prevent back-room deals or giving the candidate an unfair advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S District Judge Mark Walker has ruled that Florida’s “scheme” of restoring <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/02/01/federal-judge-strikes-down-floridas-system-for-restoring-felon-voting-rights/">voting rights to ex-felons</a> is unconstitutional. &#8220;Florida strips the right to vote from every man and woman who commits a felony,&#8221; Walker wrote. &#8220;To vote again, disenfranchised citizens must kowtow before a panel of high-level government officials over which Florida&#8217;s governor has absolute veto authority. No standards guide the panel. Its members alone must be satisfied that these citizens deserve restoration … The question now is whether such a system passes constitutional muster. It does not.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The secretary of state’s office and the ACLU of Georgia have reached a settlement in a suit brought by the ACLU over Georgia’s notification process for those in danger of being <a href="https://www.wabe.org/georgia-end-controversial-step-voter-roll-deletions/">purged from the voter rolls</a>. Moving forward, the secretary’s office will instruct local elections officials to automatically update addresses for people who move within the same county.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Secretary of State Kris Kobach will represent himself during a March trial over the state’s <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article198143494.html">proof-of-citizenship law</a>. Kobach received permission to do so from Attorney General Derek Schmidt. According to the<em> Kansas City Star</em>, Kobach said his self-representation saves tax dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> St. Paul City Council member Dai Thao has been charged with <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2018/02/06/st-paul-city-council-member-dai-thao-charged-accused-of-helping-voter-cast-ballot/">unlawfully marking a ballot</a>, misconduct in or near polling places and unlawful assistance of a voter. The first charge is a gross misdemeanor, the other two charges are petty misdemeanors. Thao allegedly took an elderly voter to the polls and help her cast her ballot.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The U.S. Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/politics/supreme-court-partial-stay-north-carolina-voting-case.html">granted a partial request</a> from the North Carolina Republicans to block a voting map drawn by a federal court. The order blocked the implementation of the map while the justices consider whether or not they will hear an appeal of the map.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania has reached a settlement with Cumberland County over <a href="http://cumberlink.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/settlement-reached-over-cumberland-county-s-access-to-polling-locations/article_0cb627de-babf-532e-9d1a-1c8e9c1b0e31.html">polling place accessibility</a>. The county has agreed to evaluate its polling places for ADA compliance. “The settlement requires the county to either relocate inaccessible polling places to new, accessible facilities, or to use temporary measures such as portable ramps, signs, traffic cones and doorbells, where appropriate to ensure accessibility on Election Day,” according to the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Belinda Garcia, 45 has been charged with one count of <a href="http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/another-arrest-made-in-starr-county-voter-fraud-case/article_2a610fca-0c81-11e8-bc91-2719993ff519.html">election fraud</a> and one count of fraudulent application for ballot by mail in Starr County.

The Secretary of State’s office said most of the people who are affected by the Motor Voter error were already registered to vote. But election officials did identify 6,969 people who were not. The vast majority of them, 5,791, are women.&nbsp;Secretary of State Kim Wyman said that her elections staff will conduct daily tests going forward to confirm that Motor Voter registrations are being transmitted to the Secretary of State. The Department of Licensing also plans to conduct daily reconciliations.&nbsp;</p></p>
