							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election 2018 Preview: Ballot measures</strong><br />
<em>Voting on how we vote</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline</p>
<p>On November 6, in addition to political races, voters in 38 states will decide 157 statewide ballot measures and countless other local initiatives and referendums.</p>
<p>There will be the usual suspects like pot, taxes Medicaid expansion, and the minimum wage. But in addition there will be eight statewide ballot measures on election reform covering everything from photo ID to early voting to ballot collection.</p>
<p>In addition to the statewide elections-related ballot measures there will also be at least nine local elections-related ballot measures covering everything from lowering the voting age to non-citizen voting to ranked choice voting.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of how voters will be voting on voting on November 6.</p>
<p><strong>Statewide Measures</strong><br />
<strong>Arkansas:</strong> Voters will decide on<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arkansas_Issue_2,_Voter_ID_Amendment_(2018)"> State Issue 2</a> which if approved would require voters to present a valid photo ID to cast non-provisional ballots in person or absentee. This amendment was referred to the ballot by the House after other voter ID laws were overturned by the courts.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_4,_Voting_Rights_Restoration_for_Felons_Initiative_(2018)"> Amendment 4</a> would automatically restore the voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have completed the terms of their felony convictions. The exceptions would be those who were convicted of murder or felony sexual offense. Polls have indicated that the Amendment has wide support.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maryland_Question_2,_Election-Day_Voter_Registration_Amendment_(2018)"> Question 2</a> would allow the state Legislature to amend the state constitution in order to allow for registration at polling places on election day. Currently the state allows for same-day registration at vote centers during early voting.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> This citizen lead-initiative (<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/09/read_the_ballot_language_for_a.html">Proposal 3</a>) would amend the constitution to implement no-reason absentee voting, give military members additional time to vote, let citizens register to vote anytime with proof of residency, allow straight party voting, protect secret ballots and require audits for election results.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> This legislatively referred state statue (<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Montana_LR-129,_Ballot_Collection_Measure_(2018)">Montana LR-129</a>) would ban  persons from collecting the election ballots of other people, with exceptions for certain individuals. Exceptions include election officials, postal service workers or others authorized to transmit mail, caregivers, family members, household members and individuals known by the voter.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_5,_Automatic_Voter_Registration_via_DMV_Initiative_(2018)"> Question 5</a> is an indirect initiated state statute that would provide for the automatic voter registration of eligible citizens when receiving certain services from the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: After a protracted legal battle and a contentious legislative session voters will make the ultimate decision on North Carolina’s<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_Voter_ID_Amendment_(2018)"> Voter ID</a> Amendment. If approved, voters would be required to show a photo ID in order to cast a ballot in future elections.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>:<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/North_Dakota_Measure_2,_Citizen_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_Initiative_(2018)"> Measure 2</a>, an initiated constitutional amendment would amend the state’s constitution to clarify that only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in federal, state and local elections.</p>
<p><strong>Local Measures</strong><br />
<strong>California:</strong> Voters in the City of Los Angeles will decide whether or not they want to amend the city’s charter (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-los-angeles-election-schedule-20180905-story.html">Charter Amendment E</a>) so that the city’s primary election date will align with the state’s primary election, held in March of even-numbered years. The amendment would also make other related and technical changes to the city election procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> Voters in the City of Golden will decide whether or not they want to amend sections 3.4 and 15.14k of the Home Rule Charter (<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/03/golden-minimum-voting-age-16/">Ballot Question 2E</a>) to allow the city council to enact an ordinance that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in municipal elections while retaining the current requirement that council members be at least 18-years-old.</p>
<p>Also in Colorado, residents of Denver will decide whether or not they want to amend the city and county’s charter (<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/07/31/denver-voters-ballot-measure-2018-election-petition-thresholds/">Measure 2B</a>) to change the required number of signatures for initiatives from a percentage of votes cast in the last mayoral election to a percentage of registered voters in Denver. If approved, the amendment would also lengthen the city council’s review and comment period for proposed initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> After surviving a legal challenge, voters in the City of Bloomington will vote on whether or not the<a href="https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bec-s-future-up-to-bloomington-voters-after-judge-s/article_fb9129c3-8165-5d4a-b684-d0ac8ce57e5b.html"> city’s election commission should be abolished</a> and the McLean County clerk’s office take over the administration of elections for the city.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Residents in the City of Santa Fe will decide whether or not to<a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/ballot-question-to-change-city-election-dates-gets-council-ok/article_285cb56b-ad20-54d6-ae84-0b036d17daf6.html"> move the city’s elections</a> from spring to the fall. Voter approval of the charter amendment would establish new odd-year elections and change the beginning and end dates for elected municipal officeholders.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Fargo’s<a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4491241-approval-voting-measure-appear-fargo-ballots-november"> Measure 1</a> would change the city’s voting system from plurality voting to approval voting allowing voters to vote for any number of candidates they choose in a local election.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Voters in the City of Akron will vote whether or not amend their city’s charter (<a href="https://www.summitcountyboe.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/p17001/assets/pdf.php?election=20181106G&amp;p1=1&amp;p2=2&amp;style=X">Issue 9</a>) to move the city’s primary municipal elections to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in May.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> After months of back-and-forth within the Memphis city council, the residents of Memphis will now weigh in on<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/November_6,_2018_ballot_measures_in_Tennessee"> Referendum Ordinance 6577</a>, which if approved will repeal the city’s use of run-off elections and establish that the candidate with the most votes, wins.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Residents of Lane County will decide if they want to move to the STAR method of voting for non-partisan elections. STAR stands for,<a href="http://www.klcc.org/post/lane-county-ballot-measure-asks-voters-approve-new-voting-method"> Score, Then Automatic Runoff</a>. Using the STAR method, ballots would list every candidate and allow voters to score them zero to five. The two highest scoring candidates are the finalists for an automatic runoff. Your vote goes to whichever of those two received your higher score.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> Residents in Montpelier will decide if they want to join a small, but growing handful of municipalities that allow<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2018/10/03/montpelier-puts-noncitizen-voting-on-ballot-winooski-delays-action/"> documented non-citizens</a> to vote in local elections.</p>

														<h3><strong>My 2018 Summer Vacation</strong></h3>
<p>By Tammy Patrick, senior advisor<br />
Democracy Fund</p>
<p>As the leaves begin to turn, the nights get cooler, and we head into the Midterms, I can’t help but look back on the summer of 2018. Even though my summer was filled with airports, hotel ballrooms, conference tables and PowerPoints instead of hammocks and sand and stacks of book that beckon to be read, it was a GREAT summer.</p>
<p>My summer helps me sleep better at night knowing about all the thoughtful, diligent, effort being put into ensuring our democratic process is secure without sacrificing access. When not in the office working toward the relaunch of electionline and the network platform, I was out in the election profession wild. Here are some of the highlights from “My Summer Vacation”:</p>
<p><strong>Summer Playlist: Media  </strong><br />
I grew up during the mix-tape era, each song carefully chosen and placed in just the right order to convey the intended sentiment for the audience. The Midterm Election is upon us and for the last few months I have been working with Poynter, ElectionLand, and the Shorenstein School of Journalism at Harvard University to contemplate the messages we present to the public about our elections, their requirements, and their integrity. Assembling the Top Hits of the Summer included publication of the<a href="https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/covering-us-elections-journalism-tips"> 8 Tips for Covering Elections</a>, a free webinar for journalists<a href="http://www.newsu.org/courses/democracy-deadline-take-your-coverage-us-elections"> Democracy on a Deadline</a>, and entreating journalists to help debunk myths that persist such as that absentee (or provisional) ballots are only counted “if the election is close,” and to cover voting options early on in the election cycle rather than the last few days of early voting when we know there will be lines. I spent many hours in past summers waiting in line at Ticketmaster for sales to open (remember THAT?), but generally lines are not a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Summer “Romance”: #ElectionGeeks</strong><br />
Do election process models and detailed schemas of complex election functions make your heart sing? Do you carve the initials CDF (for Common Data Formats) into tree trunks? Probably not, but luckily for all of us there are enough dedicated #ElectionGeeks who suffer from this ailment that we have seen the culmination of years of work come to fruition over the summer in the publication of “<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/ElectionModeling/ElectionProcessModel.pdf">America’s Election Model: The Architecture of Elections</a>”—a126 pages of detailed mapping of our electoral process. This technical work may not be for everyone, so Democracy Fund has enlisted the aid of Oxide Design and will soon be releasing a primer on a handful of procedures, along with PowerPoint templates that election officials can use to educate the public on exactly what happens in their democracy.</p>
<p>One of the processes we will be highlighting is the way that voters are placed in their voting precincts and districts, something that has been in the news a bit during the summer primary season. Governing Magazine published<a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-institute/voices/col-election-districts-voter-placement-gis.html"> An Opportunity to Make Every Vote Count</a> as a clarion call for modernizing this process before the next round of redistricting. Democracy Fund Voice is currently working with grantee<a href="https://www.nsgic.org/geo-enabled-elections"> National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC)</a> to help forge relationships between state GIS departments and election officials so that we can more efficiently, and accurately, place and maintain voters in the appropriate political geographies.</p>
<p>No discussion of #ElectionGeek’ery would be complete without mentioning the partnership with academics—the political scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists who help to inform data-driven election administration. From the<a href="https://bowencenterforpublicaffairs.org/institutes/policy-research/election-admin/conference/raleigh-conference-2018/raleigh-conference-2018-agenda"> State Certification Testing of Voting Systems National Conference</a> convening hosted by Ball State and the North Carolina Board of Elections to the<a href="https://esra.wisc.edu/"> Election Sciences, Reform, &amp; Administration</a> (ESRA) conference hosted this year by the University of Wisconsin, dozens of election officials and academics met this summer to think deeply about election technologies, scatter-plots, registration data, and a myriad of other topics. The beauty of both of these meetings, in addition to their collaborative nature and relationship building, is that the majority of the content is available to everyone. I was fortunate enough to travel to Raleigh and to Madison, but the materials are viewable to all.</p>
<p><strong>Road trip!: Access &amp; Security  </strong><br />
Denver, Tampa, Minneapolis, Reno, Boston, Philadelphia, San Antonio, Williamsburg—this summer was like a good Johnny Cash song. And like most country songs, there is tension. In elections we have always felt the pull between access and security and how do we balance what can be seen as conflicting perspectives and motivations. But, as with most worthwhile efforts, commitment and determination can uncover solutions and a path forward.</p>
<p>Access can mean many things.  Have you ever had to read, and then potentially re-read, a ballot proposition or referendum? (Maybe more than a couple of times before you felt that you REALLY understood what the question was?) Now consider how that would feel if English wasn’t your first language. Hearing the challenges, and dedication, of administering language assistance to Alaskan Natives by translators, pollworkers, and the State Board of Elections was one of the highlights of 2018 when I was asked to speak at the<a href="http://www.kyuk.org/post/state-elections-division-holds-alaska-native-language-summit"> State’s first Language Summit</a>. It was a moving experience and we were honored to have Indra Arriaga from the Alaska Division of Elections and Walkie Charles from the University of Alaska join us in the “lower 48” for this year’s Democracy Fund Voice and Election Assistance Commission’s<a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2018/07/24/language-access-for-voters-summit-2018-language-summit/"> Language Access for Voters Summit 2018</a>.  Informing voters and ensuring access to the franchise for all eligible citizens means breaking down the hurtles of language, the barriers of format for voters with assistive needs, the obstacles of time and distance for military and overseas voters.</p>
<p>Security is top of mind for election officials, for voters. It is important to know that this is not a new topic for the profession, but that the level of sophistication of our adversaries is better understood now and election officials are taking advantage of the resources provided to them. Playbooks by<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/StateLocalPlaybook%201.1.pdf"> Belfer</a> and<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/elections-resources/"> Center for Internet Security</a> are widely distributed, webinar training collaborations by<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/courses/cybersecurity"> Center for Technology in Civic Life and the Center for Democracy and Technology</a> have instructed hundreds of election officials, and helpful guides like the one published by the<a href="https://www.csg.org/report_interactive.pdf"> Council of State Governments</a> are informing many levels of state governments on the securing of the franchise. State association meetings and conferences leverage the resources to inform their members.</p>
<p>My last trip of the summer was to<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2018/2600-electionlineweekly-september-13-2018"> Colorado for their election cybersecurity table-top exercise</a> (TTX), based on the Belfer model, which condensed 180 days of the election process into a two hour TTX.  It was a sight to see. The room echoed the cacophony of being in Hot Line Command Centers on Election Day with injections of cyber-attacks, system failures, fires and other natural disasters taking out polling places. Aside from the fabulous neon-green safety vest that I was asked to wear to identify my role as moderator – I posed as a chaos agent/journalist/voter/advocate/hacker – the experience was amazing. My highlight? When each of the polling locations in the room were lost I went around the room asking about the accessibility of the replacement facilities for voters with disabilities. Without skipping a beat the local officials provided me with perfect responses: they moved the site to a nearby back-up location that was already pre-surveyed to be certain it complied with the ADA, that they would position signage or a pollworker/staff at the old location directing voters to the new location, or that they had an ADA-compliant mobile unit that they were deploying and would have at the same address so no change for voters. It made me want to “Cry, Cry, Cry” with happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Letters (&amp; Postcards) Home: USPS  </strong><br />
You didn’t really think I would write a blog without a mention of USPS, did you? My summer kicked off at the National Postal Forum where, for the first time ever, we had a full day of election mail content. Even though we were in the midst of primary season, there were more than a dozen states represented in the room—industry representatives noticed that we were the only tract of content that was visited by every Postal Vice President as well as the Deputy Postmaster General. “Delivering Democracy” has been my mantra, for tens of millions of voters they don’t get their ballot from a pollworker, but rather, from their postal carrier. Together with Democracy Works we created<a href="http://www.electionmail.org/"> electionmail.org</a> as an issue resolution tool for election officials. This summer demonstrated that years of partnership and collaboration continues to pay off when USPS rolled out a new Service Type Identifier (STID) for ballots to enable better tracking of official ballots and improved services in those critical final days. It will be in use in November.</p>
<p>So, yeah.  I do sleep better at night.  It may be because of all of that I have seen, all the heady (&amp; often uber wonky) conversations, all of the passionate tête-à-têtes that I have had with election officials soldiering on to protect our elections. Or, just maybe, it is all of those things and also that I am, quite simply, exhausted.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>In a hearing before a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee this week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen clarified remarks she made last week during a cybersecurity summit and sought to assure the panel that DHS is doing all it can to secure the upcoming election.</p>
<p>She did acknowledge that<a href="https://wtop.com/government/2018/10/how-safe-is-your-vote-dhs-secretary-reassures-senators-in-light-of-chinas-unprecedented-efforts/"> China</a> is attempting to influence the election.</p>
<p>“China absolutely is exerting unprecedented effort to influence American opinion,” Nielsen said, adding that “we have not seen to date any Chinese attempts to compromise election infrastructure.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>A Deschutes County, Oregon woman recently discovered</strong><a href="https://www.ktvz.com/news/cautionary-tale-of-voter-fraud-in-central-oregon-1/805072682"> the importance of a shredder</a>. She was out of town during the January special election earlier this year and so her husband put her uncast ballot in the recycling bin. Someone fished it out, filled it out, forged her signature and cast it. Fortunately elections workers for the county caught the mismatched signature and reached out to the voter to confirm that it was not her. Deschutes County Clerk Nancy Blankenship had this advice, &#8220;If you receive your ballot and you&#8217;re not interested in participating for some reason, it would be ideal probably for you to shred that so people can&#8217;t gain access to it.”</p>
<p><strong>It’s back-to-school for members of the Alabama Board of Registrars!</strong> Secretary of State John Merrill has asked all registrars to<a href="http://altoday.com/archives/26845-john-merrill-orders-registrars-back-to-school-to-conduct-voter-registration-drives"> visit any institution of higher learning</a> in their respective counties before October 22 to conduct voter registration drives. Even if the registrars have already visited the schools this year, Merrill is asking them to return one last time before the voter registration deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Get’em any way you can!</strong> In the days leading up to Georgia’s voter registration deadline, the City of South Fulton offered residents who registered to vote or confirmed their voter registration status<a href="https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-city-voter-registration-discount-under-scrutiny/vd14aMaECGqDnfC9fEVz6J/"> $50 discounts</a> on outstanding citations. The discount was offered by the city prosecutor’s office. “I feel it is the responsibility of the courts to educate the citizens before it, including in the area of participating in elections. We did not force anyone to accept the reduced fee if they provided the paperwork,” Solicitor LaDawn Jones told the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>. “Further, I did not inquire about their political preference or mention any candidate or campaign.” Mayor Bill Edwards expressed concerns and said he would seek a legal review.</p>
<p><strong>Well, they meant well</strong>. The Linn County, Iowa auditor’s office reports that nearly  <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/nearly-500-confuse-linn-county-sample-ballots-for-the-real-thing-20181010">500</a> voters have<a href="http://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/more-300-linn-county-voters-mistakenly-mail-sample-ballots#stream/0"> returned marked copies of the sample ballot</a> they received. According to Iowa Public Radio, the office has mailed letters to those who returned the ballots, although 40 of them did not include return addresses. Still, Auditor Joel Miller told IPR, that the mailing was worth the effort. “We’ve had over 3,000 additional absentee ballot requests that we probably wouldn’t see had we not sent that mailer out,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;So lots of people followed the instructions and a very few, less than a percent, did not follow the instructions.”</p>
<p><strong>No one is certain how the rumor got started</strong>, but Monmouth County, New Jersey Clerk Christine Giordano Hanlon is trying to put a stop to it. It seems a rumor is floating around Facebook that “thousands” of voters received incorrect vote-by-mail ballots for the November election and if they inadvertently cast the wrong ballot, their vote won’t count.<a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/monmouth-county/2018/10/10/monmouth-elections-facebook-posts-ballot-mixups-fake-clerk-says/1589071002/"> &#8220;It&#8217;s false. It&#8217;s just false,&#8221;</a> she told the <em>Asbury Park Press</em>. &#8220;Whoever posted it is causing voter crisis when it doesn&#8217;t — it&#8217;s just fake.&#8221; Hanlon said her office has received fewer than 10 calls from voters concerned about potentially getting an incorrect ballot and that it does occasionally happen since vote-by-mail ballots are hand-processed.</p>
<p><strong>Ride-sharing giant<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/uber-to-offer-free-rides-to-voters-during-the-midterm-elections/"> Uber</a> has joined Lyft</strong> in offering free rides to the polls on Election Day. In addition the free rides, Uber has also created a polling place button their app to help riders find where they need to go to cast a ballot. &#8220;With the 2018 elections around the corner, many organizations and companies across the country are going the extra mile to support our democratic process,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a<a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/drivethevote/"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Using our technology and resources, we can help make it easier for every Uber rider in the US to get to their polling place at the push of a button.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> According to <em>The Indiana Lawyer</em>, Judge Tanya Walton Pratt issued an order last week in<a href="https://ecf.insd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?12017cv3936-119"> Common Cause Indiana v.

<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Senior Circuit Judge Richard Callahan has upheld most of the state’s<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article219758240.html"> voter ID law</a> but did bar the state from requiring voters without an ID from signing a statement he deemed “misleading.” Callahan ruled that the state could not require “voters otherwise qualified to cast a regular ballot” to sign the sworn statement the way it’s currently written if they didn’t have a photo ID.

Justices Ginsburg and Kagan both dissented from the court’s decision not to intervene.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Senior U.S. District Judge George Smith has ruled that notification forms Ohio sends to voters in its process to<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2018/10/federal_judge_deals_another_bl_1.html"> remove inactive voters</a> from the rolls are in fact compliant with federal law.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Territories</strong>: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review<a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/u-s-supreme-court-won-t-review-lawsuit-to-expand/article_04fc0058-cc2c-11e8-9fd4-f3d6981d319e.html"> Segovia v.

<p><strong>California:</strong> Secretary of State Alex Padilla has called for an independent audit of the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles after another 1,500 residents, including non-citizens, were<a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-dmv-more-voter-registration-errors-20181008-story.html"> improperly added to the voting rolls</a>. Following the latest disclosure about more people being wrongly added to the voter rolls, Secretary of State Alex Padilla said a press conference that a<a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article219739930.html"> freeze</a> of the state’s Motor Voter program is “certainly on the table.” “We’re doing the homework as we speak of what does that mean and what it would take,” Padilla said. “These mistakes from the DMV are absolutely unacceptable.”</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> Scott County residents have a new way to find out where they vote. Recently, County Auditor and Commissioner of Elections Roxanna Mortiz announced the new<a href="https://wqad.com/2018/10/04/where-do-i-vote-app-available-in-scott-county/"> WhereUVote</a> Scott County app. The app helps users find early voting times and locations, Election Day times and locations and a way to contact the auditor’s office. “With so many people of all ages now using mobile devices it just makes sense to provide a mobile friendly alternative to people,” Moritz told WQAD. “Four other counties in Iowa provide this app to their citizens. As soon as I saw it I knew we needed this app for Scott County. It’s perfect for people on the go.”</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Potter County will be the first county in the state to use<a href="https://www.newschannel10.com/2018/10/08/potter-county-using-languageline-translation-service-diverse-voter-population/"> LanguageLine</a>, a visual translator for more than 200 language. “Between the American Sign Language and Somalian, we realized we had a gap,” Elections Administrator Melynn Huntley told KFDA. “We are not required by law to do this. We just felt like this was something we should do because it’s the right thing to do.” When a voter who doesn’t speak English or Spanish shows up on election day, they will be prompted to select a language from a tablet device. A virtual translator will appear on the screen and the election worker will ask for voting information and instructions to be translated to the voter.</p>

							<h2>Clearie Awards Deadline Extended! </h2>
														<p><strong>EAC extends deadline for third annual competition for best practices in election administration</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has extended the deadline for submissions for its third annual “Clearie” awards, a national competition for best practices in election administration, until Friday, November 30, 2018. This year, the Commission will present awards in the categories of best practices related to voting accessibility, outstanding innovations in elections, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. All entries must be received no later than Friday, November 30, 2018.</p>
<p>This year, the Clearie awards are dedicated the life and legacy of Wendy Noren and R. Brian Lewis.<a href="https://www.eac.gov/documents/2018/07/30/eac-commissioners-issue-joint-statement-honoring-wendy-noren-/"> Wendy Noren</a> served as Boone County Clerk for over three decades and was a member of the EAC’s Board of Advisors before passing away in July 2018 following a long battle with cancer. R. Brian Lewis served as Counsel to the office of the Senate Majority Leader before his passing and was an early and steadfast proponent of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and election officials. Both were luminaries in the field of election administration who will long be remembered for their work and friendship.</p>
<p>“Election officials are known for their commitment to the values expressed in the EAC Clearie awards: excellence, innovation, maintaining accuracy and integrity in the election process and ensuring all eligible citizens can cast a ballot,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks. “The Clearies are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficacy</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>

</ul>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition or Outstanding Innovations Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a brief summary of the election program nominated and attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry.
