							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Postal Forum 2018</strong><br /><em>Who? What? Where? When? &amp; Why?</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick, senior advisor, elections<br /><a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">The Democracy Fund</a></p>
<p>Since 1968, the <a href="http://npf.org/">National Postal Forum (NPF)</a>has served as the preeminent “educational venue, trade show, and networking event” for the <a href="https://www.usps.com/">United States Post Service</a> (USPS) and the industry it serves.</p>
<p>Last week, thousands of thousands of mailers, shippers, postal employees and management gathered in San Antonio for the 50th NPF. The event featured more than 130 workshops and sessions on how to best utilize postal delivery and products.</p>
<p>For the last five Forums, I have had the opportunity to share with attendees the critical role that vendors and USPS play in “Delivering Democracy” to the American Electorate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stamp.jpg" alt="Stamp" style="margin: 7px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />This year was different.</p>
<p>It was even better.</p>
<p>For the first time there was an entire day of election mail content at the Forum curated specifically for election administrators, there was a discounted day-rate for election officials, and outreach to inform the community about the event.</p>
<p>“Dan Bentley and team were smart to create a special ‘election mail’ summit at the National Postal Forum where election officials and the USPS could meet to discuss our common objectives. With more jurisdictions turning to vote-by-mail, these conversations are even more important,” said Judd Choate, <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">Colorado</a> election director.</p>
<p>Choate shared how Colorado utilizes <a href="http://www.nationalchangeofaddress.com/">National Change of Address</a> services in their voter registration list maintenance efforts in an agenda that seamlessly blended shared experiences from election offices with vendor perspectives and Postal input.</p>
<p>Attendees from more than a dozen states (even though we are in the midst of primary season) had the opportunity to hear from vice presidents in five different areas of the Postal Service, but also from the Deputy Post Master Ron Stroman himself.</p>
<p>Stroman’s personal commitment to election mail is becoming legendary within the election administration community; he understands the important role they play: for tens of millions of U.S. voters they don’t get their ballot from a pollworker, but rather, their postal carrier.</p>
<p>Kathleen Conway, city clerk for <a href="http://www.rockvillemd.gov/index.aspx?NID=415">Rockville, Maryland</a> had never been to NPF before but thought it was important as her jurisdiction will be the first municipality in Maryland to conduct all-mail elections.</p>
<p>“I know that the USPS is committed to mail delivery. My surprise was hearing the overwhelming commitment of the USPS with Election Mail. Deputy USPS Postmaster General Ron Stroman’s pledge by the USPS ‘to do everything in their power to ensure every voter who wants to vote by mail is able to do so … and to ensure ballots are safe and secure’ was very powerful to me,” Conway said. “The USPS is committed to delivering the mail, which I believe is common knowledge, however I had not heard their commitment to Election Mail delivery and security expressed in this manner.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a commitment to partnership and collaboration that has been a constant with their promotion and receptivity to electionmail.org — the online tool for election administrators to convey issues or challenges that they are facing at the local level.</p>
<p>Ballot delivery and tracking was also a big topic at NPF.</p>
<p>David Bjerke, <a href="http://www.fallschurchva.gov/135/Voter-Registration-Elections">Falls Church, Virginia</a> registrar of Voters shared his experiences in implementing ballot tracking in 2017.</p>
<p>“Neighborhood polling places are expensive, time limited, and can have long lines, all of which decrease turnout,” Bjerke said. “As more places consider the vote-by-mail/vote-at-home ballot delivery system, costs will decrease, turnout will increase, and with technology like ballot tracking (Intelligent Mail barcodes aka IMb), confidence in this system will increase.”</p>
<p>NPF is the perfect place to network and discuss some of the challenges our voters face globally. One panel, moderated by David Beirne of the <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/">Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP) included panelist Charles Martin, management analyst for the <a href="https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/military-postal-service-agency">Military Postal Service Agency</a> (MPSA).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/stamp2.jpg" alt="stamp2" style="display: block; margin: 7px auto; border: 1px solid #000000;" /></p>
<p>“I came to this year&#8217;s NPF to share experiences on how difficult Military deployments and frequent address changes are on updating voting and address lists,” Martin explained. “To inform the stakeholders on processes and procedures being used to mitigate barriers to casting ballots,”</p>
<p>Martin went on to highlight the importance of relationships “…To hopefully, illuminate how critical maintaining relationships between stakeholders (Service Members, FVAP, Election Officials, and Postal providers) is to the entire election process and securing the right to vote for all who are eligible; And finally, learn how we can all work together to improve the reliability of the voting and mailing processes involved.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my part, I wanted to emphasize how important effective communication is in serving our voters well. The attendees and panelists made this point an easy one.</p>
<p>As Kim Waltz from <a href="http://www.cathedralcorporation.com/">Cathedral</a> put it “…[I]t was well worth our time to attend and listen first hand to the other presentations as well as the challenges and concerns of the election mail officials across the country”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m excited to work with our partners at USPS to design a customer centric process for ballot delivery &#8211; one that is efficient for Voters and one that achieves operational efficiencies for local election offices and USPS. Better service in an efficient way for our customers is a win-win!” Amber McReynolds, <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html">Denver</a> director of elections.</p>
<p>In addition to the electionmail program, <a href="http://npf.org/pdfs/NPF%202018%20Program%20Guide.pdf">NPF offers workshops</a> on mailpiece design, address hygiene, marketing strategies, undeliverable mail, and the numerous data products that can save time and money in a busy election office. (Are you still hiring temps/paying overtime for staff to key in address change data from those yellow stickers? You can get that data directly without re-keying! Look into <a href="http://about.usps.com/publications/pub8.pdf">ACS</a>, thank me later.)</p>
<p>I asked election officials at NPF if they would recommend it to other officials. From officials just getting started in the vote-by-mail “business” to those who have been doing it for a while, they all said yes.</p>
<p>Pam Anderson, who serves as the executive director of the <a href="http://www.clerkandrecorder.org/">Colorado County Clerk’s Association</a> said the forum is helping her inform her membership since the state moved to the vote-by-mail/vote center model.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NPF Election forum was a great opportunity for me to take back important information on serving voters to our association” Anderson said. “It also provided important resources and contacts to enhance our very important partnership with the USPS.”</p>
<p>And Janice Case, from <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections.aspx">King County, Washington</a> where they’ve been voting entirely by mail since 2011, USPS is a huge partner and key component of making vote by mail successful and the county is always looking for ways to further improve the process whether it is improving the county’s relationship with USPS or utilizing new tools like Informed Delivery.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad they have added this component to their NPF conference and hope they will continue to do so,” Case said.</p>
<p>NPF 2019 will be May 5-8th in Indianapolis. We hope to see you there.</p>

							<h2>MIT Election Data Lab Update</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. MIT Election Data &amp; Science Lab Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>MIT Election Lab launches new website and newsletter</strong></p>
<p>By Claire DeSoi, communications assistant<br />MIT Election Data and Science Lab.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve already heard of the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election Data &amp; Science Lab</a> (MEDSL), a relative newcomer on the elections scene – but even if you have, we’d love the chance to introduce ourselves to you. We are dedicated to supporting advances in election science, and to improving our collective understanding of how elections are administered. We collect, analyze, and share data on U.S. elections, and work with election officials and scholars around the country to apply new scientific research to the practice of democracy.</p>
<p>MEDSL grew out of the work that has been conducted at MIT over the past two decades to study the role of technology in elections, and to contribute research that advances the scientific side of election administration — a field now called election science. That work has been connected to two major initiatives. The first is the <a href="https://www.vote.caltech.edu/">Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project</a>, which will continue and will be supported administratively at MIT by MEDSL. The second was the work done by MEDSL’s founding director, Charles Stewart, as he worked with the Pew Charitable Trusts on a number of projects, most notably the <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/data-visualizations/2014/elections-performance-index">Elections Performance Index</a> (EPI) and the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/SPAE">Survey of the Performance of American Elections.</a></p>
<p>When MEDSL began, we knew that we would need to share our work in a clear, accessible way with a wide range of readers, from academics to poll workers to voters. So, although the Lab has been at work for more than a year, we knew we needed to take that time to set up a foundation for our launch pad before we blasted off, so to speak. In that time, we’ve grown from two people to a team of staff, accompanied by a number of graduate and undergraduate researchers, and we now count the support and knowledge of a network of practitioner and academic experts. We’re now preparing some really exciting work that we’ll launch later this year — including an update to the EPI.</p>
<p>In March, we set a new website quietly loose on the world, without much fanfare, while we tested some of the features and got feedback from experts and users. Visitors since then have already seen it, but we officially launched it on May 10, and we encourage you to take some time to <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">explore the information and features on it</a>!</p>
<p>Ultimately, part of our mission is to ensure that information and research about elections and election administration is accessible to researchers, decision-makers, and folks who are just interested in how elections work in the United&nbsp;States. We’re proud to be working alongside a host of institutions and individuals to make that information available.</p>
<p>As we look forward, we’ll continue to shape the content on the MEDSL website to reflect our mission, and add to the growing field of election science. One of our <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/putting-the-data-in-medsl-8d7f8169989d" target="_blank">top priorities</a> is to identify and collect datasets that help fuel research — the data we collect and post to our site will stay there, free for use for scholars focused on U.S. elections. We’ll also continue linking to other resources and relevant open data sources, and will keep adding the tools we develop that make working with election data easier, like our <a href="https://github.com/MEDSL" target="_blank">R-package</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>At the same time that we’re diving into the data side of things, we think it’s important to demystify important concepts in election science, and to highlight new research. That means ensuring our website has a place that anyone can browse to find in-depth, rigorous reports from national or local experts or our own staff (like <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/improving-the-voter-experience-reducing-polling-place-wait-times-by-measuring-lines-and-managing-polling-place-resources/" target="_blank">this new report measuring voting lines</a>, which we worked on with the Bipartisan Policy Center), as well as straightforward, nonpartisan guides to key issues that matter to voters and policymakers.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join the conversation on elections, whether you’re an academic, a local election official, or you simply care about using scientific methods to improve the ways elections work. We’ve also launched a <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/">blog on Medium</a> and a <a href="bit.ly/2I5QGtd">quarterly newsletter</a> to provide nonpartisan news and updates from the field of election science, and we hope you’ll subscribe and follow along. We’ll showcase our research, the accomplishments of the experts engaged in research or practice around the country, and innovative ideas about elections and election management. Sign up <a href="https://mailchi.mp/6d7d2506b1b4/sign-up-for-the-medsl-newsletter" target="_blank">here</a> to receive the newsletter and hear directly from MEDSL as we continue our&nbsp;work, or follow along on <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/">Medium</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/MITelectionlab">Twitter</a>.</p></p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>Four more states held primary elections this week and other than the show put on by Mother Nature in Pennsylvania, it was, all things considered, a relatively quiet day.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> A high percentage of incorrectly filled out ballots had officials in <a href="https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/bad-ballots-had-c-counting-votes-past-a-m-on/article_1de70ccd-1e79-5a3e-9ec3-8a1a8d5efca7.html">Canyon County</a> counting ballots till 3 a.m. Although he was on the ballot and won the race, <a href="https://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/brown-wins-republican-state-representative-primary-despite-confusion-on-ballot/article_8228d9b5-af4b-5c13-9d1d-c061b8818b01.html">Bannock County</a> elections officials and representatives in the secretary of state’s office both report receiving numerous calls questioning whether or not Kevin James Brown was still in the race for state rep. It’s unclear where the confusion came from. Although they did not run out of ballots, as some reported, <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/article211167809.html">Ada County</a> did scramble to supply enough Democratic ballots after a strong turnout. Incumbent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/15/us/elections/results-idaho-primary-elections.html">Secretary of State</a> Lawerence Denney (R) will face Democrat Jill Humble in November.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> <a href="http://nebraska.tv/news/local/nebraska-secretary-of-state-disappointed-by-low-voter-turnout-in-primary">Turnout</a> in the Cornhusker State was just 24.3 percent. In <a href="http://nebraska.tv/news/local/voter-turnout-low-but-hall-county-sees-more-young-voters">Hall County</a>, where turnout was around 22 percent, a large number of young and first-time voters hit the polls. “So I looked at some of the numbers for teenage voters, first time voters, those kids who are 17-18 years old. We had almost 350 first time voters registered for the election. Of those, 44 were 17 year olds. So I think we have some up and comer voters and I think that&#8217;s encouraging for Hall County,” Election Commissioner Tracy Overstreet to KNTV. In <a href="https://beatricedailysun.com/news/local/more-ballots-cast-early-than-on-election-day-in-gage/article_618c0f20-e347-5aa3-adfa-be6c3803ed78.html">Gage County</a>, where turnout topped 36 percent, more people voted early than on election day. Republican Bob Evnen will face Democrat Spencer Danner in the race to replace outgoing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/15/us/elections/results-nebraska-primary-elections.html">Secretary of State</a> John Gale.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> The biggest story out of the Beaver State on Tuesday was the <a href="http://www.ktvz.com/news/secretary-of-state-reacts-to-low-primary-voter-turnout/742640304">low voter turnout</a>. Although Oregon votes by mail and has automatic voter registration, turnout was just over 33 percent. According to KTVZ that’s the lowest turnout seen in 40 years of primary elections. &#8220;The elections turnout was a little disappointing in the primary election,&#8221; Secretary of State Dennis Richardson told KTVZ.&nbsp;&#8220;But what we find is if there is controversy in major issues, major primaries that are of major concern, then we will have a better turnout.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> With turnout already low, <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-election-day-lehigh-valley-20180514-story.html">Mother Nature</a> crashed the party in the Commonwealth late in the day on Tuesday. Although polling places stayed open, some had to rely on <a href="http://www.dailyitem.com/news/local_news/flashlights-generators-paper-ballots-employed-for-primaries/article_7d6e2e89-7fe2-5319-81d7-5a7548061f84.html">flashlights</a>, back-up generators and paper ballots. In <a href="http://www.pahomepage.com/news/storm-damages-carbon-county-polling-place/1181365717">Carbon County</a> a polling place had to be moved late day after two utility poles came down on the building. A storm-related gas leak mean that the polls in <a href="http://radio.wpsu.org/post/wagner-will-challenge-gov-wolf-lt-gov-stack-loses-primary-fetterman">Delaware Water Gap Borough</a> had to remain open until 10:30pm. In <a href="http://thetimes-tribune.com/power-restored-in-wyoming-county-courthouse-about-an-hour-after-polls-closed-1.2337519">Wyoming County</a>, although voting continued, ballot counting was delayed due to the storm. It wasn’t the storm that caused issues at one polling place in <a href="http://wnep.com/2018/05/15/construction-causes-confusion-near-polling-place/">Luzerne County</a>, it was construction.</p></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) has arranged for top U.S. intelligence officials to <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/387770-speaker-ryan-schedules-briefing-for-congress-on-election-security">brief members of Congress</a> on the administration’s efforts to guard voting systems across the country from hackers. The meeting, scheduled for press time of electionline, will include Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The meeting will not be open to the public.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week, Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) announced</strong> that the state would <a href="http://komonews.com/news/local/inslee-oks-prepaid-ballot-postage-except-in-king-county">pick up the tab for postage</a> for mail-in ballots in both the state’s primary and general elections. The governor’s office will kick in $600,000 and the secretary of state’s office will kick in another $600,00 to cover postage in 38 of the state’s 39 counties. In announcing the decision, Inslee also noted that the state would not pay for the postage in King County because the county had already voted to do so. Although Secretary of State Kim Wyman did say that she and Inslee would ask the Legislature in 2019 to reimburse King for the 2018 expenditure and to approve a permanent prepaid ballot program. Needless to say, <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2018/May/15-prepaid-ballot.aspx">King County officials</a> were not too happy about that part of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, even the best of intentions go awry.</strong> Recently, a Paulding County, Georgia elections worker placed a sign outside of McClure Middle School to <a href="http://www.mdjonline.com/news/same-name-wrong-school-paulding-elections-worker-mistakenly-places-signs/article_2bccdbe4-585f-11e8-847c-13e09d0243a7.html">inform voters that the school will not be a polling place</a> for the May 22 primary. The problem is, the McClure Middle School where the sign was placed is in Cobb County and that county is most definitely using that middle school for a polling place. There is also a McClure Middle School in Paulding and that site will not be used on election day. Apparently, the election worker was new and plugged the wrong McClure Middle School into their GPS.</p>
<p><strong>The Maine Secretary of State’s office has created</strong> a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=137&amp;v=xcGGH7E_vNk">5-minute video</a> to explain how ranked choice voting in the state’s <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/05/14/state-releases-video-on-ranked-choice-voting-ahead-of-closely-watched-elections/">upcoming June primary</a> will work. Once again, an animated Matt Dunlap takes center stage in the video. In addition to the video, Dunlap’s office has also posted sample ballots, an FAQ and final rules for the voting tabulation process. “These are the final components of our ranked-choice voting resources web page, which we are providing so that voters can educate themselves about this new process before going to the polls or marking their absentee ballots,” Dunlap said in a statement. “I also look forward to meeting with voters to discuss this information with them during my visits this month.” In addition to the efforts by the state on voter education, several <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/ranked-choice-voting-education-campaigns-underway-primaries-near#stream/0">advocacy groups</a> are also working to inform voters about the new system.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations are in order for Heather Doane and Trish Robertson</strong> for receiving the Unsung Hero and Rising Star awards from the Southwest Florida Chapter of the Florida Public Relations Association. Doane, who received the Rising Leader Award, is the voter education coordinator for the <a href="https://immokaleebulletin.com/government/elections-office-staff-recognized-by-the-swfl-chapter-of-fpra/">Collier County, Florida supervisor of elections office</a> and Robertson, who received the Unsung Hero Awards, is the communications coordinator for the office.</p>

This week, by a 24-13 vote, the Senate approved legislation that would restore the voting rights to those who have been out of prison for five years. The bill now heads to the governor’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Residents of College Park will no longer require an excuse to vote absentee after a bill sponsored by Sen. Will Smith (D-Montgomery) was signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan. The law, which takes effect June 1, prohibits municipalities from requiring an <a href="http://www.dbknews.com/2018/05/17/umd-college-park-no-excuse-absentee-voting-signed-hogan/">excuse to vote absentee</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Circuit Judge Raag Singhal has ruled that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sb-broward-elections-supervisor-broke-law-snipes-canova-20180514-story.html">violated state and federal laws</a> by destroying ballots from a 2016 Congressional race while the ballots were the subject of a lawsuit against the office. According to the <em>Sun Sentinel</em>, based on that ruling, Florida’s Department of State will send election experts to the Broward elections office in the upcoming election “to ensure that all laws are followed,” the governor’s office said. It could also cost the elections office more than $200,000 to pay attorney’s fees for Tim Canova, the defeated candidate who sued the office.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall has issued an order that Fulton County elections officials should grant the secretary of state’s office <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/judge-grants-request-for-docs-linked-atlanta-mayoral-vote-probe/D0S4MMebQ9FR9YBPfOZLgO/">“immediate access”</a> to ballots, recaps, tally sheets, voter applications and other documents related to the 2017 Atlanta mayoral contest the secretary of state’s office is now investigating.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> A group of Kane County voters have filed suit against the county clerk <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180514/lawsuit-kane-clerks-ballot-error-mandates-do-over-on-failed-fire-district-tax-hike">seeking to have a March 20 tax vote voided</a> because there was incomplete information on the ballot. When the mistake was discovered on March 9 during early voting, the county clerk allegedly drew up a plan to address the missing information, but when the voters who are suing cast their ballot on March 14, the missing information was still missing from the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> U.S. District Judge Jon D. Levy ruled this week that The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting may not intervene in a pending lawsuit seeking to block the use of <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/05/16/judge-rules-ranked-choice-voting-advocacy-group-cant-intervene-in-lawsuit-aimed-at-blocking-it/">ranked choice voting</a> in the June primary. In his ruling, Levy said the inclusion of the group in the suit “would complicate a case that badly needs to be expedited.”</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Gov.

Officials wanted the site moved because it was located outside of the area that it serves. Forman determined that the petition did not establish itself in line with Article 78.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia has given Texas until May 17 to tell him how the state will comply with the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/05/11/federal-judge-texas-must-propose-remedy-voting-rights-violation/">National Voter Registration Act</a>. More than a month ago Garcia ruled that Texas was in violation with NVRA and now state officials have a deadline to comply with that ruling.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, Laura Janeth Garza, 38, has been indicted by a Montgomery County grand jury on two charges of <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Mexican-national-indicted-for-illegal-voting-in-12914425.php">illegally voting</a> in Harris County after she allegedly stole the identity of a U.S. citizen and using that information to register to vote.</p>
