							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Harvard Kennedy School Hosts Event on “Getting to 80 Percent”</strong><br /><em>All-day gathering focuses on “moonshot” of improving voter participation</em></p>
<p>By Doug Chapin</p>
<p>Many(!) years ago, I worked on a statewide campaign in my home state of Virginia – and as part of preparations for Election Day, I met a local activist in Farmville to discuss GOTV.</p>
<p>As the conversation started, he asked me, “do you know what GOTV means?”</p>
<p>Now, I’m no political expert (fact check: I’m still not), but I felt pretty confident about this one – I answered, “it means Get Out The Vote.”</p>
<p>He said, “That’s what it stands for. What does it mean?” Seeing my blank face (fact check: I still have that, too), he smiled and explained “GOTV is the process of turning peoples’ GET-OUT into a VOTE.”</p>
<p>In other words, he went on, GOTV is the process of turning all that enthusiasm that’s been generated during a campaign – for your candidate, against your opponent, whatever – into an actual vote on Election Day.</p>
<p>I thought about that conversation a lot last week when I had the good fortune to join a meeting at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government focused on improving voter turnout – to unprecedented levels. Entitled “Getting to 80 Percent” and sponsored by HKG’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School; and the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, the meeting brought together folks from across the country to talk about what it would take for the country to undertake what organizers called a “moonshot” goal of 80 percent participation – which is especially significant given survey data showing the strong recent uptick in interest in elections among many sectors of the American public.</p>
<p>Here’s the overview from the <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/GettingTo80">meeting page</a>:</p>
<p><em>A persistent and deeply troubling problem of American democracy is low voter participation. The US ranks 28th out 35 OECD countries in voting turnout&#8211;55 percent of voting age population in 2016. On the presumption that this is unacceptable, and we want the widest possible participation in American democracy, what would it take to seriously move the needle on this issue, to have 80 percent of Americans voting? What policies could really work? What cultural shifts do we need to make? How can new technologies and platforms be best utilized? How can young people become a new civic generation?</em></p>
<p><em>During a one-day intensive session at the Harvard Kennedy School, journalists and media, technologists, business leaders, elected officials, scholars, and grassroots advocates and organizers&#8211;all passionate about American democracy&#8211; will convene to talk about pushing the envelope and sparking the cultural and policy shifts we will need to increase voter participation in a major way for our country’s future.</em></p>
<p>The day was organized around a series of sessions where participants had an opportunity to discuss different aspects of the participation challenge:</p>
<p><strong>Reimagining Participation: Creating a Culture Shift</strong><br />We are entering a new era of civic engagement where influencers are creating new ways to inspire voters. How can we continue to shift the way voting is perceived throughout sectors of society, from business leaders incorporating voting as a social responsibility to cultural influencers raising the profile of civic duty?</p>
<p><strong>Leading the Way: Technology and Social Media as Participation Innovators</strong><br />Innovations in technology and social media have revolutionized the way citizens are informed and participate in democracy. How can we lift up what’s working and conceptualize ways for new technologies and social media platforms to encourage more voter participation?</p>
<p><strong>The Change Generation: Young Americans and Participation</strong><br />We know that people become life-long voters when engaged in civic duty early in life. Students are building momentum in turning their peers into voters. How can we build on the momentum across college campuses and elsewhere in registering voters and how do we support their power to organize and achieve higher participation?</p>
<p><strong>States at the Cutting Edge</strong><br />Some states have adopted multiple policies to encourage voting, others lag way behind. Can we lift up the examples of states who have achieved significant voter participation increases, looking at the technologies employed, the policies adopted, and the political and cultural conditions that made voter increases possible?</p>
<p><strong>Closing the Participation Gap: Mobilizing Non-Voters</strong><br />Do we know who is not voting and do we know why? What strategies have been successful in engaging these voters and increasing their representation at the polls?</p>
<p><strong>The Policy Landscape: Universal Registration, Universal Voting</strong><br />In addition to taking down the current barriers to voting, can we advance the conversation around policies to make voter registration truly universal? Can we explore possibilities for putting the idea of universal voting into the public debate?</p>
<p>It was an incredibly lively day of discussion – and here’s what I got as the top-level takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving participation to 80 percent isn’t an immediate or short-term goal – but it’s still important as an antidote to cynicism and a way of thinking about engaging more Americans in the democratic process;</li>
<li>One of the most effective things anyone can do to encourage voting is simply to ask – and reach beyond so-called “high-propensity voters” to those to rarely vote or never have before.</li>
<li>Voters need a reason to vote beyond simple exhortations to exercise their rights – making the connection between elections and public issues of importance (education, taxes, immigration, public safety, etc.) helps establish that voting is an opportunity and not just a duty;</li>
<li>States and localities are creating more opportunities for people to cast a ballot on and before Election Day and are developing tools to let them learn about the process – and thus everyone can help individuals manage their own voter’s journey by encouraging them to “be a voter” and be ready for Election Day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to everyone at Harvard for organizing the event. It was a fantastic day; obviously, “getting to 80” is a huge goal but it’s worth it. It’s no secret that levels of energy (i.e., “get out”) are higher than ever before – all that’s left is for the community to come together and turn it into votes.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>President Donald J. Trump recently met with members of his administration including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/386202-trump-meets-with-cabinet-officials-on-securing-elections-against-malign">to discuss election security</a>. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the president received an update about current federal election security-related efforts, including information sharing and best practices like using paper ballots, issuing security clearances and conducing security assessments. A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/readout-president-donald-j-trumps-meeting-regarding-election-security/">full read out</a> of the meeting can be found here.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee has concluded that Russia was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/russia-2016-election-hackers.html">preparing to undermine confidence</a> in the United States’ voting process when hackers surveilled around 20 state election systems. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, the committee said it saw no evidence that the Russians had ultimately changed vote tallies or voter registration information.</p>
<p>“These activities began at least as early as 2014, continued through Election Day 2016, and included traditional information-gathering efforts as well as operations likely aimed at preparing to discredit the integrity of the U.S. voting process and election results,” the senators <a href="https://www.burr.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/RussRptInstlmt1-%20ElecSec%20Findings,Recs2.pdf">wrote</a>.</p></p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia all held primary elections this week and overall, things went well although there were a few reports of scattered problems in each state.</p>
<p>In <strong>Indiana</strong>, in <a href="https://www.eaglecountryonline.com/news/local-news/ballot-scanner-mishap-looms-over-dearborn-county-elections/">Dearborn County</a>, most of the counties ballot scanning machines were disabled by dead batteries. The county tested the machines a few weeks before the election and found no problems and the year-old batteries were supposed to have five-year lifespan. In <a href="http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/shoving-match-among-poll-workers-breaks-out-at-lake-county/article_74f4cf1c-8b7a-5dc4-9524-f671e0e5dae9.html">Lake County</a>, a kerfuffle broke out between poll workers as they were returning to the county government center. A sheriff’s deputy was called. Several counties, including <a href="http://www.bannergraphic.com/story/2511126.html">Putnam</a> and <a href="http://www.flyergroup.com/news/local_news/new-voting-system-a-hit-with-voters-and-candidates-alike/article_cdbcc6a7-ea42-59af-92cf-432afafe0f41.html">Hendricks</a>, rolled out vote centers for the first time and feedback from elections officials and poll workers was positive. In <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/38139238/clark-county-voters-say-ipad-use-at-polls-is-working-well">Clark County</a>, voters and elections workers both sung the praises of the county’s new e-poll books.</p>
<p>In <strong>North Carolina</strong> there were some issues and one polling place had to be kept open later, but overall things went well especially considering that many county boards of elections had not been fully staffed until recently. Voting was extended in one precinct until 7:45pm in <a href="https://www.wral.com/for-most-everyone-it-s-time-to-vote/17537613/">Hoke County</a> because the precinct opened late. In <a href="https://www.robesonian.com/news/110883/accident-injures-4-at-polling-site">Robeson County</a>, voting was extended until 8:15 pm after an accident outside the polling place delayed voters. A polling place in <a href="http://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/franklin-county-shootout-school-lockdown-could-mean-extended-voting-hours/1167457096">Franklin County</a> was put on lockdown for a brief period of time due to a nearby shootout. Voting time was not extended. An issue with poll workers found some voters in <a href="http://www.rrdailyherald.com/news/local/voters-urged-to-return-after-early-morning-issues/article_06e763e4-52ec-11e8-a503-7770cf86226b.html">Halifax County</a> being turned away when the poll worker could not find their information in the e-poll book. Results were delayed in <a href="https://www.wral.com/wake-vote-results-delayed-but-things-went-according-to-plan/17542789/">Wake County</a>, but that was totally on purpose. The county put in place a new results reporting procedure this year in order to guard against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ohio</strong> there were some reported problems with voting machines in <a href="http://www.wtol.com/story/38137242/glitch-fixed-at-west-toledo-voting-location">Toledo</a> and <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/article/voting-issues-at-highland-county-polls/20399364">Highland County</a>. Poll workers and voters in <a href="http://www.cantonrep.com/news/20180508/electronic-poll-books-reduce-time-spent-at-polls">Stark County</a> were pleased with the roll out of e-poll books during the election. Only minor problems, chalked up to voter error and input errors, were reported in <a href="http://www.timesreporter.com/news/20180508/only-minor-glitches-mar-may-primary-in-tuscarawas-county">Tuscarawas County</a>. And in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/08/us/elections/results-ohio-primary-elections.html">secretary of state race</a>, Democrat Kathleen Clyde will face Republican Frank LaRose in November.</p>
<p>And in <strong>West Virginia</strong>, there were not reported issues with the implementation of the state’s new voter ID law, although there were some problems about which ballots <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/w-va-secretary-of-state-s-office-isolated-incidents-cause/article_772d1e23-9cbd-53c1-a56a-8263d60f39dd.html">unaffiliated voters</a> were supposed to use during the primary. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a few isolated incidents in Mingo, Logan and Kanawha counties,&#8221; Steven Adams, assistant communications director for the&nbsp;Secretary of State&#8217;s Office told <em>WVNews</em>. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had issues with poll workers telling unaffiliated voters who asked for a party ballot, whether Republican or Democrat party ballot, that they can&#8217;t do that. So we&#8217;ve had to obviously make contact with those county clerks to try and get word to those precincts that you absolutely can.&#8221;</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the Georgia secretary of state’s office</strong> has launched an investigation into <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/state-probing-voting-problems-atlanta-mayor-race/HiwmOWf0QCh8kQuzJbZSMI/">irregularities during the December runoff election</a> for mayor in Atlanta. The probe involves irregularities over absentee ballots and investigators have requested records to conduct a forensic review.</p>
<p><strong>This week, Orange County, California launched <a href="https://www.ocvote.com/30/">30 Days of Data</a>,</strong> an initiative that will give users the ability to visualize key topics through maps, charts, narratives and graphs that will reveal connections between voters, demographics and other forms of data. A new storyboard is released every day. “Access to voter data — and ways to make sense of that information — is essential to understanding elections and how they function in the 5th largest voting jurisdiction in the country,” said Registrar Neal Kelley. “30 Days of Data&nbsp;sets a new standard for election data, bringing to life the rich stories that our data can tell.”</p>
<p><strong>Every elementary school teacher in America is nodding their head yes</strong> over this one. It recently took Bridgewater, Massachusetts a couple of days to correctly and officially declare the winner in the race for library trustee because the <a href="http://www.wcvb.com/article/oops-wrong-candidate-declared-winner-in-election-thanks-to-sloppy-handwriting/20629168">handwriting on tally sheets was so bad</a>, it initially could not be determined who the precinct warden had written in on the tally sheet. As a result, the wrong winner was initially announced. “We were horrified,” Clerk Marilee Kenney Hunt told WCVB. Hunt said everyone involved feels terrible about the error and she has already spoken to all the election workers to make sure nothing like this happens again.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the Collier County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Office</strong> for winning the Image Award and Judges Award from the Southwest Florida Chapter of the Florida Public Relations Association. The awards recognized the office’s <a href="https://immokaleebulletin.com/government/elections-office-wins-awards/">outstanding efforts during the fifth annual High School Voter Registration Challenge</a>, which was postponed due to Hurricane Irma. Through planning and coordinating with the Collier County Public Schools, the elections office was able to continue the challenge post-Irma and saw the highest voter registration numbers in the competition’s history – nearly doubling the number of student registrations from the prior year.</p>

Recent research shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long lines are not the norm for most voters. There are a fraction of polling places where voters wait longer than the 30 minutes and a smaller group polling places where lines are over one hour.</li>
<li>Lines can be caused by a variety of issues, some unique to a particular polling place or others by more general problems related to chronic capacity shortages.</li>
<li>Lines are longest on the morning of Election Day.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Longer lines tend to occur more in larger precincts, in precincts unable to handle early morning lines, and in precincts that are more urban, dense, and have higher minority populations.</li>

<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Coconino County has reached an agreement with the Justice Department to make county polling places <a href="https://gcmaz.com/justice-department-calls-out-coconino-county-for-polling-place-issues/">accessible</a> to people with mobility and vision impairments. Under the agreement, the county will start remediating polling places in time for the next election and will ensure that all of its polling place are accessible during elections to people with disabilities by no later than the November 2020 election.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, U.S District Judge Douglas L. Rayes has ruled that <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/federal-judge-arizonas-voting-law-does-not-burden-minorities/">restrictions on Arizona voting</a> purportedly aimed at reducing voter fraud—eliminating ballot harvesting and provisional ballots—do not impose an undue burden on minorities and were not intended to. The suit was originally brought by the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Los Angeles County is being sued by two <a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2018/05/07/la-county-sued-over-ban-on-sex-offenders-as-poll-workers/">registered sex offenders</a> for the right to become poll workers. Their lawsuit says that state law doesn’t bar registered sex offenders from serving as poll workers and so they are suing the county for violating the state constitution.</p>

<p><strong>Maine:</strong> The Maine Republican Party has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the secretary of state from implementing <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/05/04/maine-republican-party-files-federal-lawsuit-to-stop-ranked-choice-voting-in-june-primary/">ranked-choice voting</a> for the party’s June 12 primary. According to the <em>Press Herald</em>, the suit seeks a quick injunction against Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap that would prohibit him from <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/18/maine-secretary-of-state-says-he-is-ready-to-apply-ranked-choice-voting-to-june-12-primaries/?rel=related" target="_blank">proceeding with a retabulation of the ballots</a> cast in the Republican primary as called for under the ranked-choice voting law if a candidate does not win a majority in the first count of ballots. <a href="http://www.wcax.com/content/news/Date-set-for-GOPs-ranked-choice-voting-arguments-in-Maine-482077151.html">Arguments</a> have been set for May 23.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Attorney General’s office has asked the state’s Supreme Court to block a lower court’s ruling that the state’s entire <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/attorney-general-asks-nh-supreme-court-to-block-release-of-states-massive-voter-database/20190894">voter registration databased be turned over</a> to parties challenging a 2017 law that tightened vote requirements. The attorney general&#8217;s office argued in a motion to the high court that the database information for nearly 1 million active New Hampshire voters is private under state law and that the Superior Court judge is requiring state officials to “commit a crime in order to release this information to the plaintiffs.”</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, Judge Charles Temple has <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20180508/NEWS21/180509348">recused himself</a> from the suit against Senate Bill 3 because the state has hired an outside attorney who Temple considers a close friend.</p>

The judge set the conference for May 29 at the federal courthouse in Bismarck.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> The Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled that the state’s voter-approved 2010 <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/state-s-high-court-upholds-voter-id-law/article_056c441d-9fac-5d1f-9738-07af1057a792.html">voter ID law</a> is constitutional. “The Oklahoma Voter ID Act is a reasonable procedural regulation to ensure that voters meet identity and residency qualifications to vote and does not cause an undue burden,” according to the opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Thurman George, 57 of Philadelphia has pleaded guilty to <a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/05/09/thurman-george-pleads-guilty-election-fraud/">election fraud</a> during the 2017 House special election.
