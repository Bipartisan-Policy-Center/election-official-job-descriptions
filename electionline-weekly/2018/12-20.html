							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Exit Interviews</strong><br />
<em>John Gale, Ruth Johnson and Wayne Williams</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>From implementing the Help America Vote Act in the early days, to tackling the never-ending battle of election security to dealing with a statewide recount for a presidential election, Nebraska’s John Gale, Michigan’s Ruth Johnson and Colorado’s Wayne Williams have seen a lot in their combined 30 years as secretaries of state.</p>
<p>All three will be leaving office in the coming days to pursue other opportunities or to enjoy time with family and friends in retirement. Before they close the door on their offices one last time, we sat down to talk with them about their experiences, good and bad, as secretary of state and what are their thoughts about elections in the future.</p>
<p>We reached out to all the departing secretaries of state for an exit interview. Arizona’s Michele Reagan and Ohio’s Jon Husted declined our offers and we received no response from Georgia’s Brian Kemp, Kansas’ Kris Kobach or South Dakota’s Shantel Krebs. If we hear back from any of them in the coming weeks, we’ll be sure to post it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska Secretary of State John Gale</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sos.ne.gov/admin/about/bio.html"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3465 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/JohnGale-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />John Gale</a> was first appointed secretary of state in 2000 and then was elected for the first time 2002 with re-elections in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Gale was active in the National Association of Secretaries of State and is the past chairman of NASS’ Business Services and International Relations committees.</p>
<p><em><strong>What will you miss most about being secretary of state?<br />
</strong></em>Having managed a modern, uniform, reliable, transparent and accountable election system for 18 years; adopting online voter registration in 2015; acting as goodwill ambassador on behalf of our state for over 5,000 foreign visitors to our State Capitol; initiating multiple student civics programs that reached hundreds of thousands of Nebraska students; maintaining  modern and progressive business services to our businesses and banks, helping Nebraska be a leader in business regulatory climate; and, a great sense of fulfilling and positive public service.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you feel was your greatest accomplishment as secretary and why?</strong></em><br />
a) Maintaining a quality staff committed to our motto of “Prompt, Personal, and Professional Service”; b) Managing an agency that has been aggressive and pro-active as a leader in state government with online services; c) reaching over 250,000 students with useful and educational civics, international relations, and state history programs; and, d) meeting as Chief Protocol Officer with over 5,000 distinguished foreign visitors and creating positive personal international relationships for the benefit of Nebraska.</p>
<p><em><strong>What was the most difficult time/issue you faced (electionswise of course) as secretary?</strong></em><br />
Adopting the mandates of  the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002, and transitioning from a  93 county-based patch-work of election management to a statewide election management system with state ownership of election technology and a statewide voter registration system with regular maintenance of equipment and update of software provided by the state through reliable vendors, allowing a uniform, secure, well-maintained, efficient, accurate, and accountable election system, based upon paper ballots.</p>
<p><em><strong>As an expert in the field of elections, what do you feel is the most pressing issue facing elections officials?<br />
</strong></em>Protecting our election systems from cyber vulnerabilities with adequate cybersecurity resources; even with paper ballots there are still many vulnerabilities that must be addressed from state and county email systems, to any methods of electronic transmission of critical data, to secure warehousing of electronic equipment and flash drives, to rapid notification systems to provide early warnings of threats. Public confidence is vitally important and steps must be taken to assure the public that their voter registrations and their ballots are protected and preserved from corruption or hacking.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s next for you, besides being able to sleep in on election days?<br />
</strong></em>I’ll stop wearing suits and ties every day after 60 years as an attorney and public servant!  We have four grandsons in western Nebraska and Wyoming and one grandson at the Naval Academy whom we look forward to seeing more often. They all like to hunt and fish, as do I. Their dads, our sons, are great companions as well. We have a daughter and son-in-law in southern California, whom we love to visit in the winter. My wife and I also look forward to traveling around our great state to enjoy the marvels and beauties of Nebraska, well-remembered by us from our years of campaigning and my travels in the course of my 18 years as Secretary of State. The people of Nebraska are warm and hospitable people who are fun to visit with wherever you meet them, whether coffee shops, bed and breakfasts, local diners, or tourist stops.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any parting words of advice for your successor?<br />
</strong></em>Three quotes plus my comment:</p>
<p>Warren Buffett: “I look for three qualities when I hire, intelligence, energy, and integrity. Without the third one, the first two make no difference.”</p>
<p>Winston Churchill: “Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.”</p>
<p>Unknown:  “Leaders motivate. They model hard work and integrity, and inspire others to lead.”</p>
<p>John Gale:  “You are the constitutional officer for the whole state.  You may have been the candidate of a political party, but you must provide the whole state with quality, fair, and non-partisan service. Don’t lose your connection with the people. Answer their emails and letters. Listen to their complaints and address them. You take an oath of office; take it seriously and remember it. We live by the rule of law. Let the law instruct you in your policies and you’ll keep a steady course. Political values may influence your decisions, but the scope of the law must be your proper boundary.”</p>
<p><strong>Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1640_9105---,00.html">Ruth Johns<em><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3463 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/RJohnson-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></strong></em>on</a> was first elected to the secretary of state’s office in 2010. Due to term limits she was not able to seek re-election in 2018. Before becoming secretary of state, Johnson served as the Oakland County clerk/register of deeds from 2004 to 2010.</p>
<p><em><strong>What will you miss most about being secretary of state?<br />
</strong></em>The thing I will miss the most is all of the incredible people that I have had the privilege to work alongside for the past eight years.  This includes my excellent staff and the many local and county clerks across Michigan who are on the front lines of our democracy and delivering services. They all do a fabulous job of helping to protect the integrity of our elections.  I will also miss my role as an advocate for voters, but will continue to promote transparency and security in elections as I move to the Michigan Senate.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you feel was your greatest accomplishment as secretary and why?</strong></em><br />
In the area of elections, I am most proud of our statewide rollout of new, modern voting equipment in every jurisdiction across our state.  We planned ahead and were able to use HAVA funds to cover the vast majority of this cost. Along with a state appropriation, this enabled us to provide the new equipment with the latest cybersecurity features to local units of government at no cost (including covering the first 5 years of maintenance costs).  I believe the paper ballot optical-scan systems that my administration chose will help to ensure secure and transparent elections and serve voters and election administrators well over the next decade. Particularly with new cybersecurity concerns, I feel strongly about having a paper backup so that ballots can be manually recounted when necessary.  I always say we want a &#8220;belt and suspenders&#8221;, so we have the most up-to-date equipment and cybersecurity measures, but also we have a way to do a manual recount if needed.</p>
<p><em><strong>What was the most difficult time/issue you faced (elections wise of course) as secretary?</strong></em><br />
The statewide presidential recount in 2016 was an incredible challenge. Election officials across Michigan had not conducted a statewide recount in more than 60 years and we had the eyes of the world on us.   But this is where planning pays off. The &#8220;belt and suspenders&#8221; philosophy of hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. We have procedures ready for power outages, natural disasters, and anything else that might impact our elections process, and we had procedures ready for a statewide recount too.  I was so proud of our Bureau of Elections staff and of clerks across the state who successfully met the challenge head on with teamwork and professionalism at all levels.</p>
<p>Also, cleaning up our Qualified Voter File was an arduous task.  When I took office we had about 102.5 percent of eligible people on our Qualified Voter File.  I’m not a mathematician, but I certainly understood this was a problem. Since then we have removed over 1.2 million people, including hundreds of thousands of voters who had died or had moved and were voting in another state.  We have also removed 3,505 non-citizens, most of whom probably registered by accident and could face revocation of their legal status if they had voted. A clean qualified voter file is the basis for integrity in elections and prevents opportunities for fraud.  At the same time, I am immensely proud that Michigan was named best in the country by USA Today for registering eligible voters through our motor vehicles division (which in Michigan it is very helpful that I also oversee as Secretary of State).</p>
<p><em><strong>As an expert in the field of elections, what do you feel is the most pressing issue facing elections officials?<br />
</strong></em>Election security, and especially cybersecurity, continues to be a top priority. Michigan’s new election equipment, as well as our rollout of a new qualified voter file system, have been great security upgrades, but we must stay vigilant to remain a step ahead of those who might wish to undermine our democratic processes. As part of our efforts, Michigan is now also piloting risk-limiting audits and has strengthened relationships with state and federal cybersecurity, law enforcement and homeland security agencies. As Secretary of State, our office now has a seat at the Michigan Intelligence Operations Center &#8211; our state level law enforcement command center and threat assessor.  I think this is a reflection of the times we are living for election administrators.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s next for you, besides being able to sleep in on election days?<br />
</strong></em>I am unable to serve again as Secretary of State due to term limits, but was honored to be elected by the people of northern Oakland and southern Genesee counties in Michigan as their State Senator, so I look forward to continuing to serve in this new capacity. In the Senate, I will continue to be an advocate for election integrity and to fight against fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/info_center/biography.html">Wayne Williams</a> was first elected to the Colorado Secretary of State’s office in 2014. Prior to that he served as El Paso County Clerk f<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3464 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/WWilliams-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" />rom 2011 to 2015. Williams was the first sitting county election official to be elected as secretary of state.</p>
<p><em><strong>What will you miss most about being secretary of state?  </strong></em><br />
Working with the great team at my office and with Colorado’s county clerks and their employees and judges. Visiting the counties and ensuring we were providing the support they needed was always a highlight of the week.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you feel was your greatest accomplishment as secretary and why?</strong></em><br />
Establishing the nation’s safest voting system.  This required the adoption of new voting standards, helping 60 counties to purchase machines using those standards, and establishing the nation’s first complete risk limiting audit.  This new system resulted in increased voter confidence and record turnout in the 2016 general and the 2018 primary and general elections.</p>
<p><em><strong>What was the most difficult time/issue you faced (electionswise of course) as secretary?</strong> </em><br />
Establishing new voting standards.  I was questioned by the legislature and county commissioners, sued by vendors, and sued by counties. Knowing some of what I would face by taking this step, my staff questioned whether I should take the risk. I said it was worth it.</p>
<p><em><strong>As an expert in the field of elections, what do you feel is the most pressing issue facing elections officials?</strong></em><br />
Ensuring voters’ confidence in the integrity of our voting systems.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;</strong></em><em><strong>s next for you, besides being able to sleep in on election days?<br />
</strong></em>Hopefully saving on gas and time commuting without the daily three-hour roundtrip from my home in Colorado Springs to the office in Denver.  Since my wife (and newly elected county commissioner) Holly vetoed the house husband idea, I’m reviewing several possibilities.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any parting words of advice for your successor?</strong></em><br />
As Secretary of State, you represent everyone, not just those who voted for you.  Seek to work with folks from all points of view and across the state.</p>

							<h2>NSCIG First-Year Report</h2>
														<p><strong>NSGIC Releases First-Year Report for Geo-Enabled Elections Project</strong><br />
<em>Report includes first draft of best practices for implementing GIS in elections</em></p>
<p>National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) has released the<a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/images/GEE/Geo_Enabled_Elections_Year_One.pdf"> first-year report</a> of phase one of its Geo-Enabled Elections project, highlighting the project’s accomplishments in the first twelve months. These include completing a baseline assessment of how far states have come, to date, in terms of integrating geographic information systems (GIS) with electoral systems, as well as assembling a team of leaders and experts to help guide the project. The project team has also facilitated conversations with a wide range of stakeholder groups, aimed at raising awareness of the importance of using geospatial technology to increase reliability and accuracy in elections.</p>
<p>“During this first year, we’ve been encouraged to learn that while most voter data across the country is still kept in ‘address file’ tables, many state election directors are interested in the benefits that GIS can bring. Additionally, since most state governments have a geographic information officer (GIO) or equivalent on staff, the prospects for strengthening elections through the integration of GIS into electoral systems are very good.” says Dan Ross, NSGIC President and GIO for the State of Minnesota.</p>
<p>As part of the Geo-Enabled Elections project, NSGIC has been able to help build stronger connections between state officials responsible for the electoral system and state-level GIS subject matter experts, a critical first step towards the successful implementation of GIS in elections.</p>
<p>The organization, which is quickly becoming recognized as the center of expertise for how GIS can be deployed to strengthen electoral systems, also released the first draft of its best practices for how states may go about enhancing election accuracy using GIS. The five identified best practices are, in headline form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convene a Team of Specialists</li>
<li>Collect and Sustain a Statewide Voting Unit GIS Layer</li>
<li>Adopt and Implement a Statewide Geocoding Strategy</li>
<li>Assemble and Provide Best Available Contextual GIS Layers</li>
<li>Define and Implement Data Validation Processes</li>
</ul>
<p>These draft best practices will be put to the test and further refined in five state-wide pilot studies taking place during the project&#8217;s second year. The best practices can be viewed in full as part of the first-year report.</p>
<p>NSGIC’s report also outlines the work that lies ahead for the project, as well as opportunities to impact geo-enabled elections in phase two of the project (pending funding).</p>
<p>The Geo-Enabled Elections project, phase one, runs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019, with the aim to help strengthen electoral systems by supporting states in the adoption of GIS. Concretely, this means encouraging state governments to replace non-spatial ‘address file’ systems with election precinct and voter data in a GIS format, leveraging that format’s inherent visual and analytical advantages.</p>
<p>The Geo-Enabled Elections project is partly funded by the bipartisan Democracy Fund Voice.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The Pew Research Center is out with a new survey of voters</strong> this week and the news is good. In the lead up to the 2018 midterms, only 44 percent of those who planned to vote said they expected the process to be easy. Following the election, the new survey found that more than three-quarters of voters who cast ballots in November (76 percent) said that<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2018/12/17/most-voters-have-positive-views-of-their-midterm-voting-experiences/"> voting was “very easy.”</a> Prior to the election, fewer than half of Americans (45 percent) were confident that elections across the U.S. would be secure from hacking and other technological threats; 55 percent said they were not too confident or not at all confident that elections would be secure. After the election, a majority of Americans (64 percent) say they are confident that the elections were secure from hacking, though about a third (35 percent) still have little or no confidence in the security of the elections. The national survey by Pew Research Center, supported by a grant from the Democracy Fund, was conducted Nov. 7-16 among 10,640 adults, including 8,579 who say they voted in the midterm elections. This survey compares attitudes about the elections and voting process with a survey conducted before the elections (Sept. 24-Oct. 7).</p>
<p><strong>It’s the election that keeps going and going and going</strong>…<a href="https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/trailing-votes-georgia-house-incumbent-seeks-recount/8wg4An68mOYGiNG5KNOy5M/">a recount was ordered</a> this week in a Georgia House election that was actually a legally ordered do-over election because it was discovered that voters received the wrong ballots. After all votes were tallied including absentee and some outstanding provisionals the margin of victory was two votes. The losing candidate requested and will receive the recount. Following the recount the<a href="http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/i-team/results-the-same-after-house-district-28-vote-recount"> margin of victory</a> stands at two votes. The losing candidate, State Rep. Dan Gasaway is going to court to<a href="http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/i-team/state-rep-dan-gasaway-again-sues-to-overturn-election-defeat"> contest</a> the election.</p>
<p><strong>The ACLU of Kansas recently published</strong><a href="http://www.salina.com/news/20181214/aclu-analysis-says-kansas-voters-have-different-access-depending-on-where-they-live"> an analysis of the state’s recent elections</a> and found that convenience plays as important a role in voter participation as political issues and that Kansas’ counties have such varied policies that it influenced turnout in 2016 and 2018. “In far too many ways, the health of our democracy — and the extent to which an individual citizen’s vote counts — is based on the county in which one lives,” the report said.</p>
<p><strong>What once was lost now is found, part two.</strong> Officials in Bonner County, Idaho<a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/dec/14/bonner-county-election-officials-discover-396-unco/"> discovered 396 uncounted ballots</a> in a locked filing cabinet when they were working to balance the number of registered voters against the number of ballots counted. “I wish I had an explanation, but I don’t,” Senior Elections Supervisor Charlie Wurm told the <em>Spokesman Review</em> of how the 396 ballots were missed. “It was about 2 percent of our voters.” However, the newly discovered ballots did not change the outcome of any elections.</p>
<p><strong>Well this is a Pleasant surprise.</strong> The Shelby County, Tennessee voted unanimously<a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2018/12/17/o-c-pleasant-jr-shelby-county-election-operations-center/2338618002/"> to name the county’s Election Operations Center</a> after longtime Election Commissioner O.C. Pleasant Jr. Pleasant, who died last week, served on the county election commission from 1979 to 2009. “It means the world to me and my family,” his son Darryl Pleasant told <em>The Commercial Appeal</em>. “We knew how much he loved working there. That was the joy of his life. He always wanted things to run right and run fairly.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> Senator Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel) introduced Senate Bill 57, which would allow individuals to opt-in for voter registration instead of<a href="http://www.oc-breeze.com/2018/12/19/132293_senator-bates-introduces-legislation-to-fix-motor-voter-law/"> automatically being registered</a> to vote or having to opt-out of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> State Sen. Cheryl Kagan and Del. Eric Luedtke have proposed a bill for the General Assembly that would allow Montgomery County to move to a<a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/government/ranked-choice-voting-method-supported-for-county-elections/"> ranked choice voting system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> In a 6-3 vote, the House Elections and Ethics Committee passed a bill that proponents say would create enabling language needed to<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/19/clarifying-prop-3-voting-changes-michigan-house/2363379002/"> implement Proposal 3</a>, which would allow for same-day voter registration, straight-ticket voting, no-reason absentee voting and regular election audits.</p>

Roy Cooper (D) has vetoed a bill that would require voters to show a<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article223103100.html"> photo ID</a> after voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Legislature to move forward with the ID measure. In his veto message, Cooper said the problem is not with voter impersonation, but “votes harvested illegally through absentee ballots, which this proposal fails to fix.” On Tuesday the Senate and the on Wednesday the House<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article223310620.html"> voted to override the veto</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Two bills are already for the upcoming legislative session including one that would eliminate the state’s straight-party voting option and another one that would expand a law that requires employers to give employees two hours<a href="https://www.enidnews.com/news/state/bills-would-update-state-s-election-laws/article_0128f89e-4afb-5d25-a80d-fd40367cdead.html"> paid time off</a> to vote on Election Day.</p>

														<p><strong>Vendor News</strong>: The California Secretary of State’s Office recently announced that it has certified the<a href="https://www.hartintercivic.com/press-release/verity-california-certified/"> Verity Voting System</a> from Hart InterCivic. Designed to support California Voter’s Choice Act requirements such as by-mail voting and Vote Centers, Verity advantages for California counties include: best-in-industry security protocols; easy-to-use system; high return on investment; and cost-savings. “This latest certification of our proven Verity system demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the State of California,” President and CEO of Hart, Phillip Braithwaite said in a statement. “Hart has provided voting system solutions to California counties since 2006, and the needs of the State’s evolving election administration landscape are native to Verity’s design.

							<h2>FVAP Update</h2>
														<p><strong>New voter registration/ballot request and back-up ballot forms on Federal Register now</strong></p>
<p>The current draft Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms are available for review and comment on the Federal Register until January 22 at regulations.gov.</p>
<p>The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) requires that the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) prescribe two standard federal forms. Both forms require review and public comment every three years. The FPCA (SF-76), can be used to register to vote, request an absentee ballot and update contact information, while the FWAB (SF-186) serves as a backup ballot if the voter doesn&#8217;t receive a requested ballot in time.</p>
<p>FVAP leveraged feedback from voters and election officials to update the forms to clarify their use and requirements.</p>
<p>The revised forms simplify instructions for voters and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification of National Guard classification for use of the form.</li>
<li>Alterations to the list of states requiring additional information.</li>
<li>Clarification of registration and ballot request instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form usability is an essential part of the redesign process. To help ensure the form is easy and intuitive from a voter&#8217;s perspective, please download and complete it as if you were registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot or voting the FWAB. Provide usability comments via the links below.</p>
