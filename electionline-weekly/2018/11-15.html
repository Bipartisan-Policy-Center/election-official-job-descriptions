														<p><strong>Election 2018</strong><br />
<em>A state-by-state look at the 2018 midterms</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><em>(Editor’s Note: Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, electionline Weekly will not publish next Thursday the 22nd and the Daily News will not publish on Thursday the 22nd and Friday the 23rd. We h</em><em>ope you have a very happy (and peaceful!) Thanksgiving and we sincerely hope that the hardworking elections officials, staff and volunteers can take a break, even if just for a day.)</em></p>
<p>As we noted last week, Election Day 2018 saw a series of issues, but for the most part it was relatively business as usual, even with the high turnout and the counting and recounting drama that has ensued in small number of states.</p>
<div id="attachment_3360" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3360" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3360 " src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Egg-Ballots-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="349" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Egg-Ballots-225x300.jpg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Egg-Ballots.jpg 627w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3360" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Elections officials see it all including an egg smashed between absentee ballots in Anoka County, Minnesota. Thanks to Paul Linnell for sending this in!</em></p></div>
<p>There were long lines. There were machine malfunctions. There were power outages. Some people weren’t able to cast their ballots. There were puppies, goats and a chicken. In other words, in most states, it was a fairly typical Election Day, even though turnout was fairly atypical for a midterm in most states.</p>
<p><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2018/11-08/">Last week</a> we took a broad view of how things went and this week we’ll take a closer look at how Election Day 2018 went in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>There is still a lot more to cover from the election that was and we’ll do that throughout the remainder of 2018 and into 2019.</p>
<p>And as well all know some counties and states are still counting and recounting ballots.</p>
<p>But for now, here’s a state-by-state look at the election. And don&#8217;t forget to check out our <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2018/11-06/#tab-1">Election Day Dispatches</a> for all the news from November 6.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama</strong> —The Yellowhammer State rolled out<a href="http://www.govtech.com/computing/There-will-be-a-new-check-in-process-for-Montgomery-voters.html"> electronic pollbooks</a> more broadly this election and from all reports, things seemed to go well. While the e-poll book roll out went well, that doesn’t mean the day was without problems. In<a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/07/election-day-2018-voting-problems-midterms-montgomery-alabama/1920873002/"> Montgomery County</a>, some voters received incorrect ballots, some polling places opened late and some ran out of provisional ballots and change-of address forms.<a href="https://whnt.com/2018/11/06/madison-county-voting-machines-having-problems-counting-ballots-workers-will-try-again-when-polls-close/"> Madison County</a> voting machines had problems tabulating ballots. Incumbent<a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/06/john-merrill-defeats-heather-milam-retain-alabama-secretary-state-post/1882190002/"> Secretary of State John Merrill</a> was elected to a second term.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong> — The biggest news out of the biggest state was probably about how awesome the state’s early voting<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Alaska-early-voting-stickers-designs-animals-Race-13367994.php"> “I Voted” stickers</a> were, but there was some other news. Early morning voters at one<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2018/11/06/voters-at-west-anchorage-polling-station-briefly-without-paper-ballots-after-election-worker-forgot-them/"> Anchorage</a> polling place were without paper ballots after an election worker left them at home. Voting machine problems delayed the results in some areas of<a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2018/11/07/voting-machine-problems-delay-results-for-parts-of-southeast/"> Southeast</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong> —Election Day in Arizona was vastly different than primary day. Although there were still some issues that arose, overall things went well. In<a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/chandler-polling-place-experiencing-issues-maricopa-county-recorder-says"> Maricopa County</a>, one polling place failed to open on time because the building had been foreclosed on overnight, and there were some issues with lines, but overall it was a major improvement from the primary. In a move that we’ll label brilliant, the Arizona Humane Society brought<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/meet-the-polling-place-puppies/article_9a030e34-e1f4-11e8-b614-6bb14701649d.html"> PUPPIES</a> to one polling place for people to pet while they waiting in line. All the puppies were available for adoption. At press-time ballots are still being counted including more than<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/county-recorder-about-ballots-left-to-count-in-maricopa-county/article_ee859e2e-e7a1-11e8-ac78-83c557152336.html"> 100,000</a> in Maricopa County. The race for<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/13/arizona-secretary-state-steve-gaynor-and-katie-hobbs-latest-results-election/1990962002/"> secretary of state</a> seems headed for a runoff.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong> — Voters in Arkansas approved a constitutional amendment that will make the state’s existing<a href="https://katv.com/news/election/voter-id-passes-become-constitutional-amendment"> voter ID</a> law legal.<a href="https://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/news/local/2018/11/06/arkansas-election-2018-baxter-county-voters-long-lines-delay/1908565002/"> Baxter County</a>, which consolidated from 22 individual polling sites to 11 vote centers faced long lines on Election Day. Some voters in<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/nov/06/voters-given-incorrect-ballots-north-little-rock/"> North Little Rock</a> received incorrect ballots. Results were delayed in<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/nov/07/software-problems-cause-delay-vote-totals-phillips/"> Phillips County</a> due to faulty software. Officials in<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/nov/08/nearly-900-votes-northwest-arkansas-not-counted-el/?elections"> Benton County</a> failed to count 900 ballots on election night because of an overlooked thumb drive.<a href="https://www.fox16.com/news/politics/thurston-elected-arkansas-secretary-of-state/1577603869"> Republican John Thurston</a>, Commissioner of State lands since 2011 was elected secretary of state.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong> — While<a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2018/11/06/californias-close-election-results-will-roll-in-days-or-weeks-lateagain-it-doesnt-have-to-be-that-way/"> vote counting</a> continues in many counties in California, there were some Election Day issues to talk about. Voters reported voting machine issues in<a href="https://patch.com/california/northhollywood/voting-machine-issues-reported-throughout-los-angeles-county"> Los Angeles County</a> and<a href="https://patch.com/california/orange-county/voting-machine-issues-reported-across-orange-county"> Orange County</a>. In<a href="https://www.10news.com/news/san-diego-politics/election-error-dozens-of-san-diegans-omitted-from-voting-rosters-at-polling-places"> San Diego County</a> there were reports of a few dozen voters being left off the poll books. In<a href="https://fox40.com/2018/11/08/in-san-joaquin-county-one-school-board-race-was-left-off-hundreds-of-ballots/"> San Joaquin County</a>, a school board race was left off hundreds of ballots. Large turnout at vote centers lead to long lines and wait times in<a href="https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article221230065.html"> Sacramento County</a>. Last-minute voters were faced with long lines, waits at the<a href="https://www.pe.com/2018/11/06/long-lines-waits-at-riverside-county-registrar-of-voters-office-on-election-night/"> Riverside County</a> registrar’s office. In<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-turnout-20181106-story.html"> Cudahy</a>, a chicken walked into a polling site and distracted voters enough that they complained to county election officials. And incumbent Secretary of State Alex Padilla was elected to a second term.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong> — Although overall turnout is still shaking out, Colorado, with its system of vote-by-mail and vote centers had about a<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/11/07/colorado-election-voter-turnout/"> 78 percent turnout rate</a>, one of the highest in the nation. There were some glitches in<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/election-quirks-no-big-deal/article_583c960e-e317-11e8-ba8b-10604b9f6eda.html"> Mesa County</a> including long lines, computer problems and a fire alarm. Voters in<a href="https://www.aspentimes.com/election/aspen-voters-leaning-toward-changing-municipal-election/"> Aspen</a> approved a ballot measure to change the municipal election day. In the race for secretary of state<a href="https://koaa.com/ap-colorado-news/2018/11/06/the-latest-colorado-voters-deciding-governor-house-races/"> Democrat Jena Griswold</a> defeated incumbent Wayne Williams.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong> — The biggest problems in The Nutmeg State occurred in<a href="https://fox61.com/2018/11/07/new-haven-experiences-election-day-voter-registration-issues-again/"> New Haven</a> where once again the registrar of voters struggled to keep up with the volume of residents choosing to register and vote on Election Day. In<a href="https://www.wfsb.com/news/some-polling-places-report-slight-issues/article_24396434-e1ac-11e8-81aa-3f17d7559ad9.html"> Meridian</a>, hundreds of voters were told they weren’t on the voter rolls. And like other areas,<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Some-Ballots-Became-Wet-Causing-Difficulties-With-Counting-Secretary-of-the-State-499897052.html"> wet ballots</a> caused problems with counting. Incumbent Secretary of State Denise Merrill was re-elected.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware</strong> —<a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/big-turnout-voter-id-confusion-and-rain-highlights-first-half-election-day/1893207002/"> Strong storms</a> didn’t stop voters in the First State from casting their ballots. There were some complaints about voters being asked for ID, although state Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove pointed out that’s the longstanding practice.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong> — Voters and poll workers rushed to the aid of a voter in one D.C. precinct and<a href="https://katv.com/news/nation-world/bystanders-at-polling-site-save-mans-life-after-he-suffered-cardiac-arrest"> administered CPR</a> to save the voter’s life after he suffered a cardiac arrest. As the D.C. Fire &amp; EMS tweeted after the incident, the voter did not get to cast his ballot, but he did get to live. Also in D.C. for a long time the city had only 99 percent of precincts reporting because on precinct—<a href="https://dcist.com/story/18/11/07/what-happened-to-precinct-110s-votes-on-election-night/">Precinct 110</a>—the poll workers did not electronically transmit the results to the Board of Elections and then when a BOE representative went to the polling place to retrieve the results, the polling place was locked. Official were eventually able to retrieve the software on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> —While Florida has been pretty much all anyone can talk about since Election Day due to recounts in several hotly contested races, to be fair, Election Day itself in the Sunshine State was pretty smooth sailing  with only<a href="https://www.tbo.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/11/03/voting/"> a few minor problems</a>. We’ll go more in-depth into the recount in the weeks to come, but as for Election Day, like everywhere else, there were<a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/election-timeline-ron-desantis-elected-fla-governor-rick-scott-declares-victory-in-senate-race/867459914"> lines</a> at polling places throughout the state. A man with a gun in a car in the parking lot of a<a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/11/06/gunman-causes-brief-closure-palm-bay-voting-precinct/1901495002/"> Palm Bay</a> polling placed caused some panic before he fled the scene. In<a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/06/melbourne-man-threatens-blow-up-supervisor-elections-office/1901953002/"> Melbourne</a> a man threatened to blow up the supervisor of elections office. Voters overwhelmingly voted to approve<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/415021-florida-will-restore-voting-rights-to-felons"> Amendment 4</a> which will automatically restore the rights to ex-felons once they’ve completed the terms of their service.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong> — Election 2018 is far from over in Georgia. On Election Day itself voters faced hour-long waits. Some of it was due to volume, some it was due to<a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/gwinnett-officials-experience-trouble-with-machines-at-four-voting-precincts/article_147d68b6-712c-533c-9b5b-5f3a05a6f9f1.html"> malfunctioning</a> machines and others it was due to a<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/415280-georgia-voters-wait-hours-after-county-mistakenly-installs-only-three"> lack of</a> sufficient voting machines. Georgia remains in the headlines long after Election Day because the governor’s race has yet to be called with multiple lawsuits determining how and when absentee and provisional ballots will be counted. One thing is certain, the race to be Georgia’s next<a href="https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/fight-over-ballots-campaign-decide-who-should-count-them/HzO2r6XPQ30EqE9CRJTdgI/"> secretary of state</a> is headed for a December runoff.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong> — There was very little trouble in paradise on Election Day, but some<a href="https://www.kitv.com/story/39468032/waianae-polling-places-ran-out-of-same-day-registration-forms"> Waianae</a> polling places reported running out of same day registration forms. On<a href="https://www.kitv.com/story/39430410/broken-voting-machines-and-scanners-reported-at-several-oahu-polling-locations"> Oahu</a>, there were several broken voting machines early the morning that had to be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho</strong> — High turnout in<a href="https://www.localnews8.com/news/politics/voting-issues-at-fort-hall/850577849"> Bingham County</a> forced the county elections office to bring additional voting machines to one polling place in Blackfoot. A high number of absentee ballots slowed the count in<a href="https://lmtribune.com/northwest/latah-county-behind-thanks-to-absentee-ballots/article_c42f44e8-9408-5dfd-8d86-1ca55bd0fb14.html"> Latah County</a>.<a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/elections/canyon-county-finds-39-uncounted-ballots-after-election-day/277-613038366"> Canyon County</a> found 39 additional ballots from military and overseas voters that were not included in the election night, but were ultimately counted. Voters in<a href="http://sandpointreader.com/sagle-voters-alarmed-by-timing-of-paving-project-at-polling-place/"> Bonner County</a> were alarmed that a paving project at the polling site was inhibiting access to the polling place.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong> — Two polling places in<a href="https://patch.com/illinois/glenellyn/voters-report-broken-machines-long-lines-dupage-county"> DuPage County</a> were forced to stay open until 7:30pm due to machine failures earlier in the day. Students at Northern Illinois University in<a href="https://www.daily-chronicle.com/2018/11/12/young-voters-say-niu-polling-place-not-sufficient/dwiq8v/"> DeKalb County</a> complained about long lines that prevented some of them from casting a ballot. The<a href="https://www.commercial-news.com/news/local_news/website-glitch-left-election-watchers-in-dark/article_ad337b1a-3b25-5764-96a0-5213c2d1c659.html"> Danville</a> Election Commission’s website suffered some sort of technical glitch on election night and people weren’t able to check it for results. During the initial posting of results,<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-met-mchenry-county-election-undervote-20181108-story.html"> McHenry County</a> failed to include 10 of thousands of votes. One polling place in<a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/11/7/polling-place-hyde-park-runs-ballots-voters-wait-h/"> Hyde Park</a> temporarily ran out of ballots. Voters in<a href="http://www.wglt.org/post/bloomington-voters-reject-question-dissolve-election-commission#stream/0"> Bloomington</a> rejected a question that would have dissolved the city’s election commission.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong> — With 99 counties, there were numerous minor glitches and problems, and voters waiting in line throughout the Hoosier State, but nowhere were there problems like in Porter County and in Johnson County on Election Day. In<a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/08/indiana-election-2018-fbi-asked-investigate-porter-countys-trouble-counting-votes/1930226002/"> Porter County</a>, the county’s commission asked the FBI to investigate what they called “scores of alleged violations of Indiana Election Law.” The county did not even begin counting ballots until Wednesday morning, this after 12 of the county’s vote centers opened late on Election Day. Porter County Commissioner Jim Biggs attributed the county&#8217;s woes to a variety of factors, including heavy voter turnout, but told the Indianapolis Star &#8220;big changes&#8221; were needed to prevent a report of the situation in the county of about 170,000 residents. &#8220;What we have here is a total breakdown in the process,&#8221; he said. In<a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/2018/11/10/clerk_it_was_the_perfect_storm_im_sorry/"> Johnson County</a>, Clerk Sue Ann Misiniec told The Daily Journal that it was a “perfect storm” of problems that lead to machine malfunctions on Election Day and late results on election night. Incumbent<a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/indiana-election-2018-secretary-state-connie-lawson-harper-results/1751201002/"> Secretary of State Connie Lawson</a> was re-elected.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong> — There were very few reports of problems with the state’s<a href="http://www.telegraphherald.com/news/tri-state/article_c0d927b3-9bc9-52ca-bcaa-6f577c024cc3.html"> voter ID</a>. About 30 ballots in<a href="https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/ballots-without-postmarks-wont-be-counted-in-iowa-house-race-separated-by-nine-votes-20181113"> Winneshiek County</a> arrived without postmarks and therefore could not be counted. For the first time Iowa counties conducted a<a href="https://wqad.com/2018/11/08/new-iowa-election-audit-matches-totals-at-local-precinct/"> post-election audit</a>.

<p><strong>Missouri—</strong> There was some confusion about what<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article221226220.html"> ID</a> voters had to show in the Show-Me State.

<p><strong>New York</strong> — Perhaps you should expect problems on Election Day given that New York City has more than 9 million residents, but voters in Gotham once again faced a problem-filled day on Election Day. This time the problems seemed to stem from problems with<a href="https://abc7ny.com/politics/polling-problems-reported-at-some-nyc-precincts/4630823/"> wet ballots</a> and not enough<a href="https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/ballot-scanner-breakdowns-plague-nyc-polling-places"> ballot-scanning machines</a> to go around.

For his part, the BOE<a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/3965745-board-of-elections-explains-problems-with-voting/"> director</a> accepted some of the blame, but also blamed voters for the problems and a two-page ballot.

<p><strong>North Dakota</strong> — After failed lawsuits, Native American tribes scrambled to get members IDs in order to cast ballots on Election Day and although there were<a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/latest/few-native-american-voters-had-id-issues-in-north-dakota/article_4aa926aa-04b1-59dc-b35b-a7e24acde1d2.html"> some issues</a> with IDs, Native voter<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/north-dakota-reservations-record-voter-turnout-amid-fears/story?id=59038845"> turned out in record numbers</a> on the 6th.

<p><strong>Ohio</strong> — Power, or lack thereof plagued many polling places throughout the day in Ohio, but voters were able to continue casting ballots, even if it meant doing it by flashlight in some instances.

A new voter alert system in<a href="https://www.fox19.com/2018/11/06/heres-why-your-ballot-might-get-rejected-by-voting-machine/"> Hamilton County</a>, while functioning properly, caused a quite a bit of confusion with voters.

<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong> — Although there were reports of<a href="https://newsok.com/article/5614154/minor-issues-reported-at-oklahoma-county-polling-places"> minor problems</a> in polling places on Election Day, it was &#8220;nothing out of the ordinary,&#8221; according to Bryan Newell, director of operations for the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. Newell told local media it appeared elections officials were fixing those problems quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong> — Oregon votes by mail and has automatic voter registration so the only thing we really have to report about in Oregon is that voters in<a href="https://www.ijpr.org/post/lane-county-effort-change-voting-system-fails"> Lane County</a> shot down an effort to change the county’s voting system to the STAR system. STAR stands for Score Then Automatic Runoff which would have allowed voters to award each candidate a score ranging from 0 to 5.

The problems with the machines were exacerbated by high turnout and  lead to long lines in many of the state’s counties.

The Iowa Legislature created the board about eight years ago to analyze current or proposed criminal laws. It is comprised of 16 voting and six non-voting members that include four lawmakers. the advisory board voted to recommend lawmakers restore the voting rights of offenders. Details such as whether that would begin after completing prison or making restitution would be left to lawmakers to decide. No members opposed the recommendation, which was taken via a voice vote Wednesday. Iowa remains one of only two states that permanently ban felons from voting unless their rights are restored by the governor.</p>
<p><strong>Allen County, Indiana Elections Director Beth Dlug</strong> has been getting an ear full since Election Day.

							<h2>Clearie Awards Deadline Extended!</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC Extends Deadline for Third Annual Competition for Best Practices in Election Administration</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has extended the deadline for submissions for its third annual “Clearie” awards, a national competition for best practices in election administration, until Friday, November 30, 2018. This year, the Commission will present awards in the categories of best practices related to voting accessibility, outstanding innovations in elections, and recruiting, training and retaining election workers. All entries must be received no later than Friday, November 30, 2018.</p>
<p>This year, the Clearie awards are dedicated the life and legacy of Wendy Noren and R. Brian Lewis.<a href="https://www.eac.gov/documents/2018/07/30/eac-commissioners-issue-joint-statement-honoring-wendy-noren-/"> Wendy Noren</a> served as Boone County Clerk for over three decades and was a member of the EAC’s Board of Advisors before passing away in July 2018 following a long battle with cancer. R. Brian Lewis served as Counsel to the office of the Senate Majority Leader before his passing and was an early and steadfast proponent of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and election officials. Both were luminaries in the field of election administration who will long be remembered for their work and friendship.</p>
<p>“Election officials are known for their commitment to the values expressed in the EAC Clearie awards: excellence, innovation, maintaining accuracy and integrity in the election process and ensuring all eligible citizens can cast a ballot,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks. “The Clearies are a testament to their work and dedication and highlight best practices other election administrators can emulate.”</p>
<p>This year’s entries will be judged using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficacy</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Outreach efforts</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Replicability</li>
</ul>
<p>All submissions should be sent to the EAC via an email to clearinghouse@eac.gov. Nominators should use the following subject lines based on entry category: Election Worker Competition, Accessibility Competition or Outstanding Innovations Competition.</p>
<p>All entries must include a brief summary of the election program nominated and attach relevant documents, images and links that can be used to assess the entry. Submissions should also include contact information for the person submitting the program for consideration. Each entry must be submitted in a separate email.</p>
