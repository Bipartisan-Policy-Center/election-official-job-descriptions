							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Report reveals how states use map technology to manage elections</strong><br /><em>Results indicate need for better coordination between state agencies</em></p>
<p>More than two-thirds of states responded to a <a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/GEE_State_Reps_Report.pdf">nationwide survey</a> on elections data conducted by the <a href="https://www.nsgic.org/">National States Geographic Information Council </a>(NSGIC) in the first half of 2018.</p>
<p>Responses were coordinated by state government representatives who focus on the development and deployment of mapping data and systems across state agencies and local governments.</p>
<p>“An electoral system with integrity &#8211; enhanced by accurate, authoritative geographic data and presented clearly and transparently &#8211; has never been more important,” said NSGIC President Andy Rowan.</p>
<p>The National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) promotes the efficient development and management of location-based information resources, and advocates for innovative, strategic use of these assets to advance the interests of states, tribes, regions, local governments, and the nation.</p>
<p>“Geo-enabled elections overcome the four fundamental challenges with the existing address list approach to precinct management,” said Rowan. “In the address list approach, no actual boundaries are stored explicitly in these systems; quality control is difficult without a method to visualize precinct assignment using aerial photography and boundary information that can change frequently; there is no efficient method for applying large-scale precinct boundary updates; and the process is usually not aligned efficiently with other state and local address or boundary management processes.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key <a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/GEE_State_Reps_Report.pdf">takeaways</a> from the survey include:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Addresses</strong><br />55 percent of responding states confirm voter registration addresses against a database of known addresses such as a driver&#8217;s license or state ID database, a statewide point address set, a master address database used for 9-1-1 call routing, or a commercially available address database.</p>
<p>“The results indicate a need to advocate for coordination between state agencies (e.g. state elections department and the department of motor vehicles) and encourage integration of the voting system and other systems,” says Jamie Chesser, the Geo-Enabled Elections project manager.</p>
<p><strong>Election Precincts</strong><br />More than half of responding states indicated they maintain statewide mapping of precincts. Within this group, 40 percent also maintain a layer of sub-precincts in digital mapping systems.</p>
<p>“There remains a need to develop local precinct data content and procedural standards to examine the relationship between precincts, local and state boundaries, and residential structures,” says Chesser.</p>
<p><strong>Other Data<br /></strong>82 percent of states keep up-to-date spatial data of city and county boundaries, essential for computer-based mapping of precincts.</p>
<p>“Statewide spatial data &#8211; especially city, county, school, and special district boundaries &#8211; are essential to mapping precinct boundaries across the state,” says Chesser. “The survey reflected, however, that accuracy of current city and county boundary mapping varies considerably.”</p>
<p>A substantial majority, 79 percent of respondents, confirm their mapping of state-level district-based elected offices are accessible online in a digital mapping format.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted as part of NSGIC’s Geo-Enabled Elections project, which aims to provide the impetus for replacing non-spatial ‘address file’ tables with the visual and analytical advantages of election precinct and voter data in a natively geographic information systems format.</p>
<p>Later this year, NSGIC will release the results of a study probing the spatial approach to elections management from the perspective of state elections officials.</p>
<p>The two-year Geo-Enabled Elections project, underwritten by the bipartisan Democracy Fund Voice, convenes a wide variety of stakeholders to explore ways geographic information systems and related processes can enhance elections management and citizen engagement across the US.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>State and federal officials testified before the <a href="https://statescoop.com/elections-officials-have-a-lot-of-security-work-to-do-before-november-state-and-federal-officials-tell-congress">House Homeland Security Committee</a> this week on the current state of preparations for the 2018 mid-term elections. Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and DHS Undersecretary Christopher Krebs testified that the great threat facing elections offices is to the computer networks used by state agencies than to the ballot boxes themselves.</p>
<p>“Voting systems in and of themselves are systems within systems,” Krebs testified according to <em>StateScoop</em> when asked if he was aware of any attempts by hackers to directly access ballot-counting machines. “You also have backend systems that store voter registrations. Just like any IT system, there are going to be vulnerabilities. What we’re looking for is resilience in the system.”</p>
<p>In a separate hearing on Capitol Hill this week, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee took voting machine vendors to task on several issues. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/11/nations-top-voting-equipment-vendors-grilled-senat/">Sen. Mark Warner</a> (D-Virginia) expressed his dismay with Hart InterCivic for failing to cooperate with a security review in Virginia. Oregon <a href="https://www.ktvz.com/news/wyden-blasts-voting-machine-cos-over-cybersecurity/766786586">Sen. Ron Wyden</a> (D) went after ES&amp;S for failing to respond to his questions about their cybersecurity practices. And <a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2018/07/11/elections-security.aspx">Sen. James Lankford</a> (R-Oklahoma) testified about his bipartisan efforts to refine the Senate Elections Act.</p>
<p>“We want to put some processes in place to make sure that we’ve not forgotten the lessons from 2016,” Lankford (R-Okla.) said in his testimony according to <em>GCN</em>. “There are some basic things that could be done while still allowing the states to control their election structures and have flexibility on the type of election machines that they want to have.”</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> According to final numbers, nearly 7,000 <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/07/07/colorado-unaffiliated-voters-nullified-ballots/">unaffiliated voters</a> voided their votes by submitting both a Republican and Democratic ballot. This was the first primary election where unaffiliated voters were permitted to cast a ballot. They received both a Democratic and Republican ballot via mail and were told to cast only one. Officials say the 2.4 percent rejection rate was lower than what they had anticipated. <a href="https://www.csindy.com/TheWire/archives/2018/07/06/el-paso-county-leads-state-in-number-of-rejected-primary-ballots">El Paso County</a> lead the state with 1,516 ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> The Office of Elections has announced that voters displaced by the <a href="http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2018/07/07/hawaii-news/polling-place-to-open-in-pahoa-on-election-day/">ongoing eruption of Kilauea</a> will be able to vote in person in the Aug. 11 primary at a polling place set up in the Pahoa Community Center. Initially all displaced residents would have been limited to voting by mail.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> The State Board of Elections and the state’s Motor Vehicle Administration have reached an agreement on the number of people affected by the MVA’s software “glitch” that prevented voters’ information from being updated. That number is <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-voting-mva-20180706-story.html">83,493</a>. In Baltimore County, only nine votes separated the winning candidate from runner-up state Sen. Jim Brochin. Brochin asked for a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-county/bs-md-co-brochin-executive-recount-20180707-story.html">recount</a>, which was <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-co-recount-begins-20180711-story.html">underway</a> at press time.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>A new study from the Center for American Progress</strong> reports <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-reg-easier-voter-registration-report-20180710-story.html">that if Florida made voting registration and more convenient</a>, it could increase turnout by as many as 570,000 votes. According to the <em>Sun Sentinel</em>, that big infusion could come from the adoption of automatic voter registration, which would be easier than the current system, which requires that people sign up to vote at least 29 days before any election. The study said that same-day voter registration could increase participation by 478,000 people. The study did give Florida props for allowing pre-registration for 16- and 17-year olds, but demerits for the felon voting-rights restoration process.</p>
<p><strong>Early voting is on the rise in North Dakota</strong>, and one county, <a href="https://www.omaha.com/news/politics/elections/join-list-sign-card-get-ballot-early-voting-gets-easier/article_7e105a8f-a4c4-5908-9a35-b1d4c68a600a.html">Douglas, wants to make it even easier</a>. This week the county announced the creation of a list, which if people opt into the list, they will receive a postcard before each election asking them to sign and return it to get their early ballot. Voters will no longer need to make a trip to the county election office to request an early ballot. According to the <em>Omaha World-News</em>, county election commissioner Brian Kruse said the postcard is the most cost-effective way to follow state law which allows early voting for any reason but requires that people sign a request for an early ballot. Although other counties in Nebraska offer the postcard option, Douglas has the largest population in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Last week, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill took to Twitter</strong> to reiterate his commitment to make sure that all Alabama voters have the <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/yellow-stripes-dead-armadillos-and-doug-jones/">necessary ID to vote</a>. He even offered his cell phone number to anyone who needs help! “And if anyone needs a home visit because they cannot make our remote location visits to the festivals or community centers we will go to their homes and give them a photo ID and make sure they are registered to vote. Just call my cell at 334-328-2787,” Merrill tweeted.</p>
<p><strong>Outdoor sportswear company Patagonia</strong> announced that it will be closing its doors on November 6 in order to give all its employees <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/06/patagonia-is-giving-its-workers-election-day-off-and-says-you-should-too/?utm_term=.fb5b4deda293">the day off to vote</a>. The company did the same thing in 2016 although this time, it’s encouraging other corporations to follow suit. Patagonia chief executive Rose Marcario <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/let-our-people-go-vote-rose-marcario/">wrote</a> that “this year, we’re doing it again,” and that other companies should join in “because no American should have to choose between a paycheck and fulfilling his or her duty as a citizen.”</p>

														<p><strong>VII. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Technology</strong>: Election Systems &amp; Software (ES&amp;S) today announced the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has federally certified the new ES&amp;S EVS 6000. This suite of products provides a new hybrid voting option that ensures the voter’s intent is accurately captured while providing a paper ballot. The EVS 6000 suite includes two brand new products from ES&amp;S: the <a href="https://www.essvote.com/products/12/51/universal-voting-system/expressvote-xl/">ExpressVote XL full-face Universal Voting System</a> and the ExpressTouch electronic Universal Voting System. The ExpressVote XL displays the full ballot on a 32-inch touch-operated interactive screen and produces a voter-verified paper ballot for tabulation. The use of a touch screen to mark a ballot prevents voters from overvoting (a common mistake), can alert voters about undervotes, and guarantees that the voter’s intent is accurately recorded each and every time.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Congratulations to the Maricopa County recorder’s office for receiving the National Association of Counties 2018 Information Technology Achievement Award.
