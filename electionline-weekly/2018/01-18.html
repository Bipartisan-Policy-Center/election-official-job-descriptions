														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Denver Elections fulfills need for election judges in unique way<br /></strong><em>Partnership with Denver Day Works employs area homeless</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html">Denver Elections Division</a> employed a special group of election judges to work in the ballot processing room.</p>
<p>They didn’t look any different from any of the other temporary election workers, they ate in the break room with everyone else and had the same temporary employee badges. They processed ballots for six hours a day just like everyone else.</p>
<p>What made these nine election judges special though is that they were employed through <a href="http://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-human-services/community-outreach/denver-day-works.html">Denver Day Works</a>, a program designed to provide a low to no barrier work experience for people throughout the city who are experiencing homelessness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The first day was an electrifying day,” said Elizabeth Littlepage, election judge coordinator. “I felt like we were really making an impact in these workers lives, giving them the opportunity to get back into the workforce.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many of the Denver Day Works&#8217; partnerships, the connection with Elections came as a suggestion from someone only indirectly involved explained Marcus Ritosa, lean facilitator with Denver Day Works. From a program leadership perspective, Ritosa saw this as a good project in part because of the nature of the work. It was something indoors, low-impact, and more details-oriented.</p>
<p>For Littlepage, the call from Denver Day Works was helping her deal with a struggle every election official in the country faces — finding enough election judges/poll workers.</p>
<p>Littlepage said that after several meetings with the Denver Day Works team to discuss the possibility of the program, the Elections Division then had to meet with attorneys to determine if it would be possible because all election judges are required to go through background checks. This was a new step for Denver Day Works.</p>
<p>“One of the new processes we tested during this election cycle was in effectively and efficiently conducting limited background checks in accordance with Elections Division rules,” Ritosa said. “While there may have been some potential workers excluded for these reasons, we were able to perform the necessary checks without disruption or burden on our process.”</p>
<p>Other than the background check, the only other requirement the workers needed to fulfill is that they had to be eligible to register to vote in Denver.</p>
<p>The workers assisted in the ballot processing room for four separate days, six hours each day, and there were five workers per day, but not always the same workers each day. In total nine total different workers helped over the four day schedule the Elections Division had set up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the workers were working in the ballot processing room, there was very little training involved and it didn’t matter if a different employee showed up the next day.</p>
<p>According to Littlepage, the workers were excited, energetic, and very approachable. They were all very different, with varying backgrounds and experiences. One of the workers had been an election judge in Chicago in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Department of Human services recently released a <a href="https://youtu.be/ptiNfZ1zAWM">video</a> with clients telling their own stories about working with Denver Day Works. One of those workers is Regina, who worked at the Elections Division. In the video, Regina talks about how important it was to her to be trusted in such an important city job.</p>
<p>“You can tell from the video her pride in working for the Elections division as she shows her badge,” Ritosa said. “We also know that many of our participants at that site chose to return for the second week in the short project.”</p>
<p>The workers employed through Denver Day Works are paid a set daily rate through the Department of Human Services. Some get cash, some get gift cards and some get checks, depending on each which option they choose and they are paid at the end of the day. Denver Day Works also provides a sack lunch for each of the employees.</p>
<p>On the Elections side, Littlepage said a decision was made to pay the Department of Human Services the amount the city would have paid election judges, working the same hours, that were not part of the program.</p>
<p>“We wanted to do this because we hope that it will help expand the program,” Littlepage said.</p>
<p>Although a mechanism like Denver Day Works may not be available in every jurisdiction, if it is, Littlepage strongly recommended that other elections officials consider working with the program.</p>
<p>Ritosa echoed Littlepage’s sentiments and offered some advice. He said&nbsp; if other elections groups are considering recruiting among the homeless population, it&#8217;s important to recognize how on-boarding and operations can be structured using some principles of supported employment (as opposed to competitive employment).&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For instance, we were successful because 1) we ensured that they could reliably work for pay (cash) on the scheduled day, 2) we offered breakfast, lunch, and a secure place to store personal belongings, 3) we operated at a location easily accessible by public transit and/or near other service providers, and 4) we were careful to conduct the background checks transparently, after gaining initial trust, and ensuring that a failure would not be just one more ‘closed door’.”</p>
<p>Littlepage is looking forward to continuing the partnership this year.</p>
<p>“As the election judge coordinator for the Denver Elections Division, I feel it is important to always have different sources and ways to find the large amount of election judges needed from election to election,” Littlepage said. “I am so thrilled to collaborate with this program again in 2018; this is a great partnership to have between Denver Human Services and the Denver Elections Division and I am eager to see it grow.”</p>

<p>In Texas, plaintiffs in a suit that seeks to prevent the state from providing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with voter data are <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2018/01/11/aftermath-trumps-fraud-commission-questions-remain-texas-releases-voter-information">seeking a way to end the suit</a> now that the commission no longer exists and the White House says that all data already collected will be thrown out.</p>
<p>“We’re going to reach out to the state to see if we can come up with some sort of joint agreement for winding down the lawsuit in a way that makes us satisfied that voter rights are going to be protected,” Myrna&nbsp;Pérez, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s Law School, which represented the plaintiffs in the case told <em>The Dallas Morning News</em>. “We are not suggesting there is no way and no information that could be sent over striking the balance the Legislature struck in crafting the election law, but we’re worried about the balance.”</p></p>

<p><strong>The Illinois State Board of Elections recently decided</strong> that it will <a href="http://rockrivertimes.com/2018/01/12/state-elections-board-says-kansas-based-voter-database-not-up-to-task/">not be providing voter data to the interstate program Crosscheck</a>. According to the <em>Rock River Times</em>, the ISBE cited security concerns as the reason for not sending the data. “As of this date, we have received no description of security enhancements from Crosscheck,” ISBE Executive Director Steve Sandvoss said in a Jan. 10 letter to legislators. “We plan to review and discuss those proposed enhancements upon receipt and we will transmit no data to Crosscheck until security issues are addressed to our satisfaction.”</p>
<p><strong>Posible si. Posible no.</strong> The Hall County, Georgia board of elections has reversed course on an April 2017 plan to <a href="https://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/elections-board-scraps-plans-provide-ballots-spanish/">provide ballots in Spanish</a>. Instead, the board voted to establish a committee to study the costs. The committee will report its findings in January 2019. According to the <em>Gainesville Times</em>, more than a dozen speakers testified in favor of bilingual ballots, saying it was the right thing to do on ethical, financial and patriotic grounds. Speakers included Hall County residents and representatives from Latino groups and the American Civil Liberties Union. Craig Lutz, a member of the elections said the county didn’t know the cost of bilingual ballots and said having English-only ballots wouldn’t disenfranchise voters, the paper reported.</p>
<p><strong>Canyon County, Idaho is leaving nothing to chance</strong> with its polling places in 2018 and has signed a $45,600 contract with an independent contractor to make sure that the all of the county’s <a href="https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/2cscoop/canyon-county-hires-firm-to-bring-polling-into-accessibility-compliance/article_0335db33-7973-5ceb-a343-5e279894f307.html">polling places are accessible</a>. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice found that only four of the county’s 25 polling sites were fully accessible. The county and their new contractor, Meeting the Challenge, have until March 13 to get the polling sites into compliance.</p>
<p><strong>The League of Women Voters in Naperville, Illinois</strong> is providing <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180116/birthday-boxes-encourage-naperville-18-year-olds-to-vote">birthday boxes</a> to students at two high schools who will turn 18 in time for the November election. According to the Daily Herald, contain nonpartisan information about registering to vote, searching for reliable information about candidates, voting by mail while in college, forming opinions in a democracy and why voting is important. Along with the handouts, each box contains pencils, mints and Tootsie Rolls in patriotic wrappers, a business card for the League of Women Voters website, and a letter from a fellow voter. We think that sounds like a pretty awesome gift!</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>

<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed notice that they are appealing U.S. District Judge L. Scott Coogler’s order to dismiss a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/01/naacp_legal_defense_fund_disap.html">state’s voter ID law</a>. &#8220;We are deeply disappointed by the judge&#8217;s ruling dismissing our case before trial,&#8221; said LDF President and Director-Counsel Sherrilyn Ifill. &#8220;Over the course of two years, we have developed a sound case demonstrating that Alabama&#8217;s voter ID law is racially discriminatory. We had hoped to present our full case at trial next month.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Earlier this month the State of California reached a settlement agreement with the League of Women Voters and three other groups that had sued the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles and Secretary of State’s Office claiming that the state burdens would-be voters by making them fill out the same information on two separate voter registration forms. Under the agreement, the state agreed to continue rolling out AB 1461 — <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/golden-state-settles-suit-over-moter-voter-rules/">automatic voter registration</a> — on the LWV’s schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Jeffrey Spanier, 53 of Sartell pleaded guilty to a <a href="http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/sartell/2018/01/13/sartell-man-pleads-guilty-voter-fraud-charge/1031466001/">felony count</a> of registering to vote as an ineligible voter in November 2016. As a convicted felon on probation, Spanier was not eligible to register to vote.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota:</strong> In August 26, a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s <a href="https://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/government-and-politics/4389383-warning-thousands-unverifiable-votes-nd-asks-judge-lift-order">voter ID law</a>. This week, the state argued in U.S. District Court that voter affidavits are “incompatible” with North Dakota’s status as the only state without voter registration. &#8220;Thousands of unverifiable votes will likely be cast in future elections as long as North Dakota is forced to use voter&#8217;s affidavits in conjunction with its choice to remove registration as an impediment to voting,&#8221; the state argued, the <em>West Fargo Pioneer</em> reported.</p></p>
