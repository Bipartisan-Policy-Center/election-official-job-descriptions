							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>CEIR voter registration database security report<br />
</strong><em>Survey finds most states adopted best cybersecurity practices since ‘16</em></p>
<p>The<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/"> Center for Election Innovation and Research</a> (CEIR) has released a<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/2018-vrdb-security/"> new report</a> based on a survey of 26 states conducted between June and July of 2018 to assess the current state of security around voter registration databases (VRDBs).</p>
<p>The survey results, released ahead of<a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/"> National Voter Registration Day</a>, show that immense progress has been made in securing voter registration databases since 2016, though significant room for improvement remains for states to strengthen their defenses against hacking attempts.</p>
<p>Voter registration databases have been a central focus of conversations around election security since the 2016 presidential election when several voter registration databases were scanned and at least one infiltrated by Russian operatives.</p>
<p>Amid concerns on the security and integrity of the upcoming midterms, the report provides a clear picture of the tangible improvements that have taken place to ensure voters can trust the democratic process this November.</p>
<p>The report finds that a significant majority of responding states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly train voter registration database users to detect cyber threats, like phishing</li>
<li>Consistently monitor for improper access to their database</li>
<li>Use secure HTTPS for websites with sensitive information</li>
<li>Employ tools to prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</li>
<li>Utilize recommended email protection tools</li>
<li>Back up their database daily – and regularly test the backup</li>
</ul>
<p>However, states can do better when it comes to implementing more secure password requirements and further adopting multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>“The survey shows just how much progress states have made since 2016 in key areas of cybersecurity to prevent, detect, and mitigate foreign interference,” said David Becker, executive director of CEIR.</p>
<p>CEIR is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization working to improve election administration through research, data, and technology. CEIR works with experts and election officials in every state and across the political spectrum to rebuild voter confidence in our elections and democracy, ensure all eligible voters can vote conveniently in a system with maximum integrity, and ultimately increase voter participation.</p>
<p>The survey consisted of 23 multiple-choice questions addressing three major areas of cybersecurity: (1) prevention, (2) detection, and (3) mitigation. The survey was sent to election officials in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Of those, twenty-six states returned completed surveys.</p>
<p>Additionally, one state was able to contribute a small number of answers but declined to respond to most of the survey questions. That state’s answers are included in the analysis of the questions to which they responded. Three other states returned surveys which declined to answer any of the questions due to security considerations. Thus, those three states are disregarded in data-reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>This report details the results of the survey, while contextualizing the importance of certain security measures in maintaining a well-protected VRDB.</p>
<p>“There is no finish line in cybersecurity, so Congress and state legislatures will need to provide elections officials with a consistent funding stream to continue to improve their training and protocols around election cybersecurity,” Becker said.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p>Late last week, the House Oversight Committee held a<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/feds-brief-house-oversight-on-election-security-for-2018-midterm-elections"> classified briefing</a> on election security. According to <em>The Washington Times</em>, Chairman Trey Gowdy’s office reported that the Department of Homeland Security sent two top elections officials and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence sent officials that deal with Russia and Eurasia. The national intelligence officer for cyber issues of the ODNI was part of the briefing, as was the FBI’s Deputy Assistant Director Joe Bonavolonta and the Justice Department’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division Adam Hickey.</p>
<p>“As we near midterm elections, we must take every step possible to safeguard our electoral process and ensure our fellow citizens have confidence in the security of elections,” Gowdy, R-S.C., said in a statement.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>New York:</strong> New York held the final primary of the 2018 election season on Thursday the 13th. In New York City, multiple voters reported problems with their<a href="http://gothamist.com/2018/09/13/voter_rolls_primary_purge.php"> names not appearing on voter rolls</a> although they had recently voted. A larger turnout than expected in<a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/democratic-ballots-run-out-after-large-voter-turnout-in-buffalo"> Erie County</a> mean some polling places ran low on ballots. In<a href="http://www.wxxinews.org/post/monroe-county-officials-look-problem-how-some-assembly-primary-ballots-were-distributed"> Monroe County</a>, officials are looking into how/why some voters were given the wrong ballot in Rochester. And in<a href="http://www.recordonline.com/news/20180913/paving-creates-parking-issues-for-primary-voters-at-silver-lake-fire-house"> Orange County</a>, paving near a polling place in Silver Lake was causing headaches for voters trying to park at the fire house and vote.</p>

Holder decision which held that provisions of the VRA unconstitutionally determined which jurisdictions needed federal government preclearance to change voting procedures. Findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laws and procedures like requiring photo ID at the polls, cutting back early voting times and locations, and closing polling places are impacting minority voting rights.</li>
<li>Without preclearance, elections have occurred under laws that were later found in court to be intentionally discriminatory against communities of color.</li>
<li>Enforcement and litigation under Section 2 of the VRA is an inadequate for protecting voting rights.</li>

														<p><strong>A new poll from National Public Radio and Marist found</strong> that about 1 in 3 American adults think that a foreign country is<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/17/647420970/npr-marist-poll-1-in-3-americans-think-foreign-country-will-change-midterm-votes"> likely to change vote tallies and results</a> in the upcoming midterms. That being said. The majority of Americans think that efforts to make this year&#8217;s voting more secure are adequate, as 53 percent said they think the U.S. is either very prepared or prepared to keep the midterms safe and secure. Conversely, nearly 40 percent of Americans doubt that preparation. &#8220;There&#8217;s been so much saturation of [Russia] discussions,&#8221; Neal Kelley, the registrar of voters for Orange County, California told NPR. &#8220;You can&#8217;t help but have a segment of the population that&#8217;s going to feel that way. But the bottom line is, there have been so many things done since 2016, to prepare for 2018.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Florence News</strong>: The<a href="https://wcti12.com/news/state-news/hurricane-florence-could-have-impact-on-november-election"> impacts of Hurricane Florence</a> on the 2018 midterm election still remain to be seen, but<a href="https://www.heraldsun.com/news/politics-government/article218592540.html"> already the storm is causing angst</a>. The North Carolina state board of elections &amp; ethics enforcement said in a statement that it is communicating with elections officials in the state’s counties. The state has taken over sending ballots on behalf of some counties that are unable to do so because of flooding. Fortunately for<a href="https://wtop.com/local-politics-elections-news/2018/09/fairfax-co-ballots-escape-florence-flooding/"> Fairfax County, Virginia</a>, which uses a printing plan in New Bern, North Carolina to print election ballots, the ballot arrived at the county elections office just a few days before the storm hit.</p>
<p><strong>The Washington County, Ohio board of elections</strong> will be employing some special helpers on Election Day in November. The BOE has partnered with WASCO, Inc. and Ewing School, two nonprofits that work with<a href="http://www.mariettatimes.com/news/2018/09/greeting-voters/"> adults with developmental disabilities</a>. The six volunteers will serve as greeters at polling places. “We got the idea when we went to our summer conference and learned that another county with a similar set-up to WASCO and Ewing were having them volunteer,” Washington County Board of Elections Director Mandy Amos told the <em>Marietta Times</em>. “We thought maybe we could have them as volunteers too and they could greet people and show them around from when you check in to where you pick up your ballot, or they could hand out stickers, too.” Two volunteers interviewed by the Times said they were most excited to hand out “I Voted” stickers and we think that’s pretty awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Everyone is going back to school!</strong> Recently the Livingston County, Michigan Human Services Collaborative held the “<a href="https://whmi.com/news/article/accessible-voting-prepares-individuals">Accessible Voting For All</a>” class that taught voters with disabilities and those who may need assistance how to cast their ballot this fall. Anne Richardson, director of the Arc Livingston told WHMI the class discussed issues like how to use voting equipment, the process, citizens’ rights, what to expect, and why it’s important to vote. About 45 people attended the class.</p>
<p><strong>If you happen to be in Rhode Island between now and November 23</strong>, consider stopping by the State Archives in Providence to check out an exhibit called “<a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/state-archives-opens-new-exhibit-on-the-history-of-voting/1447446364">Voting in Rhode Island: 380 years of ‘I voted’</a>”. According to WPRI, the exhibit includes 19th and 20th century ballots and ballot readers and original 17th century documents about election results and the earliest legislation providing for proxy and absentee voting. There’s also an &#8220;I&#8217;m a Voter&#8221; selfie station is outside the state archives so voters can show their commitment to voting.</p>
