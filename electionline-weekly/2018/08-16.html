														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>DEFCON26 shows partnerships will win the war<br /></strong><em>Voting Village looks at vulnerabilities, threats to system</em></p>
<p>By Jennifer Morrell<br /><a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a></p>
<p>As a former election official in Colorado, the summer of 2017 was focused on the successful implementation of our first statewide risk-limiting audit. It was exciting because we anticipated it would be an important component in further validating the outcome of elections.</p>
<p>So you can imagine the frustration we felt with the <a href="https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/DEF%20CON%2025%20voting%20village%20report.pdf">headlines</a> coming from last summer’s <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEFCON</a>25 stating that voting equipment could easily be hacked. My perspective was that it was just a publicity stunt to get attention. Fortunately, it did get quite a bit of attention, helping to pave the way for federal funding to states for new voting equipment.</p>
<p>Now a year later I found myself accepting an invitation to attend <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-index.html">DEFCON26</a> and observe the Vote Hacking Village. I’ve attended many different conferences, but nothing prepared me for the semi-controlled chaos of DEFCON.</p>
<p>The neon, flashing conference badge, the chill-out rooms, the Goons (part security, part information providers), 20,000-ish tech geeks, Caesar’s Palace. The whole thing was a trip!</p>
<p>To say I felt out of my comfort zone was an understatement. Besides realizing I was navigationally challenged, I found myself in a sea of people who all seemed to speak another language.</p>
<p>Election administrators certainly have their own lexicon, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise that hackers and technology experts have a language of their own as well. It was as much about the experience as a realization there is a whole world of terms and expertise I knew nothing about. But, here is what I did learn…</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities and threats to the election system</strong> <br /> The keynote speaker, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger">David Sanger</a>, noted that in 2007 “cyberthreat” was not even a word in our national threat assessment, so there is a very good reason why the recent threats to our elections have left the election community scrambling to catch up. This is all very new and has the potential to completely change how we conduct elections.</p>
<p>It seemed evident this year that the Voting Village organizers recognized the election system was more than just voting equipment. The Village was organized to illustrate the vulnerabilities and threats to voter databases, election night reporting websites, e-pollbooks, and of course voting equipment, specifically DREs and optical scanners.</p>
<p>Some criticisms have been levied against the usefulness of this whole production since it takes place in a pseudo environment where hackers have unfettered access to the voting equipment and systems. While this was true there were also some eye-opening things that took place.</p>
<p>I watched hackers pick locks and security seals in just a few seconds with what seemed like nothing more than the flick of their wrists. These were the same locks and numbered seals we use to secure memory card doors on DREs and seal ballot boxes/bags used for storing paper ballots, memory cards, etc. They could pull the locks and seals apart and put them back on again with no damage and no evidence of tampering. In some demonstrations they were able to pick the lock, remove the seal, and tamper with the card reader and memory card slot in just a few seconds giving them full administrative access to the machine.</p>
<p>They tried to demonstrate the point that being disconnected from the internet doesn’t mean your system is safe if there are flaws in the machine. They shared real world examples of situations where hackers were able to inject a virus into other critical systems with high levels of physical security and no internet connections – which was chilling.</p>
<p>My favorite demonstration was a large-screen projection with graphics representing a state voter registration database and the sophisticated layers of security between a hacker and the database. The challenge was to breach the security and tamper with the database. Conference goers could watch and see how far a hacker had been able to penetrate through the layers of security, which seemed to be a real challenge.</p>
<p>There was conversation about how far in some of the hackers had got and what they had learned but ultimately none were able to penetrate the database. One of the many reasons I was able to confidently answer the question, “do you think elections are more secure now than they were in 2016” with a resounding “yes! – they are absolutely more secure then they have every been”. (I got asked that a lot!)</p>
<p>The organizers were passionate about the need for paper ballots, risk-limiting audits, and better resources to protect the back-end systems and hopeful that the Voting Village demonstration would accelerate the implementation of those practices. (They were also optimistic that paper ballots were only the answer until they can help us come up with something better.)</p>
<p><strong>Strong desire to understand elections and collaborate</strong><br /> I went to DEFCON with the idea that I would just observe and learn. It was pointed out on the first day that I was in the audience and was an ex-election official now focusing on risk-limiting audits. This made observing all the activity in the Voting Village a challenge. I was constantly approached by hackers and tech experts all wanting to ask questions about how elections were conducted, how voting equipment was tested, and especially how risk-limiting audits worked and the process for conducting them.</p>
<p>I noticed that other election officials in attendance, who were brave enough to identify themselves as such, were getting the same questions. Some participants came to the discussion with skepticism, but all seemed to leave impressed with the steps that are being undertaken by the election community to secure elections as well as a better understanding of what actually takes place when planning and conducting an election.</p>
<p>I heard repeated references to the ‘election system’ separate from discussions about voting equipment so I think they are listening to us. Clearly the focus this year was not just on voting equipment.</p>
<p>Though it has been a controversial news story this week, the fact that an 11-year-old girl could breach a replicated state election website in under 10 minutes, with little help or input, should be a wakeup call to all of us that if you haven’t had an expert review and test your website for vulnerabilities you need to find an individual or organization who will do that for you. [Ed. Note: The Voting Village <a href="https://twitter.com/VotingVillageDC/status/1028868525685764097" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">issued a correction</span></a> that it was actually an 11-year-old boy who hacked the site in 10 minutes. The 11-year-old girl did it in 15 minutes.]</p>
<p>Most of the hackers I talked to felt that it was important to pick apart the equipment, websites, and registration databases to understand what flaws and vulnerabilities might be present. This was not just so they could show off their skills. There was a genuine desire to help election officials improve their security protocol and encourage voting system vendors to fix the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships will win the war</strong><br />It is clear that election hacking, and conversely election security, is complex. Conference organizers and participants repeated over and over again that state and local election officials need more resources. On more than one occasion presenters from the tech side admonished the hackers participating to become poll workers. The audience erupted in applause when one speaker suggested that the best way to learn how elections work and make them more secure is to volunteer as a poll worker.</p>
<p>While the focus of the conference was on increasing security for the technological components – hardware, software, firmware, security settings, etc. it struck me that all of these recommendations have a human component. They need people with a specific set of skills and education to implement them.</p>
<p>State and local election offices need funding not just for new voting equipment but to recruit and retain staff with the technical skills to test, monitor, maintain, and audit that equipment. Until they receive adequate funding and the FTEs to do that, some type of public/private partnership may be the best answer.</p>
<p>I saw another side to this community than what I was expecting, and I think it is in our best interest to stop thinking of them as adversaries and start thinking about ways we can collaborate and utilize their expertise. In fact, we should probably rely on this same cadre of tech experts to help us write new job descriptions and org charts, so we can start hiring security and auditing experts of our own when and if the funding is put in place.</p>
<p>Until then, maybe we should look to DEFCON and other similar gatherings as free consulting. We may not agree with all of the recommendations that are made but we can at least use the information to better inform the questions we ask when looking for new voting equipment as well as use it to enhance our cybersecurity and physical security practices. Likewise, if there is a recommendation made by the hacker community that would be detrimental to the election process we know that’s an area where we can collectively stand firm and find ways to better communicate and inform. I hope to see more election officials in the Voting Village next year!</p>

														<p><strong>III. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2018/08/14/voter-turnout-par-past-primaries/">Turnout</a> in the Nutmeg state was “on par” with past primaries with overall turnout coming between 20-25 percent, once all absentees and provisionals are tallied. There were some problems at polling stations statewide with polls at one location in <a href="http://www.wfsb.com/story/38880260/some-polling-places-report-problems-on-primary-day">Middletown</a> opening about 15 minutes late and in <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/politics/Malfunctioning-Machine-Replaced-at-New-Britain-Polling-Site-490832071.html">New Britain</a>, a voting machine went down forcing poll workers to use an auxiliary bin for the cast ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Hawaii held its primary over the weekend the big story out of the 50th state was the <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/08/12/hawaii-news/polling-sites-quiet-as-absentee-voting-gains-popularity/">growing popularity of absentee mail-in ballots</a> that lead to quiet polling places on election day. “It’s slow, very slow,” Virginia Maimon, precinct chairwoman at the Campbell High School polling site in Ewa Beach told the <em>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</em>. “This is my fourth election cycle, and this is the slowest I can ever remember.” According to the <em>Star-Bulletin</em>, elections officials sent out more than 238,000 absentee ballots, compared to more than 191,000 for the 2016 primary election, said Nedielyn Bueno, voter services section head for the state Office of Elections.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2018/08/county-primary-turnout-highest-in-two-decades/">Maui County</a>, voter turnout for the primary was 36.2 percent, which is the highest primary turnout in more than two decades. Overall <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38867798/the-numbers-are-out-how-many-registered-hawaii-voters-actually-voted">turnout</a> was 38.6 percent which was higher than the 2016 presidential primary turnout.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Following a strong early voting showing, <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/primary-voting-hits-record-high-in-minneapolis/89-584165342">turnout</a> in Minnesota hit a record high this primary. The high turnout meant some precincts in the <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4485836-extra-ballots-used-duluth-iron-range">City of Duluth and St. Louis County</a> ran out of ballots, which forced election judges to make copies of ballots that then had to be hand counted. In the city of <a href="http://timberjay.com/stories/some-votes-in-tower-likely-wont-be-counted,14286">Tower</a>, nearly one-in-five residents received the wrong ballot which most likely means their votes will not end up counting. Voters and officials in <a href="https://www.kvrr.com/2018/08/14/new-technology-and-high-voter-turnout-changes-the-voting-experience-for-people-in-moorhead/">Moorehead</a> praised new technology that helped move the large number of voters more quickly than in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> There were no reports of any issues in Vermont’s primary where probably the biggest story of the night was who won what race. The state did roll out a new <a href="https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/new-technology-helping-the-disabled-vote/1369209164">ADA compliant voting machines</a> at all polling places which meant voters with disabilities no longer had to rely on the state’s old call-in voting system.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Voters headed the polls in the Badger state and while there were <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/several-minor-issues-reported-with-ballots-voting-machines-during-wisconsin-primary">scattered problems</a> at the polls throughout the day, the biggest issues were in <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/dane-county-elections-website-goes-down-clerk-posts-results-on-facebook/781628846">Dane</a> and <a href="https://www.gazettextra.com/news/politics/fall_2018_primary_election/rock-county-election-website-experiencing-difficulties/article_599fbb11-2551-54f9-a5cd-70cdc5a28c60.html">Rock</a> counties where election websites failed to function properly. Neither website problem stemmed from any sort of hack or DOS event. In <a href="http://www.weau.com/content/news/Chippewa-County-polling-place-experiences-ballot-shortage-490879271.html">Chippewa County</a>, there were ballot shortages. <a href="https://fox6now.com/2018/08/14/ballot-machine-replaced-at-hampton-elementary-school-after-it-went-down-twice-during-election/">Milwaukee</a> officials experienced issues with vote counting machines.</p></p>

<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> In a court filing this week, Secretary of State Brian Kemp said the state would be “plunged into chaos” if a federal judge grants a request to immediately <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-election-officials-warn-chaos-judge-orders-paper-ballots/JAmo0aW5C3HE21PIywP7RK/">switch to paper ballots</a> for the November general election. “There is no&nbsp;‘paper-ballot fairy’ who, with magic wand at ready, can save plaintiffs’ half-baked&nbsp;‘plans’ from devolving into a fiasco,” according to the filing.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Judge Sarah Evans Baker has ruled against Solicitor General Tom Fisher’s attempt to halt the expansion of <a href="https://www.wibc.com/news/local-news/judge-rejects-hill-attempt-reopen-deal-satellite-voting-marion-county">early voting sites in Marion County</a>. According to WIBC, Baker noted that federal law trumps state law in voting-rights cases.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The Iowa Supreme Court has handed down a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2018/08/10/iowa-voter-id-law-iowa-supreme-court-29-day-early-voting-period-2018-election-paul-pate-lulac/958652002/">split decision on the state’s new voter ID law</a>. The court has ruled that the shorter, 29-day period for early voting under the law is acceptable, but agreed with the lower court that temporarily blocked rules requiring an identification&nbsp;number to apply for an absentee ballot and allowing&nbsp;election officials to reject absentee applications and ballots when they&nbsp;determine signatures on those forms don&#8217;t match a voter&#8217;s signature on record.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Two voters have filed a federal lawsuit over a state law that bans passive shows of support for candidates on clothing in polling places. The plaintiffs argue that their First Amendment rights are being violated. “The government should not be in the business of telling people <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2018/08/suit_challenges_rule_against_apparel_supporting_candidates_at_polls">what to wear when they vote</a>,” Attorney Jeremy Colby told the <em>Boston Herald</em>. “If you just keep chipping away at our First Amendment right, which is the core building block of our democracy and our ability to communicate ideas, little by little, it does erode that First Amendment right.”</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> According to <em>Michigan Live</em>, Secretary of State Ruth Johnson is asking U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain to reconsider his decision to allow <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/08/michigan_officials_appeal_ruli.html">straight-ticket voting</a> on the November ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Renaldo Johnson, 56 of Las Vegas was given a suspended sentence and placed on probation for his role in a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/las-vegas-man-gets-probation-for-voter-fraud-scheme/">voter fraud scheme</a> during the 2016 election.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty has struck down New Hampshire’s law that allows poll workers to <a href="http://www.nhpr.org/post/federal-judge-strikes-down-nhs-signature-mismatch-absentee-voting-law#stream/0">toss out absentee ballots if they don’t believe the signature adequately matches</a> the one used on other voting paperwork. According to New Hampshire Public Radio, McCafferty said “the current process for rejecting voters due to a signature mismatch fails to guarantee basic fairness,” because it gives moderators “sole, unreviewable discretion” to discard absentee ballots. &#8220;It cannot be emphasized enough that the consequence of a moderator’s decision — disenfranchisement — is irremediable,&#8221; Judge McCafferty wrote.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Roberto Hernandez-Cuarenta, 57 of Zebulon has been convicted of two counts of <a href="http://www.rockymounttelegram.com/News/2018/08/10/Nash-man-convicted-of-voter-fraud.html'">voting by a non-citizen</a> and sentenced to four months in federal prison. Hernandez-Cuarenta has legal, permanent resident status, but was not a U.S. citizen when he voted in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.</p>
<p>Also in North Carolina, five residents who were recently featured in a <em>New York Times</em> article because they had been accused of <a href="https://www.wral.com/voting-felonies-dropped-for-5-from-north-carolina-under-plea/17766912/">voting illegally</a> have had felony charges dropped under a plea deal. The five had been accused of voting while still on parole or probation. According to WRAL, the five entered Alford pleas to misdemeanor obstruction of justice charges.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Cynthia Gonzalez has pleaded guilty in San Patricio County court to three <a href="https://www.kiiitv.com/article/news/local/woman-pleads-guilty-to-voter-fraud-sentenced-to-five-days-in-jail/503-584137349">election code violations</a> in Nueces County. According to KIII, investigators say the charges include marking a ballot and sending it in for another voters.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The first of a dozen <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/mac-warner-wrongful-filing-suits-set-to-begin-in-kanawha/article_cc98250a-22d9-573c-98f6-b8c9fc18f531.html">wrongful firing lawsuits</a> against the secretary of state is slated to begin on August 27. Plaintiffs in the cases range from receptionists to elections specialists to the elections director. Attorneys for the plaintiffs allege that they were fired because they are registered Democrats.</p>

<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> McAffee announced this week that it will be offering <a href="https://www.axios.com/2018-midterm-elections-cybersecurity-mcafee-d6017a1c-9243-4b5e-9d4b-1eca3ffdb160.html">free cloud services</a> to election officials in all 50 states (and we assume the District of Columbia). According to <em>Axios,</em> it’s unclear whether election officials would be able to renew services with McAfee after a year and at what price. &#8220;We’d like to get through November first,&#8221; Ken Karsten, McAfee’s VP of public sector sales told Axios, adding the discussion about what to do approaching 2020 has &#8220;not concluded.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Websites:</strong> The Campaign Legal Center has a new website designed to help former felons know and restore their voting rights. <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/former-felons-voting-rights">Restoreyourvote.org</a> attempts to guide users through the often confusing state laws to determine whether past convictions or unpaid fines will keep them from voting. “There is a lot of misinformation, and the laws can be complicated,” Blair Bowie, a Campaign Legal Center voting rights fellow told <em>Roll Call</em>. “This certainly is an opportunity for people with convictions to assert their voices in elections.”</p></p>
