							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>NASS New Voter Forum</strong><br /><em>One-day conference focused on best practices for young people and others</em></p>
<p>This week, the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) held a <a href="https://www.nass.org/events/nass-new-voter-forum">New Voter Forum</a> in Washington, D.C. The forum focused on voter outreach, education and best practices geared towards young people, minorities, active duty military and the disabled communities.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Americans have seen the impacts of new, young adults becoming engaged in the issues this country faces as well as the electoral process. According to Maria Benson, director of communications, NASS and its members believe it should embrace and assist them in becoming registered voters. It is also important to reach all voters to ensure that they understand where to vote, the mechanics of voting and when to vote.</p>
<p>“The NASS New Voter Forum was an exciting and significant conversation to have because it focused on some of the hardest constituencies for secretaries of state and stakeholder groups to reach including overseas, military, first-time, disabled, minority and young voters,” said <a href="https://www.sec.state.vt.us/">Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos</a>. Condos is also the current president-elect of NASS. “Voting is the very core of our democracy and reaching out to new voters is so important, especially as we approach the 2018 mid-term elections.”</p>
<p>The five panels of the day discussed best practices and experiences from across the country in reaching the new voters that have unique challenges when it comes to registering and ultimately voting. The panels included: <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?445834-4/voter-outreach-forum-accessibility-forum">Accessible Voting Initiatives</a>, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?445834-5/voter-outreach-forum-military-service-members-families-panel">Improving the Voting Process for Overseas Voters, Active Duty Military and Veterans</a>, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?445834-6/voter-outreach-forum-social-media-panel&amp;start=464">How Social Media and Technology Can Aid in Registering and Educating New voters</a>, Outreach to Minority Voters, Modernizing our Democracy to Engage First-time Voters and Students; and INSPIRE U.S.-Making an Impact on Youth Voting Across the Country.</p>
<p>C-Span carried three of the panels live and they are still viewable with transcription available. The links to the recorded panels are above.</p>
<p>“It was great that C-SPAN was able to cover a portion of this event and archive it for all interested state and local election officials and other stakeholders to review who were unable to attend this important meeting in person,” said Michelle Shafer, a long-time elections technology consultant.</p>
<p>One of the sessions available for viewing is the Improving the Voting Process for Overseas Voters, Active Duty Military and veterans. The session was moderated by David Beirne, director of the <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/">Federal Voting Assistance Program</a>. Speakers included <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate</a>, Mike Queen, deputy chief of staff and communications director in the <a href="https://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office</a> and Kamanzi Kalisa, director of the Overseas Voting Initiative at the <a href="https://www.csg.org/">Council of State Governments</a>.</p>
<p>“I believe our ‘Helping Iowans and Veterans with Disabilities Vote’ initiative is a model that every state can follow,” Pate said. “Those that defended our country and our freedoms deserve every opportunity to make their voices heard by voting, so we should do everything possible to make sure that happens. I hope to see widespread implementation across the country of our efforts to help active duty military and veterans vote.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sos.tn.gov/">Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett</a> moderated the session on social media and kicked the session off with talking about what efforts his state is making to reach potential voters including creating a video, using social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter, and purchasing Google Ads.</p>
<p>Mike Hogan, product manager for Facebook, talked about the social networking sites attempts to focus on engagement.</p>
<p>“Facebook last year rewrote our mission to be more about inclusive communities,” Hogan said. “One community we are trying to build is civic communities. We see that when people can connect with their government and have a voice in the way they are run, these are happy, thriving communities.”</p>
<p>Hogan said his team made big investments begging in 2016 to make sure that people get registered to vote and in turn get out there and cast a ballot. Hogan noted that Facebook has seen a pretty significant increase in the number of people registered to vote because their friends are asking them to vote, not because Facebook is.</p>
<p>Bridget Coyne from Twitter’s policy team was also on hand to talk about the efforts that social media platform is taking to minimize disinformation.</p>
<p>“Combating misinformation is the number one priority, and part of that is investing in machine learning” Coyne said. “We don’t look at individual people, we look at the signals, at the patterns of behavior and we look at somebody tweeting too many times. Maybe they’re not human.”</p>
<p>Coyne said by asking people to verify their accounts with real phone numbers, they are able to remove bot Twitter accounts faster than ever before.</p>
<p>“Sharing best practices with other states is part NASS’ mission. The discussions were robust, productive and informative,” said Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate. “The New Voter Forum will hopefully lead to increased outreach, partnerships and collaboration across the country.”</p>
<p><em>(The Democracy Fund provided support for the New Voter Forum.)</em></p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p>The 2018 primary elections are in the books in four more states this week after voters went to the polls in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Texas for several runoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> In the Natural State, <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/22/turnout-climbs-for-early-voting-across-/">early voting</a> was on the rise this year and there were few reported problems with the state’s <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/22/turnout-climbs-for-early-voting-across-/">voter ID law</a>. In <a href="http://www.4029tv.com/article/confusion-causes-voting-delays-at-a-van-buren-site/20876152">Crawford County</a>, some voters mistakenly turned up at the wrong polling places. Local elections officials seemed to pin the mistake on two issues: One, the nearby counties of Benton, Sebastian and Washington all have vote centers and Crawford does not and vote centers are used for early voting so some voters may have voted early in the past not realizing they needed to return to neighborhood polling places. <a href="https://www.arkansasleader.com/articles/voting-woes-widespread/">Lonoke County</a> experienced several problems including a delayed start in some polling places and a late finish when aging voting machines had issues during the counting process. In the secretary of state race, State Land Commissioner <a href="http://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/arkansas/story/2018/may/23/thurston-secures-gop-spot-secretary-state-race/727555/">John Thurston</a> will represent the GOP in November and a runoff is needed to determine who will face Thurston.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Turnout was light throughout the Peach State on Tuesday, which was not helped by <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/rainy-weather-early-voting-impacting-election-turnout-dekalb/YCutieCvvQX0Vl3kpVNINP/">bad weather</a>. Polling place changes caused confusion for some voters in <a href="http://www.wtoc.com/story/38249004/polling-location-changes-causes-confusion-for-some-chatham-co-voters">Chatham County</a>. Some <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2018/may/22/some-catoosa-county-voting-machines-timing-out-causing-slight-delays/471444/">Catoosa County</a> voting machines were timing out while voters were casting ballots which caused a delay in the process. A woman who has just finished voting committed suicide outside an <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/womans-shooting-near-west-atlanta-polling-location-ruled-suicide-officials-say/85-557061982">Atlanta-area</a> polling place. The site remained open and voting was not impacted. Things seemed to go smoothly with <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/gwinnett-county-debuts-bilingual-voting-sticker/2Fi6KSdrbymWOTAa77HEKP/">Gwinnett County’s</a> first bilingual election and the county even had fancy new bilingual “I Voted” stickers available for voters. <a href="https://www.wsbradio.com/news/local/fulton-county-finds-way-get-election-results-much-faster/sS7yiiq4EWGearPqttMnhP/">Fulton County</a>, which has often had issues with delayed election results, seemed to solve that problem this time around by assigning election night assistants to precincts all over the county. In <a href="http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/ballot-error-led-to-late-vote-count/article_feb0d6fe-5ee1-11e8-b174-6f20b7f74fdb.html">Floyd County</a> a ballot error lead to the late reporting of election results. ADA advocates cited concerns with non-compliant polling places in <a href="http://www.wrdw.com/content/news/Getting-voters-with-a-disability-to-the-polls--483530521.html">Augusta-Richmond County</a>. And in the race for <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-secretary-state-raffensperger-belle-isle-and-barrow-advance/oimR3bvOPxAPl7da8NM3GP/">secretary of state</a>, Rep. Brad Raffensperger will compete in a runoff against Alpharetta Mayor David Belle Isle. And former Congressman John Barrow will represent the Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> In the Bluegrass State, a few “hiccups” impacted voting in <a href="http://www.wpsdlocal6.com/2018/05/22/hiccups-impacting-kentucky-primary-mccracken-county/">McCracken County</a>, things like a poll workers showing up at the wrong location and poll workers not being able to locate certain equipment as the polls prepared to open. Polls opened late in a few locations in <a href="http://www.wymt.com/content/news/Pike-County-primary-election-off-to-a-bumpy-start-running-smoothly-now-483365851.html">Pike County</a> including one where no one could find the right key for the building. But overall, Secretary of State Allison Lundergan Grimes said voting went <a href="http://wvxu.org/post/ky-secretary-state-says-primary-voting-going-smoothly">smoothly</a>. <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article211594439.html">Madison County</a> had some issued with electioneering. And in <a href="http://www.lex18.com/story/38244999/voter-fraud-suspected-in-hazard">Hazard County</a> the police were investigating vote buying.</p></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>After Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) postponed a briefing for members of Congress with the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and National Intelligence after Democratic leaders urged him to <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/388133-ryan-to-make-election-security-briefing-classified">make the briefing classified</a>, the officials <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/388816-trump-officials-brief-congress-on-election-cyber-threats-behind-closed">finally got together</a> on Tuesday behind closed doors. According to <em>The Hill</em>, only about 40 to 50 members of Congress attended the meeting and most were unwilling to speak on the record about it.</p>
<p>“What I was primarily interested in is whether there will be real-time communication with the states if their elections are probed or interfered with or hacked in any way so that we don’t have what we did in 2016 where a year goes by before the states are notified of what the Russians&nbsp;have done,” Rep. <a href="http://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters according to <em>The Hill.</em></p>
<p>House Homeland Security Committee Chairman <a href="http://thehill.com/people/michael-mccaul">Michael McCaul</a> (R-Texas) described it as a&nbsp;comprehensive&nbsp;discussion that gave him confidence in Homeland Security’s efforts to guard state voting systems from cyber sabotage.</p>
<p>“It was a very full discussion, answering all the questions,” McCaul told the paper.&nbsp;</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Things aren’t always what they seem.</strong> At a recent auditors’ candidate forum in Pennington County, South Dakota, one candidate claimed that <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/pennington-county-voters-list-walmart-as-address/article_37a5c1e3-bee5-56a0-9846-6016eb4fb2be.html">hundreds of people were illegally registered</a> to vote at the local Wal-Mart. The Rapid City Journal looked into the claims and found 162 people registered to vote at the Wal-Mart. Forty-one of those voters were considered inactive. Many of the rest however, are RVers who use the Wal-Mart or mail-forwarding companies to register to vote. Voters are allowed to remain registered there because the state constitution allows it. It says, &#8220;Each elector who qualified to vote within a precinct shall be entitled to vote in that precinct until he establishes another voting residence. An elector shall never lose his residency for voting solely by reason of his absence from the state.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Elections officials are prepared for and have to deal with all sorts of natural phenomena</strong> from hurricanes to tornadoes to the occasional earthquake. And in Hawaii, they aren’t going to let any historic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvS20fqTu34">lava</a> flows get in the way of democracy! On the Big Island, elections officials are <a href="http://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2018/05/22/hawaii-news/lava-prompts-election-officials-to-mail-absentee-voting-applications/">mailing out absentee voting applications</a> to 6,000 residents assigned to polling places in the pathway of the lava flow. Officials are also visiting shelters for displaced residents to make sure that they know how to get an absentee ballot.</p>
<p><strong>This week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) issued </strong><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/22/cuomo-issues-pardons-officially-giving-parolees-voting-rights/"><strong>conditional pardons</strong> restoring the voting rights</a> to more than 24,000 Empire State parolees. The original executive order, issued last month, covered all parolees. Cuomo’s actions this week raised concerns because one of the parolees with restored voting rights is Herman Bell, a parolee who service more than 40 years in prison for killing two NYPD police officers. According to The New York Post, Cuomo said those who’ve served their punishment in prison deserve their voting rights restored upon release and that it was “unconscionable” not to do so. “The right to vote is fundamental and it is unconscionable to deny that basic right of citizenship to New Yorkers who have paid their debt to society,” Cuomo said.</p>
<p><strong>Barbershops have a long history of voting activism</strong> in the black community and now The Post and Courier in South Carolina has a story about <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/beauty-shops-become-prime-ground-for-voter-registration-efforts-in/article_ab06fe4c-578a-11e8-a11b-af155d3b277c.html">how beauty shops are stepping up their game</a> for the ladies. Brittany Mathis has launched the Soul to Sol Salon Project. Mathis works with beauty salons that allow her hang posters and leave information about registering to vote, update voter information or request and absentee ballot. The information in in English and in Spanish. &#8220;Not all of us go to church, but we all get a haircut,&#8221; she told the paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> The Illinois Senate has unanimously approved legislation to dissolve the <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180518/legislation-to-disband-dupage-county-election-commission-clears-illinois-senate">DuPage County election commission</a> and turn all election-related duties over to the county clerk’s office. The House approved the measure last month. Gov. Rauner is expected to sign the bill which would take effect Jan. 1, 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> A provision in a bill approved last week, and goes into effect immediately, will allow Iowa residents choosing to register and vote on the same day to provide <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2018/05/17/iowa-secretary-state-paul-pate-voting-vote-laws-votes-changes-dallas-des-moines-polk-college/620048002/">electronic proof-of-residence</a>. Secretary of State Paul Pate said the change would benefit college students and younger residents who often don’t have hard copies of proof-of-residence, but do have it available on a cell phone or other device.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Wilkin County board of commissioners has approved a resolution allowing dozens of townships in the county, with populations of less than 400 registered voters, to begin conducting <a href="https://www.wahpetondailynews.com/news/wilkin-board-approves-mail-balloting/article_d859b30a-5954-11e8-9f59-83141cef9fce.html">elections by mail</a> immediately</p>

The town moderators are opposed to the bill because they believe they should make the ultimate decision about canceling elections based on the conditions in their area.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: By a 7-0 vote, the Las Cruces city council has voted to approve the first step in an <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/2018/05/21/las-cruces-city-council-opts-consolidated-elections/631012002/">election-consolidation</a> measure.

<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> The ACLU of Missouri has asked U.S. District Judge Brian Wimes to issue an injunction in connection with their April 17 lawsuit that alleges the state has <a href="http://www.newstribune.com/news/missouri/story/2018/may/21/groups-suing-missouri-call-action-election/727249/">failed to comply with Motor Voter</a>. The request for a preliminary injunction argues the &#8220;defendants&#8217; failure to update the voter registration information of&nbsp;DOR&nbsp;customers who submit a change-of-address form online or by mail violates the&nbsp;NVRA&nbsp;and, absent immediate relief, will deny qualified Missourians their right to vote and burden others.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The New Hampshire Supreme Court is giving interested parties until May 31 to submit their views on <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/N-H-Supreme-Court-sets-May-31-deadline-for-memos-on-voting-rights-bill-17585295">eliminating the distinction</a> between “residency” and “domicile” for voting purposes.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire Supreme Court news, the high court is reviewing the legality of a bill approved by the state Legislature that would allow for the release of the state’s private centralized <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/lawmakers-bar-use-of-states-centralized-voter-database-for-civil-litigation-discovery-requests/20888725">voter registration database</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Orland Garcia had given the state of Texas until May 17 to submit plans for how the state will comply with the National Voter Registration Act (Motor Voter). Instead of submitting plans, Attorney General Ken Paxton submitted a <a href="https://www.mystatesman.com/news/crime--law/texas-objects-proposed-motor-voter-fixes/2rqLZABiWSplmMkB6cva3J/">list of objections</a> to the plaintiff’s proposals saying they were unworkable and go beyond what the federal law requires. The judge in the case was having none of it and has given the Texas Dept. of Safety 45 days to implement a plan. The state <a href="https://www.caller.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/21/federal-judge-sides-against-texas-motor-voter-registration-case/630057002/">vows to appeal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The U.S. Department of Justice has sent a letter to the Wisconsin Election Commission warning the commission that DOJ may sue because Wisconsin law does not allow temporary <a href="http://www.startribune.com/feds-challenge-wisconsin-s-overseas-voter-restrictions/483377731/">overseas voters</a> obtain ballots electronically or file unofficial ballots.</p></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> A software error has affected approximately 77,000 voter records generated through the Department of Motor Vehicles. Some, although it’s unclear how many, of those 77,000 affected records <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-motor-voter-registrations-errors-20180524-story.html">show a voter being registered more than once</a>. County elections officials are reaching out to the affected voters. &#8220;We believe it&#8217;s fixed,&#8221; Secretary of State Alex Padilla told <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>. &#8220;We feel we have our arms around it. We&#8217;ve rectified it, and we&#8217;ve given proper guidance to the counties.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> According to Knox County IT Director Dick Moran, the election night attack on the county’s elections website was an <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2018/05/17/knox-county-election-cyberattack-smokescreen-another-attack/620921002/">effort to distract the county while another, simultaneous attack was happening</a> behind the scenes assessing county information. The attackers had hacked into a county server and looked around. No personal or confidential information was in the server, only publicly available information like court dockets, Moran told the <em>Knoxville News</em>. Once Sword and Shield, a cyber consultant, found the other attack, they performed, with the county’s permission, a similar attack to see if they could replicate it. They, too, were successful. “They (did it) and brought us right to our knees (even) with all of the resources we had,” Moran told the paper. A patch has been created for the problem.</p></p>
