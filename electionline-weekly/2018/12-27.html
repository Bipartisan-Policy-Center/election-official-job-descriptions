														<p>A study by the intelligence community found that while<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/russia-midterm-election-influence-coates.html"> Russian operations</a> meant to polarize American voters continued during the 2018 midterms, no voting system was compromised. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, the report, which will be forwarded to the Justice Department and Homeland Security, was not release to the public, but Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats did release a statement about the report’s findings.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the American Red Cross</strong> recently<a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2018/12/at-rescuers-reunion-i-dont-know-where-the-strength-the-courage-came-from-article-for-now/slide/1/"> honored a group of citizens and poll workers who helped save a man</a> who suffered a heart attack at a polling place on Election Day. Fortunately for Charles Gordon, he collapsed at the feet of fellow voter Carmella Gonzalez who had recently renewed her CPR certification. “It makes me remember when she was little, when she was tiny,” Carmanleta Gonzalez, Carmella’s mother told WTOP. “When she was in day care, she always wanted an extra tissue and band-aide … I used to ask her why and she said, ‘for someone’s boo-boos.&#8217;”</p>
<p><strong>There’s a masked bandit on the loose in the Panola County, Texas courthouse annex where the elections office is housed</strong>. The interloper(s) was first discovered after dark on December 19. “Belinda’s [Curry] usually not scared of anything, so when she screams, all I could think was &#8230; (that) somebody’s in here trying to kill her,” County Election Administrator Cheyenne Lampley told <em>The Panola Watchman</em>. “&#8230;So I peeked out the door of my office and look down towards her direction, and<a href="https://www.panolawatchman.com/news/pound-raccoon-wreaks-havoc-at-panola-county-courthouse-annex/article_83bffb5a-049a-11e9-bfb3-efee6ea712d3.html"> this humongous raccoon was running towards me</a>.” While they got the raccoon out, when they returned the next morning to work, they discovered that the same racoon, or some partners in crime, had created quite a mess in the elections office. “I mean, all my stuff on the shelf’s knocked off. Our plants dumped over. Down at the other end, it’s clawed up a big spot in our brand new carpet. It has used the bathroom all over this place. A lot of the shelves down the hallway, stuff knocked off of them, down at the other end, and some of our glass Christmas decorations on the ground, shattered,” Lampley told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes</strong> who<a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/northern-ky/2018/12/26/alison-lundergan-grimes-announces-birth-son/2416037002/"> welcomed a new son</a>, Crawford Case Grimes, to the world on December 19. Weighing in at 7 pounds, 3 ounces, the future voter is the first child for Grimes and her husband Andrew. &#8220;Andrew and I have prayed for and dreamed of this day for many years. We are overjoyed to welcome Ford into our lives. We cannot thank enough our amazing team of doctors and nurses over these past several years. We are grateful to everyone who has offered their constant support and encouragement as it has meant more than you know,&#8221; Grimes said in a released statement.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> Sen. Pat Bates, the Senate Republican leader, has filed legislation (Senate Bill 57) that would change<a href="https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sacramento-report-bates-moves-to-kill-motor-voter-program/"> California’s Motor Voter program</a> to allow residents to opt-in instead of automatically registering them.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> According to the <em>News Times</em>, the Sentencing Commission voted to once again get behind any bill that would<a href="https://www.newstimes.com/politics/article/Sentencing-commission-says-parolees-should-vote-13481064.php"> restore voting rights to parolees</a>, who are still serving their sentences. The commission also backed the measure last year — but it never came up for a vote in either the House or Senate.</p>
<p>Kentucky: Rep. Reginald Meeks (D-Louisville) has pre-filed a bill that would direct the state board of elections to provide<a href="https://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Kentucky-lawmaker-wants-Spanish-voter-registration-materials-available-503511731.html"> voter registration forms in Spanish</a> by 2022. The bill also looks to legalize pre-registering 16-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> A package of election-related bills meant to<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/12/20/proposal-3-voting-changes-approved/2382841002/"> codify the voter-approved Proposal 3</a>, is headed to the governor’s desk. Proponents of the bill say the legislation creates enabling language needed to implement the aspects of Proposal 3 including  same-day voter registration, straight ticket voting, no-excuse absentee voting and election audits. According to the <em>Detroit News</em>, opponents said the legislation would limit access for potential voters by requiring resident to visit a local clerk’s office for registering within 14 days of the election, a problem in larger districts where would-be voters would have to drive to a particular location to register.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> Gov. Roy Cooper has vetoed legislation revamping the<a href="https://www.wral.com/cooper-vetoes-technical-corrections-bill-in-addition-to-elections-board-overhaul/18079887/"> state board of elections</a>. The GOP has vowed to<a href="http://www.wect.com/2018/12/26/cooper-calls-gop-plan-override-veto-elections-bill-astonishing-asks-citizens-press-legislators/"> override</a> the veto.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Five Democratic legislators have all filed bills that would require the state to finally move to an<a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20181221/austin-lawmaker-pitches-online-voter-registration---again"> online voter registration system</a>. This is not a partisan issue. This is a good government issue,” said Rep. Celia Israel, D-Austin, who filed<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=86R&amp;Bill=HB361"> House Bill 361</a> to create an electronic voter registration system in Texas. “I’m pledging to continue the fight, because now it’s embarrassing that so many states have it and Texas doesn’t.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2018/12/26/online-registration-ballot-receipts-lawmakers-ways-fix-problems-voters-saw-polls">Other legislation introduced includes</a> a bipartisan bill that would require voting machines to produce a paper receipt. Another bill would shorten the time for early voting from 12 to seven days. Another bill would allow for same-day registration during voting. Yet another would allow residents who are elderly, sick, confined in jail or will be out of their voting county to vote early by mail. There were also several voter ID-related bills filed. Rep. Gina Hinojosa (D-Austin) has filed a bill requiring all four-year universities with more than 10,000 students to have a polling place on their main campus.</p>

														<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> A Superior Court judge says the Alaska Division of Elections properly recounted a state House race in Fairbanks that ended with a<a href="https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Judge-backs-Alaska-elections-division-in-disputed-recount-503289671.html"> one-vote margin</a> between the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Outgoing U.S. Rep.

<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Executive Council has approved a pardon for a man convicted of resisting arrest following an<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/nh-executive-council-approves-pardon-man-arrested-polling-place#stream/0"> incident at a polling place</a> in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Within minutes of becoming law, the state’s<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article223375685.html"> new voter ID law</a> was challenged in both federal and state court. According to the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>: The North Carolina NAACP and six of its branches filed a federal lawsuit, and six voters represented by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice filed a lawsuit in state court. The NAACP lawsuit says the law will be harder on African-American and Latino voters. The lawsuit in state court says the law violates the state constitution because it intentionally discriminates against African-American and American Indian voters.</p>

							<h2>FVAP Update</h2>
														<p><strong>New voter registration/ballot request and back-up ballot forms on Federal Register now</strong></p>
<p>The current draft Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms are available for review and comment on the Federal Register until January 22 at regulations.gov.</p>
<p>The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) requires that the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) prescribe two standard federal forms. Both forms require review and public comment every three years. The FPCA (SF-76), can be used to register to vote, request an absentee ballot and update contact information, while the FWAB (SF-186) serves as a backup ballot if the voter doesn&#8217;t receive a requested ballot in time.</p>
<p>FVAP leveraged feedback from voters and election officials to update the forms to clarify their use and requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The revised forms simplify instructions for voters and include:</li>
<li>Clarification of National Guard classification for use of the form.</li>
<li>Alterations to the list of states requiring additional information.</li>
<li>Clarification of registration and ballot request instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form usability is an essential part of the redesign process. To help ensure the form is easy and intuitive from a voter&#8217;s perspective, please download and complete it as if you were registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot or voting the FWAB. Provide usability comments via the links below.</p>
