							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: Joshua Franklin</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Joshua_Franklin.jpg" alt="Joshua Franklin" width="257" height="257" style="margin: 7px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />Joshua M Franklin has worked with election technology at the state and federal government for over a decade.</p>
<p>He worked at the Kennesaw State University Center for Election Systems during college, and shortly after graduating. Joshua was then recruited to work at the U<a href="https://www.eac.gov/">.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> gathering hands-on experience with a variety of voting technologies.</p>
<p>For three and a half years he managed federal certification efforts alongside election officials, labs, and manufacturers across the country.</p>
<p>Post-EAC, Joshua worked as an IT Security Engineer at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) focusing on cellular and electronic voting security. At NIST, Joshua co-chaired the Election Cybersecurity Working Group, and was the principal author for the security portions of the next generation of federal voting system standards.</p>
<p>Joshua recently became a Senior Cybersecurity Engineer at the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center for Internet Security</a> (CIS) where he will be continuing his work in elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>You&#8217;ve worked in the public sector for quite a while now, how come you are making the leap into the “private” sector now?</strong> </em></p>
<p>Other than a few glorious years gracing the lifeguard chairs of the Atlanta suburbs with my alabaster tan, I’ve essentially always been a state or federal employee.</p>
<p>I’ve accrued 10 years of federal service, and 10 seems like a nice round number. It was time to make a change. I am legitimately curious how the other half lives. Actually, looking at the statistics on this, maybe how the other ~98 percent of the US population lives. There’s a reasonable argument to be made that I’m just dipping my toe into the water by moving to an NGO.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the biggest change you have seen in election security since you started?</strong></em></p>
<p>A couple things I guess: software independence, meaningful election audits, and the Babadook that was 2016. When I moseyed on into the Kennesaw State University Center for Election System’s (CES’s) office in 2004, the country was engaged in a massive debate over “paper or plastic.” There were HBO documentaries, books, and a deluge of news articles on the merits of fully electronic machines versus paper-based ones. I spent hours sorting through hundreds of public comments on this subject for the 2005 <a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines/">Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</a> (VVSG) at CES. And now, although the issue isn’t entirely settled, many states have simply transitioned to paper-based systems or are planning to. Kim Brace has a wonderful set of maps showing the change in voting equipment since 2000 that I use to illustrate this concept to folks learning the field of elections.</p>
<p>Audits are another interesting change in election security since 2004. Audits are critical for detecting problems in elections &#8211; both accidental and malicious. Yet there’s any number of ways to perform an election audit, and various states and jurisdictions will look to audit different aspects of the election process in unique ways. Yet sometimes two states will refer to dissimilar audits with the same term! Risk-limiting audits seem to be a unifying, cost-effective way to audit the result of the election. And I know election officials like getting bang for their buck! It’s been awesome, in the truest sense of the word, to see election officials and the security community work together on something in a proactive manner. Shout out to all the jurisdictions, election integrity groups, and academics going through the pain of bringing theory to reality. You’re the best of us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything changed in 2016. Although security has always been an important facet of U.S. elections, 2016 is the year where things went from “what if” to “what now”? I believe 2016 will be a turning point in election security; hopefully only for the better. (And I can’t wait to read the book that we’re all in!) But as a community, we need to keep on it, and it can’t just be lip service. That means learning cybersecurity best practices, teaching others, and putting what we learn&nbsp;into practice. Consistently. Finally, we need to keep fighting for resources specifically earmarked for election cybersecurity and then using them effectively. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>We hear a lot about what&#8217;s happening in the public sector on cybersecurity&#8211;and how election officials can take simple steps to reduce their risk&#8211;but what else is happening in the sector that folks might not know about but should?</strong></em></p>
<p>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a wonderful example of this. I think that framework does a wonderful job of helping folks to hone onto the cybersecurity issues that affect them, without having to be a <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf">cybersecurity expert</a>. A new version of the CSF was recently released, and I think folks should keep an eye on it and consider how it might be applicable to elections.</p>
<p>While it’s not entirely public sector, academia is certainly adjacent, and Dr. Alex Halderman’s Securing Digital Democracy course offered through Coursera is a wonderful hidden gem that everyone <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital-democracy">might not know about</a>. It’s a great FREE way of refreshing yourself on some cybersecurity basics focused on elections, and can act as a foundation for learning more advanced cybersecurity concepts.</p>
<p>In the same vein, some election officials might know the work that the <a href="https://cdt.org/">Center for Democracy and Technology</a> (CDT) has been doing with the <a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Technology &amp; Civic Life</a> (CTCL), but possibly not everyone does! These organizations have been working to create Cybersecurity <a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/online-series/">101 courses</a> specifically geared towards election officials. No fluff, just what you need. This includes a series of cybersecurity guides focused on cyber-hygiene issues like password usage and auditing. I’d be remiss to not mention the astounding work that the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/elections-resources/">Center for Internet Security</a> (CIS) is doing in the election security space. Check out their handbook if you’ve missed it! &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>You are clearly interested in mobile technology&#8211;we hear you have quite a collection of old phones!&#8211;but should we be focusing on mobile devices as a potential area of vulnerability?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sadly, I’ve donated my phone collection to NIST.</p>
<p><strong>Sigh</strong>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, mobile devices are already used throughout elections. Many states have used tablets for their electronic pollbooks since the mid-aughts. That’s well before the iPad. Yet any sufficiently complex computing platform is going to have unknown software, firmware, and hardware vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Mobile devices tend to complicate this issue by having an always-on internet connection (i.e., cellular) and they are specifically engineered to easily share information with other devices. From a cybersecurity perspective, this ain’t great. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use them at all. I think there’s a number of situations where properly configured mobile devices will be used, or are already being used in the field of elections.</p>
<p><em><strong>Should voters be concerned that their personal information is at risk from election hacking, and not just election outcomes?</strong> </em></p>
<p>Most certainly. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) were <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">breached</a> between 2015 &#8211; 2016 and the Republican data firm Deep Root Analytics was <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/the-rnc-files">breached</a> in 2017. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-voter-data-cloud-met-0818-20170817-story.html">Illinois</a> voters experienced a massive voter data breach in 2017. At the <a href="https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/DEF%20CON%2025%20voting%20village%20report.pdf">DEF CON Voting Village</a> last year, a memory card was found containing voter registration information from a real jurisdiction. All of this occured in just the past few years. This is a real issue that I think we should take a step back from to contemplate how the entire elections ecosystem handles the data voters entrust to us. In many states voters have no say on whether or not their voter information is provided to candidates and/or parties. We need to be worthy stewards of the data voters are compelled to provide to us.</p>
<p><em><strong>What one step should all election officials take to improve their security posture?</strong> </em></p>
<p>Get better at authentication. It doesn’t matter if it’s an election management system, an SSH account on a .gov website hosting election results, or a personal email account. Folks should be using strong, unique passwords for all the computers and devices in their lives. Two factor authentication should be employed for any critical system, and honestly, any system that makes it easy to use a second factor should prolly have a second factor. Look to a password manager to remove the burden of memorization (but not for critical election passwords!!). I also have to mention this XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">cartoon</a> on password strength or the cybersecurity community would have my head.</p>
<p><em><strong>What role if any should blockchain play in elections?</strong> </em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blockchain.png" alt="blockchain" width="376" height="282" style="display: block; margin: 5px auto; border: 1px solid #000000;" /></p>
<p><em><strong>I&#8217;ll ask the third-rail question&#8230;do you think Internet voting will ever be a viable option?</strong> </em></p>
<p>Of course, it’s just not “<a href="http://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/2012/05/22/nist-statement-on-internet-vot/">someday</a>” yet. The number of years between the first manned aircraft and the first manned spaceflight was less than a human lifetime. According to Star Trek we’re supposed to be able to travel at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zefram_Cochrane">light speed by 2063</a>! I have the utmost confidence in the human race’s ability to solve difficult problems through technology. But as of right now, it’s still exceedingly difficult for any organization to keep a system secure while connected to the internet. It doesn’t matter if it’s a governmental world power or a large technology company. But that doesn’t mean that we need to stop investigating and researching the topic altogether. I’m going to be mad at everyone if I can’t vote from some device or implant while simultaneously working the polls at 80 years old. As an aside, as an elderly man working the polls, I plan to cause a lot of hilarity for voters.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could create the perfect election system, what would it look like?</strong> </em></p>
<p>I don’t think it’d look like anything. I would just think about my preference, and it would be securely recorded and reported. But brain-computer interfaces still have a long way to go, and I’m not planning on being a beta tester for that tech&#8230; Although I am worried that this would lead to the episode of The Orville (Majority Rule) where everyone voted on everything all the time. It was honestly more dystopian than the Black Mirror episode on voting (Nosedive). This is required watching for election geeks by the way.</p>

														<p><strong>III. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>On Friday the 13th, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russian nationals working on behalf of the Main Intelligence Directorate in a series of hacks targeted at <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2018/07/13/russia-cyber-indictments.aspx">state and local election officials</a>, voter registration databases as well as voting-machine software companies. According to <em>FCW</em>, one charging document says one such attempt yielded voter information on approximately 500,000 Americans, including names, addresses, partial social security numbers, dates of birth and driver’s license numbers. Another attempt resulted in the successful penetration of computers owned by an unnamed U.S. vendor that supplies software used to verify voter registration information the 2016 elections.</p>
<p>Also on Friday the 13th, the U.S. House Administration Committee released a <a href="https://democrats-cha.house.gov/sites/democrats.cha.house.gov/files/Election_Security_Update.pdf?wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202&amp;wpmm=1">report</a> on 18 states with the “most vulnerable” <a href="https://statescoop.com/states-with-most-vulnerable-voting-systems-named-in-congressional-report">election systems</a> in the country. According to <em>StateScoop</em>, the states included in the report were faulted for lacking several of the things voting-security advocates frequently call for, including paper records of ballots and post-election audits.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-official-overseeing-election-meddling-task-force-has-left-1531576801">Jeff Tricoli</a>, the senior FBI official overseeing a government task force looking into Russian attempts to meddle in the U.S. elections has left for a job in the private sector.</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-official-russia-using-social-media-to-divide-americans">Kristjen Nielsen addressed</a> a joint luncheon of the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors on July 14 in Philadelphia. During her remarks, Nielsen said that there are no signs that the Russians are targeting this year’s midterm election on the same “scale or scope” that they did in 2016. That being said, she did say U.S. intelligence officials are seeing “persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns.”</p>
<p>In non-cybersecurity news, advocates and tribal leaders told an informal meeting senators from the Indian Affairs and Rules committees that <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2018/07/17/tribal-leaders-tell-senate-voting-barriers-are-persistent-systemic/">tribal voters face a range of challenges</a> from language barriers to restrictions with vote-by-mail and lack of access to voting locations.</p>
<p>This week, Maine’s Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap was notified by the federal government that he will be receiving the documents from the president’s now defunct <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/07/18/federal-voter-fraud-commission-documents-finally-headed-to-maine-secretary-of-state-dunlap/">voter fraud commission</a>. Dunlap sued the commission that he was a part of saying that he was not provided while the commission was in existence.</p>

														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Campaign Legal Center and Southern Poverty Law Center have joined forces</strong> on a campaign they have dubbed the <a href="http://www.gadsdentimes.com/news/20180714/groups-seek-to-help-felons-regain-voting-rights">Alabama Voting Rights Project</a> which is designed to help former felons regain their voting rights. The campaign comes a year after state law clarified the list of felonies under which Alabamans were able to regain their voting rights. “The Alabama Voting Rights Project is going to organize door to door, community by community in every region of Alabama to reach tens of thousands of Alabamians affected by recent changes in the law,” Blair Bowie, Alabama voting rights campaign manager and Skadden Fellow at the CLC told the <em>Gadsden Times</em>.</p>
<p><strong>In other felons voting rights news</strong>, the Alaska Division of Elections and the League of Women voters are working together to <a href="http://juneauempire.com/state/news/2018-07-14/pilot-program-aids-voter-registration-absentee-balloting-eligible-prisoners">help inmates register to vote</a> and apply for an absentee ballot. Representatives from each recently visited the Lemon Creek Correctional Center where they spoke with several inmates and helped one apply for an absentee ballot. “I think even if we touch one person, it’s worth that,” Lauri Wilson, elections supervisor for Southeast Alaska told the <em>Juneau Empire</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Fruits, vegetables, flowers, honey, maybe some fancy soaps.</strong> Those are the things you expect to find at your local farmer’s market. What you don’t expect to find is a <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/2018/07/16/las-cruces-farmers-market-voter-registration-flap-reaches-city-council/790726002/">kerfuffle over voter registration</a>. But that’s what happened at a market in Las Cruces, New Mexico when market organizers asked third-party voter registration organizations, authorized by local elections officials, were trying to register voters. It turns out that the city manager had authorized the voter registration drive, but he forgot to include the department that oversees the market in the email.</p>
<p><strong>In response to a letter from the Mississippi NAACP,</strong> the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Mississippi Center for Justice, the Mississippi secretary of state’s office is <a href="http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Mississippi-updating-voter-registration-deadline-for-runoffs-488140871.html">updated its voter registration deadline</a> for runoff elections. While in the past, the voter registration cutoff had been 30 days before the initial election, the <a href="http://www.desototimes.com/news/voters-given-more-time-to-register/article_4cc2f65c-894d-11e8-a89b-cf2330bd8455.html">new rules</a> will include a second cutoff date for 30 days before the runoff election as well. “A qualified voter who registers to vote 30 days before a runoff election for a federal office will be permitted to cast a ballot in that runoff election,” Mississippi Assistant Attorney General Harold Pizzetta wrote on behalf of Hosemann.</p>
<p><strong>In this day and age, we can all use some good news</strong> and we’ve got some for you from Athens County, Ohio. As some of you may recall, the county board of elections has <a href="https://www.athensmessenger.com/spotlight/pumpkin-the-cat-has-a-benefactor/article_cf0aec4e-d8f7-5f30-9928-3035d93553d0.html">a cat named Pumpkin</a> who lives at the board. Recently Pumpkin needed dental surgery and while that’s something that typically the staff would step up and pay for out of their own pockets, an anonymous donor covered the costs of Pumpkin’s care. The donor had money left over from an inheritance her sister left her to care for her own cat. Now that that cat is gone too, the donor wanted to keep spending it on a cat and Pumpkin seemed like a logical choice. The inheritance also paid for boarding during the May primary — Pumpkin gets a bit nervous on election day (don’t we all Pumpkin) and some other medical needs. “We appreciate it so much,” Elections Director Debbie Quivey told <em>The Athens Messenger.</em></p>

<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: The <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/397680-election-security-bill-picks-up-new-support">Secure Elections Act</a> has two new bipartisan cosponsors. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) and Bill Nelson (D-Florida), leaders of the Senate Armed Services cyber subcommittee signed onto the bill this week.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> A new law in place will require journalists, researchers and political campaigns that receive <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article214995745.html">voter data</a> from the state to report any breaches to that data.</p>
<p>Also this week, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation into law that will require counties to provide <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article215115160.html">postage for return vote-by-mail ballots</a> beginning in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Gov. Bruce Rauner has vetoed a bill that would have removed Illinois from the Interstate <a href="http://nprillinois.org/post/rauner-vetos-crosscheck-ban-illinois-participation-already-hold#stream/0">Crosscheck</a> System.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> By a unanimous 38-0 vote, the Senate have approved H 4671 which if signed by the governor would implement <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/07/12/automatic-voter-registration-senate">automatic voter registration</a> in Massachusetts. Voters who have interactions with the Registry of Motor Vehicles or MassHealth would be automatically registered unless they opt out.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker heard arguments this week over attempts block <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/07/16/judge-weighs-campus-early-voting-sites/789837002/">on-campus early voting sites</a> in Gainesville and Tallahassee. Walker did not indicate how or when he would rule.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> An Amicus Curiae <a href="images/Amicus_Brief.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">brief</span></a> was filed on behalf of Common Cause, the National Election Defense Coalition and Project Democracy in Curling v. Kemp, the ongoing case challenging the state’s use of voting machines with no voter-verified, auditable paper trail.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Judge Sarah Evans Barker of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District in Indiana has ordered Marion County to establish a minimum of <a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/69630-judge-orders-marion-county-to-offer-even-more-early-voting-sites">five satellite voting locations</a> in time for the 2018 general election. The consent decree also calls for a minimum of two satellite offices for future primary elections.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Judge Jennifer Frisch, a Ramsey County judge, has given Secretary of State Steve Simon 10 days to provide <a href="http://www.startribune.com/secretary-of-state-steve-simon-has-10-days-to-hand-over-voter-information-a-judge-has-ruled/488130391/">voter registration information</a> to the Minnesota Voters Alliance. According to the <em>Star-Tribune</em>, in January 2017, the MVA formally asked Simon for access to an electronic copy of data in the statewide voter registration system, including voter identification number, name, address, phone number, year of birth, voting history, type of ballot (absentee or in person), voter status (active, inactive, deleted, challenger), reason for challenge and all other information. Simon declined saying the group was only entitled to name, address, year of birth, history, district and phone number. Simon’s office has sought a stay while it is <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/voter-records-tussle-headed-to-higher-court/89-574980639">appealing</a> the ruling.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: In a 3-2 ruling, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found that House Bill 1264 “serves the compelling interest of insuring that those allowed to vote in this state share a community interest with the population generally.” According the <em>Courthouse News</em>, the bill removes the phrase “for the indefinite future” from New Hampshire’s <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/nh-justices-give-green-light-to-voting-residency-bill/">voter residency statute</a>. The change would mean that anyone registering to vote would be declaring his or her residency in the state. Currently, a person only needs to claim New Hampshire as their domicile in order to vote.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union argued in District Court that the state law <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/courts/city-town-election-officials-sued-for-secretly-throwing-out-absentee-ballots-if-signature-didnt-match-20180717">allowing ballots to be discarded</a> because a signature on a ballot does not match that on the affidavit is unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The Navajo Nation’s Human Rights Commission has filed an <a href="https://fox13now.com/2018/07/13/navajo-nation-files-election-complaint-against-san-juan-co-over-primary-races/">election complaint</a> against San Juan County over incidents they allege happened during the primary. The complaint includes issues with electioneering and voter intimidation by poll workers, insufficient staffing, lack of ballots, failure of lights and air conditioning and general lack of decorum among other things. According to Fox 13, county officials have accused the Navajo Nation of “harassment.”</p>

Ron Wyden (R-Oregon) which said the company implemented remote-access software on voting systems over a six-year period. The vendor said it never set up a remote connection on voting devices like tabulators or ballot-marking devices.

<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Gov. Larry Hogan, along with state’s Senate President and House Speaker have asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/13/fbi-marylands-voting-system-linked-to-russian-oligarch/">technical assistance</a> to evaluate the network used by the state board of elections after it was discovered that the company that provides the network has ties to a Russian oligarch.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Under an initiative from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the state will begin soliciting contracts from companies that will assess the cyber-security risks of the state’s voting systems and help improve internet firewalls for county boards of elections. According to the Times Union, Cuomo said the state&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/State-to-fund-cyber-protection-of-voting-systems-13082798.php">Secure Election Center</a>,&#8221; managed by the State Board of Elections, will provide uniform cyber-security training to state and county election officials this year.</p>

About&nbsp;22 percent of registrations or changes were made online, according to data provided by the Pennsylvania Department of State. In Philadelphia, just under 15,000 applications have been processed online.</p>
