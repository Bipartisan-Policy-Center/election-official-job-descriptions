							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: Edgardo Cortes</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cortes.png" alt="Cortes" width="313" height="418" style="margin: 7px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" />Edgardo Cortés has worked in elections for more than 15 years, with experience in all facets of the electoral process including campaigns, non-partisan voter registration, federal and state election policy, and local and state election administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the first Virginia Commissioner of Elections, Cortés spearheaded voter registration and election administration modernization efforts in the Commonwealth. Accomplishments during Commissioner Cortés’ tenure included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing paperless voter registration at DMV locations</li>
<li>Fully integrating online DMV transactions with the online voter registration system</li>
<li>Establishing an online, paperless absentee ballot request system</li>
<li>Implementing an easier to use voter registration form</li>
<li>Creating an online assessment of election administration at the local level, making election data more accessible to the public</li>
</ul>
<p>Cortés served as the Chairman of the Board for the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) and Chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board. Cortés was a charter member of the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Cortés previously served as General Registrar in Fairfax County, VA and Deputy Director for Policy and Grants Director at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. He has also directed Congressional field campaigns, a national non-partisan voter registration program, and led efforts to implement automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals with prior felony convictions in Virginia.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are you most proud of during your time as the Virginia elections commissioner?</strong></em></p>
<p>There are so many things to be proud of that we were able to accomplish the past 4 years to make it easier for eligible Virginians to vote. We worked to modernize every part of the election process with the goal of making it easier for people to participate in our democracy. However, the biggest change and the one that stands out is making the DMV voter registration process completely paperless. Electronic voter registration at DMVs has resulted in more registered voters and more accurate voter rolls in Virginia. The system fully integrated DMVs online processes with the Department of Elections online voter registration and provides paperless in-person voter registration using the same touchscreen terminals used for payments.</p>
<p>The best part is the real-time connection between Elections and DMV that lets DMV know if someone is already registered to vote and allows the voter to do a 1 step address update rather than having to reregister and fill out an entire application. This makes it so easy for voters to update or confirm their information. The success of this project shows in the registration rates for DMV customers and the overall registration numbers in Virginia.</p>
<p>We used the same framework that was created for DMV to create a secure API for 3rd party registration groups to conduct paperless voter registration drives. This exciting project makes it more secure for voters to register with 3rd party groups, increases accountability for the groups, and provides the groups with more useful data and assurances that the information has been properly received by election officials. The work we did in modernizing voter registration took Virginia from 100 percent paper-based registration in 2014 to roughly 80 percent electronic registration now. These projects serve as a model for how election officials can use technology to improve the process and open new avenues for registration and increase participation. </p>
<p> <em><strong>What would you say is the most difficult thing you faced during your time running elections in Virginia and how did you deal with it/what did you learn from it?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think the biggest difficulty I faced was dealing with the divide in the election community between those who want to facilitate the process for eligible voters and those who see themselves as gatekeepers to the process. This isn’t a problem specific to Virginia, but it was incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers would often attempt to impose additional requirements on individuals they didn’t believe should be able to vote in their communities – whether it was attempting to block college students from registering or improperly scrutinizing individuals with a prior felony conviction. For many of those gatekeepers, our efforts to simplify the process and make it easier for eligible voters to participate was troubling and they fought hard to continue doing things how they’d always been done. Thankfully, I’ve seen a trend towards local election officials who view themselves as facilitators for eligible voters. These officials try their hardest to help voters navigate the process and work hard to ensure they can exercise their right to vote. We approached this challenge through a focus on transparency.</p>
<p>The best way to encourage good behavior is to let voters see and understand what is going on and have them demand accountability. My take away from those experiences is that the field of election administration continues to move towards facilitating the process for eligible voters and away from acting as gatekeepers to citizens that simply want to have their voice heard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there anything you were not able to accomplish as elections commissioner that you really wish you had?</strong></em></p>
<p>The one project I really wish I had been able to accomplish was to integrate voter registration at social service agencies in the same way we did at DMV. Social service agencies are an important avenue for voter registration for underserved communities and they have had a significant shift to online services in the past few years.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their shift to online service delivery has meant a decrease in registration opportunities for those receiving services. Getting full integration of voter registration with the online services offered by social service agencies will be an important part of not only ensuring social service agencies continue to comply with their NVRA requirements but will also make it easier for social service clients to have meaningful access to voter registration opportunities when they are interacting with government.</p>
<p><em><strong>In an increasingly partisan world, what advice would you give to an up-and-coming elections official to deal with that?</strong></em></p>
<p>Keep your cool. Election officials make an easy target for partisan attacks, especially if you work in an area with close elections or divided government. Dealing with partisan attacks is just like dealing with any other kind of bullying. Just remember why you’re there – to help the voters. I dealt with many partisan attacks during my tenure, but I knew that if I was doing my job and making sure voters were able to participate in the electoral process, that I had nothing to worry about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p> <em><strong>The Latino population is growing nationwide, but you were one of only a handful of Latino elections officials, especially at the state level. Do you have any thoughts about how to get more of the Latino population involved in the administration of elections?</strong></em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a lack of diversity in the election administration community, especially at the state level. Getting people interested in any public service is difficult. I think the key to getting more Latinos and other people of color into the field of election administration is showing how they can make a difference for their communities.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my career in elections working to open the process for underserved communities and individuals that feel disconnected from the electoral process. Whether it was registering voters in communities of color, advocating for re-enfranchisement of individuals with prior felony convictions, or working to make voter registration easier in Virginia, my work has been to ensure people can exercise their fundamental right to vote.</p>
<p>I think explaining the huge impact you can have on your community by being involved in administering elections will go a long way to bringing more people to the process.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Virginia General Assembly has introduced a host of election-reform legislation from no-excuse absentee voting to runoff elections. What would you like to see them focus on?</strong></em></p>
<p>I would love to see the Virginia General Assembly finally provide no-excuse absentee voting. The current excuse-based process is cumbersome for voters, inefficient to administer, and serves no purpose other than to keep eligible voters from participating. The Department drafted compromise legislation to address the concerns expressed in the past related to no-excuse absentee voting and hopefully the legislature will eventually decide to open the process for voters.</p>
<p>I would also like to see a state constitutional amendment that allows for automatic restoration of rights for all individuals with a felony conviction once they’re no longer incarcerated. I was proud to work for Governor McAuliffe, who restored voting rights to more people than any other Governor in the history of the country, but being able to exercise a fundamental right of citizenship shouldn’t be dependent on a single individual doing the right thing.</p>
<p> <em><strong>What advice you have for jurisdictions trying to bring key election functions in house like you did in Virginia?</strong></em></p>
<p>Bringing IT functions in-house and growing the IT expertise of the Department of Elections was the best internal decision we made during my tenure. Having the expertise we needed in-house made all our other projects possible without the need for massive investments contractor spending. Having control over our IT systems also provided greater security for our statewide voter registration system and assurances that we were doing everything possible to keep our systems secure. For states that are looking to do the same, they need to have a transition plan in place and realize that it will take some initial increased funding before you begin to see the benefits. There will be some overlap time as you transition from vendors to in-house staff but in the long run, you will see a great improvement over your ability to maintain and secure your IT systems.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could create the prefect election system, what would it look like?</strong></em></p>
<p>For me, it’s all about the voter and having a positive experience when you interact with the elections process. I think that can take many forms, but there are some key requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need voter registration to be portable and the onus to be on the government for updating your information. We have all the information we need and placing all these obstacles to voter registration doesn’t serve any purpose other than to keep people out of the process.</li>
<li>We need flexibility for voters in how and when they cast ballots. We need to be responsive as election officials to the myriad needs of voters to participate in different ways and times other than the traditional election day at a polling place.</li>
<li>We need appropriate resources for election officials to ensure voters have a positive voting experience. Elections are a core function of government and essential to maintaining our democracy and we should provide resource levels that reflect that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Voters should only have to worry about who they will be voting for. If their focus is on the mechanics of the process rather than who will be representing them when policies are being created, then we need to do a better job with the process.</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s next for you?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>In March, I’ll be starting some exciting projects.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll be working with the Center for Secure and Modern Elections promoting automatic voter registration and other modernization efforts. I&#8217;ll also be working with the Brennan Center for Justice as an Election Security Fellow. I’m looking for ways to use my experiences to help other election officials that want to modernize their processes to make it easier for voters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, I may look towards venues other than elections where I can help communities have their voices heard.&nbsp; I’ve enjoyed working with so many talented and dedicated public servants throughout Virginia and across the country and have made many amazing friendships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, I’m enjoying picking up my son from school every day and looking forward to the arrival of our new baby this summer.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>It was another hectic week on the Fed-State front.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the departing head of the National Security Agency (NSA) testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/us/politics/michael-rogers-nsa-cyber-command-russia-election-meddling.html">Russian interference</a> with the 2016 election and continued efforts to interfere. Under questioning, Rogers said that his office had not been asked by the Administration to find ways to counter Russia’s efforts.</p>
<p>“President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion that there’s little price to pay and that therefore ‘I can continue this activity,’” Rogers said according to The New York Times. “Clearly what we have done hasn’t been enough.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, NBC was out with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/u-s-intel-russia-compromised-seven-states-prior-2016-election-n850296">another report</a> that left many in the elections field scratching their heads and being forced to respond to questions from the media. In the report, the network said three senior intelligence officials told them that the community believed that state websites or databases had been compromised in seven states—<a href="http://www.govtech.com/security/Alaskan-Election-Officials-Question-Reports-of-Russian-Breach.html">Alaska</a>, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Texas-says-no-evidence-of-election-systems-being-12714855.php">Texas</a> and <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/statement-on-nbc-news-story-about-election-cyber-security/">Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<p>In a thread of Tweets, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied NBC’s report and said that DHS remains committed to helping states sure their election infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to National Public Radio, DHS said NBC&#8217;s story was &#8220;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/589485777/1-state-7-states-uncertainty-persists-about-russian-cyberattacks-on-u-s-election">factually inaccurate</a> and misleading&#8221; and stood by its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/09/22/552956517/ten-months-after-election-day-feds-tell-states-more-about-russian-hacking">previous assessment</a>, that just one state, Illinois, had its system breached.</p></p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2017-2018 <a href="http://www.myhighplains.com/news/preventing-the-spread-of-flu-at-the-polls/992784792">flu season</a> has been particularly deadly</strong> and although it’s winding down doesn’t mean that elections officials are resting on their laurels. In Potter County, Texas the county has a protocol to keep new voting equipment as safe and as clean as possible. &#8220;We have never worried about this before, but with the flu season being so intense this year it was just one of those topics. One of the thoughts we had is if all of our workers got sick during early voting we would have problems opening on election day,&#8221; Elections Administrator Melynn Huntley, told KAMR. The county will be making hand sanitizer available to all voters and poll workers will be wiping down the voting equipment and tables multiple times throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>After disability rights advocates threatened to sue the Texas Workforce Commission</strong> for violating the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, the Commission has agreed to <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/after-lawsuit-threat-texas-agency-changes-voter-registration-policy/2wY0AtEl1L6mWjqmPFLLnK/">offer voter registration help to Texans with disabilities</a> who receive job training from the Commission. According to the Austin American-Statesman, registration aid was no longer offered when job training duties were moved from the state Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, to the workforce commission. In a letter signed by Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos and Larry Temple, executive director of the workforce commission, the officials said work had begun toward offering voter-registration services as part of the agency’s job-training mission.</p>
<p><strong>One Ohio county is taking democracy to the next level.</strong> Franklin County will use two mock elections today and on March 8 to help the county <a href="http://www.govtech.com/computing/To-Make-a-30M-Decision-Ohio-County-Turns-to-Mock-Elections.html">decide which new voting system</a> to drop a coll $30 million on. The mock elections — each from 3 to 7 p.m. — will give elections workers a chance to evaluate each system to see, for example, if they are easy to set up for poll workers and if the machines&#8217; software works correctly as votes are cast. &#8220;This is so (voters) can touch it, feel it, see how it works,&#8221; elections spokesman Aaron Sellers told <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>. &#8220;The purpose of this is to try to get feedback from the general public &#8230; so we can evaluate.&#8221; The county last purchased new voting equipment in 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Late last week, Reuters broke news</strong> that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) is passing over U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-election-masterson-exclusiv/exclusive-u-s-official-focused-on-election-security-will-be-replaced-idUSKCN1G62NI">Matthew Masterson</a> for a second four-year term. “The appointment expired in December and we are going in a different direction for our nomination. We nominate people for a variety of positions and generally speaking choose our own folks,” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, told Reuters. Masterson had been appointed by former House Speaker John Boehner. Reaction from throughout the election community was swift. “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/22/paul-ryan-election-agency-replacement-matthew-masterson-422725">This is insanity</a>,” Joseph Lorenzo Hall, an election security expert who is the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology told <em>Politico</em>. “Matt is extremely capable and has been a champion of more secure and better elections the entire time he&#8217;s been on the EAC.”’</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/embattled-michael-haas-says-he-won-t-continue-as-state/article_85530448-3bad-5238-96ea-abd772eaebc7.html">Michael Haas</a> </strong>announced this week that he will not continue in the role as the state’s election administrator. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, Haas, in a statement Tuesday, said he plans to keep working temporarily at the commission as an attorney, but intends to eventually leave to pursue other opportunities. “It is time for this foolishness to end,” Haas wrote to the commission. “The agency cannot afford to be distracted by my status and must focus on moving forward.” Haas decision brings to an end an ongoing battle between the bipartisan elections commission and state lawmakers who wanted Haas removed.</p>

This law mandates state motor vehicle agencies offer customers the opportunity to register to vote or update their registration information during licensing transactions. Survey findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 percent reported they were not offered the opportunity to register to vote or update their registration during their licensing transactions; most said they would have registered if asked.</li>
<li>The mean transaction time to register to vote was six minutes; 62 percent reported a transaction time of less than five minutes, while 38 percent reported spending five minutes or more.</li>
<li>The vast majority of those who declined to update their registration said they did so to avoid spending additional time at a motor vehicle agency.</li>

							<h2>Postal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Postal Updates</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MailPhoto.png" alt="MailPhoto" width="412" height="197" style="display: block; margin: 5px auto; border: 1px solid #000000;" /></p>
<p>The Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA) had recommendations for improving the process of voting by mail/absentee. One recommendation was to increase ballot tracking with the use of the USPS Intelligent Mail Barcode (IMb).</p>
<p>This 31-digit barcode can be serialized with unique numbers allowing voters to track the ballot as it is delivered to them as well as their voted ballot’s return to the election’s office. The IMb data is also informative in letting election officials know when the ballot was submitted to USPS by the voter and can be used in the absence of a legible postmark. This practice is on the rise with states such as Iowa passing legislation allowing for IMb and Indiana has a similar bill working through the legislature now.</p>
<p>But PCEA wanted wholesale change. In the early 90s the Postal Service designated an Official Election Material Mail logo for election officials to use in order to increase the visibility of election mail in processing. While the logo is still helpful in messaging to voters on what is official information and in recovery situations, with the increase in automation it’s impact has waned due to a reduction of manual handling of mail pieces.</p>
<p>For the last few years PECA has been working to get a ballot Service Type Identifier (STID). The use of a ballot STID will allow for the postal processing plants to know the volume of ballots moving through the system. It will allow them to create logic notifications should a set time elapse in-between scannings because a tranche of ballots have been misplaced or overlooked. It will allow them greater capacity in the location of ballots that may need expedited service as return deadlines near and the USPS does their hourly sweeps of the plants looking for ballots.</p>
<p>Although the use of voter-level ballot tracking is on the rise, it is made available to only a fraction of voters. A ballot STID can be used on virtually every ballot being mailed. It is an improved, data version of the Official Election Material Mail logo. This will benefit the tens of millions of voters who vote by mail.</p>
<p>This change was announced by the Postal Service at the Mailers Technical Advisory Committee (MTAC) meeting in Washington, DC.</p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> AB 1407 has been approved. Under the bill, 16-year-olds would be eligible to <a href="http://krcrtv.com/north-coast-news/eureka-local-news/2-calif-bills-passed-regarding-dam-inspections-and-voting-preregistration">pre-register to vote</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> By a 35-19 party line vote, the Senate has approved a measure that would make 7pm the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2018-02-26/the-latest-gop-senators-want-atlanta-polls-to-close-earlier">standard polling place closing time</a> statewide. Currently most localities close their polls at 7pm, but in Atlanta they don’t close until 8pm.</p>
<p>Also in Georgia, by a 50-1 vote, the Senate has approved a bill would replace the state’s electronic touch-screen voting machines for a system that includes a verifiable <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/news/article202608789.html">paper trail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> House Bill 2541, which would move Hawaii to an <a href="http://www.civilbeat.org/2018/02/hawaii-may-switch-to-all-mail-elections-in-2020/">all-mail ballot state</a> has cleared the Finance Committee. Four in 10 Hawaii voters cast mail ballots in the 2016 general election. Half of voters mailed in ballots for the primary that year.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> Idaho will continue to <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article202459159.html">send voter data to Crosscheck</a>, at least for this year, after a bill to prevent it from doing so died in the house due to a typo. According to the <em>Idaho Statesman</em>, an error was discovered in its key sentence: “(T)he secretary of state shall have no power or authority and the secretary of state shall not allow, cause or disseminate any voter information to the interstate voter registration crosscheck system.” As written, the bill strips the secretary of state of “power and authority.” Adding the word “to” after “authority” would do what the bill intended: limit the secretary of state’s power and authority as it applies to Crosscheck.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The Senate has voted to approve a bill that would fix a state elections law to clarify that <a href="http://www.cjonline.com/news/20180222/kansas-senate-votes-to-fix-elections-law-after-sedgwick-county-throws-out-votes">elderly voters and those with disabilities may need assistance</a> filling out their mail ballots and do not have to sign them. The bill passed 39-0 and faces one more vote in the Senate.</p>
<p>In the House, with the clock ticking to keep bills alive this legislative session, the House approved House Bill 2509 which would give the state’s four largest counties control over their <a href="http://www.cjonline.com/news/20180222/kansas-house-passes-elections-budget-transfer-over-objections-of-rep-keith-esau">elections budget</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Paul LePage (R) has proposed a bill that would require voters without a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/maine-governor-proposes-another-voter-id-bill/">photo ID</a> to sign an affidavit and then present a photo ID within three days.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The Senate Elections Committee has failed to pass SB 2906 which would have allowed residents to <a href="https://northsidesun.com/news-breaking-news/voting-bill-dies">register online</a> to vote and would have introduce “no fault” early voting.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-jersey-looks-restoring-voting-rights-offenders/">restore voting rights</a> to those with criminal convictions. The measure would end the practice of barring residents on parole, probation or in prison from casting a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The House State Affairs Committee voted 11-0 to recommend that the state Department of Tribal Relations, in off-year elections, help the secretary of state, counties and tribes comply with the Help America Vote Act, including the establishment of s<a href="http://www.capjournal.com/news/legislative-panels-work-through-election-bills-and-reject-out-state/article_e2b191a6-1d0e-11e8-a42e-9720b1d9914f.html">atellite voting centers</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate State Affairs Committee voted 7-0 to forward HB 1004 which would give the state board of elections the authority on <a href="http://www.capjournal.com/news/legislative-panels-work-through-election-bills-and-reject-out-state/article_e2b191a6-1d0e-11e8-a42e-9720b1d9914f.html">page size and type size for ballots</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The House has given final approval to the <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/feb/27/washington-voting-rights-act-passes-legislature/">Washington Voting Rights Act</a> that sets additional ways for communities to establish districts for elected offices that are currently at-large.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court of the United States</strong>: The Supreme Court heard arguments this week in a case from Minnesota which <a href="http://www.startribune.com/u-s-supreme-court-takes-up-minnesota-voter-apparel-case/475435703/">pits the First Amendment against polling place attire rules</a>. According to the <em>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</em>, the justices described the statute as overly broad, but also questioned whether political symbols could be used to improperly sway voters. &#8220;It does reach quite a bit beyond what I think a reasonable observer would think is necessary,&#8221; Chief Justice John Roberts said during the hourlong oral arguments. &#8220;The idea that [voters are] going to be protected from recognizing that other people support different candidates than they might, I think, is a bit more of a stretch.&#8221; The U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals previously upheld Minnesota&#8217;s law. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of June.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Legal counsel for the Alabama NAACP, Greater Birmingham Ministries and minority voters filed an appeal of the state’s <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/civil-rights-groups-appeal-alabama-voter-id-ruling/">voter ID law</a> in the U.S. district court in northern Alabama. “The district court acknowledged our evidence that over 100,000 voters, disproportionately Black and Latino voters, lack the required photo ID to vote, but suggested the disparities are not significant,” Natasha Merle, NAACP’s Legal and Education Defense Fund assistant counsel told <em>The Associated Press.</em> “The disenfranchisement of several thousand voters is not trivial. We will continue to fight to ensure every eligible Alabama voter can make their voice heard at the ballot box.”</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Circuit Judge Alice Gray has set a hearing March 12 on a lawsuit that asks that she enjoin use of the state&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2018/02/24/hearing-set-on-voter-id-law-challenge-mark-martin-defends-law">voter ID law</a> in the May primary elections.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> A Kern County judge has sided with MALDEF — the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund — which had sued the county alleging that supervisor districts drawn in 2011 violated the <a href="http://kvpr.org/post/maldef-wins-voting-rights-suit-against-kern-county">Voting Rights Act</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> A three-judge panel of the state 1st Circuit Court of Appeal at the LSU Law Center heard arguments this week about whether or not <a href="http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/courts/article_84ed40d4-1b2d-11e8-8f68-7fd4db87a53d.html">felons on probation and parole</a> should be allowed to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> The Committee For Ranked Choice Voting and eight candidates have filed suit in Kennebec Superior Court asking the court to institute <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/maine-court-urged-to-institute-ranked-choice-voting/">ranked choice voting</a> in time for the June primaries.</p>
<p><strong>New York:</strong> The Manhattan Democratic County Committee is dropping a lawsuit against the New York City Council over a nomination for a <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7496-manhattan-democrats-drop-lawsuit-over-nominee-to-board-of-elections">commissioner to the board of elections</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Lawyers for San Juan County have filed an <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/02/28/san-juan-county-asks-courts-to-pause-redistricting-that-would-give-more-political-power-to-navajo-voters/">emergency motion</a> in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals objecting to a lower court’s ruling that would redraw voting district boundaries and require that special elections be held this year.</p></p>

														<p><strong>&nbsp;VIII. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Potential voters in Indiana may now <a href="https://www.duboiscountyfreepress.com/indiana-adds-text-service-streamline-voter-registration/">register to vote via text</a>. Residents simply need to text “Indiana” to 2VOTE and they will receive a link to the Indianavoters.com website where they will then be able to register to vote from their smartphone. “We are always looking for new and innovative ways to help Hoosiers register and vote,” said Secretary of State Connie Lawson. “This is just another step in that direction. Millennials and young voters expect the flexibility to register from their phone and we are giving them one more way to do this.”</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Congratulations to a voter in the Philadelphia area for becoming the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania/articles/2018-02-26/pennsylvanias-online-voter-registration-hits-1m-milestone">one millionth person</a> to use the state’s online voter registration portal.
