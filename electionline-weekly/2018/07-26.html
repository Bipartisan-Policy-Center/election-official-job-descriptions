							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>The last mile</strong><br /><em>DHS partners with states on cybersecurity poster project</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />electionline.org</p>
<p>At the recent <a href="https://www.nased.org/">National Association of State Election Directors</a> and <a href="https://www.nass.org/">National Association of Secretaries of State</a> Annual Conferences a lot — but not all — of the discussion focused on cybersecurity and the protection our elections. Many ideas and best practices were shared but there was one idea that had people getting out of their seats to take a closer look at and even snap a few photos of.</p>
<p>What was all the fuss? A poster.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NASED_Poster.jpg" alt="NASED Poster" style="margin: 7px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" width="271" height="203" />A project launched by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> in conjunction with states that on the surface seems so simple, but that ultimately provides critical information at no cost to states and counties.</p>
<p>The posters are divided in to three sections, safeguards, threats/risks and the checklist. Geoff Hale, cybersecurity strategy and integration program manager, andwho spearheaded the project for DHS said the poster is totally customizable to the states/counties and while DHS encourages them to include some information about certain safeguards (phishing), nothing is required.</p>
<p>“Election officials love a checklist,” said Matt Masterson, senior cybersecurity advisor for the DHS. “If we can lay out some of the risks and mitigations so [a] county feels ownership and provide that in a checklist — they are gonna put that thing up their office and get that checklist done.”</p>
<p>The first state DHS worked with was Iowa. Dawn Williams, director of elections for the <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">State of Iowa</a> had already been thinking about her own poster project, one that she could have all the counties post in their employee area as a reminder of the everyday importance of strong cybersecurity practices. When Masters was in Iowa to speak about cybersecurity, Williams had a chance to talk to him about her poster idea and he told her about DHS’ poster. It was the perfect launching point.</p>
<p>“The poster is the perfect tool to address the competing needs to keep the details of cybersecurity measures confidential and the need to communicate and bolster public confidence,” Williams said. “It provides a thorough overview of cybersecurity environment in Iowa which then assists election administrators to provide information in an organized and accurate manner, which bolsters public confidence in our elections.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Iowa_Poster_copy.jpg" alt="Iowa Poster copy" style="display: block; margin: 7px auto; border: 1px solid #000000;" width="562" height="355" /></p>
<p>After working closely with Williams in Iowa to get the posters just right, in the early days of the project, DHS also worked with Ohio, Rhode Island and Washington so they could scale the posters for any type of voting climate — vote-by-mail, elections run by towns and municipalities instead of counties, etc.</p>
<p>Since the NASED&nbsp; and NASS conferences Masterson said they have heard from quite a few states about implementing the poster project there.</p>
<p>DHS is working with a contractor to produce the posters and Masterson said they are prepared to scale pretty significantly based on demand. It takes about 2-3 weeks to turn the project around depending on state-specific needs.</p>
<p>While the poster project starts with the states, Masterson said DHS would love to hear from counties that are interested so he and Hale can then work with the county reach out to that state and get them onboard.</p>
<p>“That’s the part that makes this scaleable,” Masterson said. “We knocked out all 99 counties [in Iowa] all together in one project. To be able to reach a state on that scale makes it easy for us.”</p>
<p>Masterson and Hale don’t anticipate this project just being for 2018 so that’s why they would encourage states to reach out to them at any time. The anticipation is that even states who have already received posters will need new/updated ones as threats change and evolve.</p>
<p>And while it may seem simple on the surface, Masterson noted that the importance of this poster project reaches to the highest levels at DHS.</p>
<p>“Secretary [Kristjen] Nielsen mentioned it at NASS in her remarks. We refer to it as the last mile,” Masterson said. “This is how we answer the need to reach those mid and small counties. We know how to get ahold of [Los Angeles County or Cook County], this effort is the first step in bridging that gap.”</p>
<p>Any state or county interested in getting involved in DHS’ poster project should reach out directly to Matt Masterson and Geoff Hale. electionline will be happy to provide you with their contact emails, just let us know (<a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">mmoretti@electionline.org</a>)</p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;III. Our Say</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the 28th Anniversary of the ADA, Reaffirming Our Commitment to Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>By Thomas Hicks and Christy McCormick&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the 2018 Federal Election approaches, the importance of election security continues to shape headlines across the country and spark discussion about how to secure the vote. While every state and jurisdiction should consider security when selecting the election equipment and procedures that best serves their voters, they must remember that the law requires every American – including the more than 35 million Americans who have a disability – to have the opportunity to vote privately and independently.</p>
<p>This week, as we mark the twenty-eighth anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it is important to remember that election security cannot come at the expense of election accessibility.</p>
<p>Recently in Baltimore, we held a forum to hear in our capacity as Commissioners from members of the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) about their experiences at the polls. We also want to assure these Americans that the work to secure elections would not undermine their legal right to cast their ballot without assistance.</p>
<p>Voting accessibility has long been a priority for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), as well as for the election officials and voters we serve. The EAC was established in 2002 as part of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), legislation which built upon the disability protections enshrined in the ADA by outlining a clear mandate to ensure Americans with disabilities be given the same opportunity to vote freely and independently as other voters. It was the first time Congress set forth such a measure and it is one we must not ignore.</p>
<p>Nearly one-sixth of the total U.S. electorate has one of a broad range of disabilities, including mobility, communicative, physical and cognitive impairments. This ever-growing population of voters may also face educational, cultural and political barriers that could make participating in elections even more difficult. It is imperative that these men and women have a seat at the table as election officials make critical decisions about how they run elections.</p>
<p>The work to ensure accessible elections is not easy. We recognize that election officials with limited manpower and budgets may often feel they face a broad range of challenges that are in tension with the responsibility to provide accessible elections. The EAC works to help election officials navigate these obstacles through the distribution of resources, best practices, and federal funds.</p>
<p>For example, in March, Congress allocated $380 million in funds for states to improve the administration of elections for Federal office. All 55 eligible&nbsp;states and territories have applied for and are in the midst of drawing down these funds to pay for improvements to better serve their voters. Each state will determine how they spend these federal dollars, but some will certainly seek ways to improve election systems to make them more accessible and secure.</p>
<p>As they do, the EAC will serve as a trusted federal partner that can help identify procedures and practices that have a proven record of serving the needs of all voters, including priorities such as accessibility, security and efficiency. We can also connect election officials with accessibility experts and advocacy groups that stand ready to assist in the effort to help Americans vote.</p>
<p>Beyond the EAC’s convening power and our administration of federal funding, the Commission uses its voluntary testing and certification of election systems, its creation of resources such as voting rights cards in Braille and large print, and its effort to identify and lift up innovative approaches and best practices to serve American voters who need assistance at the polls. The EAC has also contributed funds to develop new innovations, such as Prime III, which includes for example a remote ballot marking system, to expand accessibility for voters with disabilities.</p>
<p>The recent gathering in Baltimore is just one stop in our ongoing journey across the country to directly engage with election officials and voters. These conversations not only shape the creation of new EAC resources, but provide forums for us to dispel myths such as the false choice between security and accessibility. We also encourage voters with disabilities to get involved in the election process beyond registering and casting a ballot, such as becoming a poll worker.</p>
<p>Ensuring the rights of voters with disabilities isn’t a choice, nor is it a partisan issue. It’s the law. We can never forget that as we work to improve elections.</p>

														<p><strong>IV. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Late last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-plans-to-alert-public-to-foreign-operations-targeting-us-democracy/2018/07/19/d010e3a6-8b8d-11e8-85ae-511bc1146b0b_story.html?utm_term=.3e3a5825af79">plans to alert the public to foreign operations targeting U.S. democracy</a>. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, the government will inform American companies, private organizations and individuals that they are being covertly attacked by foreign actors attempting to affect elections or the political process.</p>
<p>“Exposing schemes to the public is an important way to neutralize them,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said when announcing the policy at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. The American people have a right to know if foreign governments are targeting them with propaganda.”</p>
<p>Also as the Aspen Security Forum, Paul Nakasone, director the National Security Agency, announced the creation of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-22/u-s-cyber-commander-tackles-russian-threat-with-new-task-force">special task force to address Russian threats</a> to cybersecurity. The NSA and Cyber Command, the military’s cyber arm, will collaborate against Russian threats.</p>
<p>“I stood up a Russia group, a Russia Small Group,” Nakasone said, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. “It’s in line with what the intelligence community has really been doing since post 2016, 2017.”</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill this week, New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, Ricky Hatch, the clerk and auditor from Weber County, Utah, EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks and DHS Undersecretary Christopher Krebs all testified before the <a href="https://statescoop.com/states-and-counties-are-not-sitting-back-on-election-cybersecurity-officials-tell-congress">House Oversight Committee</a> on the efforts states and counties are making to secure the 2018 election.</p>
<p>“Election security is not a one-time issue,” Toulouse Oliver told Congress. “Interference happened before 2016, it will happen after 2016. I think 2016 just brought an awareness of how serious this issue is. I believe elections are underfunded considering how serious they are.”</p></p>

<p><strong>A work group which is advising Lt. Gov. Byron Mallot on <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2018/07/25/state-officials-weigh-shift-to-more-voting-by-mail/">potential reforms to Alaska’s election system</a></strong> met this week to discuss some of the potential changes to the system including moving to vote-by-mail. According to Alaska Public Radio, the state plans to replace voting equipment and software by 2020 and the plan is to have whatever other changes in place by then as well. Members of the work group were presented with results of a survey of Southwest Alaska residents about vote-by-mail that found most of those residents preferring the current polling-place system, but open to the option of vote-by-mail. “One of the guiding principles of the group is that if it doesn’t work for rural Alaska, then it won’t work for Alaska,” Elections Division Director Josie Bahnke told KTOO. “And so we’ve been very cognizant of that.”</p>
<p><strong>According to analysis from TargetSmart,</strong> a Democratic data firm, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/card/young-voters-make-significant-portion-new-registrations-key-states-parkland-n892601">young voters</a> between the ages of 18 and 29 make up the largest share of newly registered voters. The increase was tracked since the shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida. Pennsylvania saw the sharpest increase — 61 percent of new voter registrations come from young voters, compared to 45 percent before the shooting. The analysis, which looked at all 50 states and the District of Columbia also found double digit percentages in Indiana, New York and Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Maryland Reps. John Delaney (D) and Andy Harris (R) have introduced a bill that would mandate that vendors associated with federal elections be owned and controlled by <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-elections-russia-legislation-20180719-story.html">U.S. companies</a>. According to the<em> Baltimore Sun</em>, Delaney’s and Harris’ bipartisan bill would take effect in 2020 and create a database to make it easier to establish that an election vendor is not foreign-controlled.</p>
<p>Another bill, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) and co-sponsored by Rep. Robert Brady (D-Pennsylvania) and Zoe Lofgren (D-California) would take effect in 2018 and would bar states from entering agreements with <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-elections-russia-legislation-20180719-story.html">election vendors</a> “controlled by persons who are not citizens, nationals or permanent residents of the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Gov. Bruce Ruaner has signed a bill into law that will officially shutter the <a href="https://patch.com/illinois/wheaton/rauner-signs-bill-permit-dupage-election-commission-merger">DuPage County elections commission</a> and more the responsibilities of the county’s elections to the county clerk’s office.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> The city councils in Las Vegas and North Las Vegas have approved an agreement with Clark County that will allow <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/north-las-vegas-las-vegas-approve-shared-voting-centers/">voters in municipal elections to cast ballots at vote centers</a> regardless of jurisdiction. According to <em>The Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>, the move is aimed at bolstering turnout. Boulder City and Henderson officials have already approved a similar agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> House Bill 18 is on the way to Gov. John Kasich’s desk. The bill would eliminate <a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/more-one-candidate-special-primaries-ohio/FmJ0On0WLpqq0Jzr8MjQiI/">unnecessary special elections</a> in order to fill a congressional vacancy.

														<p><strong>VII. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Judge Mark Walker said this week that officials showed “a stark pattern of discrimination” by blocking <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/07/24/judge-faults-state-and-approves-early-voting-on-college-university-campuses/">early voting sites on state college and university campuses</a>. According to the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, Walker issued a preliminary injunction that directs Scott&#8217;s chief elections official, Secretary of State Ken Detzner, to tell all 67 counties that they can use campus buildings for early voting this fall. Detzner has until Friday to tell the judge he will obey. Walker ruled that a 2014 state opinion that banned early voting on campus violates three amendments to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the ongoing case against the state’s process of <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article215496355.html">restoring voting rights</a> to former felons.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> Polk County District Judge Karen Romano has granted a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2018/07/25/iowa-voter-id-law-paul-pate-judge-issues-injunction-early-voting-absentee-ballot-signature-matching/836202002/">temporary injunction</a> blocking some provisions of the state’s voter ID for the 2018 election. The injunction requires the state to restore its early voting period to 40 days. &#8220;The harm to the registered voters who may become disenfranchised or experience substantial obstacles in voting is greater than any harm to the state,&#8221; she wrote in her order. Secretary of State Paul Pate said the state will appeal the decision to the Iowa Supreme Court &#8220;immediately.”</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> According to the <em>Capital-Journal</em>, Secretary of State Kris Kobach recently filed a statement with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals contending that U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson erred in deciding the state’s voter registration law is unconstitutional in requiring that new voters <a href="http://www.cjonline.com/news/20180719/kansas-appeal-in-aclu-kobach-fight-says-federal-voter-law-doesnt-pre-empt-state-law">prove their citizenship</a>.</p>

According to The Tennessean, the appeal continues the challenge the state’s <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/07/20/supreme-court-abortion-tennessee-amendment-1/806993002/">method of counting votes</a> for the ballot measure. The&nbsp;appeal asks the high court to consider two questions: whether election officials conducted the election in a biased manner, and whether state attorneys acted lawfully in filing&nbsp;their own suit against the eight plaintiffs in the case. The Supreme Court has not yet granted the petition.</p>
<p>Also in Tennessee, Brian “Wormy” Hodge was recently charged with witness tampering, conspiracy to commit voter fraud, five counts of vote buying and witness tampering stemming from a 2014 Monroe County sheriff’s election. According to the <em>Advocate and Democrat</em>, those charges were dropped when Hodge agreed to plea to a charge of <a href="http://www.advocateanddemocrat.com/news/article_3683c3bc-ba9f-5ecf-851b-ea94fbdf45fa.html">conspiracy to pay/offering to pay for voting</a>.</p></p>

<p><strong>Tech Company News</strong>: According to <em>Fast Company</em>, cloud security provider Cloudflare is offering a free service to any U.S. election authority for the 2018 election. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90204867/why-security-company-cloudflare-is-protecting-u-s-election-sites-for-free">Athenian Project</a> is in essence, forms a barrier between clients and the internet and absorbs hacking attempts.

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> There have been several news reports this week about the Statewide Online Voter Registration System experiencing <a href="https://www.chronicleonline.com/news/local/state-s-online-voter-registration-system-experiencing-intermittent-problems/article_0dc47fbc-8f64-11e8-90de-236ca0df4836.html">intermittent problems</a>. Some voters have complained that they have not been able to update their registrations while others have said they haven’t been able to register at all. In one news report the state said that the problem had been fixed, but the problem was never identified.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The secretary of state’s office has fixed a “glitch” on the <a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2018/jul/21/state-fixes-glitch-on-site-showing-voter-registration-status/">state’s voter registration website</a> that was incorrectly indicating that some voters were not registered to vote. Erich Ebel, communications director for the Secretary of State, told <em>The Columbian</em> that the cause of the problem was a brief interruption between the public interface of the website and the state voter database. “That caused people to receive an inaccurate message that they were unregistered,” he said. He said the Secretary of State’s Office is still investigating the interruption.</p></p>
