							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Election management in the U.S. is improving</strong><br /><em>An updated Elections Performance Index from the MIT Election Data &amp; Science Lab evaluates the 2016 election</em></p>
<p>States’ administration of elections overall improved by 6 percentage points between 2012 and 2016, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://elections.mit.edu/#intro">Elections Performance Index</a> (EPI) released today by the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election Data &amp; Science Lab</a>.</p>
<p>As many readers will know, the index, which was developed and managed by The Pew Charitable Trusts before being transferred to MEDSL in 2017, provides a nonpartisan, objective measure of how well each state is faring in managing national elections. When it launched in 2013, it provided the first comprehensive assessment of election administration in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.; it now includes data from every federal U.S. election since 2008. It’s calculated using 17 indicators that cover the broad scope of issues involved in managing elections, providing specific metrics for election officials, voters, and policymakers to compare their state with its own past performance, as well as the performance of other states.</p>
<p>“The index is an important foundation for the ongoing discussions on election management,” said Charles Stewart III, the Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MIT Election Lab’s founding director. “The new release of the index helps remind us that election administration is a multi-dimensional challenge. Significant improvements in the 2016 index also illustrate that when election officials commit themselves to a path of improvement, good things can happen.”</p>
<p>Overall, almost all states improved their index scores between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, with 22 states improving at a rate greater than the national average. Overall, Vermont showed the most significant improvement from 2012, landing at the top of the index for the first time after expanding the availability of online tools, providing online voter registration, and requiring a postelection audit.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia, West Virginia, and South Carolina also saw significant gains in their scores and rankings. Only six states saw their scores decline from 2012, partly due to an increase in the residual vote rate.</p>
<p><strong>Trends in 2016<br /></strong>A trend that made a positive impact on the index scores of many states in 2016 was the increasing online capacity of state and local election offices, including an increase in the availability of online lookup tools for voting information. These tools make important election information easy to find, and take a significant time burden away from election staff. In 2016, every state and DC had at least one of these tools, whether it was meant to allow voters to check the location of their polling place, their registration status, track the status of their absentee or provisional ballot, or simply look up specific ballot information.</p>
<p>The hefty jump in rank made by states like Vermont—which catapulted to the top of the index in 2016—was in many cases partly due to the states’ development and release of these tools. Likewise, online voter registration played a role in these shifting ranks. In 2008, only Arizona and Washington State offered voters the ability to register to vote entirely online. By 2016, that number had grown to 33 states and DC, with four additional states offering voters the chance to update their existing registration online.</p>
<p>The decline in average wait times at the polls also played a role in improving the average index score in 2016. The effort that state and local officials put into addressing polling place wait times after 2012 paid off, and is reflected in the significant drop in this measure for many of the states that performed worst in 2012. Florida had the longest average wait to vote in 2012, at <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/05/us/politics/how-long-it-took-groups-to-vote.html">45 minutes</a>, but dropped to just 5.5 minutes in 2016. D.C., which in 2012 was second-from-the-bottom, saw 2016 wait times drop from 33.9 to 16.3 minutes. Overall, 7 states had average wait times of more than 20 minutes in 2012. In 2016, that number dropped to zero.</p>
<p>(In the interest of cross-promotion, we should note that MIT, along with the <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/improving-the-voter-experience-reducing-polling-place-wait-times-by-measuring-lines-and-managing-polling-place-resources/">Bipartisan Policy Center</a>, has had a major program to work with election officials to record line lengths and reduce wait times. A report on this effort, entitled <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/improving-the-voter-experience-reducing-polling-place-wait-times-by-measuring-lines-and-managing-polling-place-resources/">“Improving the Voter Experience,”</a> was released in April.)</p>
<p>As noted above, one indicator that stood out in the 2016 update was the residual vote rate, which calculates the number of under- and over-votes cast in an election (as a percentage of voter turnout) to evaluate the performance of voting machines. The 2000 election still holds the record for highest residual vote rate in the last two decades; the nationwide rate in that election was 1.9 percent, with state highs of up to 3.9 percent. In 2016, however, the rate spiked back up to 1.39 percent, after dropping to 0.99 percent in 2012.</p>
<p>Research has shown that the jump is likely due to an increase in voters abstaining from casting a vote in the contentious presidential race, rather than a decline in the performance of voting machines. Interestingly, Nevada, which provides voters with the ballot option “none of these candidates,” saw a historical low in the residual vote rate in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>In store for 2018’s EPI: Time for renewal<br /></strong>As the staff of the MIT Election Lab look ahead to the next federal election, now less than three months away, they’re already planning out their approach for the 2018 EPI. Nearly ten years after the first EPI advisory committee was convened, the Lab will reconvene many of them—plus a few new faces—to revisit the current indicators and discuss whether any might need to be altered or retired.</p>
<p>At the same time, they’ll face the challenge of evaluating new potential measurements and data sources, and identifying whether they have a place in a redesigned index. Cybersecurity, for example, has been a hot topic in discussions on U.S. election administration, but has proved difficult to include on the EPI because of the dearth of a high-quality measure for it.</p>
<p>All told, the EPI exists to illustrate to the public the many factors that go into running elections, and how changes to election policy can lead to change in election performance. The current nationwide concern with cybersecurity hasn’t changed the fact that election management is a complex web of prosaic processes that determine whether voters can cast ballots conveniently and securely. It will be this understanding of elections that guides the development of the EPI through the 2018 election and beyond.</p>

														<p><strong>III. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Last week, the top national security officials presented a united front in the White House briefing room to warn that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-stresses-its-focus-on-election-security-amid-criticism/2018/08/02/1e60c3ae-9675-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.c29a3209d756">Russia continues to target the U.S. election system</a> and that the Administration has made combatting the interference a top priority.</p>
<p>“In regards to Russian involvement in the midterm elections, we continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States,” Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats told the White House press corps in the live-televised briefing according to <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p>In other news, according to Maine Secretary of State, a Democratic member of President Donald J. Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/03/the-most-bizarre-thing-ive-ever-been-a-part-of-trump-panel-found-no-voter-fraud-ex-member-says/?utm_term=.0de038324eeb">presidential commission on election integrity</a>, said that the commission found no evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>Kobach responded to Dunlap by calling him “willfully blind of the voter fraud in front of his nose” and pointed to two studies seeming to back up his claims, however other experts argue that Kobach was working with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/07/experts-say-kris-kobach-used-flawed-research-to-defend-trumps-voter-fraud-panel/?utm_term=.a4bd63209f3f">flawed data</a>.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p>I<strong>V. Primary Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Hawaii’s primary is next week, but officials are encouraging as many voters to vote early because of an impending <a href="http://www.kitv.com/story/38810857/election-officials-preparing-a-plan-in-case-the-hurricane-threatens-the-islands">hurricane</a>. Although the path of the storm in not certain, an oncoming hurricane is just <a href="https://www.empireadvance.ca/hawaii-grapples-with-lava-hurricane-as-election-nears-1.23391448">one more natural disaster</a> that elections officials in the Aloha State have had to factor into this year’s primary.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Sen. Oletha Faust Goudou (D-Wichita) and the ranking member of the Senate Elections Committee said that Tuesday’s election was her “worst voting experience ever,” in <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article216228795.html">Sedgwick County</a>. In <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216224060.html">Johnson County</a>, the states most populous county, voters found problems at the polls early in the morning with some of the county’s new voting machines not working. The early morning delay had a trickle-down effect with some polling places <a href="http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Lines-delay-returns-in-vote-rich-Kansas-county-490322851.html">staying open late</a> and <a href="https://fox4kc.com/2018/08/08/long-lines-at-some-johnson-county-polls-delay-results-for-major-kansas-races/">delaying the reporting</a> of results. “I’m embarrassed for our county,” Johnson County election commissioner <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/article216290855.html">Ronnie Metsker told</a> the <em>Kansas City Star</em>. “Our county is not accustomed to having this kind of event. It’s embarrassing for our office, it’s embarrassing for me, for our team and for the vendor.” In the <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216206270.html">race for secretary of state</a>, Republican Scott Schwab will face off against Democrat Brian McClendon in November.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Many Michigan counties and towns saw the first major roll out of new voting systems and things did not go as planned in some areas. There were ballot shortages on <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2018/08/07/oakland-county-ballot-shortage-election-aclu-metro-detroit/930319002/">Oakland County</a> and in <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/08/some_grand_rapids_polling_stat.html">Grand Rapids</a>. In <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2018/08/millage_proposal_inadvertently.html">Jackson County</a>, a millage proposal was left off of some ballots. The power went out in at least 15 <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/07/michigan-primary-election-poll-locations-outages/921894002/">Detroit</a> polling places. Also in <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/08/07/polling-place-moved-detroit-election/924418002/">Detroit</a>, some voters said they were never informed about a polling place relocation. Votes in one <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/08/final_genesee_county_tally_on.html">Genesse County</a> precinct could not be counted. Results were delayed in <a href="https://www.cadillacnews.com/news/vote-counting-issues-lead-to-uncertainty-in-wexford-county/article_22f7582a-5e03-5cd1-ad6a-ab11921d2083.html">Wexford County</a> because of vote-counting issues. Results were also delayed in <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/monroe-co-election-error-to-postpone-results-until-11-pm">Monroe County</a>. Officials in <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2018/08/wayne_county_election.html">Wayne County</a> blamed late results on technical problems with a website created to present vote counts in an interactive map. It was issues with computer modems in various municipalities that delayed the results in <a href="http://www.sentinel-standard.com/news/20180808/ionia-county-election-results-delayed-by-technical-glitches">Ionia County</a>. In the race to replace embattled <a href="https://www.macombdaily.com/news/miller-leading-bieda-for-macomb-county-clerk-nomination/article_67549134-9a9f-11e8-af43-fb9f021504ba.html">Macomb County</a> Clerk Karen Spranger, Democrat Fred Miller will face Lisa Sinclair. According to early numbers, <a href="https://www.postbulletin.com/news/politics/voter-turnout-shatters-recent-records-for-michigan-primary-elections/article_4b1b4ad9-19fa-53a3-8b4c-b915b03ff28c.html">voter turnout</a> exceeded 27 percent, which is the most people to vote in any Michigan primary — midterm or presidential — since 1978.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> A lot of strange and unique things happen on election days and sometimes it seems like we’ve heard them all, but this was a new one for electionline. On Tuesday, a group of GOP poll workers at a polling place in <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/poll-workers-in-berkeley-left-for-lunch-then-got-lost/article_cbbbbdb9-1ba5-5d79-b2d8-a6721b918d83.html">Berkeley</a> left for lunch and got lost and failed to return. When that happened, the Democratic poll workers shut down the polling place and turned away voters. “It was just like a comedy of errors,” St. Louis County’s Democratic Election Director Eric Fey told the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>. It is unclear how many people were turned away during the 45 minutes it took to get more Republican poll workers to the school, which also had three Democratic poll workers on site. Voters in at least one <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article216251425.html">Kansas City</a> polling place reported that when they turned over their two-sided ballot, the back side of the ballot was already complete. There were scattered power outages on election day including in <a href="https://fox4kc.com/2018/08/07/power-outage-forces-voters-across-the-metro-to-cast-votes-in-the-dark/">Jackson County</a>, but none of those outages prevented voters from casting their ballots. Voters in <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/08/extraordinary-turnout-election-day-ballot-republican-voting-shortage-led-long-waits-some-voters/930944002/">Greene County</a> experienced delays of up to 90 minutes while waiting to cast a ballot. The delay was blamed on higher than expected turnout. Although overall reporting was timely, <a href="https://www.abc17news.com/news/after-delay-in-absentee-totals-boone-county-clerk-in-need-of-new-equipment/778931675">Boone County</a> had some issues getting their absentee vote tallies complete. While there were scattered issues throughout the day, there were no reported problems with the implementation of the state’s <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2018/08/08/no-issues-reported-locally-first-major-election-voter-id-law/935544002/">voter ID law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Overall, the August primary went well throughout much of the Volunteer State. There were the usual minor issues, like <a href="http://herald-citizen.com/stories/power-outage-doesnt-stop-voting,29284">power outages</a> and <a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2018/aug/02/voter-turnout-steady-despite-rain-and-traffic/476216/">bad weather</a>, but some counties like <a href="https://www.dnj.com/story/news/2018/08/02/rutherford-county-election-early-voting/863160002/">Rutherford</a> and <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/local/sullivan-county-sees-record-turnout-for-august-election/1342748420">Sullivan</a> saw record turnout. In <a href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/cheatham-county-election-computers-go-down-county-wide/1343296340">Cheatham County</a>, results were delayed due to a countywide shut down of the election system. And delayed results in <a href="http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/38804605/voting-delays-bring-renewed-call-to-replace-antiquated-equipment">Shelby County</a> brought renewed calls for new voting <a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/2018/08/03/old-equipment-failed-website-stall-release-election-results/899757002/">equipment</a>. In <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/wilson/2018/08/03/election-ties-wilson-county-may-have-break-deadlocked-races/899258002/">Wilson County</a>, two races for county commissioner ended in a tie. If the races remain tied after the election is certified, the county commission will either choose a winning candidate or make a new election part of the November 6 general. Although it didn’t end in a tie, the race for vice mayor in <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/story/38816719/nashville-vice-mayor-runoff-will-cost-city-750000">Nashville</a> was close enough to trigger a runoff, which will cost the city about $750,000.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Washington, which is all vote-by-mail, had a primary. And that&#8217;s all we have to report!</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special elections are usually low-turnout affairs,</strong> but when one is called in Alaska during the summer, it <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2018/08/05/food-trucks-on-election-day-unusual-summer-anchorage-election-nears-end/">presents its own challenges</a>. Not only, does Anchorage not typically have elections in the summer, but it’s also the nicest time of the year in Alaska so people are often otherwise occupied. “And it&#8217;s compounded by the fact that it&#8217;s summer in Alaska and people are off camping, fishing, hiking and enjoying all the awesome things Alaskan summers provide,&#8221; Carolyn Hall, education and outreach coordinator for the city elections told the <em>Anchorage Daily News</em>. Hall and her staff have been manning a table at local farmer’s market in order to generate attention and they have planned to have food trucks and a kombucha stand at city hall on election day so people can stop by, grab lunch and watch the mail ballots being processed.</p>
<p><strong>Since the second phase of the <a href="https://www.ilnews.org/news/statewide/more-than-people-have-used-illinois-automatic-voter-registration/article_76c3b220-9654-11e8-88a3-5f8ff90d32dc.html">implementation of automatic voter registration</a></strong> began in July in Illinois, more than 20,000 people have updated their voter registration information or registered to vote for the first time according to the Illinois State Board of Elections. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty surprising to me that you have 20,000 new or updated voters,&#8221; ISBE spokesman Matt Dietrich told the <em>Illinois News Network</em>. &#8220;That shows how, number one, it&#8217;s going to bring new people into the system. And number two, it&#8217;s going to help the local jurisdictions keep accurate records.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration Efforts</strong>: Last week we learned about the Broadway cast of Hamilton doing their part to get voters registered for November and this week, <em>Publisher’s Weekly</em> has a story about voter registration drives at <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/77675-indie-booksellers-look-to-register-voters.html">independent book stores</a>. Some bookstores have set up tables with voter registration information and others are handing customers voter registration forms with their change.

<p><strong>Congratulations to the <a href="https://www.capemaycountyherald.com/community/business/article_fb66f978-9655-11e8-94f9-9f9e3f28ece8.html">Cape May County, New Jersey board of elections</a></strong> for receiving the 2018 Leadership Award from the Advisory Council of Rutgers Cooperative Extension. According to the Cape May County Herald, the Board received the annual award in recognition of their significant and generous support of the Cape May County 4-H Youth Development Program. For more than 12 years, the Cape May County Board of Elections has donated two voting machines each year to the annual South Jersey 4-H Teen Conference which takes place in various locations throughout southern New Jersey, including transporting and setting up the machines. This generous annual donation enables over 100 South Jersey 4-H youth each year to participate in an election, thereby learning how to use actual voting machines.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Udpates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Signatures have been submitted to give voters a say in whether or not the <a href="https://www.pantagraph.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/election-consolidation-to-appear-on-bloomington-ballot/article_c40c0189-bb8e-5723-9eb0-0d5cf85297be.html">Bloomington election commission</a> should be folded into the McLean County clerk’s office. According to <em>The Pantagraph</em>, consolidating elections is broadly popular among local officials as a way to save money and reduce voter confusion, and the ballot question could end a long standoff between those who want to dissolve the BEC and those who favor moving all elections to a countywide election commission. The signatures were submitted by the Republican and Libertarian parties. County Democrats do not support the consolidation.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The Santa Fe city council has approved a charter amendment ballot question that would ask city resident whether to <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/ballot-question-to-change-city-election-dates-gets-council-ok/article_285cb56b-ad20-54d6-ae84-0b036d17daf6.html">move the city’s elections</a> from the spring to the fall.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> In a court filing this week, Attorney General Curtis Hill said an agreement that Common Cause Indiana and the Indianapolis NAACP reached with Marion County over the location of <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/08/indiana-attorney-general-curtis-hill-assailed-over-opposition-voting-sites-agreement/937167002/">early voting sites</a> is contrary to Indiana law and the public interest. Secretary of State Connie Lawson has come out in opposition to Hill’s filing.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The Iowa Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on August 9 on whether a lower court acted properly in blocking provisions of the state’s <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2018/08/02/iowa-voter-id-law-supreme-court-decide-if-judge-properly-blocked-early-voting-restrictions-paul-pate/888736002/">voter ID</a> law.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ruled that elections officials in Cumberland, Moore and Beaufort counties <a href="https://www.wral.com/judge-orders-nc-to-comply-with-federal-law-on-purging-voters/17756090/">may not purge their voter rolls</a> before the 2018 general election. Biggs also ordered the state board to ensure that all 100 county BOEs must comply with the National Voter Registration Act.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The state Supreme Court has ordered a <a href="https://www.wday.com/node/4481082">recount in the race for secretary of state</a>. Libertarian candidate Roland Riemers requested a recount after he fell 53 votes short of making the November ballot. Secretary of State Al Jaeger denied the recount, but the state’s high court said Riemers is entitled to an automatic recount under the “plain language of state law.”</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> In a court filing this week, opponents of Texas’ <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/08/08/plaintiffs-say-texas-voter-id-fight-over/">voter ID law</a> told U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos that the case is settled and they would not pursue any other remedies or changes to the law that was first challenged in 2011. According to the <em>Texas Tribune</em>, because neither party in the case asked for rehearing or attempted to kick it up to U.S. Supreme Court, “the substantive merits and remedy phases of this long-standing case are over.”</p>

<p><strong>Cybersecurity News</strong>: The Information Technology-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (IT-ISAC) and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council (EI SCC) announce the launch of the Elections Industry Special InterestGroup (EI-SIG), a new cybersecurity information-sharing group for election industry providers to guard their networks and assets against threats. EI-SIG members will include members of organizations that provide voting tabulation, election management, voter registration, electronic pollbook and results reporting technologies that support U.S. election officials in administering the voting process. “The goal of the EI-SIG – or ‘the SIG’– is to scale up the sharing that’s happening through our companies within the private sector to develop a ‘Super-ISAC’ capability,” noted Kay Stimson, Chair of the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council and Vice President of Government Affairs for Dominion Voting Systems. “This proactive move will help industry understand broader threats to election IT systems and engage in peer-to-peer learning across sectors.”</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Advocates expressed concerns that the <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-elections-web-update-irks-voter-registration-advocates/r36RcplDrV8eibATwiYLIN/">state’s elections website was offline</a> over the weekend for maintenance. According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, Secretary of State Brian Kemp’s office said the maintenance of the online sites was long-scheduled and that local elections officials were notified in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokeswoman with the office, Candice Broce, said those platforms needed “routine maintenance” to keep them up to date. “We sent out a notice on Friday morning to all 159 counties at 9 a.m.,” she said, adding they were back online by early Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen have asked a U.S. Treasury Department committee to determine whether or not Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin’s financial involvement a state election software contractor, poses a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-senators-letter-russian-20180806-story.html">national security threat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir is finally getting a <a href="http://www.kut.org/post/travis-county-voters-are-getting-voting-machines-paper-trail">new voting system</a>. Although it will not be exactly the STAR-Vote system that she worked with voting and cyber experts to develop, it will provide most of the bells and whistles she was looking for. “We think STAR-Vote had a lot to do with moving this market to a place where [a] paper trail was certified,” she said during Tuesday&#8217;s meeting. “We think we helped influence the market there.” The new paper-trail system will be provided by ES&amp;S. The county has approved $9.7 million for the purchase and implementation of the new system.</p>
