							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contra Costa Elections emphasizes voter accessibly for all</strong><br /><em>APPLE: Accessible Polling Place Locations and Equipment</em></p>
<p>By Paul Burgarino, community education and engagement specialist<br />Contra Costa County Clerk-Recorder-Elections Department</p>
<p>The Contra Costa County Elections staff has always worked to make sure polling places are accessible, but this year they’ve taken that commitment to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After reviewing different ways to help poll workers understand the importance of creating an accessible polling place, the elections division created a class dedicated that highlights every aspect of accessibility in the polling place.</p>
<p>The Elections Division call this class APPLE, which stands for Accessible Polling Place Locations and Equipment. Topics covered during the class include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How our office surveys sites for compliance with federal accessibility standards;</li>
<li>Using items such as ramps and signs to make polling places accessible;</li>
<li>Creating a welcoming environment for all voters;</li>
<li>Setting up and using a ballot marking device with accessible features;</li>
<li>Identifying potential accessibility issues in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="wf_caption" style="max-width: 468px; margin: 5px; float: left; display: inherit;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CC1.jpg" alt="CC1" width="468" height="351" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin: auto;" /><span style="max-width: 468px; display: block; font-size: 10pt;">Chris Juell teaching an APPLE class in February at the <br />Contra Costa Elections office in Martinez.</span></span>“We saw a bit of a disconnect between the efforts we put in to ensure polling places are accessible and how we share its importance with our poll workers,” Assistant Registrar Scott Konopasek said. “By having a class dedicated just to voter accessibility, our poll workers can see the valuable role they play in ensuring all residents can vote comfortably.”</p>
<p>The APPLE class curriculum includes real examples of inaccessible polling places, and guides poll workers on how to identify accessibility issues and how to use the ballot marking device.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of ‘Ah ha’ moments, where people see that a lot of people may have common challenges they never thought about. It’s a real eye opener,” said Camille Cain, one of the Elections Division staff members who developed and teaches the course.</p>
<p>Adds fellow instructor Chris Juell: “Accessibility is not just for the people who need it, it’s for everybody.”</p>
<p>The APPLE classes were fairly inexpensive. Contra Costa Elections officials say that in addition to the staff time to prepare the class curriculum, the hard costs included renting a couple of training venues throughout the county at a cost of less than $2,000 and just over $5,000 for some special pins to present attendees of the class.</p>
<p>Attendance of the APPLE class is voluntary. Since the class launched in January, 599 poll workers have taken the course. That’s roughly a third of the county’s Election Day volunteers.</p>
<p>Poll workers lauded the new class, saying it has opened their eyes to the importance of identifying barriers and mitigating them to create accessibility.</p>
<p>“It gave me all of the insight and a different thought process about how we can make voting more accessible for all people,” said Mohsin Ali of San Ramon. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CC2.jpg" alt="CC2" width="154" height="175" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px solid #000000; float: right;" /></p>
<p>Ali, a poll worker who volunteers at the polling location at the San Ramon Senior Center, says the class gave him a different perspective and will make him more cognizant of items such as sign placement, door pressure and other voter needs.</p>
<p>“The class doesn’t just focus on one class of people, but how we can make all voters comfortable,” Ali said.</p>
<p>Bonita Brewer, who volunteered as a poll worker for the first time in November 2016 at the Pleasant Hill Hope Center, said she appreciated hearing the detailed information about all the measures the Elections Office take to ensure access to the ballot; not just addressing physical disabilities, but also language barriers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="wf_caption" style="max-width: 462px; margin: 5px; float: left; display: inherit;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CC4.jpg" alt="CC4" width="462" height="269" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin: auto;" /><span style="max-width: 462px; display: block; font-size: 10pt;">A photo of the tools used by our surveying team to measure sidewalk slope, door pressure and other accessibility issues.</span></span>“The class helped me understand why it’s important that doors are kept open and things like that. Before the class, I wouldn’t have thought about what if a kid walks by and shuts the door,” Brewer, a Martinez resident, said. “In June, I know I’m going to be more aware of the polling place environment.”</p>
<p>The Elections Division’s goal is to have at least two poll workers at each of the county’s 278 polling places attend the APPLE class before the June 5th election.</p>

														<p><strong>II. Correction</strong></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2018/2433-electionlineweekly-march-1-2018">article last week about postal updates</a>, one of the paragraphs should have read: Although the use of voter-level ballot tracking is on the rise, it is made available to only a fraction of voters. A ballot STID can be used on virtually every ballot being mailed. It is an improved, data version of the Official Election Material Mail logo. This will benefit the tens of millions of voters who vote by mail.</p></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, nominated to lead both NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, was asked at his confirmation hearing whether he agreed with outgoing NSA Director Adm.&nbsp;Michael Rogers’s&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/375784-nsa-director-says-he-hasnt-receive-orders-from-trump-to-disrupt-russian">statement</a> that the response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election has not been strong enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It has <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/376242-trump-nsa-pick-says-response-to-russian-election-interference-has-fallen">not changed their behavior</a>,” Nakasone told Sen. <a href="http://thehill.com/people/benjamin-ben-sasse">Ben Sasse</a> (R-Neb.), who asked the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the same hearing, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said it was time to “<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-respond-russian-interference-top-dem-warns/story?id=53452260">spell out a deterrence doctrine</a>.” “We may need to make clear to Russia,” Warmer warned in a speech, saying “If you go about using cyber warfare and disinformation against us, we’re going to call you out and we’re going to punch back.”</p>
<p>Following a report in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> last month that says voting machine vendor ES&amp;S had advised officials to install <a href="https://gizmodo.com/senator-wyden-questions-top-voting-machine-manufacturer-1823558022">remote-access software</a>, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) has sent the manufacturer a series of questions and has asked them to respond by March 30.</p>
<p>“The American public has been repeatedly assured that voting machines are not connected to the internet, and thus, cannot be remotely compromised by hackers,” Wyden, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote in a letter to ES&amp;S according to <em>Gizmodo</em>.</p>
<p>Wyden’s office told Gizmodo he had questioned ES&amp;S and other voting machine manufacturers last year about their cybersecurity practices. “ES&amp;S did not answer <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ES&amp;S%20Voting%20machine%20company%20response.pdf" target="_blank">Wyden’s questions</a> about whether the company follows basic cybersecurity best practices,” it said.</p>
<p>In another letter, Senators Amy Klobuchar (DFL-Minnesota) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire) have asked voting equipment vendors whether they have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cyber-russia/senators-ask-vote-machine-vendors-about-russian-access-to-source-code-idUSKCN1GJ2S5">allowed Russian entities to scrutinize their software</a>. According to <em>Reuters</em>, the senators requested that the three largest election equipment vendors &#8211; Election Systems &amp; Software, Dominion Voting Systems and Hart Intercivic &#8211; answer whether they have shared source code, or inner workings, or other sensitive data about their technology with any Russian entity.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em>, Sens. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) and Kamala Harris (D-California) were forced to table an amendment to a bill moving through the Senate that was aimed at <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/377313-push-to-bolster-election-security-stalls-in-senate">improving information-sharing</a> between federal and state election officials on election cyber threats. Elections officials several states had objected to the amendment.</p></p>

														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>According to WRAL, 25 of North Carolina’s 100 counties have</strong> <a href="http://www.wral.com/dozens-of-local-elections-boards-paralyzed-weeks-before-primaries/17400185/">no functioning elections board</a> to settle questions of polling locations and early voting hours with just two months to go until the primary. Each of those county boards only have two members, although a court ruling allowed them to function with just two. However, that court ruling has expired and there is still no way for new members to be appointed. &#8220;The ruling on Monday nullified that Supreme Court order, so those two-member boards can no longer act,&#8221; Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement told WRAL. Gannon said most county boards approved their early voting plans before the ruling. Early voting starts April 19, and absentee ballots start getting mailed out March 19. Wake County Elections Director Gary Sims told the station this still causing problems. &#8220;Sometimes we&#8217;ll have construction at a polling place or have to move for one reason or another, and that&#8217;s important that we do make those changes if they&#8217;re necessary. That does require a board to take action on that,&#8221; Sims told the station.</p>
<p><strong>Safety first! Safety has been the topic of several news stories this week</strong>. On <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/police-schools-polling-places-1.17156064">Long Island</a>, Suffolk police are considering a request to enhance patrols at polling places that are in schools. Acting Police Commissioner Stuart Cameron told Newsday that police are considering plans for “enhanced police presence” at about 21 school polling places. “I’m pretty confident that when people go to vote . . . they’ll see an enhanced police presence,” Cameron told the paper. “It will look somewhat different than it has in the past.” In <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/elmbrook-considering-risks-of-polling-places-to-students-safety">Brookfield, Wisconsin</a>, the local school district is considering how to handle polling places in schools after parents expressed concerns. The school district is working with local elections officials to discuss possible school holidays or creating a vote center at new convention center. In <a href="https://www.thebraziltimes.com/story/2489748.html">Clay County, Indiana</a>, elections officials discussed potential gun violence at the county’s vote centers. Indiana law does not prohibit guns in polling places and the county elections board discussed, what, if anything they could do regulate it. And in the <a href="http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/03/07/school-polling-location-safety-concerns/">Monroeville</a> area of Pennsylvania, some parents have expressed concern about schools being used a polling places for an upcoming special elections.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner and his staff recently</strong> out to <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/theet/news/voter-fraud-tampering-misinformation-prompts-secretary-of-state-to-demo/article_6860b960-c3b8-5a56-86e3-0ba4af883ca2.html">put an end to misinformation about voter fraud and voting system tampering</a>. Warner and staff staged a demonstration in the governor’s Cabinet and Conference Room at the Capitol using current voting equipment and technologies. “The system is safe here in West Virginia, and we are after security from day one,” Warner told <em>The Exponent Telegram.</em> Warner said he is concerned about the media being susceptible to manipulation more than the state’s voting system. “If somebody were to hack CNN or Fox and put out false information and appearing to be one of legitimate sources, that can affect a lot more people than you do changing one or two votes.”</p>
<p><strong>Although people have been voting almost since January 1 in a variety of elections</strong>, Tuesday marked the first big mid-term election when voters in the Lone Star state went to the polls. Overall things went well with early voting numbers outpacing expectations. There were a few issues though. Several polling places in Houston <a href="http://abc13.com/politics/booths-fixed-after-problems-reported-at-n-houston-voting-site/3181271/">opened late</a> with voters waiting in line to vote due to the late start. The issues faced in Harris County has advocates calling for the county to move to <a href="http://cw39.com/2018/03/07/calls-for-a-change-in-harris-county-after-problems-surface-on-election-day/">vote centers</a> like many other Texas counties have. Some voters in San Antonio faced confusion because their polling places had been <a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/houston-texas/article/Confusing-on-East-End-about-voting-sites-12732192.php">relocated</a>. Although voting went smoothly, some voters in Travis County were waiting about <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/local/2018-primaries-kick-off-smoothly-central-texas-election-officials-say/k4y8PhLmTrOGNjo7ebwPwL/">20 minutes</a> to cast ballots. A missing ballot box, which turned out not to be missing after all, slowed down <a href="https://tylerpaper.com/news/local/smith-county-slow-to-post-election-returns/article_b5803aa6-21ba-11e8-8d5e-a718b842b0a8.html">vote counting</a> in Smith County.</p>
<p><strong>While momentum is gaining to restore <a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/florida/florida-puts-voting-right-requests-on-hold-due-to-lawsuit/711834780">voting rights to many ex-felons</a> in Florida</strong>, currently Gov. Rick Scott (R) and the three other officials who determine whether or not an ex-felon may have their rights restored are putting any restoration decisions on hold following a judge’s ruling in February that the state’s system of restoring felon voting rights is unconstitutional. There are currently 62 ex-felons who have requested to have their voting rights restored.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming Governor Matt Mead has appointed Ed Buchanan to serve as <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/mead-picks-buchanan-for-wyoming-secretary-of-state/article_c147e042-1dae-11e8-b553-0be4face1207.html">secretary of state</a>.</strong> Buchanan will complete the remainder of Ed Murray’s term after Murray was forced to resign. Buchanan has announced that he will run for the Republican nomination for the office. Buchanan ran for secretary of state in 2014 narrowly losing to Murray in the primary. Buchanan is a former prosecutor and state legislator.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> The House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee has approved a constitutional amendment that would <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2018/03/07/house-committee-approves-amendment-ending-some-special-elections/403008002/">end special elections</a> for legislative vacancies that take place 13 months before the next statewide general election.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Lawmakers are considering a bill that would give the state the authority to tell local governments <a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/local/arizona-lawmakers-again-seek-right-to-oversee-local-election-scheduling/article_c4eb4649-9353-549e-bd47-600cf58af8a4.html">when they can and can’t hold local elections</a>. Lawmakers passed similar legislation in 2012 but the state Court of Appeals overturned the law.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Two bills approved by the Senate failed to pass the House by this week’s deadline for acting on Senate measures. Senate Bill 250 would have authorized <a href="http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/indiana-election-reforms-approved-by-senate-die-in-house/article_fc9b7701-40ca-5cb2-b943-f4080d312e84.html">no-excuse absentee voting</a> and Senate Bill 326 would have established standards for legislative redistricting.</p>
<p>Also in Indiana, the Senate has approved a plan to break the deadlock on <a href="http://kokomoperspective.com/politics/indiana/indiana-senate-approves-plan-to-break-deadlock-on-lake-election/article_abe7eca6-06ce-50af-80b1-07bf42a198af.html">precinct consolidation</a> in Lake County.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> Chris Gallus, an attorney from Helena has submitted language for a ballot initiative that would change the state’s constitution to explicitly <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/montana/articles/2018-03-02/proposed-ballot-measure-seeks-to-bar-noncitizens-from-voting">ban non-citizens from voting</a> in elections. If Gallus&#8217; proposal passes a legal review, he will have to gather the signatures of 10 percent of voters spread over 40 legislative districts — 50,936 signatures total — for the measure to be placed on the ballot in November&#8217;s election.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Gov. Susana Martinez has signed a bill into law that will <a href="http://nmpolitics.net/index/2018/03/governor-oks-consolidating-most-local-elections/">merge most nonpartisan local elections</a> into one. “Consolidating nonpartisan local elections reduces confusion and election fatigue for voters and will lead to increased voter participation in local elections,” said Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. “In addition, fewer elections will help the state, county and municipal governments cut election administration costs and provide more streamlined election services for voters.”</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Sen. Frank LaRose has introduced a proposal that would allocate about $114.5 million to counties statewide to help them offset the costs of <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/03/1145_million_proposed_for_new.html">replace aging voting machines</a>. LaRose is a Republican candidate for secretary of state.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Secretary of State Shantel Krebs announced last week that backers of a ballot initiative that would move the state to a <a href="http://www.argus-press.com/news/state_news/article_64802917-1ee4-557b-b799-d3af10dfbf3c.html">top-two primary system</a> did not gather enough valid signatures to get the measure on the ballot this year.</p>
<p>Also in South Dakota, the Senate has approve a bill that would require <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota/articles/2018-03-06/senate-passes-new-rules-for-initiative-petition-circulators">ballot measure organizers</a> have their circulators proved residency information to the secretary of state’s office including driver’s license number, length of time at current address and past two addresses and their state of voter registration.</p></p>

														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> According to Alabama Public Radio, more civil rights groups are challenging a lower court ruling that found that the state’s voter ID law is not discriminatory. The ACLU of Alabama, ACLU Voting Rights Project, Lawyers&#8217; Committee and Campaign Legal Centerhave submitted a brief in support.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> San Francisco Superior Court Judge Richard Ulmer Jr. has agreed with the ACLU of Northern California that voters who submit a mail ballot should be provided time to cure their ballot <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article203746944.html">if the signature on the envelope does not match that on file</a>.
