							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaking a common language</strong><br /><em>How common data format helps elections officials</em></p>
<p>By Katy Owens Hubler<br /><a href="http://www.democracyresearch.com/">Democracy Research, LLC</a></p>
<p>If you’ve been to national election conferences in the last several years you’ve likely heard the term “common data format” or CDF. What is a common data format and why is it important for elections?</p>
<p><strong>What is a common data format?<br /></strong>In this day and age, data is king (or queen). As with everything else, elections administration has become more data heavy and more device heavy.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way. Think back to the analog age of giant cumbersome lever voting machines when there was just one “voting machine.” It was mechanical, not electronic, and wasn’t attached to any other machines that helped it serve its purpose. It allowed electors to cast their vote, and it tabulated the votes without the need to “talk” to anything else.</p>
<p>Now, election systems are much more than a big bulky lever machine. There is a web of different software and hardware systems that need to interact with each other in some way. Data is at the core of all of these systems, from the databases that are used to maintain voter lists, to electronic poll books used to check voters in, to devices used to tabulated votes, to election night reporting systems that display results.</p>
<p>Sometimes these systems can reflect a United Nations without a translation service. Different devices made by different manufacturers and for different purposes all speak different languages. It can take quite a bit of work to translate the data coming out of one device into a language that can be imported into another device. This could mean that software is needed to reformat the file in the middle, or even that individuals are “keying-in” data from one data set into another manually.</p>
<p>A common data format (CDF) allows each of these systems to “speak the same language.” Having data in the same format across all systems allows for more streamlined exports and imports from one system to another. A CDF advances the goal of interoperable election systems – systems that work together seamlessly no matter who the manufacturer is.</p>
<p><strong>What are some advantages of a CDF?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased efficiency. If different systems “talk,” then officials don’t need to re-key the same data across different databases, which often introduces errors. Common formats streamline imports and exports between different systems.</li>
<li>More flexibility. Eventually common formats will allow for easier integration of new components, components from different vendors, and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Election officials would have more choices in what is available for purchase, which in the long run could save money.</li>
<li>Enhanced security through transparency. If data is available in a common format, rather than a proprietary format, it increases transparency and makes the data easier to analyze for a greater number of citizens and groups. More eyes on the data makes it easier to test for accuracy and determine whether the data has been changed once it’s been exported.</li>
<li>Easier to test. Devices that use a CDF will be easier to test, potentially speeding up the testing and certification process.</li>
<li>Integration with other data. Once data is in a common format, it’s also simpler to provide data for other needs, such as the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s <a href="https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/election-administration-voting-survey/">Election Administration and Voting Survey</a> (EAVS), the <a href="https://votinginfoproject.org/">Voting Information Project</a> (VIP) and other requests from the media, legislators, campaigns, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If election data is easier to consume, more organizations want to use it and present it in cool ways – everyone from Google to MTV can create maps and graphics for presenting voter information and election results.</p>
<p><strong>What is available now and how can I use it?</strong><br />CDFs for various aspects of the election process are being developed by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), in collaboration with the EAC and with the help of public working groups.</p>
<p>The working groups consist of state and local election officials and their staff, voting equipment manufacturers, and election experts from all over the country. Anyone can get involved – see NIST’S <a href="http://collaborate.nist.gov/voting/bin/view/Voting/Interoperability">Interoperability Public Working Group page</a>&nbsp;for information and for joining.</p>
<p>The Election Results Reporting specification (see <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/ElectionResultsReporting">NIST SP 1500-100 Version 1.0</a>) is the most developed of the CDF work. If you are a state or local election official who has been frustrated by the process of compiling and reporting results with candidates and the media breathing down your neck, this is something you may want to review.</p>
<p>Without a CDF, local jurisdictions have to export results from their systems, translate it in some way (using software or perhaps manually) or even type in result information by hand. Having a CDF allows result information to be automatically downloaded from local jurisdictions and uploaded into the statewide reporting system. It reduces errors from manual entry, which means that candidates, the media and the public get to see results faster and in a more uniform way.</p>
<p>A CDF also permits states and jurisdictions to form partnerships with other organizations. Using the NIST SP 1500-100 specification permitted the <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/">Virginia Department of Elections</a> to work with Google to present results of the 2017 general election (which included a high profile gubernatorial race). Virginia published result information in the 1500-100 format, which allowed Google to directly consume the data and display results on their search page.</p>
<p>One advantage that Virginia saw in forming this partnership was the amount of web traffic absorbed by Google, reducing direct web hits on the Department of Elections page. Reducing the traffic load on the state’s site can save money on web hosting, and also decrease the risk of the website failing on election night.</p>
<p>Matthew Davis, the Virginia Department of Elections Chief Information Officer, notes that on election night, “The more places you can have official access to the data, the better.”</p>
<p>Official data is getting out to a larger audience, and is available through other sources in case of a server outage at the state election office.</p>
<p>Virginia also discovered an unexpected benefit of making changes to their internal data infrastructure to accommodate 1500-100 – it was also compatible with <a href="https://votinginfoproject.org/">the Voting Information Project (VIP)</a> specification, permitting the state to implement VIP feeds much more quickly.</p>
<p>VIP works with 46 states and the District of Columbia, thus many are already aware of the advantages of the partnering with the project to provide official information to voters, such as what is on their ballots and where to vote.</p>
<p>Maria Bianchi, the VIP Project Manager at <a href="https://democracy.works/">Democracy Works</a> summarized the advantage for states in using the specification: &#8220;VIP data comes directly from the states, so the information is up-to-date and accurate. Technology companies and civic engagement groups are then able to innovate and build effective voter outreach campaigns around the official data that the states provide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CDF for election results reporting was the first to be completed and is therefore the most used at the moment, but there are other ways that states can use the CDFs still in development. For example, states looking to replace aging voter registration databases can consider adding language about CDFs into the development of requirements for the new system, a request for proposals (RFP), or when contracting with a new vendor. <a href="https://collaborate.nist.gov/voting/bin/view/Voting/OnlineVoterRegistration">The Voter Records Interchange (VRI)</a> CDF is near completion and deals with data interchange from online voter registration systems, voter registration systems, third-party systems, and motor vehicle agencies.</p>
<p>The VRI CDF also has potential to help election officials consume and integrate data from the department of motor vehicles and other registration agencies more easily. This can be helpful for any state, but especially so for those looking at a more automated voter registration system and list maintenance procedures.</p>
<p>The next version of the EAC’s <a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines/">Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</a> (VVSG) will require the common data format. Election officials can help with feedback on these draft requirements and start requiring CDFs in new election products to get ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>To make sure each CDF is developed accurately and reflects the real-life experience of election offices, we need jurisdictions that are willing to try them out and give feedback. If your state is looking at implementing an updated voter registration database, for example, or if you’re looking to get proposals for new election system components, get in touch about how you might be able to use the CDF work.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>This week, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/20/senate-russia-probe-election-security-425941">Senate Intelligence Committee</a> released their long-awaited recommendations on securing the nation’s elections. The bipartisan committee, which concluded that Russia did interfere in the 2016 election recommended establishing a voluntary state election security grant program.</p>
<p>“While our investigation is still ongoing, one conclusion is clear,&#8221; Maine Sen. Susan Collins (R), said at a press conference: &#8220;The Russians were relentless in attempting to meddle in the 2016 elections,” and will continue trying to undermine Western democracies.</p>
<p>According to <em>Politico</em>, the election security recommendations steer clear of specific mandates, instead largely emphasizing overarching approaches or priorities.</p>
<p>The day after the release of the recommendations, the Committee held a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-election-security-russia-20180321-story.html">public hearing</a> where they heard from the Department of Homeland Security as well as <a href="http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/vermont-secretary-of-state-addresses-senate-intelligence-committee/1067175149">state elections officials</a>.</p>
<p>Also this week, a funding spending bill was unveiled that includes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fiscal-congress-cyber/u-s-spending-bill-to-provide-380-million-for-election-cyber-security-idUSKBN1GX2LC">$380 million to help safeguard elections</a>. According to <em>Reuters</em>, the funding would provide states with grants to help them purchase more secure voting machines, conduct post-election audits and improve election cyber security training.</p></p>

<p><strong>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) has </strong><a href="http://www.wral.com/cooper-names-8-to-new-board-of-elections/17422154/"><strong>finally appointed members</strong> to the state’s board of elections</a> following a protracted legal battle. Cooper appointed four Republicans and four Democrats. A <a href="http://www.wral.com/division-intrigue-then-acceptance-as-new-state-board-of-elections-holds-first-meeting/17432274/">ninth</a> member of the board, from neither party, was nominated by the eight members with Cooper having the ultimate say. Several local elections officials have been appointed to the board including Stacy “Four” Eggers IV from Watauga County, Ken Raymond from Forsyth County, Stella Anderson, also from Watauga County and Joshua Dale Malcolm, a former member of the state elections board. The newly constituted board held its first meeting this week.</p>
<p><strong>Voters went to the polls in Illinois on Tuesday</strong> and while there were some problems with delayed results in <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Voting-Machine-Issue-in-DuPage-County-Snarls-Illinois-Primary-Vote-Count-477468203.html">DuPage County</a> and with an assessors race in <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/03/20/cook-county-asssessor-election-ballot/">Chicago</a>, the big election administration news of the day was in the city of Aurora where voters decided to dismantle the <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180320/voters-decide-to-dismantle-aurora-election-commission">Aurora Election Commission</a>. The Kane County clerk will now oversee elections in the city. Voters in DuPage County also let it be known that they would like to see the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/news/ct-nvs-dupage-election-commission-refer-st-0321-20180320-story.html">DuPage County Election Commission</a> become a part of the county clerk’s office. The vote was only advisory, it will now be up to the state Legislature to ultimately decide.</p>
<p><strong>Last week we reported that town elections in New Hampshire carried on</strong> even this a nor’easter baring down on the Granite State, however, we’ve learned that one town, Washington, <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/nh-town-facing-consequences-after-defying-state-order-not-delay-election-snow#stream/0">decided not to hold their election</a> and now they are in a spot of trouble with state officials. After reviewing the forecast and speaking to selectmen, Moderator Barbara Gaskell decided to defy the state and postpone the election. She had planned to hold a rescheduled election on the 13th or 17th, but the state attorney general stepped in and said the election must be held April 3 and be under the scrutiny of a state-appointed election monitor. “I seriously feel like I’m being bullied at this point,” Gaskell told New Hampshire Public Radio. “I feel like their remedy of moving it further another three weeks is just ridiculous and over the top. It feels like they’re punishing us for standing up to the Secretary of State.”</p>
<p><strong>The Vigo County, Indiana school board is considering </strong><a href="http://www.tribstar.com/news/local_news/school-board-to-check-possibility-of-busing-students-to-voting/article_80f1a2cc-e6d8-5c3b-b930-2c921e69560a.html"><strong>busing students </strong>to early voting centers</a>. Under the proposal, students who are registered to vote would be bused to area voting centers on one day of early voting. “I think it would be a good statement that the school corporation certainly encourages students to vote — everybody to vote,” Board President Jackie Lower said during a meeting, according to The Tribune-Star.</p>
<p><strong>This week, Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R) signed legislation into law that will rename </strong>a portion of Highway 28 the <a href="https://buckrail.com/secretary-of-state-applauds-womens-suffrage-highway-bill/">“Wyoming Women’s Suffrage Pathway.”</a> “The passage of this bill and its signing by Governor Mead will do a great deal to highlight a shining period in Wyoming’s history nearly 150 years ago when the Territory of Wyoming became the first government in the world to advance Women’s Suffrage,” Secretary of State Ed Buchanan said. A 19-mile stretch of road from the Fremont County line northeast to the boundary of the Shoshone National Forest will commemorate Wyoming’s 150 years of women’s suffrage.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The Government Administration and Elections Committee recently heard testimony on HB 5418 which would restore the voting rights to thousands of residents. Under the bill, those in jail, but not yet convicted and those on parole would have their <a href="http://www.publicnewsservice.org/2018-03-15/criminal-justice/bill-would-restore-voting-rights-to-parolees-pre-trial-detainees/a61834-1">voting rights restored</a>. Currently that would affect about 7,000 voters.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed 30 bills into law this week including one that will make Florida the 24th state, plus the District of Columbia to be a member of <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/state/florida-governor-signs-30-bills-into-law">ERIC</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> A bill that would create <a href="https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/bill-shorten-atlanta-voting-hours-and-curtail-sunday-voting-passes-committee/seqRoqhMT3y2p49BAcAt2L/">uniform voting hours statewide</a>—shortening Atlanta’s polling place hours by an hour has been approved by the House Governmental Affairs Committee. The bill also curtails Sunday early voting.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> By a 32-12 vote, the Senate has approved a bill that would create an <a href="https://wtop.com/local/2018/03/automatic-voter-registration-bill-clears-maryland-senate/">automatic voter registration system</a> for those eligible. The bill requires the Motor Vehicle Administration, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, local departments of social services and the Mobility Certification Office of the Maryland Transit Administration to register or update an existing voters info unless the voter opts out.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> By a 35-1 vote, the Senate has approved a bill that would allow residents with a state driver’s license or state ID cards to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/2018/03/15/online-voter-registration-gets-overwhelming-support-state-senate/428177002/">register online</a> to vote.</p>
<p>By a 62-44 vote, members of the House have approved a bill that would allow voters without a driver’s license or state ID to use a limited number of <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/03/15/michigan-approves-alternative-voter/32979213/">alternative IDs to cast a ballot</a>. The IDs include a US passport, a military photo ID or a student ID.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The House has rejected a proposal that would have required the secretary of state to work with the Department of Motor Vehicles to create an <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/nh-house-rejects-online-voter-registration#stream/0">online voter registration</a> system. According to New Hampshire Public Radio, critics argued that implementing online voter registration would carry too many security risks.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: A petition submitted to put a ballot measure that would allow voters to decide whether or not the state should move to a <a href="http://kelo.com/news/articles/2018/mar/18/not-enough-signatures-for-vote-by-mail-measure/">vote-by-mail system</a> did not have enough valid signatures to get the initiative on the ballot. According to KELO an initiated measure needs 13,871 valid signatures in order to be placed on the ballot. The initiated measure petition submitted 15,718 signatures, only 10,955 were found to be valid after random sampling.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Gov. Jay Inslee (D) has signed several pieces of <a href="http://kuow.org/post/inslee-signs-voting-rights-act-other-voting-bills-law">elections-related legislation</a> into law including a bill to create a Washington Voting Rights Act as well as a bill that will allow 16-and 17-year-olds to pre-register, a bill that allows for same day registration and a bill creating a system of automatic voter registration.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Olivia Pearson has been found <a href="https://www.myajc.com/blog/investigations/jury-quickly-says-not-guilty-georgia-elections-case/uxbnZO4AUxmBQfTmVGZjXK/">not guilty of voter fraud</a> stemming from the 2012 election. According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, During early voting in Coffee County, a first-time voter was not sure how to use the voting machine. Pearson, who was at the polls, showed her how the machine worked and signed a form as part of the process. That action led to a three-year investigation by the Georgia State Election Board and the felony charges pursued by the local prosecutor. Her first trial ended in a hung jury, but the second jury took only 20 minutes to come to the not guilty verdict. “I knew I had done nothing wrong, with these charges they had come up with. . .,” Pearson told the AJC. “I just couldn’t take a plea like the other three did who were indicted. I just couldn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kansas-voterid/judge-says-no-decision-for-at-least-a-month-in-kansas-voter-id-case-idUSKBN1GW07B">proof-of-citizenship</a> voter registration trial came to an end this week with closing arguments on Monday. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson said she would not render a decision for at least a month.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> A federal judge heard arguments last week in a suit to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/michigan/articles/2018-03-15/judge-is-asked-to-move-up-special-election-for-conyers-seat">move up the special election</a> to replace U.S. Rep. John Conyers. According to <em>The Associated Pres</em>s, state attorneys said it would be very difficult, but not impossible to move up the election. Gov. Rick Snyder set a primary election for Aug. 7, the date for primary elections statewide, followed by a special election on Nov. 6. The suit seeks to create a spring primary with the general election falling on the August primary date.</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, according to <em>The Detroit News</em>, St. Clair County Circuit Judge Daniel J. Kelly isn’t expected to decide for at least two weeks whether <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/macomb-county/2018/03/19/karen-spranger-residency-lawsuit-macomb-county/33097621/">Macomb Co. Clerk</a> Karen Spranger falsified her address to run for office.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the state over town moderator’s ability to reject absentee ballots if they have doubts about the signature without notifying the voter. According to the <em>Concord Monitor</em>, at issue is state law <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXIII/659/659-50.htm">RSA 659:50</a>, which allows moderators to reject absentee ballots if they don’t believe “the signature on the affidavit appears to be executed by the same person who signed the application” for voting by absentee ballot, “unless the voter received assistance because the voter is blind or has a disability.” In a brief filed in U.S. District Court in Concord, the ACLU says that during the 2016, 2014, and 2012 elections, this law “disenfranchised approximately 275, 145, and 350 voters, respectively.”</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The state has filed a motion in US District Court seeking to speed up the review of the state’s <a href="https://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/government-and-politics/4418064-election-nearing-state-nd-asks-quick-review-voter-id-case">voter ID law</a>. Deputy Solicitor General James Nicolai wrote that &#8220;timely resolution of the pending motions brought by both sides is necessary for proper planning by election officials.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Last week Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman ruled that the special election to replace the mayor of Nashville should be held in August as the Davidson County election commission had ordered.

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The Legislature has denied Gov. Rick Scott’s (R) request for <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/03/21/despite-attempted-election-hack-legislature-did-not-fund-cyber-security-unit/">five cyber security experts</a> to work with county elections officials. Instead, according to the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, Florida will sign one-year contracts with all 67 county supervisors of elections to improve network monitoring of county voting systems, not the statewide database that keeps track of 13 millionFlorida voters.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The legislative auditor’s office has released an audit of the state’s voting system recommending that the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/voter-registration-system-under-auditor-s-microscope/477073383/">state upgrade its aging computerized voter registration system</a>. According to the <em>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</em>, it would take $1.4 million over four years to do the work necessary to upgrade the system.</p>
<p><strong>New York:</strong> The City of New York plans to launch a new website in the coming months that will help New Yorkers in an “<a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7550-board-of-elections-to-roll-out-electronically-assisted-voter-registration">electronically assisted way</a>” fill out a voter registration form and an absentee ballot application. According to the <em>Gotham Gazette</em>, the forms will still have to be printed and either mailed or brought to the board of elections. New York State does have online voter registration, but their system is atypical.</p>
