							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Su voto es su voz</strong><br /><em>NALEO and AAJC team up on three “Guides to Language Access”</em></p>
<p>With less than three months until Election Day, voting rights groups are releasing new <a href="http://www.naleo.org/languageaccess">language assistance reports</a> with hopes that election officials, policymakers, and community leaders will be ready to assist voters from different language backgrounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/">Asian Americans Advancing Justice</a> | AAJC, Fair Elections Center and the <a href="http://www.naleo.org/">National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund</a> collaborated on the three “Guides to Language Access”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the United States, more than 62 million people speak a language other than English at home. Of this population, over 40 percent are limited-English proficient. Almost 15 percent of voting-age citizens speak a language other than English at home and of those, almost a third are limited-English proficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because large populations of voters speak another language at home, <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/naleo/pages/1433/attachments/original/1533764841/electionofficial-full-6.pdf">election officials</a> and <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/naleo/pages/1433/attachments/original/1533687336/policymaker-full5.pdf">policymakers</a> could do more to better ensure these Americans are able to vote. <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/naleo/pages/1433/attachments/original/1533687334/community-full-6.pdf">Community organizations</a> also play an important role in helping to meet their communities’ language access needs.</p>
<p>Various sections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) prohibit voting practices and procedures that discriminate against those who speak another language in a minority group and protect the right to assistance for those who need it because of blindness, disability or inability to read or write.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions, based on population and literacy requirements, must provide live voting assistance and any election-related information they make available in English in the covered languages, and officials may always go beyond legal minimum requirements to offer better service to their voters. When properly implemented and effectively provided, language assistance can increase voter participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “Guides to Language Access” clarify these requirements and opportunities to provide assistance and background on the issue, and outline best practices beyond the minimum requirements of the federal law and concrete examples for three audiences: election officials, policymakers, and community leaders. Each audience plays a crucial role in reaching and helping language minority communities participate in our elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Every eligible citizen, regardless of their language background, should have access to the materials they need to understand the voting process so they can make their voice heard,” said Michelle Kanter Cohen, Counsel at Fair Elections Center. “This series of reports offers real tools, solutions and examples for community leaders, policymakers, and election officials to improve the voter experience for citizens who face language barriers. We look forward to using these tools to engage with a variety of different audiences around this important issue.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to NALEO, Latino voters, a significant number of whom are more fluent in Spanish than English, account for 12 percent of the nation’s electorate, and their numbers are rapidly growing.</p>
<p>“The present and future health of our democratic system depends upon our ability to engage Latinos and all Americans, regardless of their language background, to ensure that they are able to vote,” stated Erin Hustings, NALEO Educational Fund legislative counsel. “These guidelines provide quality language assistance, which serves this critical interest and professionalizes election administration in our nation, guaranteeing that our voting process is worthy of our status as the world’s leading democracy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terry Ao Minnis, director of census and voting rights at Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC pointed out that with Asian American being the fastest growing population with a majority speaking a language other than English at home, it’s important they have access to materials that help them exercise their right to vote.</p>
<p>“Voting is a right of all citizens, not a ‘privilege’ earned by speaking English – this series of reports helps to bridge the language access divide, allowing limited-English proficient voters to fully participate in our democracy,” Minnis said. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naleo.org/languageaccess">The reports for each audience and a summary of those reports can be found here.&nbsp;</a></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>On ABC’s “This Week” National Security Advisor John Bolton said that <a href="https://www.abc17news.com/news/politics/bolton-election-meddling-a-sufficient-national-security-concern/783466143">efforts by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea to meddle</a> with U.S. elections are a “sufficient national security concern.” &#8220;I can say definitively that it&#8217;s a sufficient national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling and North Korean meddling that we&#8217;re taking steps to try and prevent it,&#8221; Bolton said</p>
<p>According to multiple reports, <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2018/08/22/election-bill-stalled-senate.aspx">the Secure Elections Act is on thin ice</a>. The Senate Rules Committee markup scheduled for August 22 was postponed with committee staff finding out about the postponement only 90 minutes before the hearing was set to begin.</p>
<p>A committee staffer told <em>FCW</em> on background that provisions of the bill have generated opposition from some state officials including the Vermont Secretary of State, who is currently president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. The staffer said that &#8220;additional majority support&#8221; – more Republican votes – will be needed to advance a &#8220;truly bipartisan bill.&#8221; The staffer said a Senators-only briefing on election security could help convince lawmakers on a united course of action.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, according to <em>The Hill</em>, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen told a group of reporters touring DHS’ National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center that she wants “all state and local election officials to make certain that by the 2020 presidential election, every American votes on a <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/403148-dhs-chief-calls-on-election-officials-in-all-50-states-to-have">verifiable and a auditable ballot</a>.”</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p>III. Primary Updates</p>
<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> Although Anchorage conducted a successful vote-by-mail municipal election earlier this year, it was back to community-based polling places for the statewide primary this week, even in Anchorage. Overall it was a smooth affair although some voters in Anchorage Hillside were forced to vote by flashlight due to <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2018/08/21/nearly-1500-without-power-on-anchorage-hillside/">power outage</a>. With <a href="http://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Questioned-ballots-to-be-counted-after-in-person-votes-491419522.html">more than 19,000 ballots</a> — provisional, absentee by mail/fax/online delivery, early voting, etc.— that won’t be counted on election night the Division of Elections laid out their timeline and process for counting the ballots. Some ballots in rural precincts had to be <a href="http://www.webcenter11.com/content/news/Election-workers-hand-count-ballots-for-primary-election-491518451.html">hand counted</a> which lead to a delay in reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Officials and candidates in towns that hand-count ballots are at odds with the secretary of state’s office because the <a href="https://www.recorder.com/Ballot-confusion-in-Senate-race-revolves-around-write-in-process-19546767">ballots do not provide room for write-ins</a>. One candidate has asked the state to reprint the ballots. The Greenfield Recorder reports that the secretary of state’s office will not reprint the ballots, but that it will provide materials to be used at the polls to explain how to vote for a write-in candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft (R) announced this week that his office would be investigating <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/investigation-recount-coming-in-race-for-seat-in-missouri-house/article_a2f3e388-b84f-55b6-8ed0-d89340022483.html">why a polling place in O’Fallon opened 90 minutes</a> and whether or not that late opening may have changed the results of the August 7 primary. According to the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, races are close enough in both the Republican and Democratic primaries for the House District 102 seat that any candidate could request a recount. So far, the secretary of state’s office has received conflict reports from the county as to why the polling place opened late.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> We didn’t have too much to report out of Washington’s all vote-by-mail primary the week of August 7, but we do have some interesting news this week. It turns out that ballots had to sit in four <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/aug/17/ferry-county-ballots-left-in-drop-boxes-a-week-aft/">Ferry County</a> drop boxes for more than week because election officials did not have the personnel and resources to collect them. According to the <em>Spokesman-Review</em>, state law requires that drop box ballots must be collected by a team of two people. But when Auditor Dianna Galvan had a family emergency while Elections Administrator Liz Stinson was at a training, there was no one able to pick up the 65-or-so ballots. The ballots were eventually picked up and counted.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming:</strong> There were relatively <a href="https://www.news-journal.com/ap/state/the-latest-no-reported-problems-with-wyoming-primary-voting/article_45130838-e926-5b15-a32c-6bb105c6881b.html">few problems</a> throughout the state on primary day. Early voting turnout was high in some counties, but not record-breaking. According to county clerks, 90 percent of the absentee ballots sent out were returned. <a href="https://www.sheridanmedia.com/news/voting-reported-running-well-despite-glitch100429">Sheridan County</a> Clerk Eda Schunk Thompson did report a ballot scanning problem when polls opened, but nothing that affected voters. In <a href="http://www.laramieboomerang.com/news/registration-switches-delay-election-result/article_d018d33e-a5cf-11e8-bd63-5751ad28695b.html">Albany County</a>, where election results were delayed, Clerk Jackie Gonzales told the Laramie Boomerang that thousands of voters switching parties led to a shortage of GOP ballots which lead to the use of copied ballots which then had to be counted by hand. Poll workers in <a href="http://k2radio.com/poll-workers-describe-natrona-county-primary-voting-as-steady/">Natrona County</a> reported “steady” voting and there were no problems as the county’s vote centers. The county will need to conduct <a href="https://trib.com/news/local/casper/recount-needed-for-natrona-county-assessor-commissioner-races/article_7afac769-d5d9-52d9-9b61-8dca075776c5.html">recounts</a> in at least two close races. In the race for secretary of state, Democrat James Byrd will face incumbent Republican Edward Buchanan. Both men were unopposed in their primaries.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The state of Indiana is spending $500,000 to remind people to register to vote</strong> for November and to <a href="http://www.washtimesherald.com/news/new-campaign-to-increase-awareness-of-indiana-voting-security-launched/article_b139e97a-837c-58f1-b9ec-b51b1fb20b55.html">assure the public that the state’s voting system is secure</a>. Secretary of State Connie Lawson’s office is partnering with an Indianapolis marketing firm to create the ad campaign that will run on TV, radio and in print. “In Indiana, the security of our voting system is of the utmost importance. This public awareness campaign demonstrates to voters that proper precautions are in place to secure their vote,” Lawson said in the campaign announcement. “We take great care to prepare our election administrators for each cycle, and in partnership with counties, other states, and the federal government we are developing new answers to security concerns and election policy.” In one of the radio ads released, the state’s election system is equated to a human being and if so, it would be the “healthiest 200-year-old you’ll ever find.”</p>
<p><strong>Harris County, Texas recently <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harris-County-mistakenly-suspends-voter-13175685.php">placed more than 1,700 voters on a suspension list</a> </strong>after officials for the county’s Republican party challenged 4,000 voter registration. According to the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, The suspensions came to light after Bennett’s office mailed letters to the voters whose registrations were challenged, asking them to confirm their addresses. “They were following procedure they believed was the correct procedure, but after they consulted with us, they realized that the correct procedure was to wait 30 days,” Assistant County Attorney Douglas Ray told the paper. Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Ann HarrisBennett blamed the mistake on a software glitch. She said her office discovered the error after three or four days, and immediately fixed the 1,735 suspended registrations.</p>
<p><strong>“If the mountain won’t come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain.”</strong> Or at least that was the plan in Morgan County, Georgia where the rural county became the first to <a href="http://www.cbs46.com/story/38902407/resolution-for-paper-ballots-fails-in-morgan-county">attempt to move to paper ballots</a> without waiting on the state to do so. According to CBS46, the county board of elections considered a three-part resolution that would have move the county away from DRE machines and instead opting paper ballots and optical scans. The vote was close with the BOE chairman casting the deciding vote against citing that the county could not overstep state law.</p>
<p><strong>The Baker Center for Leadership and Governance recently awarded grant funding</strong> to Ben Mindes, a graduate student at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy to pilot the first nonpartisan, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ObserveDC">sample-based election observation</a> effort in the U.S. Observe D.C. will deploy stationary observers to a random sample of the 143 polling places in the District, which allows the group to extrapolate findings on the process to the entire District. “We will be looking at procedural aspects of electoral administration, as well as accessibility&nbsp;for people with disabilities,” Mindes said. Prior to enrolling at Georgetown, Mindes supported several citizen groups around the world to conduct such observations as a member of the National Democratic Institute’s Elections team. “This effort would be the first time the sample-based methodology would be applied to an election observation effort in the U.S.” We’re eager to hear from Mindes after November to see what he finds, but in the mean time, if you live in the D.C.-area and are interested in volunteering, you can sign up via Observe D.C.’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ObserveDC">Facebook page</a>.</p>

														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Gov. Bill Ruaner (R) has vetoed a bill that would have required corrections officials to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/illinois-governor-jail-voting_us_5b7b2be8e4b05906b4166a8d">help those incarcerated in jails and prisons understand their voting rights</a>. The bill would have required election and corrections officials to offer ballots to people being detained in jail prior to their trials who want to vote. It would have also required corrections officials to provide voter registration forms to people being released from jail and information about voting rights to those leaving prison. According to the <em>Huffington Post</em>, in his veto, Rauner didn’t object to helping people get access to ballots during pretrial&nbsp;detention, but specifically took issue with the requirement that officials provide voter registration forms to people leaving jail and voting rights information to those leaving prison. He said he’d support the bill if lawmakers eliminated those elements of it.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> In a 3-6 vote, the Chesapeake City council has voted down a proposal that would have <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/local/article_13af045e-a0ff-11e8-9272-4bb26e04f568.html">moved the city’s elections</a> from May to November.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the secretary of state’s office alleging that the state does not <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2018/08/20/aclu-alleges-in-lawsuit-state-doesnt-update-voter-rolls-properly/">promptly update voters’ addresses</a>. According to the suit, procedures set up by Secretary of State Michele Reagan require voters to affirmatively ask the state Department of Transportation to update their new address, which is plaintiffs claim is in violate of federal law. State Elections Director Eric Spencer told the Arizona Capitol Times that the state is moving in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Citing the influx of voters from Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, Demos has filed a lawsuit claiming that at least 32 additional Florida counties should be providing <a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/271970-organization-sues-bilingual-ballots">voting materials in English and in Spanish</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> A complaint has been filed with the Hawaii Supreme Court alleging that <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2018/08/elections-suit-accuses-state-lawmaker-of-voter-fraud-and-intimidation/">voter fraud, coercion and intimidation</a> by State Rep. Romy Cachola helped Cachola win the Aug. 11 primary by just 51 votes. According to <em>Honolulu Civil Beat</em>, the complaint is premised on the surge of absentee mail-in ballots that secured Cachola the win. Hawaii elections chief Scott Nago is also named in the suit.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> In a legal opinion issued las week, the commonwealth’s attorney general said that poll workers may provide voters with a list of <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article216793000.html">certified write-in candidates</a>. According to the <em>Lexington Herald-Leader</em>, the state law that prohibits electioneering at the polls does not prohibit distributing a list of write-in candidates if a voter requests instructions on how to cast a write-in vote, the opinion said in response to a question by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The Rogersville Board of Mayor and Alderman has decline to reimburse the <a href="http://www.therogersvillereview.com/rogersville/article_f1d98806-57bb-5c6b-b1ef-ecc2416dbf79.html">Hawkins County</a> election commission for $14,723 in legal fees.

<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> According to CNN, 36 states have installed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/17/politics/states-intrustion-sensors-election-systems/index.html">cyber-intrusion systems</a> supplied by the Department of Homeland Security. Rather than block cyber threats outright, the Albert system alerts officials about potentially questionable activity to be investigated by experts. In those states, 74 sensors in 38 counties have been installed so far. DHS and Center for Internet Security officials aren&#8217;t saying why the 14 remaining states aren&#8217;t using Albert, and they won&#8217;t name the states.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> CyberScoop has a handy guide for state and local elections officials that details all the technology companies that are <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/election-security-offerings-list/">offering assistance</a>, a lot of it for free, to officials this election season.</p>

This publicly-owned technology represents a significant step in the future of elections in California and across the country.”</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> With the Sunshine State’s primary less than a week away, Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark has announced a new, enhanced website feature to showcase election night results. The module, called Election Night Reporting (ENR), shows both a numeric and graphical view of county results.
