							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Lines, glitches, humidity, goats. In other words a typical election</strong><br />
<em>Pre-election fears of hacking fail to materialize</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>The 2018 election has already been hacked! Voter suppression! Voter fraud! Those were some of the headlines that screamed at voters and elections officials in the days leading up to the 2018 general election, but in the light of the day, the 2018 election turned out to be far less chaotic than many people anticipated.</p>
<p>Yes, there were lines. There were machine malfunctions. There were bomb and gun threats. Some people were denied their right to vote. There were goats. But with turnout hovering around 49 percent, from a seasoned-election observers eye, the 2018 election was fairly business as usual—at least as far as the process goes.</p>
<p>This week, given time constraints, we’re just doing a brief review of Election Day 2018. Next week we’ll take a look at what happened — good, bad, silly and sad — state-by-state and in the coming weeks we’ll drill down into some of the bigger issues that arose, why they arose and what the next steps are. You can also check out our<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2018/11-06/"> Election Day Dispatches</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Election Security</strong> — For two years the security of America’s elections have been drilled into our heads. From the Department of Homeland Security, all the way down to the smallest election authority, officials worked and worried to make sure that the 2018 elections were secure. And at the end of the day,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/07/665112429/how-secure-were-the-midterm-elections?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;fbclid=IwAR0_SfRW1lLEYLPOTgJS2i6bTrH-M4ypgzhn6UViOlGQI6Et7ylaqJj_0hM"> election security really turned out to be a non-issue in 2018</a>. The Department of Homeland Security’s cyber unit fielded some<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2018/11/dhs-officials-election-system-cyberattack-claims-are-garbage-still-damaging/152604/"> false alarms</a>, but no hacks.</p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong> — Voters in Missouri and Iowa faced new voter ID requirements this year and some issues did arise in<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article221226220.html"> Missouri</a> where a judge had altered the rules in the days leading up to the election. In<a href="https://www.kimt.com/content/news/County-Auditor-People-understand-how-the-new-voter-ID-law-works-499995542.html"> Iowa</a>, initial reports indicate that overall things went smoothly. In<a href="http://time.com/5446971/north-dakota-native-american-turnout/"> North Dakota</a>, where Native American tribes had fought the state’s ID law to the last minute, turnout of Native Americans broke records. In additional ID news, voters in<a href="https://www.wral.com/details-of-nc-s-new-voter-id-requirement-still-need-to-be-worked-out/17977588/"> North Carolina</a> and<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/nov/07/voter-id-amendment-gains-arkansans-appr/"> Arkansas</a> both voted to amend their state’s constitutions to institute voter ID.</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong> — Millions of voters registered to vote in the waning days of the election cycle and overall it seems that counties were able to get all those folks on the rolls. Election day registration in<a href="https://fox61.com/2018/11/07/new-haven-experiences-election-day-voter-registration-issues-again/"> Connecticut</a> created huge lines in some towns. Voters in<a href="http://www.ktvn.com/story/39434261/nevada-makes-dmv-voter-registration-automatic"> Nevada</a> approved automatic registration. In<a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/government/same-day-voter-registration-approved/"> Maryland</a>, voters approved election day registration and in<a href="https://fox17online.com/2018/11/06/proposal-3-allowing-automatic-voter-registration-passes-in-michigan/"> Michigan</a>, as part of a larger election-reform package, voters approved same day registration.</p>
<p><strong>Lines/Turnout</strong> — Although the numbers aren’t final yet, turnout is hovering right around<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/record-voter-turnout-in-2018-midterm-elections/"> 49 percent</a> which is the highest midterm turnout in years. The last time midterm turnout broke 49 percent was 1966. Not every state broke midterm records, but many did. Large turnout lead to lines in many places as well as ballot shortages some states including<a href="https://www.cleveland19.com/2018/11/07/so-many-people-voted-cuyahoga-county-they-had-print-more-ballots/"> Ohio</a> and<a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/prince-georges-county-election-day-ballot-issues"> Maryland</a>. And a preliminary analysis by CIRCLE found that<a href="https://civicyouth.org/young-people-dramatically-increase-their-turnout-31-percent-shape-2018-midterm-elections/"> voters aged 18-29</a> increased their overall turnout to 31 percent which is 10 percent higher than for the 2014 midterms.</p>
<p><strong>Voting Equipment</strong> — While prior to Tuesday, we expressed some concern about voters seeing new equipment for the first time might cause confusion or delays, in reality it was<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/broken-machines-rejected-ballots-and-long-lines-voting-problems-emerge-as-americans-go-to-the-polls/2018/11/06/ffd11e52-dfa8-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html?utm_term=.7690ea84052c"> aging voting equipment</a> that seemed to cause the most of the<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/voting-machine-meltdowns-midterm-elections-2018/"> issues</a> both in voting and counting.<a href="https://gizmodo.com/voting-machine-hell-2018-a-running-list-of-election-g-1830261900"> Issues</a> ranged from ballot printer malfunctions, calibration problems with aging touchscreen machines, and humidity and dampness warped paper ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Power Outages</strong> — Due to severe weather, polling places across the country faced power outages throughout the day on Tuesday although there were no reports of the voting being affected by the outages.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary of State Races</strong> — Secretary of state offices were on the ballot in 24 states. There will be nine new secretaries (<a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/steve-gaynor-defeats-katie-hobbs-in-arizona-secretary-of-state-race">Arizona</a>,<a href="https://www.fox16.com/news/politics/thurston-elected-arkansas-secretary-of-state/1577603869"> Arkansas</a>,<a href="https://koaa.com/ap-colorado-news/2018/11/06/the-latest-colorado-voters-deciding-governor-house-races/"> Colorado</a>,<a href="https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Republican-wins-Kansas-secretary-of-state-race-499901402.html"> Kansas</a>,<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/11/hold_michigan_secretary_of_sta.html"> Michigan</a>,<a href="http://www.wcbe.org/post/larose-be-ohios-next-secretary-state"> Ohio</a>,<a href="https://www.1011now.com/content/news/Evnen-wins-Nebraska-secretary-of-state-race-499905581.html"> Nebraska</a> and<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota/articles/2018-11-06/the-latest-south-dakota-to-have-cool-blustery-election-day"> South Dakota</a>),  in the coming months and we’ll meet them all in due time and incumbent secretaries (<a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/06/john-merrill-defeats-heather-milam-retain-alabama-secretary-state-post/1882190002/">Alabama</a>,<a href="https://www.ctpost.com/news/crime/article/The-Latest-It-s-Newsom-vs-Cox-for-California-13365806.php"> California</a>,<a href="https://www.ctpost.com/politics/article/Lembo-Wooden-Merrill-win-but-AG-too-close-13369903.php"> Connecticut</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-idaho-elections.html"> Idaho</a>,<a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/indiana-election-2018-secretary-state-connie-lawson-harper-results/1751201002/"> Indiana</a>,<a href="https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/pate-wins-secretary-of-state-sands-defeats-incumbent-auditor-mosiman-20181107"> Iowa</a>,<a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/11/06/galvin-re-elected-secretary-of-state"> Massachusetts</a>,<a href="http://duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4525529-simon-wins-reelection-minnesota-secretary-state-race"> Minnesota</a>, Nevada,<a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/get-access/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lcsun-news.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Felections%2F2018%2F11%2F06%2Felection-results-2018-maggie-toulouse-oliver-wins-secretary-state-new-mexico%2F1914465002%2F"> New Mexico</a>,<a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4525465-jaeger-re-elected-nd-secretary-state-will-be-my-last-term"> North Dakota</a>,<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20181106/gorbea-reelected-secretary-of-state"> Rhode Island</a>,<a href="https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Condos-re-elected-Vt-secretary-of-state-499896861.html"> Vermont</a> and<a href="http://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/ed-buchanan-holds-secretary-state-office"> Wyoming</a>)  were re-elected in 13 states.

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>It’s never a good time for a fire</strong>, but a few days before a midterm election is an especially bad time, but that’s what happened to the<a href="https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Shenandoah-County-moves-voter-registrars-office-after-early-morning-fire-499288381.html"> Shenandoah County, Virginia registrar’s office</a> when a printer malfunctioned. Fortunately no one was hurt but the damage from the fire and sprinkler system was enough that the office will have to relocate for the foreseeable future. “Based on our preliminary review of the damage resulting from the sprinkler system’s activation, it appears all voter records and any absentee ballots casts in advance of next week’s election have been protected and are secure. We are grateful the damage was not more extensive,” Lisa McDonald, Shenandoah County voter registrar told WHSV.</p>
<p><strong>Concern has been growing</strong> over the use of<a href="https://theislandnow.com/featured/bosworth-offers-town-facilities-for-voting-in-place-of-schools/"> schools as polling places</a> in Nassau County, New York and recently the North Hempstead Town Supervisor Judi Bosworth reached out to the Nassau County BOE offer town facilities as potential future voting sites. “Please know that my number one priority is maintaining the safety and security of our communities here in North Hempstead,” Bosworth told <em>The Island Now</em>. “In order to further protect our children, residents, teachers, and school administrators, I believe it would be prudent for the Board of Elections to consider this request.”</p>
<p><strong>According to The Baltimore Sun</strong>, Harford County Elections Director Kevin Keene and Deputy Director Dale Livingston were put on<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/harford/aegis/ph-ag-new-harford-election-director-1107-story.html"> paid administrative leave</a> on October 31 and Cynthia Allred, secretary of the county board of elections, was named acting director. William G. Christoforo Jr., president of the board of elections refused to comment on the situation. Allred, who said no acting deputy director is in place “at this time,” declined to provide further information on why Keene and Livingston are on leave, or who had made the decision to put them on leave.</p>
<p><strong>When her son with autism expressed an interest in voting</strong>, Massachusetts mother Susan Senator knew she would have to do something to help ease his anxieties so she created booklet for her son called “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/05/health/autism-voting-laws/index.html">Voting is really important. Here’s how to do it</a>.” According to CNN, the nine-page resource walks him through the process, complete with pictures of the ballot, which he could practice bubbling in, and reminders about the candidates running for different positions. &#8220;For any person, the more you know about how something works, the better you&#8217;re going to perform,&#8221; Senator said. We love this idea!</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: Will County, Illinois Clerk<a href="https://www.theherald-news.com/lists/2018/11/03/937a5006619046cdb65985067a37d17d/index.xml?page=1"> Nancy Schultz Voots</a> will retire following the 2018 elections. She has been in the clerk’s office since 1976 and the clerk since 2002.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: The Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety has approved a bill that would<a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-council-committee-approves-bill-dc-voting-age-16"> extend voting rights to 16-year-olds</a> in the District in all elections, including federal elections. The bill is expected to come before the full council on November 13.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> Secretary of State Corey Stapleton will testify before the State Administration and Veteran’s Affairs Committee on Nov. 13 regarding<a href="https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/11/02/panel-question-montana-secretary-state-spending-stapleton/1862497002/"> spending on two contracts</a> including one for $265,000 to reprint the state voter guide after errors were found.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: In April Gov. Phil Murphy (D) signed legislation into law requiring<a href="https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/voter-registration-now-automatic-at-motor-vehicle-commission/article_0a64ccca-92aa-54fe-a0bf-ff592ce8129d.html"> automatic voter registration</a> at all state Motor Vehicle Commission offices by November 1 and on November 1, the MVC announced that the system was live. All eligible state residents who apply for a driver’s license, an examination permit, a probationary driver’s license or a non-driver identification card will be registered to vote.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California:</strong> Richard Anthony Hamilton, 22 has been charged with<a href="https://www.pe.com/2018/11/01/one-voter-fraud-case-filed-after-2017-riverside-county-investigation/"> voting twice</a> in the 2016 presidential election as well as the primary. He was also registered twice, once with his actual birthdate and once with a false birthdate.</p>
<p>Also in California, Deidra Vrooman has been charged with<a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/california/northern-california-woman-faces-felony-voter-fraud-charges-for-allegedly-voting-twice/1575491353"> felony election fraud</a> for casting two ballots in the 2016 primary election. Vrooman was mailed two ballots, one from Nevada County and one from Alameda County. She was living out of her car at the time and did not know where she was currently registered, so she sent both back. &#8220;It was just my right to vote, so I voted,&#8221; Vrooman explained to KRON. &#8220;I was mailed two ballots by the government so I was just following instructions to send them both in.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Judge Mark Walker rebuked Duval County Supervisor of Elections Mike Hogan for<a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/politics/federal-judge-rebukes-duval-elections-chief"> not following his September court order</a> to provide sample ballots available at early voting sites. According to News 4, Walker rebuked Hogan and ordered that sample ballots in Spanish be at all voting precincts on Election Day.  &#8220;The cause of this motion was Duval County Supervisor of Elections Mike Hogan’s strained and selective reading of this Court’s preliminary injunction order,&#8221; Walker wrote. &#8220;His reading &#8230; inexplicably ignored this Court’s unambiguous language.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross ruled that Georgia’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-georgias-exact-match-voter-id-rule-for-midterm/"> “exact match” requirement</a> voter identification “places a severe burden” on prospective voters and will not apply for the midterm. According to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>, Ross directed Kemp’s office to allow  county election officials to permit individuals flagged and placed in pending status due to citizenship to vote a regular ballot by furnishing proof of citizenship to poll managers or deputy registrars. “To be clear, once an individual’s citizenship has been verified by a deputy registrar or a poll manager, that individual may cast a regular ballot and the vote counts,” Ross said.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Crabtree said forcing Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox to<a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article220998870.html"> open an additional polling location</a> in Dodge City so close to the election would not be in the public’s interest. Crabtree did question Cox’s actions though. And while the court must evaluate the fully-developed facts governing this claim on a later day, the court notes, for now, its concerns about Ms. Cox’s ‘LOL’ comment and questions whether it manifests a disregard for the ‘fundamental significance’ that our Constitution places on the right to vote,” Crabtree wrote.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: On Election Day, the League of Women Voters sued the state of New York over the state’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/new-york-sued-over-voter-registration-cutoff/"> voter registration cutoff date</a> calling it “arbitrary and unnecessary.” “As a direct result of the voter registration cutoff, many thousands of constitutionally eligible voters in every election cycle are denied their fundamental right to vote,” says the complaint according to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>, which attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: A last-ditch legal effort to halt North Dakota’s<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/us/politics/north-dakota-voter-id-tribe.html"> voter ID law</a> was denied by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel L. Hovland. In his two-page order, Hovland said it was too close to the election to make any changes. He noted that “federal courts are unanimous in their judgment that it is highly important to preserve the status quo when elections are fast approaching.”</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> District Judge Justin Sanderson ordered that dozens of voters whose<a href="https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Judge-orders-Jefferson-Co-mail-in-ballots-get-a-13364347.php"> mail-in ballots were slated for rejection</a> should be notified in time to vote on Tuesday. At least 86 mail-in ballots were flagged last week for potential discrepancies in signatures between the application form and the returned ballot, elections office.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: A group of volunteer researchers and technologists led by Guardians.ai, a New York startup that’s focused on protecting pro-democracy organizations from information warfare and cyber-attack released a study that identified what they said is a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-03/twitter-study-finds-coordinated-pattern-in-vote-fraud-messages"> coordinated network of Twitter accounts that push false and misleading narratives</a> about election integrity with hashtags like #VoterFraud. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, they found a core of 200 accounts that tweeted or were mentioned in tweets more than 140 million times over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Servers</strong>: A survey by <em>ProPublica</em> found that computer servers that powered Kentucky’s online voter registration and Wisconsin’s election results reporting site ran software that could<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/file-sharing-software-on-state-election-servers-could-expose-them-to-intruders"> potentially expose information to hackers</a> or enable access to sensitive files without a password. According to ProPublica, officials in both states said that voter-registration data has not been compromised and that their states’ infrastructure was protected against infiltration. Still, Wisconsin said it turned off its FTP service following ProPublica’s inquiries. Kentucky left its password-free service running and said <em>ProPublica</em> didn’t understand its approach to security.</p>
