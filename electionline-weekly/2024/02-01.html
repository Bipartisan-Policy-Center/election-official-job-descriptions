														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ethical Standards for Election Administration</strong><br />
<em>The American Law Institute releases report on proposed set of standards</em><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Stewart III, Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science<br />
<a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/charles-stewart-iii">MIT</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5781" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Last year, the leadership of the <a href="https://www.ali.org/">American Law Institute</a> convened a bipartisan group to consider the issue of ethical standards for election administration.  On Monday, the group issued its <a href="https://www.ali.org/media/filer_public/8c/e0/8ce078e3-5b39-47ce-b393-4d5fbeec18be/ethical_standards_for_election_officials-jan2024.pdf">report</a>, which outlines a proposed set of standards.  The writing team consisted of current election officials with diverse perspectives from across the country that was advised by a larger group of similarly diverse former election officials, public officials, and academics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report emphasizes that elections in the United States are conducted by dedicated officials committed to administering fair, accurate, accessible, and secure elections.  Unfortunately, the contentious nature of our politics has clouded this reality to many and bred distrust of the system; the need to clearly articulate the moral foundation that undergirds the work of election administrations is therefore particularly pressing at this moment.  Yet, as the report explains, “Even if the times were not so challenging, it would be appropriate to encourage those who conduct elections to consider the principles that undergird their work, inform the public of those principles, and hold each other accountable to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reviewing existing principles in public service and election administration, the report recommends seven core principles for consideration by the profession:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adhere to the law.  Election officials have a duty to administer the law as written and interpreted by the relevant authorities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect and defend the integrity of the election process.  Election officials have a duty to ensure the integrity of elections and to safeguard against unfounded attacks on the integrity of the election process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote transparency in the conduct of elections.  Election officials have a duty to make election administration transparent to the public.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treat all participants in the election process impartially.  Election officials have an obligation to treat all participants in the electoral process impartially, including voters, candidates, citizens, and political committees.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrate personal integrity.  Election officials have a duty to conduct themselves honestly and forthrightly in all interactions with superiors, peers, candidates, campaign officials, and the general public.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice the highest level of ethics and stewardship.  Election officials have a duty to expend public funds carefully and foster respect among employees and volunteers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advance professional excellence.  Election officials have a duty to stay informed about election laws and new developments in election management.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These principles were formulated after a thorough review of existing principles, including the standards of conduct of the National Association of Election Officials (the Elections Center) and state associations; ethical guidelines developed by professions such as law and accounting; state ethics laws; and academic research.  The report also highlights the role of oaths of office in reinforcing the common moral basis of election administration rooted in state and national constitutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articulating ethical principles for election officials serves several purposes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared vocabulary.  It provides a shared vocabulary to communicate the moral basis for election conduct to voters.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training aid.  It aids in training new officials by reinforcing the broader purpose of election administration as a profession.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Values internalization.  It helps internalize values that can guide officials when facing external pressures or unclear election laws.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10747" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-9.42.54 AM-300x80.png" alt="" width="300" height="80" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-9.42.54 AM-300x80.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-9.42.54 AM.png 518w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Other professions that have developed ethical principles have given those principles life through the development of standards of conduct.  Standards of conduct are essential for identifying how abstract principles are applied in particular cases.  They are also developed to apply differently to individuals with varied roles and levels of responsibility.  For instance, to implement the principle of adherence to the law, a county election director might be directed to seek legal counsel when the law is ambiguous.  In contrast, a polling place officer might be directed to seek guidance from the local election office when the official is uncertain how to handle a situation at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report acknowledges challenges, such as the longstanding U.S. practice of selecting senior election officials through partisan elections and the difficulty of enforcement.  With respect to the former issue, the report emphasizes the need for laws and practices that allow officials to disclose potential conflicts of interest and recuse themselves when conflicts arise. The report considers enforcement crucial but emphasizes that the primary goal of articulating ethical principles is not punitive but rather meant to internalize behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the decentralized nature of U.S. election administration, state associations of local officials are well-positioned to articulate and educate their members on ethical principles if they haven&#8217;t done so already.  Notably, the Election Center has integrated ethical principles into its certification program; it has just completed an important project to reinvigorate ethical topics into election official training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The working group that drafted the report consisted of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Gates, Supervisor, Maricopa County, Arizona</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Logan, Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, Los Angeles County, California</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Roebuck, County Clerk/Register of Deeds, Ottawa County, Michigan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Molly Fitzpatrick, Clerk &amp; Recorder, Boulder County, Colorado</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricky Hatch, County Clerk/Auditor, Weber County, Utah</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Ball Johnson, City Clerk, Colorado Springs, Colorado</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Schwab, Secretary of State, Kansas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tahesha Way, Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State, New Jersey</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall effort was co-chaired by Bob Bauer, Professor of Practice and Distinguished Scholar in Residence at the New York University School of Law, and Ben Ginsberg, the Volker Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institute.  Charles Stewart III, Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science at MIT, was the research director who helped shepherd the report&#8217;s writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report is presented as a conversation starter for the broader election administration community, acknowledging that the outlined agenda will take years to complete.  The authors believe that the values articulated in the document already resonate with the work of thousands of election officials across the country and can help communicate the profound moral foundation of their work to the public.</span></p>

														<p><strong>The Nuanced Challenges of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By: Theo Menon, Rachel Orey, Matthew Weil</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="156" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is once again in the limelight. The EAC has faced extensive criticism since its creation in 2002: It has been accused of</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/29/AR2007082901928.html?hpid=opinionsbox1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> political bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its reporting,</span><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/back-story/2009/dec/03/election-assistance-commision-nixes-job-to-man-bec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiring discrimination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:mf969dh7882/SIO_Zero_Trust_2021.pdf#page=17"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technical inadequacy, inefficiency, and irrelevance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most recently, the EAC announced the departure of</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-commission-voting-turnover-2024-636e269597f25a1a934645f0162b0433"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its third executive director</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in as many years, Steven Frid. This continued pattern of high turnover has drawn</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2024/01/15/election-assistance-commission-executive-director-turmoil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ire of observers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who once again question the agency’s leadership and stability going into a contentious election season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/the-nuanced-challenges-of-the-u-s-election-assistance-commission/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Nuanced Challenges of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Bipartisan Policy Center makes the case that the EAC’s shortcomings aren’t the fault of agency leadership or employees. Rather, a combination of political interference, structural limitations, and insufficient funding has hampered the EAC’s ability to function as effectively as it could. Furthermore, the EAC has made real progress in reforming its operations and programs <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />to better serve the election community since the 2020 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While challenges remain, the narrative that the EAC is a wholly ineffective organization fails to account for recent progress that has occurred despite significant, externally imposed limitations. With the right reforms in place, the EAC could continue building on this progress to fully maximize its potential as the only federal agency entirely devoted to election administration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the full explainer here:</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/the-nuanced-challenges-of-the-u-s-election-assistance-commission/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Nuanced Challenges of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></a></p>

The livestream system employs four cameras with individual timestamps, delivering a single 1080p feed. This enables citizens to view high-quality video of the ballot processing area, while still safeguarding sensitive information that may be displayed on screens or ballots. The four cameras have been strategically positioned to show all stages of ballot-processing. “Transparency of the process fosters trust and understanding of the process, so this livestream is an essential function of our election,” Burgess said. “Even though we are not mandated to offer this, we feel it is our duty as public servants to invite the public to see what is happening in our office.” The livestream launched the first day of early voting and will continue 24-7 until the Canvass of the Vote, February 16. There are two ways to view the livestream: </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/washoecountytv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Washoe County website. YouTube limits livestreams to 12 hours, so the YouTube stream will reboot every 11 hours and 55 minutes. Each session will be its own steam so viewers will need to go to the channel, not the previous video, to watch each successive session. In order to provide redundancy, particularly during those few minutes that the YouTube stream refreshes, the video will also be </span><a href="http://www.washoecounty.gov/voters/2024-election/livestream.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">playing nonstop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The courtesy video feed of the elections office is a collaborative effort between Washoe County Digital Communications, Technology Services, Registrar of Voters, Security.</span></p>

She was 73. As the 20th president of the 103-year-old voting rights organization, Dr. Turner played a pivotal role in fighting for a more fair and representative union, while uplifting racial equity in the League’s mission work.  Dr. Turner first joined the League of Women Voters of Metro Des Moines in 2010 and later served as president until 2015. At the same time, she also served on the LWV of Iowa board as the state vice president from 2011 to 2015, becoming co-president in 2015. In her dual roles with state and local Leagues, Deborah has devoted her leadership to strengthening relationships between local leagues and the state Board. “Dr. Turner was the consummate leader who poured her heart and soul for the preservation of our democracy,&#8221; said Virginia Kase Solomón, CEO of the League of Women Voters. “Her leadership exemplified grace, empathy, strength, and determination, and we will forever be grateful for her passion and dedication to this organization.” Dr. Turner received her BS from Iowa State University and her MD from the University of Iowa where she completed her Residency in OB-Gyn. She completed her fellowship in Gynecologic Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Institute in Houston Texas. She practiced gynecologic oncology for 35 years, enhancing university programs at the University of Nebraska, the University of Iowa, and the Medical College of Wisconsin teaching residents and students. She also served the private sector, bringing her specialty to Genesis Medical Center in Davenport, IA, Mercy Cancer Center in Mason City, IA, and Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines. In July 2015, she left active practice to become Vice President of International Programs Medical Programs of The Outreach Program. She participated in twelve medical missions to Tanzania since 2011 and worked with Singida’s Medical Center, Outreach’s Children’s Feeding Centers, and Rotary International. She received her JD from Drake University in 2007. She has served as Associate Medical Director of Planned Parenthood of North Central States since 2016. Turner was inducted into the Iowa Women’s Hall of Fame in 2013 and received the Gertrude Rush Award from the National Bar Association in 2015. She was awarded the Louise Noun Visionary Women of the Year award from the Young Women&#8217;s Resource Center Des Moines in 2018. Her most treasured award is a certificate from the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Care. In 2022, Fortune Magazine named her a &#8220;Marquis Who&#8217;s Who&#8221; top professional for her work with LWV. Dr. Turner lived in Nebraska and had two grown children – a son and a niece.</span></p>

The </span><a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-torres-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-improve-voter-registration-at-naturalization-ceremonies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including New Voters In The Electorate (INVITE) Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would designate United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field offices as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act, requiring USCIS staff to help new U.S. citizens complete their voter registration forms and return them to the appropriate state agency following their naturalization. While USCIS policy states that the agency should provide new U.S. citizens with voter registration forms at their USCIS naturalization ceremonies, the policy does not currently require the agency to assist new U.S. citizens in properly filling out or returning their forms, leaving many newly eligible United States citizens unregistered to vote. New citizens naturalized at judicial ceremonies or without a formal ceremony are at an even greater disadvantage, having no guarantee of even receiving voter registration information. Just 61 percent of all naturalized U.S. citizens were registered to vote during the November 2022 election, compared to 70 percent of citizens born in the United States. The INVITE Act would maintain USCIS’s flexibility to work with state voter registration agencies and nonpartisan voter registration organizations, and it would allow the agency to develop and implement plans with each state to carry out this important work.</span></p>

Rep. Stephanie Stahl-Hamilton, D-Tucson, told the Arizona Mirror that even though her</span><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/80192?SessionId=128"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2335</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is unlikely to become law, she still believes that introducing it was worthwhile. A</span><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78202?Sessionid=127"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced last year by then-Rep. Athena Salman but was never considered. “It’s important not to be silent,” Stahl Hamilton said. “This is one step in pushing for a strengthened  democracy.” If passed, the bill would get rid of ballot collection restrictions that say voted early ballots in Arizona can only be returned by the voter’s family member, a member of their household or their caregiver.</span></p>

Griswold emphasized the threat that AI could pose to American elections, specifically highlighting issues surrounding the creation of deepfakes. These deepfakes, manipulated media content typically created using AI, have the potential to distort the actions and words of candidates and officeholders, leading to the proliferation of misinformation. The proposed legislation, titled “Candidate Election Deepfake Disclosures,” aims to counteract this threat by introducing measures that require clear disclaimers on political communications that have either been generated or substantially altered by AI.</span></p>

The Senate voted 30-19 along party lines for Senate Bill 358, sending it to the House for more debate. Raffensperger, also a Republican, says it is unconstitutional for the Senate to give the State Election Board the power to oversee an elected official. “There is no precedent for an unelected board of political appointees to have oversight authority over members of the executive branch,” Raffensperger’s general counsel, Charlene McGowan, wrote Tuesday. But Senate Ethics Committee Chairman Sen. Max Burns disagreed, saying that the measure only alters legal powers that the General Assembly has given to Raffensperger and the election board, and not Raffensperger’s constitutional authority. “The majority of powers of the secretary of state are vested through statute and not through constitutional law,” said Burns, a Sylvania Republican.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Ethics Committee moved the state closer to </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/01/30/georgia-gop-senators-take-new-step-to-eliminate-use-of-qr-codes-on-paper-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminating the use of QR codes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for counting votes on paper ballots, a practice that has been criticized by ballot security advocates. Chairman Max Burns said that his</span><a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/64471"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 189</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intends to restore greater confidence in the accuracy of votes cast in elections statewide. The bill calls for replacing the QR code that tabulates votes recorded on paper ballots with a new method of either readable text or a bubble style mark similar to what is currently used for absentee and provisional ballots.  “It’s a voter confidence bill,” Burns said. “If we can achieve the goal of having this legislation adopted, I think it will go a long way to ensuring that all of our voters, from all political perspectives, will have confidence in the election.” Burns said after speaking with state election officials that he’s confident that switching away from the QR code does not require an overhaul of the state’s voting system. In 2019, the state purchased the Dominion Voting Systems electronic machines for $107 million. The bill now moves to the Senate Rules Committee, which sets the agenda on which legislation is brought to the floor of the chamber. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and House Speaker Jon Burns, both Republicans, have listed the elimination of the QR code on ballots as a priority for the 2024 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters could see a </span><a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/election/georgia-house-votes-to-require-watermarks-on-election-ballots-voting-election-fraud-allegations-2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-donald-trump"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watermark on their ballot </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">beginning in November, a move Republican supporters said would assure citizens that their ballots are authentic. The House voted 167-1 for House Bill 976, sending it to the Senate for more debate. Georgia ballots are already printed on special security paper, under a law passed in 2021 after Georgia&#8217;s disputed 2020 presidential election. But a laser wand is required to detect the paper. And some Trump supporters continue to pursue claims that ballots in 2020 were forged, especially in Fulton County, despite investigators repeatedly failing to find any. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger supports the measure, with his chief operating officer, Gabe Sterling, telling a House committee earlier this month that a machine to stamp watermarks on the ballot would cost the state about $100,000, and not increase the current cost to counties of 13 cents per ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-10742" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/EvanstonIllinois-269x300.png" alt="" width="161" height="180" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/EvanstonIllinois-269x300.png 269w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/EvanstonIllinois.png 592w" sizes="(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px" />Evanston, Illinois</strong>: Ald. Devon Reid (8th) introduced an ordinance at the Rules Committee meeting that would </span><a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/2024/01/29/city/evanston-considers-proposal-allowing-documented-residents-to-vote-in-municipal-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow documented residents without U.S. citizenship to vote in local elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said the change would increase voter turnout by allowing residents who are civically active to more fully participate in their community.  “I believe it has been the march of our nation to allow more and more folks the right to vote in our elections,” Reid told The Daily. “I think that folks who are members of our community, who are documented legal residents but not quite citizens yet, who are paying taxes, their kids are going to our schools, should have the right to participate in our local democracy.”  Currently, non-citizens cannot vote in federal or state elections. State Sen. Celina Villanueva (D-Chicago) introduced a bill in 2021 that would allow non-citizens to vote in school board elections. The bill has not been passed. Reid motioned for city staff and an outside law firm to produce a memo on non-citizen voting. They have plans to present that memo at the next Rules Committee meeting on Feb. 5. The motion passed 6-2.</span></p>

Indiana voters are already required to show photo ID when casting a ballot, and a law passed last year that tightened mail-in voting requirements in the state. The bill was passed on party lines this week in the Indiana state House chamber. It’s not clear when the Senate (also held by Republicans) could take it up. Under the bill, residents who are first-time voters in Indiana would have to provide proof of residency when registering in person, unless they submit an Indiana driver’s license or social security number that matches an Indiana record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation headed to the full Senate aims to </span><a href="https://www.wboi.org/2024-01-30/indiana-lawmakers-aim-to-protect-election-workers-volunteers-at-polling-places"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protect poll workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while they’re doing their jobs by making a slight expansion to existing law. Current law makes it a Level 6 felony to obstruct, interfere with or injure an election officer while they’re on the job. But that law doesn’t necessarily cover everyone who’s working or volunteering at the polling place. </span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/senate/170/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 170</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unanimously approved by a Senate committee, makes sure all those people are included. Indiana Clerks Association President Nicole Browne said that protection is necessary. “Current and experienced poll workers are experiencing concerns for their personal safety and well-being at a time when we are preparing for what is likely to be history’s biggest election to date,” Browne said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3684" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Kansas:</strong> Representatives from the Kansas County Clerks and Election Officials Association told legislators last week the membership opposed a Republican-sponsored bill that would prohibit counties from continuing the practice of </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/01/25/bill-blocks-kansas-counties-from-sending-unsolicited-advance-ballot-applications-to-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mailing unsolicited advance ballot applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to registered voters. Harvey County Clerk Rick Piepho said the state shouldn’t interfere with decisions by counties to distribute advance ballot applications. Contents of Senate Bill 366, introduced by Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, would mandate individuals request applications for advance ballots. “We believe that individual election offices should continue to have the option, based on the needs of their jurisdiction, to send unsolicited mailings to voters in their jurisdiction that include an advance ballot application,” Piepho said. Piepho told the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee that the association of county election officials specifically objected to a provision in Thompson’s bill that would forbid the pre-filling of any portion of an advance ballot application. Counties fill name, address and birthdate sections of applications to make certain those parts were legible, given the difficulty of reading handwriting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters would have </span><a href="https://www.kcur.org/2024-01-26/kansas-lawmakers-consider-shortening-duration-of-early-voting-period"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less time to vote early in person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under a bill being considered by state lawmakers. Under current law, early voting is held until noon the Monday before an election. But a bill being discussed by the House Elections Committee would end early voting by 7 p.m. the Sunday before Election Day. Clay Barker, general counsel at the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, said at a hearing on Wednesday that some county election officials – especially in smaller counties – struggle to staff early voting the day before Election Day. “This can create a problem in counties where people are trying to vote at the same time the county election staff is trying to prepare for Election Day on Tuesday,” he said. But critics say the change could confuse or disenfranchise voters, especially if implemented during an election year. </span></p>

Looking to the upcoming presidential election, Adams said it is important to “have a law that actually is enforceable” and not struck down in court. He said photo ID laws in other states have been upheld if they permit university-issued IDs for proving a voter’s identity. If passed, the bill would prohibit identification cards issued by universities and colleges to students and employees from being accepted as primary proof of identification at the polls.</span></p>

When registering, potential voters must provide their driver license number, state-issued non-driver ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number to register. </span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25157"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow the use of tribal IDs by members of federally recognized tribes that enter into an agreement with the secretary of state, who is the top election official in South Dakota. The secretary of state supports the bill, as do representatives from the Yankton and Rosebud Sioux tribes. Rosebud tribal member Sen. Shawn Bordeaux, D-Mission, introduced the bill. Since the bill was unanimously approved by the committee, it’ll be placed on the Senate consent calendar, where it won’t be subjected to debate before a vote unless it’s moved to the regular calendar.</span></p>

The section under debate notes that finding any person who intentionally coerces or offers payment in exchange for a person to register to vote is guilty of a misdemeanor and could be fined and jailed. House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, asked that with no specific definition of the terms coerced or payment, could a college campus voter registration table giving away bottled water and cookies, or the Secretary of State’s high school teen voter registration campaign be seen as criminal acts?  “This piece of legislation in front of us could potentially not only harm those high school students and the aforementioned college students, this could criminalize our Secretary of State,” Hornbuckle said. “I would urge us, with the language, to slow down and we need to rethink what we’re doing here because it can be problematic.”  There was no other debate on the floor. House Bill 4017 passed the House by a 90-7 vote. It will become effective Jan. 1, 2025 if it passes the Senate.</span></p>

The rules are included in the Elections Procedures Manual approved in December by Fontes, the governor and the attorney general — all Democrats. It says county supervisors have no authority to change vote totals, reject the election results, or delay certifying the results without statutory authority or a court order. And it says if a county doesn’t provide the secretary of state its certified results, known as a canvass, by the time the secretary must certify statewide results under state law, the secretary “must proceed with the state canvass without including the votes of the missing county.” State Senate President Warren Petersen and state House Speaker Ben Toma, both Republicans, filed the lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court on Wednesday alleging that state law doesn’t give the secretary of state the authority to make rules about how election results are finalized, and even if Fontes did have this right, these rules are not in alignment with state law.</span></p>

It&#8217;s the latest move in an Arkansas state legislative redistricting case, filed by civil rights groups representing Black voters in the southern state, that could turn into the next U.S. Supreme Court battle that limits the scope of the landmark civil rights law. The Court of Appeals released</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24396590-arkansas-state-conference-naacp-2024-01-30-8th-circuit-order"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after attorneys led by the American Civil Liberties Union appealed the ruling by a three-judge panel last year. That panel found that federal law does not allow private groups and individuals — who have for decades brought the majority of lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act — to sue because that law does not explicitly name them. Only the head of the Justice Department, the panel found, can bring these kinds of lawsuits. In the 8th Circuit&#8217;s majority opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge David Stras, an appointee of former President Donald Trump who also wrote the panel&#8217;s majority opinion, said that the panel&#8217;s opinion &#8220;mostly speaks for itself.&#8221; Three judges, however, said they would grant the request for a rehearing. &#8220;The panel&#8217;s error is evident, but the court regrettably misses an opportunity to reaffirm its role as a dispassionate arbiter of issues that are properly presented by the parties,&#8221; Colloton wrote in a dissenting opinion that was joined by Kelly. According to</span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-appeals-court-wont-review-radical-arkansas-redistricting-ruling"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a statement released by the ACLU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the civil rights groups that brought this Arkansas lawsuit are &#8220;exploring next legal steps,&#8221; which may include a Supreme Court appeal.</span></p>

The brief is asking SCOTUS for direction and a unified ruling for all states.

Trump for President Inc. “The district court erred in applying a negligence standard.” In his 2020 lawsuit, Eric Coomer, a director of product strategy and security at Dominion Voting Systems in Denver  identified more than a dozen individuals and companies that collectively made him the villain in the narrative of unbased claims of election fraud. Coomer has since filed additional lawsuits against Denver-based conservative radio host Randy Corporon and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell.</span></p>

Walker found the provisions were discriminatory based on alienage, but the state, led by Republican secretary of state Cord Byrd, says the restrictions further the state&#8217;s goal of election integrity and are protected by a &#8220;political function exception.&#8221; During oral arguments, Florida attorneys argued that the exclusion was meant to ensure voter registration applications can be delivered in a timely manner. Putting the applications in the hands of those with illegal or temporary status decreases the odds of that happening, attorney Mohammad Jazil, said because they may leave the county suddenly, at any time. The three-judge circuit panel pondered how to address the constitutionality of the statue, which doesn&#8217;t differentiate between noncitizens who are legally residing in the U.S. and those who are illegal residents. Jazil argued that the Equal Protection clause doesn&#8217;t require a distinction between &#8220;citizens and aliens,&#8221; and that the inequities of singling out legal resident aliens &#8220;simply aren’t applicable when registering voters just as they aren’t applicable when teachers and cops are concerned.&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Britt Grant, a Donald Trump appointee, appeared to be persuaded by this argument. He asked the plaintiff groups why their work shouldn&#8217;t fall under the political function exception if it&#8217;s as crucial to the democratic process as they claim. Representing the Florida State Conference of Branches and Youth Units of the NAACP, attorney Abha Khanna argued that such an exception applies only to those in charge of policymaking decisions or who have &#8220;routine exercise of authority.&#8221; Individuals working for a voter registration organization, Khanna said, merely &#8220;deliver a form from one place to another — and that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</span></p>

Baker pleaded no contest this past week in Sumter County Court to a charge of voter fraud. She has been placed on probation for one year and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. Baker was arrested Aug. 31 following a complaint filed by Sumter County Supervisor of Elections William Keen. Baker had filled out a voter registration application on Aug. 16. She is a convicted felon with a history of arrests dating back to 2010. </span></p>

Common Cause Indiana, the League of Women Voters of Indiana and the Madison County NAACP filed the motion. The lawsuit, which was filed in June, said the Anderson City Council violated state and federal law and went against the “one person, one vote” idea of districting by voting not to redraw districts based on the 2020 Census. The groups have said the statistical deviation between the smallest and largest current districts in the Anderson Council is 45 percent, with other court cases previously ruling 10 percent violates the “one person, one vote” idea. The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit and a motion for a preliminary injunction ahead of the November 2023 municipal elections – hoping to declare the current districts unconstitutional.</span></p>

The national and state GOP plaintiffs argue that a</span><a href="https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2020/pdf/history/HB/HB1521.xml"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2020 state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing local election workers to count mail-in absentee ballots for up to five days after the election date violates federal law because only Congress sets the timeframe for when votes can be processed. The Mississippi law currently permits election workers to count mail-in votes if the ballots were postmarked by the election date. In 2020, the Republican supermajority state House passed the bill in question by a vote of 97-14, and the Republican supermajority Senate passed the bill by a vote of 31-14. It was then signed into law by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves. The plaintiffs, represented by former state GOP director Spencer Ritchie, argue that the five-day window should be suspended for all federal elections and only count mail-in absentee votes that arrive by Election Day.</span></p>

Yost found the amendment&#8217;s title — “Ohio Voters Bill of Rights” — was “highly misleading and misrepresentative” of the measure&#8217;s contents, even as he acknowledged that his office had previously certified identical language. It certified a Nursing Facility Patients’ Bill of Rights in 2021 and another Ohio Voters Bill of Rights in 2014. The Ohio Voters Bill of Rights calls for enshrining the right for all Ohioans to vote safely and securely in the state constitution. The proposed amendment includes automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration and expanded early voting options and locations. The push for the amendment follows Ohio’s enactment last year of sweeping new election restrictions, including a strict photo ID requirement and shortened windows after Election Day for returning and curing ballots. “In the past, this Office has not always rigorously evaluated whether the title fairly or truthfully summarized a given proposed amendment,” Yost wrote the coalition&#8217;s attorney. “But recent authority from the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that the title for a ballot initiative is material to voters.” Members of the voting rights coalition — which includes the NAACP&#8217;s Ohio chapter, the Ohio Unity Coalition, the A. Philip Randolph Institute and the Ohio Organizing Collaborative — said in a statement that they were dismayed by Yost&#8217;s decision. They said he had rejected their revised language “despite our dutiful compliance with his previous objections.”</span></p>

The lawsuit is expected to be one of many to litigate voting and election rules in a battleground state that is critical to 2024’s presidential contest. In the 2020 election, Trump’s campaign, state officials, the Democratic Party and others fought over the rules for mail-in voting, and Trump later baselessly smeared the election as rife with fraud and tried unsuccessfully to overturn it. The lawsuit, filed by 24 Republican state lawmakers, challenges the legality of a 2021 executive order by Biden that orders federal agencies to consider ways to expand access to registering to vote and information about voting. It also challenges two state-level actions. One is last fall’s introduction of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic voter registration in Pennsylvania by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro. The other is a 2018 state directive under then-Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. That directive said that counties cannot reject a voter registration application solely on the basis of finding that the applicant submitted a driver’s license number or Social Security number digits that don’t match what is in a government agency database.</span></p>

Since 2020, Republicans have been fighting in court to tighten the rules to limit how many absentee ballots can be accepted. State law requires absentee ballots to be submitted with a witness’ signature and address on the outside envelope that contains the ballot. Three separate lawsuits were filed related to those rules. Nilsestuen earlier this month ruled, in two cases brought by liberals, that a ballot can still be accepted even if a witness address omits municipalities and ZIP codes, or simply say “same” or “ditto” if the witness lives with the voter. The Republican Legislature fought to have the case dismissed. Nilsestuen this week ordered the elections commission to approve guidance no later than Feb. 9 that would direct clerks on what ballots can be accepted. Nilsestuen stressed that he wanted to move quickly given the upcoming Feb. 20 primary for local elections. Wisconsin&#8217;s presidential primary and spring general election is April 2. The Republican-dominated Legislature&#8217;s attorney, Kevin LeRoy, said he planned to ask for the ruling to be put on hold pending an appeal. The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on that. The case is expected to go to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</span></p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://issueone.org/events/down-the-rabbit-hole-how-social-media-is-designed-to-radicalize-its-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the Rabbit Hole: How Social Media is Designed to Radicalize its Users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Social media platforms are designed to maximize users’ attention. In order to do so, they employ algorithms that send users down a rabbit hole that promotes the most inflammatory content, including mis/disinformation, hate speech, and extremist content. Online, people often find themselves pulled farther from the political center, and find it increasingly difficult to view less radical content. The result is a polarized electorate and an information environment poisoned with false information. Authoritarian regimes and domestic bad actors have seized upon this vulnerability, exploiting it to promote their view of the world or divide Americans. This phenomenon is not benign and has already changed the way we observe conflict between Israel and Hamas, and other sociopolitical contentions around the world. On February 2nd, join us for an event hosted by Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media to hear experts in national security, technology, and democracy discuss the effect of social media on domestic and foreign extremism, how the algorithms are designed to radicalize users, and what solutions are necessary to protect our democracy from extremism. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 2, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

How are election officials – from secretaries of state to election directors and local officials – preparing to face this cycle? What lessons from past cycles are changing how we conduct elections? And how can election officials build greater community trust and promote a fair, transparent election process? At the start of this critical year, join the Election Center to hear from a diverse roster of election officials on how they are preparing to face the 2024 elections and ensure a fair and accurate count. Election Center staff will present our newly detailed Standards of Conduct and outline how these long standing principles can be used today to build public trust in elections. Panelists will discuss how their past experiences, including harassment, threats, disinformation, and more, inform their approach to 2024. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 6, 8am-11am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</span></p>

Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Speakers: Renée DiResta, Technical Research Manager</span><a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stanford Internet Observatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Kate Klonick, Associate Professor ·</span><a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/law/faculty/kate-klonick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. John&#8217;s University, School of Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Charles H.

<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/generative-ai-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessing the Impact of Generative AI and Other Online Threats in a Historic Election Year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 2024 will be a historic year for elections. Democracies comprising 41% of the world’s population and 42% of its GDP will cast their votes around the globe. Yet recent shifts in the information space threaten to turbocharge the spread of false content at the same time major social media platforms are scaling back investments in content moderation. The widespread proliferation of generative AI systems has drastically reduced barriers to creating and disseminating wholly fabricated content or coordinating cyberattacks against political campaigns and electoral infrastructure. Many are concerned that a wave of AI-generated content could derail democratic processes globally. However, it remains to be seen whether these fears will be borne out in practice or how this technology will impact the information space over the coming year. On February 7, the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative at Brookings will host an expert panel moderated by Valerie Wirtschafter to assess the effects of generative AI and other novel online threats to global elections in 2024, disentangle the facts from the hype, and discuss recommendations for tech companies and policymakers to address these challenges. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 7, 2:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2024/real-right-vote-richard-l-hasen-erwin-chemerinsky"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Real Right to Vote with Richard L. Hasen &amp; Erwin Chemerinsky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Throughout history, too many Americans have faced needless barriers to voting. Part of the blame falls on the U.S. Constitution, which does not contain an affirmative right to vote. Richard L. Hasen, Director of UCLA Law’s Safeguarding Democracy Project and author of the new book A Real Right to Vote: How a Constitutional Amendment Can Safeguard American Democracy, draws on troubling stories of state attempts to disenfranchise military voters, women, African Americans, students, former felons, Native Americans, and others, arguing that American democracy can and should do better. Joining Hasen is Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and leading scholar of the U.S. Constitution, Erwin Chemerinsky. Co-presented with the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law. Limited books will be available for purchase. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 15, 7:30pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Los Angeles.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/events/misinformation-and-disinformation-is-democracy-in-crisis-and-is-it-at-risk-of-failing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misinformation and Disinformation: Is Democracy in Crisis, and Is It at Risk of Failing?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: According to a 2023</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/poll-democracy-partisanship-trump-biden-trust-221f2b4f6cf9805f766c9a8395b9539d"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only one in 10 Americans have confidence and give high ratings to the way that democracy is conducted in the United States. Nearly 50 percent of those surveyed believe our country’s democracy is flawed. People are concerned about the state of elections, the performance of Congress, inflation, crime, and the southern border. Fear about these issues is exacerbated by rampant misinformation and disinformation. Join us for an in-person and virtual panel that will provide insights and solutions to these threats to democracy. Panelists will also explain the best way to fight misinformation and disinformation before elections this year. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 22, 12pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online and in-person in Washington, DC. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/real-right-vote-conversation-rick-hasen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Real Right to Vote: A Conversation with Rick Hasen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For many Americans, the freedom to vote is unfairly conditioned on where they live, the color of their skin, or how much money they have. Several amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been passed over the decades extending this fundamental freedom to voters of color, women and citizens who are 18 years of age. However, the lack of an overarching amendment guaranteeing the right to vote leaves our democracy vulnerable because the freedom to vote is treated differently depending on where voters live and how courts handle disputes over their rights.  In his new book, “A Real Right to Vote,” Law Professor Rick Hasen explains why a constitutional amendment is necessary, and why now is the time to begin a campaign in support of such an amendment. As Professor Hasen explains, enshrining voting rights in the Constitution will benefit all Americans, no matter which side of the political aisle they sit on.   In discussion with Campaign Legal Center President Trevor Potter, Professor Hasen will describe his vision for the freedoms an amendment on voting rights would protect, its potential impact on our democracy, and why he believes it’s possible to pass such an amendment, despite a challenging political climate. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 29, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
