							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Super Tuesday 2024</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local elections officials conducted primaries in 15 states this week</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10582" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign-300x239.png" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign-300x239.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign-768x612.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign.png 948w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />It was </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2024/03-05/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in America this week with voters in 15 states heading to the polls, mailboxes and drop boxes to cast their ballots for the Presidential Preference Primary and for  some, in state and local primaries as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in Alabama, Alaska (Republican primary), Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia cast their ballots this week. Additionally, Democrats in Iowa completed  a party-run, by-mail primary/caucus hybrid. And Democrats will caucus on American Samoa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From bomb threats to swarming bees to </span><a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/politics/elections/collin-county-voters-long-line/287-1ea80728-551d-4283-b954-b7c1a21e344e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.whqr.org/local/2024-03-05/pender-county-board-of-elections-says-voting-machine-issues-are-being-handled"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://fox23maine.com/news/local/election-workers-note-some-confusion-during-maine-first-ever-semi-open-primary-secretary-state-shenna-bellows-unenrolled-democratic-republican-green-independent-party"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questions about new voting laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, overall it was a pretty typical election day with no major issues reported. Also, for those wondering, there were no reports that we could find of any cars into polling places.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As r</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1236201877/super-tuesday-was-the-biggest-test-yet-this-year-of-america-s-voting-systems"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eported on NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indications are that things generally went smoothly — good news in a year that has experts worried about the state of democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at some of the things that made the news on Tuesday and since then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Security</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />According to the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) there were no credible threats to Tuesday’s elections. Senior officials from the agency spoke with the media late morning and then at 8pm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not have any specific or credible threats to today’s election operations,” a CISA senior official said, adding that the agency stood ready to assist with any security-related issues that might emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While CISA reported no credible threats to elections on Tuesday, for a brief period of time numerous social media sites were down including all of the Meta suite of sites (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads). A senior official with CISA said there was no election nexus and while they were aware of the problem,</span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-no-credible-election-threats-and-no-contact-with-social-media-companies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they had not spoken to any of the companies impacted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick look at the website formerly known as Twitter, while the other socials were down, showed a host of conspiracy theories already percolating about the downed social media sites and the election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at a fireside chat hosted by the Professional Services Council (PSC), Virginia Senator Mark Warner (D) expressed his concerns about election security in 2024, touching particularly on the impacts a U.S. Supreme Court case known as</span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=9BA5CAC9-84DB-40D7-A30A-E05CFA154338"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Murthy v. Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may have. The case examines whether Administration officials violated the First Amendment in their communications with social media companies regarding COVID-19 and election content. This case will help to decide what role the federal government can play in communicating with private social media companies when it comes to foreign threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration has been very cautious about telling their lawyers to allow that communication to take place,” the senator said. “So, as of two weeks ago, there has been no communication since July.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/06/north-carolina-voter-id-rules-primary-election/72858469007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were required to show a </span><a href="https://triad-city-beat.com/on-primary-election-day-a-look-at-how-the-new-voter-id-law-and-poll-observers-are-impacting-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photo ID </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in order to vote for the first time in a statewide election this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10028" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCDriversLicense-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCDriversLicense-300x183.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCDriversLicense.png 542w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Karen Brinson Bell, executive director with the State Board of Elections, told reporters at a press conference on the morning of Super Tuesday that no major issues with photo ID requirements had been reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell said that of the 695,000 North Carolinians who voted early, 216 had to cast provisional ballots for reasons related to the photo ID requirement. “In other words, only about three out of every 10,000 voters had to vote a provisional ballot due to the photo ID requirement,” she said. “We believe this is a strong sign that the word is getting out that you should bring your ID to vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolina Public Press </span><a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/63398/smooth-voting-process-on-primary-day-in-nc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interviewed voters and election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in six N.C. counties: Orange, Chatham, Person, Durham, Wake and Harnett counties. The voting process was smooth and quick at most of the polling sites with few lines or delays. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in </span><a href="https://voiceofoc.org/2024/03/is-huntington-beach-about-to-introduce-voter-id/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huntington Beach, California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a voter ID ballot measure appeared headed for passage. At press time, just over 54% of voters are in favor of moving forward with voter ID, with a 3,000 vote lead. The new voter ID laws would not take effect until 2026 and would mandate voters show ID when going to vote at polling locations. Voters could still participate in mail-in voting without having to show ID.</span></p>
<p><strong>Harris County, Texas</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris County held its first statewide election since state law changed how and by whom elections are administered in the county. While it wasn’t perfect – is any election? – things did run much more smoothly than in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8105" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-768x593.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The</span><a href="https://abc13.com/texas-primary-election-results-harris-county-last-voter-how-late-can-you-vote-voting-totals/14495906/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last voter to cast their ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted at 10:13 p.m. according to County Clerk Teneshia Hudspeth. &#8220;No matter how many days of early voting you have, there are traditional people who procrastinate and wait until Election Day, and even wait between that 5 to 7 p.m. hour,&#8221; Hudspeth said. &#8220;And many will be running from the parking lot to get to the door to get their vote cast.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One issue that did generate some attention was when Kim Ogg, the Democratic district attorney in the county said she was turned away from the polls early Tuesday morning because her ballot had already been cast. Hudspeth said that Ogg’s life partner – with whom the district attorney shares an address – had inadvertently cast a ballot in Ogg’s name during early voting last week. Ogg, whose name was on Tuesday’s primary ballot, successfully voted later that day, but </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/05/politics/texas-voter-id-kim-ogg-houston/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she told CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the incident raises questions about how it happened in the first place.</span></p>
<p><strong>Issues in Alabama</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While local officials reported </span><a href="https://www.waff.com/video/2024/03/06/area-election-official-smooth-sailing-during-super-tuesday-primaries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively smooth sailing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the polls in Alabama on Tuesday, more than 6,000 voters in a newly formed congressional district drawn to heighten Black voting power in Alabama received postcards with incorrect voting information ahead of Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Snipes, chair of the Montgomery County Board of Registrars, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-voting-rights-black-voters-congress-19ded57858f3194634be74894c9f1f01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Associated Press </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">6,593 county voters received postcards listing the incorrect congressional district after the county’s election software misidentified some people living in the 2nd Congressional District as living in the 7th. Snipes said voters arriving at the polls were still able to vote for the correct candidates. The county had sent about 2,000 notices to affected voters as of Tuesday evening and will send out an additional 4,000 on Wednesday, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secretary of state’s office and the Southern Poverty Law Center </span><a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2024/03/06/splc-secretary-of-state-remain-at-odds-over-voter-misinformation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaged in a heated back and forth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over who was to blame for the mistake despite Snipes taking the blame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone who came to their precinct was able to vote for the correct candidates,” Snipes told the AP, attributing the incorrect information to a “software glitch” made when adjusting to the recent shift in state congressional districts. “This was a good-faith effort.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Ballot Counting</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6024" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ballot counting in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/05/california-vote-senate-primary-super-tuesday/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has always taken more than most other states. What’s different this Super Tuesday is that there seems to have been a concerted effort by </span><a href="https://www.cbs8.com/video/news/politics/elections/509-2a7473ce-565c-4bb9-b9fd-eb61f274b42c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">elections officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/us/politics/california-super-tuesday.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to explain exactly why it takes so long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think oftentimes what people don’t understand about the California election process is that the Legislature, by intent, has allowed voters to have every opportunity to cast a ballot and to get their ballot in,” said Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-05/election-senate-presidential-congress-why-take-so-long-count-votes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Los Angeles Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no counties in California, or any other jurisdiction for that matter, were hand-counting ballots on Tuesday, the Republican Party in </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2024/03/06/gillespie-county-hand-count-republican-primary-gop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one Texas county decided to give hand counting a go</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Super Tuesday and they quickly found out just what that means. Natalia Contrerarswith Votebeat has a great look at what happened when the Gillespie County Republican Party decided to hand count the roughly 8,000 ballots cast. Because Texas law requires that ballot counting not stop once it begins, the counting which began at 7:30 am on Tuesday did not finish until about 4:30 am on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You saw how this went,” Gillespie County Elections Administrator Jim Riley told Votebeat at 5 a.m. Wednesday, when all party members had departed the office. “This was a circus.” He said he’d withhold judgment on whether the count was accurate because he didn’t have eyes and ears in the rooms where it happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gillespie County was the second to last of the state’s 254 counties to report results, followed only by Harris County. Gillespie County had 13 GOP precincts to count, Harris County had nearly 1,200. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [A special shout-out to Natalia who </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2024/03/05/i-cast-my-first-vote-as-naturalized-us-citizen-green-card-reporter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cast her first vote as a U.S. citizen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week.] </span></p>
<p><strong>Issues at the Polls</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with every election, there were random issues at polling places. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.alxnow.com/2024/03/06/alexandria-director-of-elections-apologizes-for-israeli-flag-behind-voting-machine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria, Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director of Elections &amp; General Registrar Angela Maniglia-Turner had to issue an apology after complaints arose that a long-time polling place, the Beth El Hebrew Congregation, was displaying an Israeli flag. “The layout of the polling place was not meant in any way to send a political or religious message. To the extent that any voter was made to feel uncomfortable by the location of the voting equipment, we sincerely apologize,” Maniglia-Turner said in a statement. “The Beth El Hebrew Congregation has partnered with our office since 1964. During this time, we have cooperated with many diverse faith-based organizations to provide locations for Alexandria residents to cast their ballot and participate in the electoral process, while respecting the religious and cultural beliefs of our hosts.” Also in </span><a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/video/1421575"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County, Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bomb threat called into a high school serving as a polling place forced voting to move into the parking lot before the county was able to secure space in the middle school directly across the parking lot from the high school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An incident at a polling site prompted the </span><a href="https://www.wnct.com/local-news/incident-at-polling-site-prompts-response-by-onslow-county-sheriffs-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onslow County, North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sheriff’s Office to respond. Sheriff Chris Thomas confirmed that they were called to the polling center at Morton voting precinct at Grants Creek Missionary Baptist Church in Maysville. They were called after an incident between a voter and poll workers after the polls closed that raised alarm for the poll workers. There were no injuries and the ballots were safely transferred to the Onslow County Board of Elections without incident, Thomas said. The incident is still under investigation.

The researchers looked at nearly a billion voter records and compared the rate at which white and nonwhite Americans vote in elections. The study refers to the difference between white voters and other groups as the &#8220;turnout gap.&#8221; In three elections from 2018 to 2022, 43% of eligible white voters cast their ballots every time, while that figure for Black voters was 27%, 21% for Asian American voters and 19% for Hispanic voters,</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to the Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Across the U.S., the turnout gap between white and nonwhite voters is increasing for various reasons. But Brennan found that the turnout gap was growing faster in places formerly covered under Section 5 and that it was growing fastest between white and Black voters in those areas. &#8220;What we found was that these jurisdictions fell back into their pattern of adopting laws and policies that made voting difficult for people of color,&#8221; says Kareem Crayton, the center&#8217;s senior director for voting rights and representation.</span></p>

We’ve not had any concerns,” said Westmoreland County Election Bureau Director Greg McCloskey. “We’re not even down a single judge at this point. Over the last several years, we’ve made it a priority to improve the training of poll workers.” In fall 2021 after the county raised the pay for its more than 1,450 staffers who work just two days a year to log poll books, set up voting machines and ultimately return ballots to the courthouse for tallying. In early 2021, county poll workers were among the lowest paid in Pennsylvania, with judges earning day rates of $130 and others receiving just $95 to work the precincts for the 13-hour day. The commissioners, acting as the county’s elections board, approved a more than 80% increase in pay two years ago, raising judge’s salaries to $235 and other staffers to $175 for their day’s work. That now makes Westmoreland County’s poll workers among the highest paid in the state. Allegheny County’s nearly 6,700 poll workers who staff more than 1,300 precincts are paid between $150 to $175 as a result of pay hikes approved in 2021. “Our team is really happy with our numbers as compared to four years ago. Overall, the numbers are looking good,” said Allegheny County spokeswoman Abigail Gardner.</span></p>

Mike Garcia, R-Santa Clarita, has introduced H.R. 5189, the </span><a href="https://signalscv.com/2024/02/garcia-introduces-voter-id-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter Integrity and Defense Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would require voters to show photo identification. The Voter Integrity and Defense Act would condition the distribution of Help America Vote Act grants on states having voter ID laws. The bill does allow for states to make exceptions for military voters stationed overseas. The bill defines a voter ID law as a statute that requires the appropriate state or local election official to check a valid photo ID before providing a ballot for a federal election, and that requires any individual voting by mail to include a copy of their valid photo ID with their returned ballot. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 37 states already require some form of ID to vote. A valid photo ID as defined by the bill includes a valid state-issued driver’s license with a photo and expiration date; a valid state-issued identification card with a photo and expiration date; a valid United States passport; a valid military identification; and any other form of government-issued identification that the state may specify as a valid photo identification for the purposes of this legislation. </span></p>

Katie Hobbs will veto it. The bill is aimed at addressing conspiracy theories that the 2020 Arizona election was somehow stolen from then-President Donald Trump and that victories in the 2022 election were similarly swiped from several Republicans running for statewide offices.  Its sponsor, Republican Rep. Michael Carbone, of Buckeye, dubbed it the “Free, Fair and Transparent Elections Act,” and said the bill would make Arizona’s system of voting more like those in Florida and Illinois. He claimed that his bill would mean quicker release of results following elections, a point of contention for some who believe that a slower release of results means that fraud must have occurred.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/80412?SessionId=128"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2547</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Rachel Jones, R-Tucson, passed through the state House of Representatives on Feb. 6, by a vote of 31-24, with only Republicans in support. It was approved by the Senate Elections Committee on March 4 by a vote of 4-3, with Republican Sen. Ken Bennett, a former secretary of state, voting alongside the Democrats against the bill. The legislation would force a </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/03/04/republicans-want-to-limit-voting-to-1000-voter-precincts-arizona-would-need-more-than-4100/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">return to precinct-based voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — with only 1,000 registered voters in each precinct.  This would drastically increase the number of precinct locations open across the state, with Arizona counties concerned about finding enough physical locations, as well as enough poll workers, not to mention the increase in ballots cast that inevitably won’t be counted. The bill also would eliminate in-person early voting locations.</span></p>

Assemblymember Evan Low, the Cupertino Democrat who co-authored</span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB884"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assembly Bill 884</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said he hopes it will increase voter participation and strengthen democracy in California. “California is one of the most diverse states and leads the nation in language diversity,” he said, “so it is important that we lead the way to providing in-language ballots and voting materials to reduce barriers and enfranchise more Californians.” The bill, which passed the Assembly in late January and is before the Senate, would require California’s Secretary of State to identify the languages spoken by at least 10,000 voting-age individuals in a county who don’t speak English fluently, including groups not covered by current federal voting rights laws, such as Middle Eastern or African immigrants. The Secretary of State would then have to provide language assistance, including a toll-free hotline and funding for county language coordinators, in areas where the need is most acute.</span></p>

The bill (</span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/135/ByCategory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 135</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) cleared the chamber floor with unanimous support. If approved in the Senate, it will create new safeguards that the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) must abide by to ensure voters can only switch or leave a political party on purpose. Highland Beach Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman, who sponsored the measure with Delray Beach Rep. Mike Caruso, a fellow Republican, said DHSMV “glitches” may have accidentally deregistered hundreds of thousands of Florida voters from their chosen party. The problem had to do with DHSMV software that gave motorists seeking new or updated licenses to also update their voter registration. If they didn’t re-select their existing party, the system switched them to no-party affiliation (NPA). An untold number of voters remained unaware of the party switch until they tried casting ballots in a Primary Election and were barred from doing so, according to Gossett-Seidman, who said the issue went uncorrected for the past seven to eight years.</span></p>

It passed committee with only one from the majority party in opposition through Rep. Christopher Allgood (R-Caldwell). Allgood said he opposed the bill because Secretary of State Phil McGrane was not included in the bill or consulted by bill sponsors. &#8220;It&#8217;s fairly unique in terms of legislation, because it&#8217;s all housed within the Attorney General&#8217;s Office,&#8221; Secretary of State Phil McGrane said. &#8220;It raises questions about whether we&#8217;re enforcing the laws as the way they are. And I can say, at the local level we are.&#8221; The legislation is modeled after other states, according to McGrane. Florida, for example, recently created a similar office. However, the Sunshine State organized the office to report to the Secretary. McGrane prefers that method. &#8220;We do the investigative work, we reach out to law enforcement, not to prosecutors or the Attorney General to continue to do that legal legwork, and then it gets passed off to the attorneys to go and force it in the courtroom. And really, that&#8217;s probably what we need to see happen here,&#8221; McGrane said. &#8220;It will be impossible for this group to do any of its work without working with us who are working in elections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill </span><a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/politics-government/2024-03-06/idaho-boise-absentee-voting-restrictions-head-to-house-floor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restricting Idaho’s long standing practice of no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is moving forward, though it could see some changes. Rep. Mike Kingsley (R-Lewiston) has presented his bill as aiming to halt political parties from mailing pre-filled absentee ballot requests to registered voters. But it would also only allow someone to request an absentee ballot if they’re going to be out of town on Election Day, or if they have an illness or disability preventing them from going to the polls. “Absentee balloting was meant to be something that was rare, that it wasn’t something to be depended upon,” Kingsley said. Secretary of State Phil McGrane and the group representing Idaho’s county clerks both oppose the measure as well. McGrane said the vast majority of Idahoans vote in-person on Election Day, with 25% of people using absentee ballots or voting early. “I think there’s often a misconception that we have to restrict access to increase security,” McGrane said. County clerks, he said, already verify signatures to ensure absentee ballots aren’t being abused. Those that don’t match are thrown out and attempts are made to contact the voter.</span></p>

While the bill provides slightly more time for county auditors to mail absentee ballots to voters — an increase from 20 to 22 days before an election. Under current law, absentee ballots are accepted on Election Day upon arrival until polls close. Other changes in the bill include a ban on ranked-choice voting systems and the creation of a voter registration database verification pilot program, as well as measures related to ballot challenges for federal candidates. In Iowa, candidates for federal office convicted of felonies would still be eligible to run for office under the legislation, and objections to the eligibility of a candidate would be limited to whether their petition or certification of nomination meets legal requirements.

Senate President Ty Masterson expressed empathy with Republican senators eager for sweeping change to Kansas election security law, but cautioned against weighing down the bill to the point it became veto bait for Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. His advice wasn’t accepted, but the subsequent 18-22 final action vote on Senate Bill 365 sent the chamber back to the drawing board. Under Kansas election law adopted in 2017, the deadline for getting advance ballots to county election offices by U.S. mail was the third day following an election. Those ballot envelopes had to be postmarked before the close of polls on Election Day. However, SB 365 would impose a 7 p.m. Election Day deadline for delivery of ballots. That would compare to the deadline for for in-person voting. The amendment, which ultimately sank the bill would require each ballot in the paper-only voting system to carry a unique serial number as well as a watermark.</span></p>

The resolution failed to pass in a 62-78 mostly party-line vote. Rep. Kimberly Pomerleau of Standish was the only Republican to vote against impeachment. Bellows, a Democrat, disqualified Trump from Maine’s Republican primary ballot in December after citizens challenged his eligibility under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was adopted after the Civil War to prevent those who took an oath “to support the Constitution of the United States” from holding office again if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Bellows sided with the challengers, disqualifying Trump because of his involvement in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, however she suspended her decision pending appeal and Maine’s top court declined to weigh in until the Supreme Court decided on the Colorado case — leaving Trump on the ballot in the interim. Similar to the impeachment January effort, the resolution heard this week called for a special committee investigation of Bellows’ decision to not recuse herself from ruling on Trump’s eligibility due to alleged bias from her role as a Maine presidential elector for President Joe Biden in 2020.  The resolution added allegations of the “unilateral disenfranchisement of voters and candidate Donald J. Trump and her willful violation of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.”</span></p>

If she approves them, they won&#8217;t take effect immediately due to GOP opposition. In order to take immediate effect, bills need two-thirds support.

Cheikh Taylor of Starkville said. “In my opinion, this is one of the greatest bipartisan bills we’ve passed since changing the state flag.” Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of any of 10 types of felonies lose their voting rights for life. Various opinions from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office expanded the list of disenfranchising felonies to 23. The House measure would allow people convicted of nonviolent offenses such as bad check writing, perjury, and bribery to obtain their suffrage if they have not been convicted of another felony for five years after completing their sentence and paying any outstanding fines.  But people convicted of murder, arson, armed robbery, carjacking, embezzling more than $5,000, rape, statutory rape, and voter fraud would still lose their voting rights for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Elections Committee advanced a measure that would allow Mississippi voters to </span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2024/03/05/early-voting-measure-advances-senate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cast ballots — in person — for 15 days prior to an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the Saturday before. “Mississippi is one of only three states that doesn’t allow early voting,” said Senate Elections Chairman Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave and author of</span><a href="https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2024/pdf/history/SB/SB2580.xml"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB2580</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “… This just allows more access to the ballot in a very secure way … This would help so many — doctors, first responders, others, some single parents.” The bill passed the committee on a voice vote Tuesday, the deadline for such action on the bill. Mississippi allows in-person absentee voting before elections, but voters must meet criteria, such as being over 65 or disabled, or provide one of a handful of valid “excuses,” such as being out of town for work on election day and follow a long list of rules and procedures. The new measure would allow “no-excuse” voting for all registered voters. England said the new system would replace in-person absentee voting, but that mail-in absentee ballots would still be accepted.</span></p>

The measure would create a minimum of three new positions — a director and at least two investigators — in addition to a voter fraud hotline. The proposal would require the new office to submit an annual report to the governor and leaders of both the House and Senate before Jan. 15, detailing investigations of alleged violations that occurred during the previous calendar year. It would also provide the attorney general statewide authority to investigate any voter fraud allegations. The attorney general would have concurrent jurisdiction along with local prosecuting authorities, according to the proposal.</span></p>

The legislation, LB1262, was introduced by Sen. Jen Day of Omaha. It would create a Native American Voting Rights Commission within the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs. The new commission would contract with a consultant with expertise in tribal issues to conduct a study to determine barriers to voting and equal representation for Indian tribes in Nebraska. As introduced, the bill would require the commission to submit an annual report and ongoing policy recommendations to the Legislature beginning Dec. 31, 2025. Day said she would offer an amendment to change that requirement to a one-time report. Several other states have conducted similar studies or used a national report to implement recommendations for removing voting barriers, she said, and LB1262 could provide the same opportunity for Nebraska. “By asking the right questions, our state will be able to discover the barriers to voting [that are] particular to Nebraska’s tribal lands so we can explore policy changes that would improve accessibility for all Native Americans in our state,” Day said. LB1262 would help promote the “active empowerment” of Native American voters, Lenz said, by taking the state’s history and voting trends into account when determining barriers to Native voter participation and finding ways to remove those barriers. The committee took no immediate action on LB1262.</span></p>

The House Election Law Committee deadlocked twice over a bill that would require everyone to present an ID to vote. Critics say the bill goes too far and will disenfranchise many older voters who no longer carry an ID. Last year, the House tabled a similar bill without taking action on it. Currently, if a voter does not have an ID with them, they can fill out an affidavit ballot. If they fail to prove their citizenship and residency within seven days, their ballot will be thrown out and their vote will not be counted.</span></p>

The bill follows the arrest last month of Craig Callaway, a former Atlantic City Council President and veteran ballot harvester.   Federal prosecutors allege that Calaway set up a fraudulent scheme to illegally harvest and cast vote-by-mail ballots in the 2022 general election. “This bill represents a necessary change so that our state can recognize that to carry a ballot is to carry a voter’s voice across the threshold of anonymity and give it life independent of its own, and anyone who seeks to manipulate this sacred duty should be held accountable for that nefarious act,” Stanley said. Stanley’s bill proposes that ‘no person who serves as an authorized messenger or as a bearer shall accept consideration of any sort to serve, nor shall any person offer or give consideration of any sort to an authorized messenger or a bearer to serve.”   The proposed law defines consideration as cash, goods, services, or intangible property.</span></p>

Then it failed 24-46 in the House. According to South Dakota Searchlight, the assertion that election officials are not being threatened or intimidated in South Dakota helped derail the legislation. Rep. Rebecca Reimer, R-Chamberlain, spoke in favor of the bill on the House floor. Rep. Bethany Soye, R-Sioux Falls, asked her, “Did you say that this has been happening in our state, that poll workers are being threatened?” Reimer answered, “I did not say poll workers are being threatened, but they have in other states. And no, I do not have an example for you.” Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, picked up on Soye’s point later in the debate. “We haven’t had any of this in South Dakota,” May said. “None of this.”</span></p>

Ann Millner, R-Ogden. But during debate, several senators argued for allowing the pilot program to expire on its own in 2026. Sen.

Williston Rep. Angela Arsenault has introduced a bill that would create a new misdemeanor crime for anyone caught possessing a gun at the ballot box in future elections. “We have an opportunity now … to preserve Vermont’s tradition of exercising one of the most sacred of rights — to cast our ballots at the polls free from intimidation,” she said. Montpelier City Councilor Cary Brown said Vermont already has a law against voter intimidation. But she said there’s no explicit prohibition against bringing a gun to the ballot box. “The law needs to spell out that the common sense understanding is that many people will feel frightened and feel intimidated if they have to vote with people with guns around them,” Brown said.</span></p>

People who run elections in Virginia may soon be required to process absentee ballots within three business days after they’re received in the mail or in a drop box. That&#8217;s the idea behind a bill introduced by Republican Delegate Otto Wachsmann of Sussex, who says a constituent came to him with concerns that absentee ballots were stacking up. &#8220;The whole intent of this bill is to make sure that these provisional ballots don&#8217;t stack up in the registrar&#8217;s office,&#8221; Wachsmann says. &#8220;So then, more voters will be informed earlier so then they can come back and cure the ballot, so we have more ballots that are cast as ballots and not as provisional ballots at the end.&#8221; The bill passed the House without opposition and is currently being considered in the Senate, where Senator Aaron Rouse is chairman of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee.</span></p>

Bolton concluded Arizona legislators did not discriminate when they adopted the laws and the state does have an interest in preventing voter fraud and limiting voting to those individuals eligible to vote. “Considering the evidence as a whole, the court concludes that Arizona’s interests in preventing non-citizens from voting and promoting public confidence in Arizona’s elections outweighs the limited burden voters might encounter when required to provide (documentary proof of citizenship),” she wrote. However, Bolton said the requirement for individuals using a state registration form to include their state or country of birth violates a provision of the Civil Rights Act and a section of the National Voter Registration Act. Doing so, she explained, would result in the investigation of only naturalized citizens based on county recorders’ subjective beliefs that a naturalized individual is a non-citizen. The lengthy ruling summarizes testimony from a bench trial in late 2023 at which experts testified about Arizona&#8217;s history of voting discrimination. That included literacy tests effectively precluding Native American and Latino voters from participating and voter roll purges in the 1970s and 80s that created barriers for minorities to re-register to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5220" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag-300x203.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Colorado:</strong> In a 9-0 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1230453714/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ballot"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restored Donald Trump to the Colorado primary ballot,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling that the state lacked authority to disqualify him after his actions three years ago during the siege on the U.S. Capitol. The unanimous decision came only weeks after the justices heard oral arguments in the politically sensitive case that put the high court in the middle of the 2024 presidential election. And it comes a week after the court said it would hear arguments in a case that seeks to answer whether Trump enjoys broad immunity for his actions on Jan. 6. Six Colorado voters argued that Trump had run afoul of a post-Civil War law that bars people who took an oath to support the Constitution from engaging in an insurrection or rebellion. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment has never been used against a presidential candidate, and it&#8217;s only been deployed eight times since the 1860s. That sparse record contributed to</span><a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=24455191-23-719_1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the high court&#8217;s decision Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse,&#8221; the court decision concluded. While the justices came together to agree Trump could not be removed from the Colorado ballot, they differed as to how far they would go. The three liberal-leaning justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote to criticize the majority for deciding &#8220;momentous and difficult issues unnecessarily.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Court Chief Judge Philip A. Brimmer </span><a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/courts/federal-judge-declines-to-reopen-case-against-jena-griswold-over-voter-data/article_44643034-d744-11ee-852e-17e6185993c5.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to reopen a conservative group&#8217;s lawsuit against Secretary of State Jena Griswold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, following revelations that her office misstated the number of voters recently removed from the state&#8217;s registration lists due to address changes. Initially Judicial Watch filed suit against Griswold, joined by the American Constitution Party and Libertarian Party in Colorado, plus three Colorado voters. The plaintiffs alleged her office was failing to discontinue the registrations of people who neither voted nor responded to inquiries about their change of address, as required by the National Voter Registration Act. Specifically, they calculated the number of registered voters in several low-population counties exceeded the number of voting-age citizens. In August 2021, Brimmer rejected the state&#8217;s request to dismiss the lawsuit, finding the plaintiffs had alleged a legitimate injury: undermined confidence in the integrity of Colorado&#8217;s elections. After the parties exchanged evidence, they informed Brimmer in March 2023 they had reached a settlement. Griswold&#8217;s office, on April 1 of each year, would provide Judicial Watch with the latest data on discontinued voter registrations stemming from address changes. Then in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion with Brimmer alerting him to &#8220;new evidence.&#8221;  </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cod-1_20-cv-02992/pdf/USCOURTS-cod-1_20-cv-02992-3.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Feb. 27 order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Brimmer rejected the plaintiffs&#8217; request to reopen the case. &#8220;Here, the Court explicitly declined to retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement because the parties did not identify any exceptional reason why the Court should retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement,&#8221; he reminded them. &#8220;Moreover, plaintiffs do not now identify any exceptional reason why the Court should retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement.&#8221;</span></p>

Kennedy Jr. will </span><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2024-03-04/judge-denies-kennedys-bid-to-solicit-ballot-signatures-at-maine-polling-places-on-super-tuesday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not be allowed to collect ballot signatures at Maine polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during Tuesday&#8217;s primary election. Kennedy&#8217;s campaign sued Secretary of State Shenna Bellows in February for enforcing the state&#8217;s restriction on candidates gathering signatures at polling places if the election is for the same office that the candidate is seeking. The campaign alleged that Bellows violated the Constitution&#8217;s Equal Protection Clause, but Woodcock ruled that Kennedy will still be able to collect signatures during the June primary election and that the state had a compelling interest to protect this week’s presidential primary against influencing voters. Woodcock denied the campaign&#8217;s request for an injunction.</span></p>

The state&#8217;s multi-layered approach for identifying dead voters and removing them meets and exceeds the &#8220;reasonable effort&#8221; required under federal election law, Beckering wrote while dismissing the suit brought by the Alexandria, Va.-based Public Interest Legal Foundation. &#8220;After conducting more than nine months of discovery into the many facets of Michigan’s program for the removal of deceased registrants, PILF (Public Interest Legal Foundation) has identified no genuine issue for trial regarding its claim that the program is not reasonable,&#8221; Beckering wrote. Beckering also dismissed complaints from PILF regarding Benson&#8217;s production of records the foundation had requested, noting PILF&#8217;s initial request was delayed by the 2020 election but eventually was satisfied.</span></p>

The court ruled 5-2 in favor of Secretary of State Al Schmidt, saying that researcher Heather Honey and others were not entitled to the records from Lycoming County for the 2020 General Election. Pennsylvania’s Elections Code says county election records are public “except the contents of ballot boxes and voting machines and records of assisted voters.” The law does not define voting machines, however. Honey’s October 2021 request under the state’s Right-to-Know Law was turned down by the county elections office, a decision upheld by the state Office of Open Records before a Lycoming County judge ruled the public is entitled to the records. The Commonwealth Court majority ruled Monday that cast vote records are the “electronic, modern-day equivalent” of all the votes in a traditional ballot box and the optical scanners are considered voting machines under state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">York County faces a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union alleging that election officials </span><a href="https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/2024/03/06/york-county-faces-lawsuit-alleging-it-denied-entry-to-nonpartisan-elections-observer/72865818007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refused to allow a nonpartisan observer to monitor vote canvassing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the November 2023 election. The suit alleges that a resident was refused access as an independent observer by the deputy director of the county’s election office because the resident didn’t have a watcher’s certificate. That refusal violated the state&#8217;s election law, which does require such certificates for political parties and candidates, the ACLU contends. Greg Monskie, York County&#8217;s chief clerk, told The York Dispatch that he can&#8217;t comment on pending litigation, but added that county officials &#8220;are prepared to defend this lawsuit.&#8221; ACLU of Pennsylvania Executive Director Mike Lee said it&#8217;s essential for the public to have access to vote canvasses to ensure the integrity of elections and to counter misinformation. “Transparency is vital to the health of our democracy,” Lee said, in a written statement, “and transparency through residents’ canvass have made recent elections have been some of the safest and most secure in United States history.”</span></p>

Former Ambassador to Poland and longtime Tennessee Republican politician Victor Ashe sued state election officials in November, claiming the law is so vague that he could be prosecuted for voting in a Republican primary. Because Tennessee voters are not registered by party, Ashe and other plaintiffs argued the laws invites arbitrary enforcement and are likely to intimidate otherwise legitimate voters. The laws do not define what it means to be a bona fide party member or to declare allegiance to a party, and they don’t say how long that allegiance must last. Richardson dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Ashe, real estate developer Phil Lawson, and the League of Women Voters of Tennessee lack standing to sue. Richardson found that their claims of potential injury were too speculative. </span></p>

The Fellowship Coordinator is a key member of our team. They are charged with quickly solidifying and deploying a program to recruit students to serve as poll workers across five states ahead of the November 2024 elections. The Fellowship Coordinator will supervise a team of five Supervising Fellows who will assist them and CVP State Coordinators in training and support CVP Democracy Fellows who receive an additional stipend to complete state-specific WorkElections recruitment for poll workers.  This position reports to the CVP Curriculum and Research Manager with additional support from the National Special Projects Manager.  Fair Elections Center’s Campus Vote Project (CVP) was launched in 2012 to expand our work on student voting issues.We work with universities, community colleges, faculty, students, and election officials to reduce barriers to student voting. CVP helps campuses institutionalize reforms that empower students with the information they need to register and vote. Campus Vote Project has three main areas of focus: institutionalizing voter engagement, providing up-to-date election information, and developing student leaders. Fair Elections Center also began</span><a href="https://workelections.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WorkElections.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address a struggle that many local election officials face: recruiting a sufficient number of poll workers – particularly those with in-demand technological and language skills, to help voters on Election Day. The online tool collects poll worker requirements and applications for thousands of jurisdictions across the country, providing a central source of simplified information for interested individuals who may not know how or where to apply.  WorkElections seeks to facilitate poll worker recruitment to ensure that this year’s elections go as smoothly as possible. This position brings these two projects of Fair Elections Center together to further the missions of both: 1) by recruiting a pool of poll workers that are more representative of the communities they will serve, and  2) reducing barriers to student voting and welcoming more young voters into the democratic process. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply, </span><a href="https://www.fairelectionscenter.org/careers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
