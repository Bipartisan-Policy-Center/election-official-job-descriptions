<p><a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the National Association of Election Officials (NAEO), has hosted three convenings thus far in 2024. Most recently, officials gathered in Portland, Oregon, where we wrapped the workshop with an open session discussing the topics that attendees posted throughout the event [see Figures 1 and 4 below]. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week on </span><a href="http://electionline.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’re sharing the top concerns and priorities that emerged, reflecting thematic similarities that are faced by diverse election officials from across the country in jurisdictions big and small, rural and urban, and from across the political spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Security</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2020, most local election officials have implemented new election security measures in the face of increasing threats to officials, their staff, and, in some cases, voters. According to </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-finds-concerns-about-safety-political"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more than one in three local election officials have experienced threats, harassment, or abuse. Security, in all its forms, continues to be a prominent topic of discussion. Federal partners from the </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CISA) and the </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Assistance Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EAC) shared resources in Portland. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_11208" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11208" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11208" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15B-300x179.png" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15B-300x179.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15B-1024x612.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15B-768x459.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15B-1536x917.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15B-2048x1223.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11208" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2 Election Center</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Staffing</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few years many seasoned officials have left their posts due to retirements and career changes, often triggered by escalating threats. This departure of experience has left many offices with disparities in staff, which can exacerbate the lack of full-time election employees in rural areas, something that the team at the </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EVIC) at Reed College has studied in depth through their annual </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo_survey_project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of local election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to help counter this imbalance and loss of institutional knowledge is to open up election officials&#8217; training to junior and mid-level staff and cater these trainings to respective experience levels, as outlined by a </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Policy Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presentation in Portland. Their finding that the turnover in the workforce has been increasing over the last 20 years is troubling. However, the data on experience is encouraging: on average, those filling the vacancies have eight years of election experience — 11 years of experience in jurisdictions with over 100,000 voters.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11209" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11209" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11209" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15C-300x172.png" alt="" width="300" height="172" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15C-300x172.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15C-1024x586.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15C-768x440.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15C-1536x880.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Weekly5.15C-2048x1173.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11209" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3 Election Center</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>State Associations</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">State associations play a pivotal role in training new officials and fostering networking opportunities. However, these associations are grappling with significant challenges, particularly in funding and finding time for governance in addition to their official duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center’s annual April workshop has been devoted to state associations and state-based training since 2023. Association leadership and members shared strategies on association structure, training curriculum and formats, and content for conferences and convenings. Despite the challenges, many positive advancements and best practices are occurring nationwide. Focused training for new officials, mentorship and fellows/internship programs, and establishing executive leadership devoted to running the association all provide promising results. </span></p>

<p><strong>Logistics of Administration<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything old is new again! The perennial issues of finding and adequately training poll workers, locating sufficient polling locations, providing meaningful voter support in language assistance, and special accommodations continue to be big topics of discussion. </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> workshop highlighted the additional consideration of what impact, both positive and negative, AI will have on either easing or adding to the administrative workload in the 2024 election cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank choice voting administration was another top area of interest, second only to funding discussions. Veteran administrators shared lessons learned in their jurisdictions and provided insights into voter education and instruction and procedural issues like tabulation and tally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Funding</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding continues to be the main topic of interest among local election officials, gathering the most postings around funding opportunities for associations and the election office itself. Election professionals deserve adequate support in resources and sentiment. Funding election official training and professional development should not be contentious or controversial. Still, many election officials, particularly those in small- and medium-sized jurisdictions, find themselves in that situation. At Election Center, we are exploring new and innovative ways to address these inequities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a member of the National Association of Election Officials (NAEO), the </span><a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers information about how to join, member benefits, training, professional learning opportunities, and more. </span></p>

Overall it was a smooth day on Tuesday with few reports of problems. Most eyes were probably on </span><b>Nebraska</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which </span><a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/05/14/ne-officials-say-voting-went-mostly-smoothly-in-states-first-election-requiring-voter-id/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implemented photo voter ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the first time in a statewide election. “This has been a pretty smooth day,” said Steve Smith, spokesman for Civic Nebraska, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting voter rights and democracy. “We really didn’t know what to expect.” He said earlier outreach efforts by the Nebraska Secretary of State — whom he called the “MVP” of the day — and advocacy groups appeared to have helped educate voters about requirements under the recently passed law. Douglas County Elections Commissioner Brian Kruse said poll workers haven&#8217;t seen confusion about voter ID and phone lines open for questions are quiet. &#8220;A lot of our telephone operators are sitting around playing on their phones, reading things of that nature, </span><a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/omaha-douglas-county-voters-say-voter-id-is-law-self-explanatory/60794247"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s really been pretty quiet out there</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we&#8217;ve had some regular provisional envelopes so we always get questions about that,&#8221; Kruse said. Despite some concern ahead of Tuesday&#8217;s primary election, there was little confusion according to Hall County Election Commissioner Tracy Overstreet. She said the election was running smoothly in her area. “I&#8217;m a little bit surprised, because whenever you make a really substantive change after 20 years of training someone to do something, usually there&#8217;s a pretty big learning curve,” Overstreet said. “I was kind of anticipating a few more snags, maybe.” There were a few other isolated issues not related to voter ID on Tuesday. In Omaha, at least two polling places were </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/and-now-little-mood-voting-election-day-central-omaha"><span style="font-weight: 400;">without power </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for about two hours but voting was not impacted. In Douglas County, Election had to consult with the secretary of state&#8217;s office to confirm that anti abortion chalk drawings outside of a polling place was </span><a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/omaha-skutt-abortion-chalk-art-not-violation-electioneering/60789805"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not in violation of the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because there is no issue or candidate associated with abortion in the May primary. In </span><b>Maryland</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where</span><a href="https://www.wjla.com/news/local/maryland-primary-election-voting-voters-mail-in-ballots-in-person-voting-primary-day-elections-2024-md-board-of-elections-votes-counted-prince-georges-county-anne-arundel-county"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most voters chose to vote by mail </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead of at in-person polling places “One of the great things about our state is that we have free and fair elections and elections that people can trust. And also we</span><a href="https://wtop.com/maryland-election/2024/05/maryland-primary-voters-weigh-in-on-key-senate-house-races/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer multiple ways for people to be able to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whether you want to do mail-in ballots, whether you want to do early voting, the way my wife and I voted early, or if you want to come on a rainy day like today. So, we have a lot of options,” Gov. Wes Moore said. On primary day, there were some minor issues, but they were few and far between. In Baltimore City however, several polling places f</span><a href="https://www.wypr.org/wypr-news/2024-05-14/several-polls-open-late-in-baltimore-city-on-primary-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ailed to open at the 7am start time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the final site opening at 9:18am. The issues that delayed the start ranged from sites simply not being set up yet to a problem with a router needed to use the e-poll books. “You have people who sacrifice to make voting happen,” he said. “When we don&#8217;t open up on time, it&#8217;s very disappointing to me, … and it makes me question the process myself,” said Election Director Armstead Jones. Also in Baltimore City, an election judge</span><a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/primary-election-day-live-updates-polling-locations-maryland/60787121"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refused to allow the press into a polling place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where a mayoral candidate was casting her ballot–something the law allows. Jones said the judge will not be paid until she appears before the board of elections. It was also relatively quiet in </span><b>West Virginia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday as well. Secretary of State Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Communications Mike Queen told West Virginia Public Broadcasting mid-afternoon on primary election day to see what was </span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/live-blog-w-va-2024-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working well and what challenges were being met</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Queen said, so far, so good. He said 1,643 polling places opened this morning. “With the exception of just little glitches that you normally have, everything is going really well so far in all 55 counties.” Queen said the SOS started primary day planning 10 months ago, working with a network of 55 county clerks.  “We have 1,643 precincts online,” Queen said. “We’ve got backup generator systems with the National Guard on alert all day long in case there would be an electrical issue. The power companies are our partners on Election Day and all in with us in case there would be a problem.“ There were reports of </span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/live-blog-w-va-2024-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Huntington area. Many voters heading to polling places said they see casting a primary ballot, any ballot for that matter, as a civic obligation. “Every vote is important and you </span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/live-blog-w-va-2024-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to fulfill your civic duty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and come out and let your opinion be heard,” said voter Belinda Mundy. “I can remember from, as a child, my mom and dad always going to vote on Election Day. And it was a pretty big deal.”</span></p>

Garland cited a handful of cases over the past several years in which poll workers in Arizona, Michigan and Georgia — swing states in the presidential election — have faced death threats. In each instance, he said, federal prosecutors won convictions against the perpetrators and sentences of up to 3½ years in federal prison. “Each of these cases should serve as a warning — if you threaten to harm or kill an election worker, volunteer or official, the Justice Department will find you and we will hold you accountable,” said Garland, flanked by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. “The public servants who administer elections must be able to do their jobs without fearing for their safety or that of their family,” Garland said. “We will aggressively investigate and prosecute those who threaten election workers.” Since its inception in June 2021, the Election Threats Task Force has brought 17 prosecutions, scoring 13 convictions, Justice Department officials said. Among those cases, prosecutors won a guilty plea from a man who said an election worker in Michigan deserved a knife to the throat, and a conviction of a man who threatened a mass shooting against election workers in Arizona. Justice officials emphasized that they are also monitoring emerging threats, including the use of artificial intelligence to spread disinformation and propagate threats behind technology that can mask the identities of perpetrators. “Violent threats using AI are still violent threats,” Monaco said. “In these cases, the Department of Justice will seek enhanced sentences. … A threat to any election official, worker or volunteer is, at bottom, a threat to our democracy.”</span></p>

Officials are exploring how they can work together to report their aggregate ballot numbers in the days after Election Day following widespread confusion among voters in March’s primary election. The Chicago board tabulates ballots from voters living in the city, while the county clerk’s office counts the votes coming from constituents living in suburban Cook County. Since the two agencies operate independently, each one reports its own unofficial vote totals and number of ballots left to be counted each day after the election. The system forces voters to add the numbers together to get the full picture. Without that full picture, misinformation spread on social media about voter fraud in the State’s Attorney race. “We can only anticipate that the rhetoric is going to ramp up for November,” said Edmund Michalowski, the deputy clerk of elections for Cook County. “And when possible, we need to communicate with Chicago to make sure that we’re on the same page.” Michalowski said the two agencies will spend the coming months working out the logistics of reporting the numbers together. Max Bever, the director of public information for the Chicago Board of Elections said ideally the two sides could work out a system where the city numbers and aggregate numbers would appear side-by-side on the Chicago Board of Elections’ website. At minimum, Bever plans to add a link on the city board’s site that redirects to the county numbers.</span></p>

It is the first time a real woman has been memorialized at Wesley Bolin Plaza in its nearly 50 years of existence, according to Melanie Sturgeon, president of the Arizona Women&#8217;s History Alliance. &#8220;We finally broke the bronze ceiling!&#8221; Sturgeon proclaimed at a dedication ceremony. While other memorials represent women as a group, this is the first woman to be singled out for recognition on the plaza for her accomplishments. Munds became interested in the suffragist movement in the late 1890s. While raising three children, she joined efforts to secure the vote for women in what was then the Arizona territory. Munds became president of the Women’s Suffrage Association in 1909, Melcher said, bringing a &#8220;less traditional view&#8221; of the role than her predecessors.</span></p>

The </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/election-administrators-ai-house-senate-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Reps. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., would require the Election Assistance Commission to team with the National Institute of Standards and Technology on a report that delivers voluntary guidelines for election administrators on the related risks and benefits of AI. Houlahan said in a press release that the legislation — the House counterpart to a March bill from Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Susan Collins, R-Maine — aims to “strengthen trust and confidence” in the electoral system, something she called “a shared responsibility that transcends party lines.” “With the rise of artificial intelligence, we must equip our election administrators with the necessary tools and guidelines to safeguard our democratic process,” Houlahan said in a press release. “This bipartisan bill underscores our commitment to fair and secure elections by addressing the potential risks posed by AI, including misinformation dissemination and cybersecurity threats.” The bill calls on the EAC and NIST to deliver their report to Congress and state and local election offices within 60 days of its enactment. The report would also detail the cybersecurity risks of AI systems in elections. There are also callouts in the bill for the EAC and NIST to outline how election offices should respond to information generated and distributed by AI that compromises the sharing of accurate election information. The report would also detail how AI could impact the spread of election-related disinformation, undermining public confidence in the process.</span></p>

Kay Ivey (R) has signed legislation into law that bans </span><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/governor-ivey-signs-bill-banning-ranked-choice-voting-in-alabama/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Yellowhammer State. SB186, sponsored by State Sen. Arthur Orr (R-Decatur), passed by a 74-28 in the House after previously clearing the Senate by a 34-1 vote last month. The legislation states that “Ranked-choice voting shall not be used in determining the election or nomination of any candidate to any local, state, or federal office,” but doesn’t apply to “electors who are entitled to vote absentee ballot under the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.” “I am proud to sign this bill which takes another step towards ensuring the confidence in our elections,” Ivey said. “As our Secretary of State Wes Allen put it, ranked-choice voting makes winners out of losers. Not only is ranked-choice voting confusing to voters, it also limits their ability to directly elect the candidate of their choice. Voting should be simple, and this complicated and confusing method of voting has no place in Alabama’s elections.” The law will take effect October 1, 2024.</span></p>

It would require political candidates to clearly label advertisements that feature content generated by AI. That includes fake voices, videos and images created by a computer to look or sound like an individual, which are known as deepfakes. It is focused on identifying AI-generated political content, rather than controlling its distribution. Candidates who are subject to an undisclosed deepfake could pursue civil action under the bill. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1150"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 24-1150</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  After the 2020 election saw a slew of fake electors, Colorado lawmakers made it illegal to serve as a fake elector ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The law creates a fine of up to $10,000 for anyone who contributes to a fake elector scheme, and it would disqualify that person, if convicted, from holding public office in Colorado. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-072"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 24-72</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This bill would require county sheriffs to designate someone who would be responsible for informing confined individuals of their eligibility to vote and coordinating with the county clerk to set up a temporary, in-person voting center at their local county jail. The bill is the first of its kind in the nation. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1067"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 24-1067</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  A new Colorado law will require that access to the caucus nominating process is accessible to candidates with disabilities.  Sponsored by Rep. David Ortiz, a Littleton Democrat and the first Colorado legislator to use a wheelchair, the bill also requires that a virtual option remain available for any nominating process, as knocking on doors to gain petition signatures isn’t an accessible option for many people with disabilities. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-210"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 24-210</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  Colorado Senate President Steve Fenberg, a Boulder Democrat, led a second round of modifications to the state’s election laws. He sponsored</span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-276"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a similar bill last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making changes to Colorado election law.  One significant change would recalibrate the number of people who serve on a party’s vacancy committees — which select candidates for state House and Senate seats in the event of an opening — to ensure better proportionality across various districts. The 56-page bill makes many small changes to Colorado’s election code and the Fair Campaign Practices Act. Another change allows voters to file a complaint if they suspect a public official isn’t complying with financial disclosure requirements.</span></p>

Senate Bill 603 would allow recounts of precincts that have a mismatch between the number of ballots and the ballots issued to voters recorded in a polling place’s log or the ballots that were tabulated. If a candidate for office files for a recount petition, that candidate must file that recount petition in good faith and the number of votes requested to be recounted must at minimum be greater than the difference in votes between the petitioning candidate and the winning candidate, Chang said. Senate Bill 603 also clarifies that county canvassers would not investigate fraud. Senate Bill 603 would also raise recount filing fees. This would not only help boards of canvassers better afford recounts, but discourage candidates and ballot question committees from requesting recounts for elections with wide margins, in which a recount was unlikely to change the result of an election, the bill says. The panel did not vote on the bills</span></p>

The Voter Convenience Act accepts the realities of new technology: the old-fashioned, heavy, original voter registration books that once had to be transported to each polling location have been replaced by electronic poll books, aka tablets, linked to a central database, making it possible for voters to go the local polling place of their choice. The bill would also establish countywide polling locations. But under the terms of the bill, sponsored by State Sens. James Beach (D-Voorhees) and Nellie Pou (D-North Haledon),  county election officials could opt not to participate, leaving voters in one county with more flexibility than those in another county. The Senate State Government, Wagering, Tourism &amp; Historic Preservation Committee approved the bill in a 5-0 vote, with Republicans James Holzapfel (R-Toms River) and Vince Polistina (R-Little Egg Harbor) voting with Democrats John McKeon (D-West Orange), Shirley Turner (D-Lawrence), and Beach. A companion bill in the Assembly, sponsored by Assemblyman Avi Schnall (D-Lakewood) and others, is awaiting action by the State and Local Government Committee.</span></p>

In a ruling released May 14, the judge threw out a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party of Arizona, and the Yavapai County Republican Party that alleged the period for public comment on the manual was too short. The challenge also asked the court to block enforcement of certain portions of the manual. The court concluded that Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, who had created the manual as the state’s chief election officer and who was targeted in the lawsuit, had complied with Arizona&#8217;s notice-and-comment requirements. Fontes&#8217; office stood by the manual in a statement. “We used this manual to effectively run the presidential preference election in March and will continue using the EPM to ensure fair elections in the upcoming primary and general” elections, the statement said. Two other lawsuits challenging the manual remain alive in Maricopa County Superior Court.</span></p>

The lawsuit, filed in July 2023, described a “bureaucratic morass” encountered by felons trying to find out if they were eligible to vote. State and local election officials asked Chief U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga to dismiss the case, which was filed in Miami. The parties engaged in mediation on May 6. Florida Department of State officials on Friday published an announcement saying they intend to hold a rule-development workshop to update the process for felons to seek what are known as advisory opinions about their voting eligibility. The yet-to-be-developed rules “may render plaintiffs&#8217; claims moot,” mediator Michael Hanzman wrote in a report filed Monday. “Plaintiffs have therefore decided to voluntarily dismiss their case without prejudice and may re-file their case if the rulemaking, or subsequent implementation of any adopted rule, fails to alleviate their concerns,” he added.</span></p>

In an order issued last week in response to a complaint from Democratic Attorney General Kwame Raoul, the publishers of the so-called “pink slime” publications must remove registered voters’ full birthdates and street addresses from their websites. That is consistent with publicly released state voting information under federal law. The publications also are enjoined from posting additional voter lists that include full birthdates and street addresses until at least June 7, when a hearing is scheduled on the matter, according to the order issued by Lake County Associate Circuit Judge Daniel Jasica and agreed to by the publishers, Local Government Information Services. LGIS publishes the flyers and websites throughout Illinois with names that attempt to make them appear to be newspapers, such as the “Chicago City Wire,” the “DuPage Policy Journal” and the “Will County Gazette.” But the websites and print products publish little more than poor-quality content disguised as news that pushes far-right political candidates and their agendas, earning the publications the “pink slime” moniker. Illinois State Board of Elections officials</span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/04/05/state-elections-board-asks-ags-office-to-look-into-publisher-of-fake-newspapers-for-printing-voter-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said they received dozens of complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the LGIS publications posted the names, addresses and birthdates of voters by precinct, including whether they had voted, using voting lists from 2016 and 2020 that by law are only to be used by political organizations and not for other purposes. The data isn’t supposed to be shared with outside organizations.

Kennedy Jr.’s lawsuit against Secretary of State Shenna Bellows this week. Kennedy filed the lawsuit in February after his campaign was barred from collecting signatures from voters during the March 5 presidential primaries. Bellows, a Democrat, cited a provision in state law that prohibits people from trying to influence voters’ decisions regarding a candidate for an office that is on the ballot that day within 250 feet of a polling place. She said Kennedy’s campaign would be allowed to collect signatures during the state and congressional primaries being held on June 11. Bellows’ office asked Woodcock to dismiss the lawsuit in mid-March. A response from Kennedy’s team was due in April, but it missed that filing deadline. On Monday, Woodcock dismissed the lawsuit on procedural ground while accepting Bellows’ arguments.</span></p>

Yates said he expects to issue a ruling right in the next couple of weeks on the challenge to guidance from Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on processing absentee ballots and verifying signatures on absentee ballot forms against signatures on file with election clerks. The Democratic secretary of state says it’s necessary to implement a voting rights amendment to the Michigan Constitution that passed in 2022. The Republican National Committee is among the plaintiffs challenging the guidance. Assistant Attorney General Heather Meingast represented the secretary of state in Monday’s Court of Claims arguments. She said the guidance will help local clerks know what to look for when they&#8217;re comparing signatures on ballot sleeves against what is on file. “That’s exactly what this rule does — it fills in some gaps, giving clerks some understanding of discrepancies and significant dissimilarities,” Meingast said. “Otherwise, you have nothing. There’s zero guidance on what’s a significant discrepancy.” The plaintiffs include the Republican National Committee, the Michigan Republican Party, a township clerk and others. They argue the guidance puts a spin on the rules that leaves too much room for mistakes or mischief.</span></p>

The Republican National Committee (RNC), the Donald Trump campaign and the Nevada GOP filed suit in early May challenging the state’s law permitting the acceptance of mail ballots up to four business days after polls close, so long as the ballots are postmarked before Election Day. The RNC alleges that the practice does not conform with the federally established deadline of Election Day. In a motion to dismiss the case filed May 14 and shared with The Nevada Independent, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), with the support of the Biden campaign,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">note that Nevada is one of several states that have such a policy, which has been held up around the country in other court challenges. This is the Biden campaign’s second legal challenge to Republican lawsuits of the cycle; earlier this month, it filed an amicus brief to support the Nevada secretary of state after the RNC sued the state over alleged inconsistencies in counties’ voter rolls. In both legal filings, the Biden campaign argued that the Republican lawsuits are legally unserious and an effort to undermine confidence in the electoral process before it begins.</span></p>

Lynch of the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division&#8217;s third judicial department wrote in the court’s</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NY-Appellate-Absentee-Voter-Order.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The court affirmed the Supreme Court in Albany County’s decision to dismiss a complaint brought by Republican lawmakers and operatives which argued that the New York Early Mail Voter Act was unconstitutional.  The act — which allows any New York voter to request and submit a mail-in ballot — was signed in to law in September 2023 and has already been applied to the state’s April 2nd presidential primary.  Plaintiffs argued that the law violated an article in the state constitution that allows for the legislature to provide for absentee voting, but lays out a number of conditions, like absence or disability, which might justify such voting. The challengers argued that this article afforded for absentee voting only if one of those conditions was met.  Lynch found that argument unconvincing. He pointed to the history of the clause as evidence against the plaintiffs’ interpretation of it. It was enacted, he noted, by a constitutional amendment in response to a Civil War push to allow Union soldiers to vote absentee.  Subsequent amendments in the early 20th century made numerous changes to the section, each framed as efforts to increase voter participation.  He disagreed with the plaintiffs&#8217; argument that these amendments, by expressing who is entitled to vote absentee, excludes others from also voting by mail.</span></p>

In the Democratic primary for a seat on the Robeson County Board of Commissioners, the losing candidate, Lacy Cummings, challenged the apparent victory of incumbent Commissioner Judy Sampson. Cummings claimed that another county commissioner, Wixie Stephens, paid people to vote for Sampson. The Robeson County Board of Elections previously threw out Cummings’ allegations of vote-buying in April. He then appealed the county’s decision to the State Board of Elections, which also threw out his complaint. So Cummings sued the state elections board, trying to halt the official election certification process that would declare Sampson the winner of the race. Rozier denied Cummings’ request in the new order, writing that “he is unlikely to prevail” in providing proof of his vote-buying allegations.</span></p>

For 24 years, Stephen Holmes was that candidate. He represented the area and served as the county’s only Black Democratic commissioner.  This past October, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffery Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/federal-judge-orders-galveston-county-to-redraw-discriminatory-voting-map/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">determined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the new maps were a “textbook example of racial gerrymandering” and ordered them to be redrawn.  The county commissioners appealed and secured a stay of Brown&#8217;s ruling. An en banc panel of the Fifth Circuit ruled this past December that the maps could not be redrawn on the eve of primary and general election voting in 2024. The case made its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where a majority of the justices declined to intervene and gave no reasoning for their decision. In dissent, the court’s three liberal justices said they would have stepped in and blocked the map from being used.</span></p>

In their Oct. 2023</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/liebert-v-wi-elections-commission-usdc-west-wi.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters Susan Liebert, Anna Haas, Anna Poi and Anastasia Ferin claimed that a state law requiring a U.S. adult citizen to physically witness, certify and sign an absentee ballot violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Act of 1964. The requirement created a disenfranchising burden, those voters said, especially for voters who are disabled, members of a minority group, recently naturalized or students. Peterson found those claims unavailing. He denied the voters summary judgment and instead granted it to the defendants, which included the members of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, three municipal clerks and the intervening Wisconsin Legislature. In all the years since Wisconsin began using the requirement in some form in the 1960s, no one had used federal law to make the plaintiffs’ novel claims. “The long silence is telling,&#8221; the judge wrote in his opinion. “It may be debatable whether the witness requirement is needed, but it is one reasonable way for the state to try to deter abuse such as fraud and undue influence in a setting where election officials cannot monitor the preparation of a ballot,” Peterson added. The judge felt the plaintiffs were reading Wisconsin law too expansively and applying federal law too broadly. Among other claims, the plaintiffs said the witness requirement unlawfully puts witnesses and clerks in the position of certifying that a voter is eligible and qualified to vote.</span></p>
