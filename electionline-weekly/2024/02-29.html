							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Who Voters Look to for Election Information in 2024<br />
</strong><em>Survey explores Americans&#8217; election information habits</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Allen, Katie Harbath, Rachel Orey, Thania Sanchez</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A record number of voters will head to the polls this year, with more than 50 countries comprising half the planet’s population due to hold national elections in 2024. This coincides with the wide and growing availability of sophisticated AI technology that will supercharge misinformation and cyberthreats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To limit the spread of inaccurate or deceptive election information, we must understand how Americans get their information to begin with and how they feel about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To answer these questions, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the States United Democracy Center, and the Integrity Institute joined together to administer a national survey exploring Americans’ election information habits.<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10853" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/infographic-1024x741.png" alt="" width="640" height="463" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/infographic-1024x741.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/infographic-300x217.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/infographic-768x556.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/infographic.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We show how Americans consume, share, and assess election news in a crucial election year, uncovering new learnings after a</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/new-survey-data-election-information/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was conducted by BPC in advance of the 2022 midterm election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Americans have confidence in the 2024 presidential election. They are more confident that votes in their community and state will be counted accurately than votes across the country.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about election-related concerns, Americans point to misleading election information, violence after Election Day, and attempts to overturn election results.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans learn about elections primarily through television and social media.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials face an uphill battle breaking into a crowded media environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are less likely to select AI-enabled chatbots as a source of election information than any other source.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, Facebook, and YouTube are the most sought out online platforms for election news and information.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans consume election information passively.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credibility and reliability of a source is the most important factor when seeking out information about elections.</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans think social media platforms should be doing more to protect users from harmful content.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most adults agree false or deceptive elections content should be handled by social media platforms and the government in tandem.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This poll was conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of BPC between December 13- 15, 2023 among a sample of 2,203 adults.</span></p>

Early voting has been varied from state to state and in some places issues have arisen due to the weather, the U.S. Postal Service and new laws. In </span><a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/politics/elections/blizzard-warning-parts-placer-el-dorado-counties/103-78ac80d2-643e-4d53-b72a-8ac0b5285539"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, counties are finishing up early voting and bracing for a potentially historic snowstorm. The </span><a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/placer-county-snowstorm-election-voting-center-preparations/60016048"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placer County Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Office said in a statement they are &#8220;always ready with contingency plans, especially when it comes to navigating extreme weather conditions.&#8221; Registrar of Voters Ryan Ronco &#8220;There are concerns that we need to put in place to make sure we&#8217;re ready and have our procedures dialed in,&#8221; said Ryan Ronco. He said they already have the equipment in place: power generators, snow blowers, ice melt and light towers. Ronco said they will also use work release inmates to shovel sidewalks and parking lots and will rely on Cal Trans snow plows to help deliver the ballots to the election office. &#8220;That we have a path to getting the ballots back down to the mothership,&#8221; he said. In </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/richmond-registrar-concerned-about-absentee-ballots-amid-mail-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some jurisdictions, including Richmond, were encouraging Super Tuesday voters to avoid using the U.S. Postal Service to cast their ballots. General Registrar Keith Balmer said some residents still have not received their ballots, sent Jan. 10. However in nearby Chesterfield and </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/henrico-county/henrico-registrar-says-absentee-ballots-are-fine-amid-ongoing-mail-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counties, no problems have been noted with mail delivery. “Any problems we’ve seen, it’s not been going out to the voters coming back in,” Henrico Registrar Mark Coakley said. “The rates are lower, but again, the voters can be holding onto their ballots or just not voting for this election. I’ve heard more people do not get Christmas cards than absentee ballots.” In </span><a href="https://www.wfdd.org/story/advocacy-groups-officials-work-educate-public-nc-photo-id-laws-ahead-primary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is implementing voter ID statewide for the first time this primary, there have not been reports of many issues. In Forsyth County, there have been no major problems during early voting so far this year, according to Elections Director Tim Tsujii. &#8220;With it being a primary election in an even-numbered year cycle, we&#8217;ve yet to experience any major issues or challenges with any of the law changes,&#8221; he says. While the new-ish ID law seems to be rolling out smoothly, officials in the Tarheel State are warning that new law which may delay the reporting of results is </span><a href="https://www.wral.com/amp/21304713/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spawning conspiracy theories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a stolen election. The North Carolina State Board of Elections official Xwitter account responded to one post: &#8220;No, we are saying that changes in the law necessitate changes in process. Please read the law, which is available via links in the press release. Talk to someone who understands the process. Spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about elections helps no one.&#8221; While those states are gearing up for their primaries, the 2024 presidential primary is now in the books in Michigan.

She said they had a little issue with one electronic poll book in a jurisdiction and Green Oak Township had a transformer go out and four precincts there lost power but “the local clerks do what the local clerks do” – meaning they assess the situation and adapt. Hundley said three of the precincts were on automatic back-up generators and the fourth had a generator delivered in short order and voting was never interrupted. With national conversations around voters being skeptical of the voting process, poll worker Kathleen Edwards said working the behind-the-scenes of the polling location in Ferrysburg has ruled out that question for her. “Especially in </span><a href="https://www.grandhaventribune.com/news/local/election-workers-facilitate-the-voting-process/article_a3816bad-5c6d-5cdd-b205-b17bcf7dc225.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ottawa County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to think there’s any kind of fraud is just ridiculous because we go through so many checks and balances,” Edwards said. “It’s just impossible. Even to make a mistake here, you don’t want to do it.</span></p>

Elections officials and AI researchers took Chatbos for a test run to see how well they responded to queries about voting. “The chatbots are not ready for primetime when it comes to giving important, nuanced information about elections,” said Seth Bluestein, a Republican city commissioner in Philadelphia. All five models they tested — OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama 2, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and Mixtral from the French company Mistral — failed to varying degrees when asked to respond to basic questions about the democratic process, according to the report, which synthesized the workshop’s findings. Workshop participants rated more than half of the chatbots’ responses as inaccurate and categorized 40% of the responses as harmful, including perpetuating dated and inaccurate information that could limit voting rights, the report said. In Nevada, where same-day voter registration has been allowed since 2019, four of the five chatbots tested wrongly asserted that voters would be blocked from registering to vote weeks before Election Day. “It scared me, more than anything, because the information provided was wrong,” said Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, a Democrat who participated in last month’s testing workshop.</span></p>

After a number of threats and attempted break-ins, McDonell decided that election officials needed a safer and larger space for election processes.So, after traveling around the country to look at other election offices, McDonell chose the new space at an unexpected location- a local brewery. They spoke about how a County Clerk embarks on a project of this size, keeping election workers safe, and maintaining trust with other clerks across the state.

She was 93. Carroll was elected supervisor of elections in 1968, and was reelected to the job until she decided not to run again in 2000. Rico Petrocelli, a former chairman of the Broward Republican Party and former member of the Plantation City Council, told the Sun Sentinel that Carroll “was a staple among the electorate.” The most momentous time of Carroll’s career came at the end. After she narrowly won reelection in 1996, she decided not to run for reelection in 2020. But she was still in office for the ultra-close, contentious, error-plagued George W. Bush-Al Gore presidential election. The Florida results, still disputed by many, made Republican Bush the president. With results undecided, and the county elections canvassing boards (including Carroll) were making decisions as the nation waited, Carroll announced she was leaving for a trip to North Carolina in the days after the election. She returned to Broward, but later resigned from the canvassing board — and was replaced by a judge — saying she was leaving town to visit her son in California for Thanksgiving. She was 70 at the time, and said she was too exhausted to keep going in the canvassing board’s review of 588,000 ballots after six nearly nonstop days of counting. “I don’t feel well,” Carroll said, according to news accounts at the time. “I’m not as young as I used to be. I was feeling very fatigued. I was feeling I wouldn’t be any help to anybody.” Jane Conner Carroll was born on Oct. 26, 1930, in Newport News, Va., the funeral home said. She graduated from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1951, part of one of the first classes with women. She married Herb Carroll on December 27, 1957. He preceded her in death. She is survived by her daughter, Sheri Carroll Mullen of Lincolnton, N.C., and Bill Summer of Aliso Viejo, Calif, two grandchildren and two great grandchildren.</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Republicans advanced a bill in the Legislature to</span><a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1871972/gop-lawmakers-advance-bill-require-schools-serve-polling-locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require schools with gyms to serve as polling places as an alternative to voting centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The bill allows for both precinct voting places and voting centers.  Precinct voting locations are designated for a certain area, so the election workers know the maximum number of people who can show up to vote. With voting centers, any eligible voter can go vote at a location of their choice. Bill sponsor Sen. Jake Hoffman (R-Queen Creek) said that teachers get off work well before the polls close, so they’ll have plenty of time to vote. He also argued that if they want to, the bill won’t stop them from taking time off to vote. The bill passed the Senate on party lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate approved by a vote of 16-13</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/SB1360S.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1360</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/02/26/party-line-votes-define-election-law-proposals-with-vetoes-looming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ban the use of artificial intelligence in software used in Arizona tabulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for ballot processing and in signature verification.  The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Frank Carroll, R-Sun City West, explained that the bill is the same as one that Hobbs vetoed last year and is based on unverified claims from unnamed witnesses who said artificial intelligence was used in ballot adjudication in past elections.  “If it (the software) picks up on patterns, how do we know that the voter intent is being honored?” he said during a Feb. 5 Senate Elections Committee meeting.  Arizona’s counties support the bill, because none of them currently use artificial intelligence, said Jen Marson, executive director of the Arizona Association of Counties, during the Feb. 5 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Feb. 22, the House voted 31-28, along party lines, to pass</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/HB2851H.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2851</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create more rigid requirements for documenting the chain of custody when moving ballots from polling places to another location to count them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Feb. 22, the House voted 31-28 along party lines to pass</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/HB2719H.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2719</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would require that bond elections happen only in even-numbered years and would invalidate those elections if less than 60% of registered voters turn out for the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Florida:</strong> According to the Tallahassee Democrat, after briefly sparking a political firestorm at the Florida Capitol, legislation that could have brought back the </span><a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/23/political-firestorm-sparked-by-house-elections-bill-then-fizzled/72711077007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s primary runoffs and imposed new limits on ballot drop boxes </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has quietly died. The measure was unveiled late Feb. 19 but postponed two days later in the House committee that proposed it. By the evening of Feb. 22, House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, said it wouldn’t be heard. “It was worth having the conversation,” Renner said late Thursday. “But I think I heard Carly Simon singing in the background, ‘you must think this bill is about you,’ because we certainly had a lot of feedback from people who thought it was.”</span></p>

Currently, they’re automatically registered unless they opt out. The bill also makes it easier for voters to be challenged based on where they live, possibly clearing the way for Republican activists who see the state’s voting lists as bloated and fraudulent to knock thousands of additional voters off the rolls. Republicans argue that the system results in too much extra work for election officials and creates duplicate registrations when someone registers again and is not matched with a previous record. “The intent is certainly not to reduce voter registration, the intent is to clarify and make voter registration more accurate,” said Senate Ethics Committee Chairman Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills to allow </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-house-panel-votes-to-make-ballots-public-and-reduce-voting-machines/PK2QENAFMRGP3KN6UNVWHPTJ2I/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public ballot inspections and fewer voting machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on election day passed a Georgia House committee this week. Under one of the bills that advanced Monday, paper ballots would be accessible to the public after elections are certified, subject to regulations that would be crafted by the State Election Board. Current law keeps ballots sealed after elections unless a judge orders otherwise. The committee also approved legislation that would ease the number of voting booths required in each election day precinct in statewide general elections. House Bill 1370 would allow fewer than one voting booth for every 250 voters.</span></p>

Vito Barbieri, R-Dalton Gardens is proposing an amendment to the Idaho Constitution that would limit elections to one round of voting. Gardens, is sponsoring the proposed amendment,</span><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/HJR003/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Joint Resolution 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If ratified, Barbieri’s amendment is designed to </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/02/23/republican-idaho-legislator-proposes-constitutional-amendment-to-block-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibit ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is one of the components of the open primary ballot initiative that supporters hope to qualify for the November election. Barbieri also hopes to qualify his proposed amendment for the November election, setting up a potential showdown over election policies and procedures at the ballot box. “The purpose is to head off this ranked choice voting perspective that has been kind of permeating, bubbling up, in some of the states,” Barbieri told the House State Affairs Committee. The proposed amendment states, “ONE ROUND OF VOTING – PERSON WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES ELECTED. In any election, there shall be one round of voting, and the person having the highest number of votes for an office shall be deemed to have won such election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5487" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Illinois:</strong> State Rep. Maura Hirschauer, D-Batavia, introduced</span><a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=4709&amp;GAID=17&amp;GA=103&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegID=152262&amp;SessionID=112"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 4709</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would amend the current state statute that says if a county board chooses a school to be a polling place, then the school district must make the school available for use as a polling place. &#8220;At my son’s elementary school, I have to buzz through two doors and show an ID just to talk to the secretary. There’s a disconnect between that safety measure and the safety measures we have in place for polling,” said Hirschauer. Under her introduced bill, Hirschauer said the school board would </span><a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/illinois/article_b321e5d8-d10a-11ee-bee7-33442fa83da8.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a say in whether the district becomes a polling place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  “We will explore all options to make sure we have enough successful places in all sorts of different diverse parts of the state,” Hirschauer said. She said they are still having conversations with county clerks and county boards across the state and she doesn’t want to put up barriers to voting access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5802" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Indiana:</strong> Poll worker safety was top of mind at the Statehouse this week as the House Courts and Criminal Code unanimously passed SB 170. The bill, if signed into law, would make </span><a href="https://fox59.com/indianapolitics/poll-worker-protections-bill-passes-indiana-house-committee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatening, obstructing or injuring a poll worker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on election day a Level 6 Felony. According to the bill’s author, the bill attempts to address concerns about election-day staffing. Several people who testified in favor of the bill said poll workers are frustrated and fearful as they head into what could be the biggest presidential election in history. “These are our neighbors and our friends, and they are dropping out of the process,” State Sen. Greg Walker (R, Columbus) said. Under the amended bill, offenses against an election worker that take place in a nursing home don’t count—a change met with disdain by some who otherwise supported the bill. An amendment to the bill also removed the Secretary of State and Election Division employees from receiving those protections. A date for a full House hearing has yet to be determined. If passed into law, the bill would go into effect immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3684" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Kansas:</strong> Lawmakers advanced several bills on election laws before their Feb. 23 turnaround deadline. The </span><a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/government/2024/02/26/kansas-house-sends-four-bills-on-election-laws-to-senate/72688062007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed by the House last week now head to the Senate. While some got bipartisan supermajority support, one controversial bill did not get enough to override a potential veto. The House passed</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2512/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2512</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a ​97-23 vote. Under the bill, in-person advance voting would no longer be offered on the Monday before a Tuesday election, starting in 2025, though local officials could make exceptions. Currently, the advance in-person voting period closes at noon the Monday before an election. The bill, starting this year, would allow in-person advance voting on both the Saturday and Sunday of the weekend before election day. Election offices would be required, at a minimum, to have four hours on such Saturdays. Currently, election offices are allowed but not required to be open on the Saturday before an election. A bill would allow military members, dependents of military members and college students to volunteer in areas that are not the same as where they are registered to vote. </span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2616/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2616</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed the House on a vote of 93-27. The bill&#8217;s carrier, Rep. Jeff Underhill, R-Junction City, explained that the expansion toward military families and college students is because those demographics are often registered to vote outside of their current precinct. The House Election Committee amended the bill to add a qualification that poll workers must be citizens of the United States. The bill was uncontroversial in committee, garnering no testimony in opposition, and a ranking Democratic member of the House asked for it to be passed on the House floor. A bill clarifying language from a 2021 bill that criminalizes impersonating a poll worker passed the House on an 85-35 vote. </span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2618/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2618</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would add that whoever is charged with impersonating a poll worker must be proven to have acted with the intention to deceive someone. The 2021 law is currently tied up in the Kansas Supreme Court, with opponents arguing that the law is written vaguely enough that it could stop volunteers from participating in voter registration drives over fears of prosecution. The House also passed</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2516/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2516</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a 68-52 vote, which would make it more difficult for an independent candidate to get on the ballot for statewide office by roughly quadrupling the number of signatures needed. The bill would change the petition signatures required from an independent candidate to get on the ballot from 5,000 to at least 2% of the total votes cast in the preceding election. That would mean more than 20,000 signatures required if an independent wanted to run for governor in 2026.</span></p>

This change would align Maryland with 37 other states, including Delaware, that already mandate some form of identification for voting. Currently, Maryland voters are only required to show identification during their first-time voting. However, this new bill, backed by 13 Republican lawmakers seeks to enforce a broader ID requirement. The proposed legislation offers flexibility in the type of identification that can be presented, not strictly requiring a photo ID like a driver&#8217;s license. Voters could use a utility bill, bank statement, or paycheck among other documents as proof of identity. Additionally, those unable to provide the required ID at the polls would still have the option to cast a provisional ballot.</span></p>

The request must be made no later than May 31 in the year of the election. Allow the requests only for state general elections. Limit the bill’s applicability to postsecondary institutions with enrollment of at least 1,500 students, not including institutions where students attend courses primarily online. This bill builds upon legislation that passed during the 2023 legislative session that authorizes cities and counties to designate temporary polling places before an election. Under the law, cities may designate polling places for days and hours that differ from those required for standard polling places.

House Concurrent Resolution 4 would amend section 253 of the state’s Constitution to provide automatic restoration of suffrage to a person convicted of a non-violent crime after a period of five years from the completion of a sentence, probation and payment of restitution. House Bill 1609 requests that change under the state’s code and lists crimes that are exceptions to expungement, which include arson, armed robbery, carjacking, embezzlement of $5,000 or more, murder, rape, or statutory rape. Under HB 1609, such an individual’s voting rights would be restored automatically after five years and when they satisfy the sentencing requirements of the conviction. Restoration of voting rights under HB 1609 will include expungement of the conviction from the Mississippi Central Criminal Database within 45 days of receiving the certified copy of the order of expunction from the circuit clerk’s office, who will then forward it to the Mississippi Criminal Information Center at the state’s Department of Public Safety. A non-public record will be maintained to ensure the court can determine the habitual offender status of the person, should they be convicted of a subsequent crime. </span><a href="https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2024/pdf/history/HB/HB1445.xml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1445</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, authored by Rep. Horan, focuses on first time offenders. Crimes not valid for expunction under this bill include arson, trafficking of a controlled substance, third or subsequent DUI offenses, convicted felon in possession of a firearm, failure to register as a sex offender, voyeurism, witness intimidation, abuse/neglect or exploitation of a vulnerable person and embezzlement. Under this bill, a non-public record will also be retained by the Mississippi Criminal Information Center to determine, if upon future offense, the justice system can determine if the person is a first-time offender. HB 1445 bill will require a person to submit a petition to the circuit clerk’s office for expungement. Under House Bills 1609 and 1445, expungement will only be provided once. HCR 4 and HB 1445 were referred to both Wallace and Horan’s Committees while HB 1609 was referred to only to the Constitution Committee. All three bills await committee action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Elections Committee advanced legislation to </span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2024/02/28/mississippi-absentee-ballots-counting-five-days-eliminate-legislature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminate the five days local elections workers have to count mail-in absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The majority-Republican committee passed Senate Bill 2579 with little debate, sending it to the full Senate.  “In my opinion, when we have votes that are being counted after Election Day like this, whether there’s any bad intent or not, it’s not received by the public well,” Senate Elections Committee Chairman Jeremy England, author of the bill, said. To address concerns with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the GOP-dominated Legislature passed a law to allow local election workers to count mailed absentee ballots for up to five days after the election date, but only if the ballots were postmarked by the election date. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the bill into law.</span></p>

Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, would extend a Class III misdemeanor in place for obstructing or hindering deputy registrars to threats and harassment against all election officials and workers, including poll workers. LB 1390 also provides a Class III misdemeanor for disseminating the home address of an election official if done without the official’s consent and intended to aid or assist in a criminal offense reasonably likely to cause death, bodily injury or stalking. Election Commissioners Brian Kruse, of Douglas County, and Tracy Overstreet, of Hall County, each testified in a neutral capacity on LB 1390. They co-chair the election law committee of the Nebraska Association of County Officials, which supported the bill. Both said they liked the ideas in the bill. However, the details are “dicey,” Overstreet said. Kruse said there have been no credible, serious threats against election officials or workers that his association is aware of, while Overstreet pointed to a fake bomb in 2020 that led to an evacuation of her election office and discouraged poll workers from volunteering since then. Overstreet and Kruse encouraged the committee to make penalties year-round. Kruse said this could bring consistency as there’s almost always an election season somewhere in the state. “Election security is a 365-day-a-year issue, not just an election season issue,” Kruse said. Overstreet said disrupting an election is really an “attack on all of society.”  </span><a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=55088"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative Bill 1203</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Sen.

In his 44 years of public service, he oversaw 141 vote-by-mail elections – the most in the United States – as well as 28 poll elections. Senators said he was a mentor to many who exemplified the qualities of compassion and service to others. “Steve Druckenmiller was a man who believed in democracy and did more than most to make it work. From vote-by-mail to Spanish language ballots, Steve worked to realize the aspiration of every eligible voter having a ballot in hand,” said Sen. Sara Gelser Blouin (D-Corvallis). “He did this in a way that united people on the right and the left, and in so doing, he built confidence in our election system. Oregon is better because of Steve’s service.” “Clerk Druckenmiller always maintained the highest standards of transparency, accuracy, and accessibility in elections for all Linn County residents throughout his four-decades-long tenure,” said Sen. Cedric Hayden (R-Fall Creek). “I know his legacy as an exemplary public servant will be remembered for years to come.” Druckenmiller passed away in September 2023 after a battle with cancer. He was 72.</span></p>

Deputy Secretary of State Tom Deadrick hopes the legislation will strengthen elections and encourage people to volunteer as poll workers. County auditors across the state report that it’s difficult to find volunteers, Deadrick said. The bill originally contained an emergency provision so it would go into effect immediately after being signed into law and require a two-thirds majority vote in each chamber, but it failed to garner enough votes in the Senate. After removing the emergency provision, the bill passed the Senate 21-12. If it is signed into law, it’ll go into effect on July 1, after the June 4 primary election but before the Nov. 5 general election. Some lawmakers on the committee expressed concern that the bill would be too broad and redundant after the House and Senate</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24504"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making it a Class 2 misdemeanor — which carries lesser penalties than a Class 1 misdemeanor — if anyone “interferes with the duties of poll workers or poll watchers.” That bill heads to the governor’s desk next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A legislative committee endorsed</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25104"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would </span><a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/02/28/last-minute-bill-would-require-earlier-voter-registration-due-to-perceived-election-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require voters to register 30 days before an election rather than the current 15</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The House State Affairs Committee endorsed the bill with a 9-4 vote. Rep. Kirk Chaffee, R-Whitewood, introduced the bill language on the 28th day of the 38-day legislative session, taking advantage of rules that allow legislators to wholly replace the text of bills after the bill introduction deadline has passed. The legislation that Chaffee amended was previously a two-sentence bill to require the state Board of Elections to meet before each legislative session and recommend changes to election laws; the new, three-page bill still does that, along with the change to the registration deadline and a repeal of a strict 30-day residency requirement imposed last year. Similar residency requirements in other states have sparked lawsuits asserting that an American citizen’s right to vote in a federal election can’t be denied by a local residency law. The bill would also add language into law saying “Only a citizen of the United States may vote in a municipal, county, primary, general, school district or any other election in this state.” It would replace the 30-day state residency requirement with less stringent language saying a person must have “fixed a habitation” in the state to which they intend to return.</span></p>

Citing complications with its implementation and lack of enthusiasm for an alternate electoral system, freshman lawmaker Rep. Katy Hall, R-South Ogden, said it was time to abandon Utah’s experiment with ranked choice voting early following state lawmakers’ near unanimous approval of the trial run in 2018. Hall’s bill,</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0290.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB290</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed the Legislature’s lower chamber of 75 members with 43 yeas and 26 nays. The bill will now be assigned to a Senate committee for consideration. If it passes the Senate, the legislation would change the repeal date for Utah’s voting methods pilot project,</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/HB0035.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Jan. 1, 2026, to May 1, 2024. It would remove the measure from Utah code and return the state to a uniform standard of traditional voting for municipal elections in 2025, eliminating one additional election cycle where Utah municipalities would have been allowed to opt into the program. </span></p>

But that didn’t change the outcome as a Democratic-led Senate committee voted 8-7 Tuesday to delay consideration of the proposal until 2025, a gentler way of blocking the bill. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/20/effort-to-depoliticize-virginias-top-elections-job-hits-snag-in-state-senate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had passed the House of Delegates 99-0, would have given the State Board of Elections the power to hire and fire the elections commissioner by a supermajority vote. The current system, said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, leaves elections commissioners susceptible to political pressure from the governor who hired them. “There’s no perfect way to get at this,” O’Quinn said Tuesday. “It’s been tried in many different ways, in many different times. I think this is a full faith effort to get there.” Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, reiterated his belief that the supermajority rule was a recipe for partisan gridlock that could incentivize the minority party to block the majority from making a decision. VanValkenburg said he respects O’Quinn’s efforts on the bill and agreed to work with those interested in the issue to come up with “a better way” for the 2025 session. “But I can’t support this,” he said. Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, the lawmaker who gave O’Quinn extra time to try to salvage his bill, said she hopes that effort bears fruit. “Let’s see if we can get something on this,” Roem said. “I think the idea is good.”</span></p>

Under the ranked-choice process, Arlington voters will be able to rank their top three preferences in the County Board race, with candidates eliminated if they are at the bottom of the vote tally. Votes cast for those eliminated candidates would be reallocated as instructed by their voters in a process that would continue until one candidate received a total of 50 percent of the vote plus one extra vote. County Board members last December for a second year imposed the voting-method change on the Democratic County Board primary, which is held each June. After concerns were raised about the use of ranked-choice voting in the 2023 primary, County Board members opted against using ranked-choice voting for the November 2023 general election, but agreed to bring the matter up for consideration in 2024.</span></p>

Manka Dhingra said during the vote. &#8220;We have to make sure that our election workers are protected, that people who participate and engage in our democracy have faith that the system works well and that we don’t have bad actors that can actually disrupt vote counts. The bill would increase the possible penalty for harassing an election worker in person or by mail from up to one year in jail to up to five years in prison. It would also give targeted workers the opportunity to join a program run by the secretary of state&#8217;s office designed to keep their address confidential. The measure has already been approved by the House but will need to go back to that body for verification before heading to Gov. Jay Inslee’s desk. Mike Faulk, spokesperson for the Democratic governor, said in an email that they haven’t reviewed the bill in detail but that Inslee is “generally supportive of efforts to protect our democratic process and the people who carry it out.”</span></p>

In an interview with WISN-TV that aired this weekend, he said he will not do so. “(It’s) just not the right time to add a new process, a whole new day to process ballots in the presidential election cycle,” he said. The bill passed the GOP-held Assembly in November, and Gov. Tony Evers previously signaled he would sign it if it eventually passed the Senate. It would have allowed communities to begin processing — but not counting — absentee ballots a day earlier than Election Day.</span></p>

While the court set a course for a quick resolution, it maintained a hold on preparations for a trial focused on Trump’s efforts to overturn his election loss. The court will hear arguments in late April, with a decision likely no later than the end of June. That timetable is much faster than usual, but assuming the justices deny Trump’s immunity bid, it’s not clear whether a trial can be scheduled and concluded before the November election. Early voting in some states will begin in September. The court’s decision to intervene in a second major Trump case this term, along with the dispute over whether he is barred from being president again because of his actions following the 2020 election, underscores the direct role the justices will have in the outcome of the election. Trump’s lawyers have sought to put off a trial until after the election.</span></p>

According to the newly unsealed indictment, Hyde allegedly left two voicemails a day after the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and the employee, met that November to certify the 2022 election results in the largest county in Arizona. In the voicemail, Hyde allegedly said “You wanna cheat our elections? You wanna screw Americans out of true votes? We’re coming, [expletive]. You’d better [expletive] hide.” “Intimidation of election officials strikes at the very heart of our democracy,” U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California Tara McGrath said in a statement. “Even just one case can have a ripple effect. This Office will aggressively prosecute any attempt to intimidate, threaten, or frighten election officials as they engage in these critical duties.” Hyde has been charged with one count of communicating an interstate threat. If he is convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the DOJ said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Jerry Ogstad, 59, of Alabama, was arrested on </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2024/02/28/man-accused-of-threating-maricopa-county-election-workers-indicted/72782568007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspicion of sending threatening messages to election workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Maricopa County Elections, according to a Department of Justice news release. Otstad made an initial appearance in federal court Feb. 28. An indictment, which was unsealed Wednesday, alleges Ogstad sent messages over social media that explicitly threatened the lives of election workers, the release stated. The indictment alleges Ogstad referenced claims of voter fraud in Arizona’s 2022 gubernatorial race and allegedly made threats to election workers and officials. U.S. Attorney Gary M. Restaino for the District of Arizona said in the release he refuses to allow threats of vigilante justice by election skeptics. “We will continue to prosecute true threats against Arizona’s election officials and other public servants, including direct messages sent on social media, or communications in any other format,” Restaino said.</span></p>

Conner struck down a request by the state election commissioner, Anthony J. Albence, alongside the Delaware Department of Elections, to dismiss a complaint stating that Delaware&#8217;s early voting and permanent absentee voting statutes were violating the First State&#8217;s constitution. The plaintiffs in the case were Michael Mennella and Republican Sen. Gerald Hocker. In his opinion, Conner stated: &#8220;The enactments of the General Assembly challenged today are inconsistent with our Constitution and therefore cannot stand.&#8221; In his ruling, the judge noted the following about early voting: The Delaware Constitution designates only one day for general elections, but the state&#8217;s early voting statute allows for voting at least 10 days before that one day. He stated that the &#8220;Constitution will prevail&#8221; when conflicts with statutes exist. The judge found that the state&#8217;s early voting statute failed to meet the constitution&#8217;s mandate to &#8220;secure secrecy and the independence of the voter, preserve the freedom and purity of elections and prevent fraud, corruption and intimidation&#8221; and that early voting went beyond the Legislature&#8217;s limited authority granted by the constitution.

Patrick is facing a felony charge of voter fraud as a result of the complaint from Sumter County Supervisor of Elections William Keen. Patrick, who is a convicted felon, registered to vote in 2011 and voted in Sumter County in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022, according to the complaint. He was arrested on a warrant on Feb. 13 and booked at the Sumter County Detention Center. He remains free on $2,500 bond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys for Secretary of State Cord Byrd last week filed a motion </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-seeks-federal-judges-exit-from-elections-fight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking the recusal of Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, pointing to parts of a ruling he issued Feb. 8 in a separate court battle about a 2021 elections law. In the motion for recusal, the state&#8217;s attorneys cited parts of the Feb. 8 ruling, such as Walker&#8217;s description of a &#8220;persistent and pernicious practice&#8221; related to Black voters. &#8220;Plaintiffs in these consolidated proceedings must prove that the state of Florida intentionally targeted third-party voter registration organizations because Black voters prefer to use them,&#8221; the motion said. &#8220;But this court (Walker) has seemingly concluded that the state of Florida engages in discrimination against Black voters. On the discriminatory-intent issue, therefore, this court appears to have a closed mind.&#8221; The motion acknowledged that the &#8220;bar for recusal is high,&#8221; usually involving such things as comments made by judges to the news media or judges&#8217; relationships. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no rule limiting recusal to such instances. The analysis turns on whether a reasonable observer might perceive this court to have a &#8216;fixed opinion, a closed mind&#8217; on the discriminatory-intent issue,&#8221; the motion said, partially quoting a legal precedent. Walker</span><a href="https://www.wlrn.org/law-justice/2024-02-27/judge-florida-elections-case"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied the request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for recusal. </span></p>

The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing the Colorado decision. While Porter ruled primary votes cast for Trump should not be counted by Illinois election officials, she stayed the effect of her ruling in anticipation of an appeal in higher state courts and a ruling from the nation’s highest court in the Colorado case. The Trump campaign vowed to appeal Porter’s ruling shortly after it was issued.</span></p>

Their argument was met with opposition from state officials, who say the law helps curb fraud. Attorneys for both sides sparred in a court hearing over the constitutionality of a key component of Republicans’ efforts to restrict voting rights in the wake of unfounded claims of voter fraud during the 2020 election. Lawmakers overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to pass</span><a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2022/b2021_22/measures/hb2183/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2183</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 amid criticism it amounted to voter suppression. Under the law, it’s a felony to pretend to be an election official or to engage in conduct that causes other people to falsely believe someone is an election official. Four voting rights groups say that effectively bans voter registration drives. That’s because their volunteers are often mistaken for election workers, despite identifying themselves otherwise — putting them at risk of prosecution. Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Attorney General Kris Kobach are defending the law. Bradley Schlozman, an attorney arguing on their behalf, said the law was meant to crack down on what he described as “nefarious actors” gathering information from voters during the 2020 election and using it to commit identity theft. Several justices appeared wary of the state’s argument. </span></p>

Kennedy Jr. is suing Maine&#8217;s secretary of state over </span><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2024-02-22/rfk-jr-sues-maines-secretary-of-state-over-polling-place-access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next month. In a lawsuit filed Feb. 21 in U.S. District Court, Kennedy&#8217;s campaign claims that Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is wrongly denying his campaign the ability to gather petition signatures inside polling locations during the March 5 presidential primaries. His attorneys argue that, because Kennedy is not on the ballot that day, his campaign&#8217;s presence would not potentially influence voters. The lawsuit points out that the campaigns for several Republican and Democratic candidates for president were able to set up signature-collection operations at tables inside polling places last November. The campaign&#8217;s attorneys contend that by denying Kennedy the same opportunity, Bellows is violating the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But Bellows stood by her instructions to clerks to not to allow the Kennedy campaign to collect signatures at polling places on March 5. “Maine law is very clear: within the voting place itself, a person may not influence another person&#8217;s decision regarding a candidate for an office or question that is on the ballot for the election that day,&#8221; Bellows said in a statement. &#8220;That’s why no presidential campaign can collect signatures on presidential primary day. That being said, when a candidate’s office is not on the ballot, they can absolutely collect signatures. There’s a statewide election in June. Certainly Mr. Kennedy can collect signatures then.&#8221;</span></p>

He is scheduled to be sentenced July 9. Barton called the plea “a win for election officials all over the country.” She added that the threats she received had “permanently impacted me and my family’s lives.” “I will never be able to turn back the clock and go back to living in a sense of peace and security as I had done prior to this incident, “Barton</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TinaLBarton/status/1762574832699412542"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I strongly believe that election officials should never be intimidated, threatened, or harassed for doing their jobs serving the public.”</span></p>

The judge also said it does not contain an unfunded mandate — dismissing arguments the legal challenge levied against the petition. “I think it’s probably time for voters of the state of Nevada to decide if they want this or not,” Maddox said from the bench this week. The initiative was proposed by Repair the Vote, a political action committee led by former Nevada Republican Club president and former Clark County GOP Chair David Gibbs. The petition aims to amend Nevada’s Constitution by requiring in-person voters to provide valid photo identification and those voting by mail to provide a personally identifiable number — such as part of a driver’s license number or Social Security number — alongside their signature.  Nevada does not require voters to provide any type of identification before voting, but each voter is required to provide a signature that must match the one in the state’s files.</span></p>

Last week, Secretary of State Al Schmidt asked a &#8220;special master&#8221; appointed by the Supreme Court to order the Republican-controlled Fulton County government, Commissioner Randy Bunch, former Commissioner Stuart Ulsh and their lawyer Thomas Carroll to repay the state an updated total of $711,000 for outside counsel&#8217;s legal fees and related costs. Most of the latest set of $263,000 in fees, wrote Schmidt&#8217;s lawyers, came about because the Fulton officials &#8220;requested an evidentiary hearing regarding the appointment of a third-party escrow agent to take possession of the voting machines at issue — and then did everything in their power to delay and obstruct both the hearing itself and, more generally, the impoundment of the voting machines ordered by the Supreme Court.&#8221; The reimbursement request was made based on a decision against the county issued by the high court in April.</span></p>

Several amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been passed over the decades extending this fundamental freedom to voters of color, women and citizens who are 18 years of age. However, the lack of an overarching amendment guaranteeing the right to vote leaves our democracy vulnerable because the freedom to vote is treated differently depending on where voters live and how courts handle disputes over their rights.  In his new book, “A Real Right to Vote,” Law Professor Rick Hasen explains why a constitutional amendment is necessary, and why now is the time to begin a campaign in support of such an amendment. As Professor Hasen explains, enshrining voting rights in the Constitution will benefit all Americans, no matter which side of the political aisle they sit on.   In discussion with Campaign Legal Center President Trevor Potter, Professor Hasen will describe his vision for the freedoms an amendment on voting rights would protect, its potential impact on our democracy, and why he believes it’s possible to pass such an amendment, despite a challenging political climate. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 29, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

As the presidential election approaches, there are serious concerns about an explosion of disinformation and synthetic content that could impact what is expected to be a very close race. Political campaigns have already begun implementing generative AI tools to create advertisements, send robocalls and contact voters, prompting policymakers to propose major legislation and guardrails to protect the integrity of our elections.   On March 13, join the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings for a discussion moderated by Senior Fellow Darrell West along with a panel of experts, about the dangers posed by AI and election disinformation and ways to protect the general public. <strong>When:</strong> March 13, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC and online.</span></p>
