														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia leads the way with elections training for police</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Georgia police will now receive training about state’s election laws</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intersection of law enforcement and elections has a long and fraught history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6180" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-300x282.png" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-300x282.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020.png 566w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />However, the elections and aftermath of 2020 profoundly changed the way election officials had to perform an already complicated, tedious, and thoroughly public process. Elections officials at all levels are </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/voting/election-threats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">under attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these threats have necessitated greater police involvement, how to do that without infringing on someone’s most sacred right – the right to vote – has presented challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations like the </span><a href="https://safeelections.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CSSE) have worked to bring together law enforcement and elections officials to overcome those challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Georgia,  </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2021/06-03/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Harvey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deputy director at </span><a href="https://gapost.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and who previously worked in the Georgia secretary of state’s office, saw a solution for his state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The personal attacks and threats that local election officials received and reported to me were gut-wrenching because I knew so many of them to be extremely dedicated to doing their jobs faithfully, legally, and honorably,” Harvey said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Harvey left the secretary of state’s office in 2021 and returned to law enforcement in a training capacity, he said he quickly saw a way that he could get elections officials  the support of law enforcement that many of them had reported to him that they had sometimes found lacking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew that law enforcement was untrained to deal with the intricacies of elections laws and processes, and that if law enforcement could provide practical protection for the election officials and their teams, that it would make the difficult job of conducting elections a little easier, and much safer for everyone,” Harvey said. “I could tell that the political temperature was not going to cool in the near future and that law enforcement officers were going to be critical partners with election officials, and that as someone who had worked extensively in both worlds, I was uniquely qualified to bring them together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11690" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.22.10 AM.png" alt="" width="270" height="242" />In July, Georgia became the first state to mandate election training for its law enforcement officers. Basic training at Georgia’s police academies will soon include POST’s one-hour course on election laws and response, teaching recruits about election interference, threats, de-escalation tactics, and protections against voter intimidation. According to Harvey, the training was included in a massive overhaul of the state-mandated basic police officer training requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our team at GA POST completely rebuilt the basic requirements to become a police officer and I was able to include the election training as a component of the revision,” Harvey said. “There was no resistance to including the election training in the new curriculum, as many law enforcement agencies in Georgia had been familiar with the likelihood that they would have officers responding to calls and being asked by local election officials to provide additional security resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7050" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-300x291.png" alt="" width="300" height="291" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-300x291.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-1024x993.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey-768x745.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Harvey.png 1114w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Harvey said he spoke with several local election officials about the training, and with members of the secretary of state’s office about the idea. In 2021 and 2022 while doing some presentations to the Georgia Chiefs of Police Association and the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association helped crystallize the production of the training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a great opportunity for our law enforcement to have election law training to better understand the nuances of how situations might need to be handled differently on Election Day compared to every other day,” said Tate Fall, director of elections and voter registration  for </span><a href="https://www.cobbcounty.org/elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cobb County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall noted that one of the common situations that they’ve seen give law enforcement pause is the different boundary lines outside of precincts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we call for law enforcement to remove someone for electioneering within the 150-foot line, they often are hesitant because their first thought is that the activity is protected by the First Amendment,” Fall said. “Learning the different restrictions on what can occur within 150 feet and 25 feet of the polling place will better equip them to handle those situations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic training in the police academy is an hour and will likely remain at that level, Harvey said. However, the need to train command staff officers and chiefs and sheriffs is an ongoing process that can be done at conferences, regional meetings, and tabletop exercises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal is to have law enforcement agency buy-in at a strategic level, while training the individual officers to be able to respond effectively and intelligently to immediate issues they might encounter as the result of a 9-1-1 call,” Harvey said. “When these two goals are pursued in a parallel manner, the result is a well-trained and well-prepared law enforcement partnership with their local election officials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of the response to the training has been positive, shortly after news broke about the new training officials from Fair Fight and the ACLU of Georgia </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/georgia-is-first-state-to-mandate-controversial-election-security-training-for-police/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey said that he reached out to both organizations immediately after reading of their concerns and invited them to his office where they reviewed the training. He eventually had a conference call with four groups that had expressed concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was determined to make this a very open process and to explain why this was being done, and at the conclusion of the call, it seemed that most of their concerns had been allayed. The training, I told them, was not designed to have polling places bristling with armed law enforcement officers, but rather designed to make sure that if an officer was dispatched to a situation at an election event or polling place, the officer was aware of the existing laws governing situations such as voter intimidation, interfering with elections and election officials, and other prohibited conduct,” Harvey explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I also stressed that the training had specific admonitions about the potential for officers at polling places to be an intimidating presence and that officers needed to be aware that their actions at polling places could have negative consequences for voting and that training, care, and  planning could mitigate some of these effects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11691" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.23.55 AM-300x78.png" alt="" width="300" height="78" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.23.55 AM-300x78.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.23.55 AM-768x200.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.23.55 AM.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Harvey has some advice for other states who want to consider adding this to their own training. First step is to gather all law enforcement relevant election laws together. The CSSE has created</span><a href="https://safeelections.org/resources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Law Enforcement Quick Reference Guides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for each state that put all law enforcement-related state election laws in a compact booklet that an officer can carry in their pocket or download to their phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most law enforcement officers have never been exposed to these laws, they need to learn them. Then, the election officials should contact their respective law enforcement agency or agencies that can provide assistance and start talking about needs, resources, and expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The single most powerful tool that each side has is a good relationship with the other so that potential problems can be identified, and possible solutions explored,” Harvey said. </span></p>

														<p><strong>Lessons Learned from State Upgrades to Voter Registration Databases </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Studies from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Rhode Island</span></em></p>

For election administrators, one of the most important factors is the performance of the voter registration database (VRDB). While VRDBs often receive little attention outside of election administration circles, they are a critical piece of election infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The widespread adoption of VRDBs following the passage of HAVA in 2002 brought voter registration into the twenty-first century, bolstering the efficiency, security, and accessibility of elections across the country. However, two decades of continued technological advancement mean that many states are now finding their VRDBs in need of updates. Changing a VRDB is not a task for this fall, but the coming months are an opportunity to understand how to build on strengths and bolster current VRBDs in 2025.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/lessons-for-vrdb-upgrades/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEIR’s new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> catalogs key insights, promising practices, and lessons learned from four states that recently replaced or are currently replacing their VRDB. CEIR’s Research Team interviewed state election officials and surveyed local election officials in four states—Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Rhode Island—to draw key insights and lessons as well as create detailed case studies about their experiences planning, developing, and implementing a new system. These case studies describe each state’s respective processes and unique insights from officials working with the new VRDB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For other states preparing to upgrade or replace their VRDB, the report identifies six themes among these case studies as promising practices and lessons learned:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin the process of replacing the statewide VRDB earlier rather than later.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess the state team’s internal capabilities and priorities, and contract with external parties and vendors accordingly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involve local election officials early and often in the VRDB replacement process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the possibility (and tradeoffs) of a phased rollout.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize efficiency and ease of use for the new VRDB.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emphasize effective communication for stakeholder support and project management success.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the unique needs of each state ensure that no two VRDBs will be exactly the same, this report aims to equip policymakers and state election officials with knowledge of key insights when they consider updating or replacing their own VRDB in 2025.</span></p>

The numbers show significant racial disparities in both turnout and ballot acceptance—a gap that means Black and Brown voters are systematically under-represented in elections.  *AZ – Maricopa Co; GA – Fulton; MI – Wayne; NC – Columbus, Durham, Mecklenberg; OH – Cuyahoga, Lorain; PA – Allegheny, Philadelphia; WI – Milwaukee </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new analysis is available in an</span><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9222bd321aeb4643917b7950dbdc7ac5"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interactive map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that, for the first time, shows 2020 turnout rates and ballot rejections at a precinct-by-precinct level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting this analysis and data in advance of the 2024 election serves several purposes:    </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishes a comparative baseline for voter turnout and ballot rejection rates to enable better identification of any irregularities in the 2024 election and provide the foundation for future analytic work.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides precinct-level 2020 voting data to help counter false claims of election fraud.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirms that claims of widespread illegal voting in these battleground counties are false and lack merit and evidence. 2020 election data show that only a minuscule fraction (less than 1%) of all ballots cast were rejected for voter eligibility reasons and that validated ballots were cast by eligible voters.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifies low-turnout precincts to help strategically target voter mobilization and education efforts to increase participation in our democracy.    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlights the critical need to provide — and continually improve — election data transparency for the 2024 election and beyond.

Saturday was </span><a href="https://www.khon2.com/2024-elections/hawaii-primary-election-turnout-under-35/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> primary. Just 269,912 of the 839,618 people registered statewide filled out a ballot. That works out to 32.1%. It’s a significant drop from the 39.8% turnout for the 2022 primary and an even more dramatic decline from the 51.2% in 2020. The latter election was the first for the state to use an all mail-in balloting system, though voters can still cast ballots in person at select locations on each island. According to final results released by the Hawaii Office of Elections on Sunday, the 2024 primary numbers represent the </span><a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2024/08/hawaii-saw-the-worst-voter-turnout-saturday-of-any-primary-since-statehood/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lowest turnout in the history of Hawaii as a state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While overall turnout on </span><a href="https://mauinow.com/2024/08/12/precinct-results-in-razor-thin-primary-cook-takes-central-maui-king-backed-in-south-and-east-maui/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maui</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was around 25%, in the areas devastated by wildfires last year, turnout was as low as 14% </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, voters in </span><a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/news/2024-08-13/early-voting-connecticut-complaints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecticut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin headed to the polls. Overall it was relatively problem-free with turnout varying. Connecticut continues to adjust to early voting and Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas said the state may need to make adjustments to how long polls are open. “We may have too many days of early voting,” Thomas said. “I think, like most legislation, sometimes you learn some things after it passes.” Out of 1.2 million registered Democrats and Republicans, only about 8,700 voted early. In </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-wisconsin-2024-primary-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting was steady, but many folks were already looking ahead to November. &#8220;I just hope that Minnesotans realize that the next one is just around the corner,&#8221; Secretary of State Steve Simon said. Simon made the rounds Tuesday, visiting polls in Chaska, Hopkins and Minneapolis. He says he&#8217;s on a mission to get Minnesotans in what he calls &#8220;election mode.&#8221; Simon says the primary election is a warm-up for game day in November. &#8220;For the election judges, the poll workers, some of whom haven&#8217;t worked at an election for a year or two, this is an opportunity to shake off the rust, get into the groove,&#8221; he said. Voters and elections workers in </span><a href="https://www.manchesterjournal.com/local-news/the-calm-before-novembers-storm-voters-trickle-in-for-vermont-primary-elections/article_0f835ab6-59ad-11ef-a743-ab393fb2a090.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermont</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also had November on their minds as they headed to the polls on Tuesday. At Ward 7 in Burlington’s New North End, clerk Jeff Comstock said it has been unusually slow. “I’m concerned I’m boring my volunteers today, which is not good motivation,” he said. Tuesday marked the </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/wisconsin/2024/08/14/drop-boxes-reopened-primary-ballot-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">return of ballot drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><a href="https://www.wsaw.com/2024/08/13/steady-voter-turnout-people-head-polls-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday. “The transition to utilizing drop boxes has been going pretty smoothly thus far, and we hope that that’ll continue in November,” Paulina Gutiérrez, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission told Votebeat. There were two issues of note in Wisconsin on Tuesday. In </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/ballot-printing-error-in-douglas-county-affects-700-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the wrong Assembly primary candidates were printed on ballots for approximately 700 voters in the Town of Summit. And in </span><a href="https://www.wqow.com/eye-on-eau-claire/voter-turn-out-much-higher-than-expected-in-eau-claire/article_72927a1e-59e5-11ef-8f8c-f3486f163283.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eau Claire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, turnout was much higher than expected leading to lines and some polling locations running out of ballots. Overall, <a href="https://www.weau.com/2024/08/14/turnout-wisconsin-election-tops-26-highest-60-years-fall-primary-presidential-year-2/">turnout</a> throughout Wisconsin was high. With approximately 26% that’s a 60-year high. </span></p>

Last week, claiming that </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/laramie-county-clerk-says-there-were-no-errors-in-voting-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larimer County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Debra Lee failed to follow all statutory guidelines during testing, the county GOP first filed a complaint and then a lawsuit. In a news release, Lee said the test of the two vote tabulation machines had “no errors,” and that “none of the complaints allege an error has occurred.” “The County maintains full confidence in the accuracy and operation of all our voting equipment, and will respond fully to all complaints and litigation filed,” Lee said in the release. “The complaint seeks to disrupt our current primary election and force my office to provide alternative means for counting ballots expected to be cast by more than 5,700 absentee voters in Laramie County.” Following the lawsuit filed inLaramie County, Gray sent a </span><a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/media/2024/Letter_re_Public_Testing_of_Equipment.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on August 19 to all county clerks requesting that some of them, including Laramie, rest their voting equipment for next week’s primary. According to WyoFile, the timing of Gray’s request has caused some lawmakers to worry that he, in concert with the state party, is attempting to sow distrust in Wyoming’s elections. “To do this a week ahead [of the election] is absolutely deplorable,” Wyoming Senate President Ogden Driskill (R-Devils Tower) told WyoFile. “It’s a blatant move to try to force hand-counts of our ballots.” Some Republicans in the state used the situation in Laramie County and Gray’s letter as a fundraising push. The fundraising appeal contended without offering evidence that only one of the state’s 23 counties — Platte — conducted tests of its tabulators “without error.” The alert criticized clerks in Johnson, Washakie, Crook, Albany, Carbon and Weston counties for allegedly making it hard to access “the numbers they used to test their vote counting tabulators.”  Clerks in two of those counties told WyoFile that they are, in fact, retesting some voting machines, though the decision was not necessarily prompted by the secretary of state’s request nor Wyoming GOP’s messaging. Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle that several county clerks retested voting machines out of an abundance of caution. “It certainly adds stress, even for those counties whose tests did go well, that did comport with statute,” Ervin said. “There’s a narrative that our equipment failed. And truth be told, the equipment did not fail. The equipment did what it was supposed to do.” In </span><a href="https://wyo4news.com/news/local-republicans-give-thumbs-up-to-countys-voting-equipment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetwater County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, county GOP stood by and issued a press statement in support of that county’s testing. </span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/08/13/no-issues-turn-up-in-second-test-of-laramie-county-voting-machines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larimer County retested their machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday afternoon. About 40 people showed up to witness the testing. The test appeared to run smoothly with no issues. </span><a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/state/local/teton-county-retests-election-equipment-nearly-a-week-out-from-primary/article_3541597a-5a6f-11ef-8a14-ef925a2c4173.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teton County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Maureen Murphy and her election staff spent Tuesday retesting electronic election equipment “They tested correctly,” she said.</span></p>

The move aims to dispel misinformation and assure voters about the integrity of Georgia’s elections. “I think that people like President Trump, he needs to come to an elections office and see what’s going on and see what’s happening,” Holden said. “There’s so much misinformation and disinformation out there that this is an opportunity for us to show the people we are doing everything we can to make sure that this equipment is working properly,” Holden said. She stressed the importance of trust in the election process and how misinformation can undermine voter confidence. “Their vote is all that matters to us. That’s all of our goals at the end is that we have those secure elections that have been conducted with integrity and people can trust what we’re doing,” Holden said. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was in Paulding this week for a </span><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/08/13/georgia-secretary-state-tests-paulding-county-voting-equipment-with-surprise-visit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surprise visit to test the county’s equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, echoed Holden’s sentiments, emphasizing the need to rebuild trust in the electoral system. “I don’t want anyone out there not showing up because they somehow think that it’s not a level playing field. It is a level playing field,” he said.</span></p>

Many other colleges and universities have already had IDs approved. But the board didn&#8217;t approve an electronic ID card that some UNC-Chapel Hill students use because one of the board&#8217;s Republican members objected to that option. The elections board plans to hold a meeting later this month to discuss the Chapel Hill virtual IDs in more detail, then take a vote on whether to accept them. The physical ID card used by UNC students has been approved already. Many state and government agencies have also gotten approval for their employees to be able to use their work IDs as photo identification for voting. Among those newly added this week were the North Carolina Department of Administration, Guilford County Schools and the City of Gastonia. In the primary this March, 473 voters had their ballots thrown out because of ID problems, WRAL reported, out of 1.8 million total voters.</span></p>

The lawsuit targets an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in March 2021 that directed the heads of all federal agencies to submit proposals for their respective agencies to promote voter registration and participation through various points of contact with the public. The president issued the order as GOP-led statehouses were pushing voter suppression legislation in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The nine Republican attorneys general who filed the</span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69041089/1/montana-state-of-v-biden/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal court argue that Biden exceeded his authority when he issued the directive, which they also say violates the US Constitution and “undermines the voter registration systems set up by the States.” “Through Executive Order 14019,” the states argue, “President Biden has sought to convert the federal bureaucracy into a voter registration organization and to turn every interaction between a federal bureaucrat and a member of the public into a voter registration pitch.” The states also claim that the executive order was “was motivated by a partisan desire to unfairly increase the Democrat vote.” They argue that the executive order and its implementation has caused them “pocketbook injuries, procedural harms, and harms to the States’ sovereign interests” by allegedly trampling on their own “ability to regulate voter registration.” The states that brought the lawsuit are Montana, Kansas, Iowa, </span><a href="https://www.sdpb.org/crime-courts/2024-08-14/jackley-challenging-biden-voter-registration-executive-order"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/08/14/mississippi-officials-sue-to-block-federal-voter-registration-efforts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wowt.com/2024/08/14/nebraska-joins-lawsuit-over-bidens-voter-registration-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.am1100theflag.com/news/north-dakota-eight-other-states-file-lawsuit-aimed-at-blocking-voter-registration-executive-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Oklahoma, South Carolina.

A grand jury indicted Acting Mayor Arthur Heckman Sr. and City Clerk Ruthie Borromeo on eight felonies apiece for allegedly tampering with the elections and failing to report results properly. The indictment also states that they “induced or attempted to induce an election official to fail in the official duty by force, threat, intimidation, or offers of reward.” Pilot Station is a town of about 600 people on the banks of the Yukon River in Western Alaska.  The charges,</span><a href="https://www.kyuk.org/public-safety/2024-08-09/pilot-station-city-officials-charged-with-felony-election-interference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week by KYUK radio, were published July 30, and both are scheduled to appear in court via Zoom on Aug. 20. According to the Alaska Beacon, until that date, limited public information is available. Senior Assistant Attorney General Jenna Gruenstein said by phone that “these are not state elections. These are local elections that are at issue.” She wasn’t able to provide details to the Beacon beyond the indictment but said, “these involved elections that either weren’t held or the ballots weren’t counted at all. … Those are the allegations.”</span></p>

We the People Arizona Alliance, a group known for spreading election conspiracy theories, filed a lawsuit in 2022 seeking the names of people who performed signature verification on early ballots in the 2020 general election. The group said that some election workers verified signatures too quickly and it wanted to further investigate training and procedures for those workers. The Recorder’s Office declined to provide the names of low-level and temporary election workers, citing concerns that disclosure would subject those workers to threats and harassment. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, Elections Director Scott Jarrett and former Assistant Director Kristi Passarelli all testified that they and other election officials have faced frequent threats in recent years. Blaney agreed. “The Court finds that the Recorder has established in this case legitimate security concerns about public disclosure of the identities of lower level and non-managerial employees,” Blaney wrote. “The threats and harassment that these employees face are both alarming and pervasive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are </span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2024-08-09/arizona-republicans-ask-u-s-supreme-court-to-enforce-proof-of-citizenship-voting-law"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking the U.S. Supreme Court </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to enforce election reform laws that would prohibit Arizonans from voting for president or by mail, unless they provide proof of citizenship. Two years ago, a series of voting rights groups sued to stop the election laws passed by Republican lawmakers from going into effect, calling the legislation an effort to disenfranchise voters. The laws have been stuck in legal limbo ever since. A trial court judge partially upheld the laws in March, and the case is currently being reviewed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In July, the 9th Circuit issued a temporary stay ordering that anyone who tries to register to vote using a state form is required at the same time to provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a driver’s license. But the appeals court recently reversed that ruling, prompting Republicans defending the law to file an emergency application for a stay with Associate Justice Elena Kagan on August 8. The stay would again allow Arizona to enforce the proof of citizenship requirement ahead of the November elections. “We just witnessed something that I&#8217;ve never even heard of and is highly irregular and unusual,” Senate President Warren Petersen (R-Gilbert) said of the 9th Circuit’s subsequent decision. “It’s unheard of. It’s disturbing really, and I think the dissenting judge really said it well; it makes them look very political, and it causes them to lose credibility. … The standard is a ‘great manifest injustice’ and come on, requiring only U.S. citizens to vote? Allowing non-citizens to vote is a manifest injustice. The court is literally doing the opposite of what their own rules are requiring them to do,” Petersen added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Melissa Iyer Julian ordered lawmakers to </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/prop-140-make-elections-fair-misleading-description-for-open-primary-ballot-initiative/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewrite the description of a ballot proposition to end partisan primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Arizona after ruling the summary was misleading. Julian ruled August 12 that a legislative panel responsible for writing summaries of ballot measures that are sent to every Arizona voter wrote a misleading description of Proposition 140, a citizen initiative also known as the Make Elections Fair Act.  If voters approve it in November, the measure would create an open primary system where all candidates for federal, state and local offices would face off in a single primary election instead of segregated partisan elections. Those primaries would also include candidates who are politically unaffiliated.  All registered voters would be able to choose from all the candidates in the primary, and the top vote-getters would advance to the general election, even if they don’t represent different parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors has settled a lawsuit filed by state and county Republican officials over</span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2024-08-13/maricopa-county-settles-lawsuit-over-vote-tabulation-equipment"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tests that ensure the accuracy of vote tabulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before elections. The suit, filed against Maricopa County in July, claimed the county and secretary of state did not properly conduct tests of vote tabulation equipment as required by state law. Every election, logic and accuracy testing is conducted with test ballots brought in by the secretary of state — a process the public can watch online or in person. A settlement agreement signed on Aug. 12 only deals with one of those issues: claims by the Republican officials that the Secretary of State only tested Maricopa County’s “backup” machines. According to the settlement, the county “shall provide only its tabulators and accessible voting devices that the [Maricopa County Board of Supervisors] intends to deploy to early voting locations and election day vote centers.”</span></p>

Peters had faced three felony counts of attempting to influence a public servant, four felony counts related to impersonation and identity theft and three misdemeanor counts of official misconduct, violation of duties and failure to comply with the secretary of state’s requirements. “This case is simply about crimes committed by her in concert with others that were designed to be a cover-up,” special deputy district attorney Robert Shapiro told the jury in closing. “This case is not about computers, it’s not about election documents, it’s about using deceit to trick public servants.” The jury largely agreed, clearing Peters on only two of the felony impersonation counts and one of the felony identity theft charges. Peters was on counts 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 &amp; 10. Counts 1, 2 and 4 have a sentencing range of 2-6 years each, Count 6: 12-18 months and Counts 8, 9 &amp; 10: 90-364 days each. Depending on whether she’s sentenced consecutively or concurrently, Peters faces 7 to 22 years in jail. </span></p>

He filed a complaint in circuit court against independent candidate Cynthia Harris, claiming she did not properly and legally file to run for office. He wants her disqualified as a candidate. Helm is also suing Glen Gilzean in his capacity as the current supervisor. Gilzean is not running for election to the post, to which he was appointed by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Harris is set to face the winner of the Aug. 20 Democratic primary between Helm, Wes Hodge, Karen Castor Dentel and Sunshine Grund. Hodge filed a motion to join the legal action as an intervener and Munyon granted the request Tuesday. Munyon told Hodge and attorneys for Helm, Harris, and Gilzean to have proposed solutions by Thursday morning for any decision she may make to either keep Harris in the race or disqualify her. Munyon promised a ruling by the end of Friday.</span></p>

On July 24, Labrador filed a challenge with the Idaho Supreme Court seeking to block Proposition 1 from going up for vote. Labrador alleged that signatures gatherers misled the public and fraudulently obtained signatures that were used to qualify the ballot initiative for the election. Labrador also alleged that the ballot initiative violates the Idaho Constitution’s requirement that laws only address one single subject. However, the Idaho Supreme Court dismissed Labrador’s challenge on procedural grounds on Tuesday without even holding oral arguments on the case. “Today the Idaho Supreme Court dismisses the attorney general’s petition on procedural grounds,” Idaho Supreme Court Justice Robyn M. Brody wrote in the opinion. “Allegations of fraud in the gathering of signatures in the initiative process are serious. Those allegations, however, must be adjudicated in the district court in the first instance. The attorney general’s petition fundamentally misapprehends the role of this court under the Idaho Constitution and the role of the secretary of state under the initiative laws enacted by the Idaho Legislature.” The Idaho Supreme Court also said it would not weigh in on Labrador’s allegation that the ballot initiative violates the Idaho Constitution’s single-subject requirement unless voters approve it.  “…(T)hat issue will not be ripe for review, unless and until Idaho voters approve the initiative at the general election in November,” Brody wrote in the opinion.</span></p>

In a 43-page response filed for the board August 8, Assistant Attorney General Daniel M. Kobrin wrote that U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher was correct when she dismissed the lawsuit earlier this year due to a lack of standing by the groups who brought the action. He went on to say that the lawsuit failed to “raise a cognizable federal question.” “Although Maryland Election Integrity’s complaint cited federal statutes, it did not plead a ‘substantial’ federal claim, as required for federal jurisdiction to exist,” Kobrin wrote of the plaintiffs. “Some of the allegations it made in connection with federal law were mere requests for relief involving no federal claim.” The state’s response comes a month after Maryland Election Integrity LLC and Missouri-based United Sovereign Americans filed an appeal of Gallagher’s ruling in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. The two groups originally filed suit against the state board of elections in March in U.S. District Court in Baltimore. That lawsuit alleged a half-dozen violations of state and federal election laws as well as the Maryland Public Information Act.</span></p>

Civic Nebraska and voting rights advocates announced the lawsuit July 29. Oral arguments are set for Aug. 28 in a case that revolves around whether the Legislature can remove the voting rights disqualification for felons after they’ve completed their sentence.  Lawmakers passed two versions: Legislative Bill 53 in 2005, which established a two-year waiting period after felons have completed their sentence, and LB 20 in April, to remove the disqualification as soon as they have served their sentence. LB 20, from State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha, passed 38-6 and took effect July 19, three months after the Legislature adjourned. But two days before the law took effect, on July 17, Evnen directed county election officials not to register new voters who had felony convictions, unless they previously had their voting rights restored under the 2005 law, with the waiting period. The lawsuit argues that only courts can stop a law, that the will of voters and lawmakers is being ignored and that Evnen’s action threatened people’s freshly restored rights.</span></p>

One by county commission candidate Mark Lawson was dismissed last week. The other, by school board candidate Paul White, involved a filing Monday where he asked the court to dismiss his case. District Court Judge Kathleen Drakulich had written last month that she felt White “fails to show that he enjoys a likelihood of success on the merits of his Complaint.” The decision for White — and by extension Lawson because their lawsuits were the same — then became whether to appeal the judge’s rejection of his preliminary request, pursue his claims further with the same judge or call it a day. Mark Hutchings represented White and Lawson in the lawsuits. “The point of the case was to get a ‘recount,’ as required by statute,” he told the Reno Gazette Journal by email. The Secretary of State’s Office did not immediately respond to request for comment. &#8220;We are pleased with the outcome and believe that dismissal was the only </span></p>

In November 2022, some polling locations saw shortages of paper ballots and malfunctioning voting equipment. Some locations opened later in the day, resulting in longer wait times for voters. Those irregularities drove more than 20 local Republican candidates to contest the election results — and Republican lawmakers in the Texas Legislature to force the county to dissolve its elections administration office. A criminal probe initiated by Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg into irregularities around the 2022 election found no evidence of a campaign to suppress voter turnout or influence the election’s outcome, officials said. Paper ballot shortages weren’t the result of deliberate attempts to unduly sway the election results, Ogg said. Those shortages came about, she said, because an election official in charge of making sure each polling place had enough paper ballots failed to do so because he was working two full-time jobs at the same time. Darryl Blackburn, a former data analyst at the now-shuttered Harris County Elections Department, has been charged with five counts of tampering with government documents, a state jail felony punishable by up to two years in jail and a $10,000 fine; and one count of theft, a third-degree felony that carries a potential prison sentence between two and 10 years and a fine of up to $10,000. Investigators said they found no evidence that Blackburn intended to influence the outcome of the November 2022 elections.</span></p>

Down by just 176 votes following a recount, the plea to the state’s high court was Jenkins’ last chance at trying to overtake incumbent Rep. Celeste Maloy in the 2nd Congressional District’s Republican primary. The decision released this week and authored by Chief Justice Matthew Durrant found that Jenkins “falls well short” of making his case that county clerks should count 1,171 by-mail ballots that were disqualified because they missed the state’s deadline for postmarking, which falls one day before Election Day. enkins claimed in his lawsuit that the state’s postmark requirement was unconstitutional because voters are treated differently based on where their mail is processed, and that relying on the U.S. Postal Service to postmark a by-mail ballot interferes with the right to vote. However, the justices found that Jenkins’ case did not adequately support either of those arguments. Quoting a 2019 ruling by the court, Durrant wrote that a party “may not simply point toward a pile of sand and expect the court to build a castle.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin’s process for restoring voting rights </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for people convicted of a felony, ruling that the suit was filed under an incorrect section of law but also seeming to criticize the governor’s use of power by comparing it to that of a monarch. Virginia is the only state in the country that permanently strips civil rights from anyone convicted of a felony and empowers only the governor to restore rights on a case-by-case basis. Youngkin has tightened it up, restoring rights to a fraction of the number of people who had rights restored in the past few years. Critics say he also has not set out clear criteria for why some cases are approved and some are denied. “No one would suggest that Governor Youngkin’s ‘fully implemented’ system is transparent, or that it gives the appearance of fairness,” the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found in a ruling issued August 7 and signed by District Judge John A. Gibney Jr. Adding that Youngkin’s method of receiving petitions for relief and deciding whether to rule on them without any explanation is “much like a monarch,” the court said that nonetheless, “transparency and the appearance of fairness are not the issues in this case.”</span></p>

The Laramie County GOP already filed a complaint with the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office on August 6 over the issue. The Wyoming GOP executive committee decided to initiate the lawsuit in order “to take all measures to restore integrity in the election.”  The Wyoming GOP is asking the district court “to declare that the electronic tabulating machines have not been properly tested and issue an injunction to safeguard the integrity of our primary election,” according to a Wyoming GOP news release sent out early Thursday. The purpose of the injunction is to either retest the voting tabulating machines or “arrive at another counting method, such as hand counting (ballots) that is allowed by state statute,” Love said. Since it is now past the two-week deadline, Eathorne said the “only outstanding option” is to hand-count ballots. However, Ervin said the likelihood of switching to a hand-count “is practically zero.” The purpose of the two-week window is to reconcile any issues or concerns after the first test, he said.</span></p>

These materials are intended to provide resources to election officials to support their mental and physical well-being and that of their colleagues and staff. The Elections Group launched their resilience resources in April 2024, while The Carter Center issued a first edition of Taking Care of Yourself to Serve Others in 2022. This second edition includes new resources and tools that have been developed for election administrators since the initial launch. <strong>When:</strong> Aug. 20, 12pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/primary-solution-conversation-nick-troiano"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Primary Solution: A Conversation with Nick Troiano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In his book, “The Primary Solution,” Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano identifies partisan primaries as one of the main drivers of political polarization and gridlock in the U.S. Because primaries are controlled at the state level, Troiano suggests that reforming the primary process presents a great opportunity to make substantive progress in pursuit of a more democratic and representative form of self-government. Unlike Electoral College reform or national voting rights legislation, ending partisan primaries does not require a constitutional amendment or an act of Congress. In fact, states like Alaska and California have already taken steps to eliminate partisan dominance of the primary process, by instituting reforms like top-two primaries and ranked choice voting. On August 22, 2024, from 2-3 p.m. ET, Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith will host author and Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano for a discussion on his book, “The Primary Solution: Rescuing Our Democracy from the Fringes.” <strong>When:</strong> August 22, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
