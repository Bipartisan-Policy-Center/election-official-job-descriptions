														<p><strong>Standards of Conduct<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center and Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice release standards</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the </span><a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Election Officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (The Election Center) and the Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice released a new set of <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ELC_Toolkit-1.pdf">Standards of Conduct</a> for elections officials as they prepare for and face the challenges of 2024 and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10773" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards7-300x118.png" alt="" width="300" height="118" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards7-300x118.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards7-1024x404.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards7-768x303.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards7.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The new set of Standards of Conduct for elections officials builds off of work done more than 20 years ago when the Election Center’s Task Force on Election Reform introduced the Principles of Election/Registration Officials and its companion Standards of Conduct for Election/Registration Officials, which at the time were developed by the nation’s election administrators and voter registrars as the ethical standard for the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mitchell Brown, Curtis O. Liles III endowed professor of political science at </span><a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/mitchell-brown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auburn University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, during the 2020 election season, election officials asked the Institute  how to talk with the public in a way that the public would hear and understand that the work election officials do every day around the country is conducted with integrity and accuracy and in compliance with the law of the nation and each of the states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10774" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards6-300x119.png" alt="" width="300" height="119" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards6-300x119.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards6-768x305.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards6.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Through that effort, we also started having conversations about how to lift up the Election Center’s Standards of Conduct with the same goal,” Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to concerns about public trust in elections raised during the 2020 election, these documents were revisited to ensure that they address the current challenges facing the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We often talk about the patchwork of our decentralized election system, about all the idiosyncrasies and variation in election administration from one state to the next, one jurisdiction to another,” said Tammy Patrick, CEO of Programs for The Election Center. “For all the differences, there are commonly held, core beliefs shared by those who have made this profession their life’s work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10775" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards5-300x121.png" alt="" width="300" height="121" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards5-300x121.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards5-1024x415.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards5-768x311.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards5.png 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ELC_Toolkit-1.pdf">Standards of Conduct</a>, developed by Election Center members and enhanced by the Election Center’s cross-partisan Committee on Ethics in Practice and The Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice, help to bridge these principles with action. They are a tool for election officials to clearly communicate with the public about their work, and what it means to administer elections with transparency, honesty, and integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The principles and actions outlined in the Standards are nothing new for election officials,” said Hilary Rudy, deputy director of elections for the </span><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and chair of the Committee on Ethics in Practice at the Institute. “What is new is our national effort to share these Standards publicly and increase engagement with the public about election officials&#8217; work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10776" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards4-300x123.png" alt="" width="300" height="123" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards4-300x123.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards4-1024x420.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards4-768x315.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards4.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ELC_Toolkit-1.pdf">Standards of Conduct</a> include a Toolkit for elections officials that included a sample press release, media talking points and social media guidance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work to complete the updated standards and create the toolkit was supported by the </span><a href="https://www.squareonefoundationchicago.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square One Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and involved engaging other partners to help flesh out and annotate the Election Center’s ethical code, listening sessions and focus groups with election officials and stakeholders across the election system and surveys about what the most important values are, biggest issues, and how they face these</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, the committee is working on additional tools to support election officials, including a new field-specific <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10777" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards2-300x122.png" alt="" width="300" height="122" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards2-300x122.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards2-768x312.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Standards2.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />framework to support ethical decision-making in uncertain circumstances and considering topics for additional ethics trainings. These new resources and initiatives will give election officials an expanded set of tools to build trust with their communities and increase public knowledge of their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope all election administrators will join me in using the standards and the resources in the toolkit to communicate with the public about our principles and what it means to conduct elections with transparency, honesty, and integrity,” Rudy said. </span></p>

							<h2>Effective Election Policies  </h2>
														<p><strong>Carter Center and Rice’s Baker Institute Say U.S. Election System Must be a National Priority<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">National framework developed for bipartisan and effective election policies  </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As U.S. democratic principles are being tested, The Carter Center and Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy have proposed</span><a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/democracy/u.s.-elections/guiding-principles-for-election-administration-020624.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guiding principles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure that elections are conducted in ways that give Americans greater confidence in their outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6137" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-300x191.png" alt="" width="300" height="191" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-300x191.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-768x489.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Too often, elections processes are used in ways intended to give political advantage to one side or the other,” said David Carroll, Director of the Democracy Program at The Carter Center. “And too many political and elected leaders obfuscate and peddle fear about the mechanics of elections, the laws governing them, and the process leading to election results, in order to motivate votes for their side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such political gamesmanship has resulted in a greater lack of confidence in election outcomes, said John Williams, co-director of the Baker Institute’s Presidential Elections Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The guiding principles offered in the report are designed to instill confidence among people on both sides of the political aisle,” Williams said. “If we can agree on such principles, then perhaps policymakers can develop laws and regulations that govern elections in sensible and pragmatic ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10768" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-07-at-7.12.10 PM-300x141.png" alt="" width="300" height="141" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-07-at-7.12.10 PM-300x141.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-07-at-7.12.10 PM.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III chaired the bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2005, both worried that democracy could face dangers if the elections are perceived as defective. “Elections are the heart of democracy,” Carter and Baker wrote in the introductory letter to their final report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2020, The Carter Center and Baker Institute have established a collaboration to continue studying election issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans use the election system – specifically, their ballots – to communicate their ideas, priorities, and values. Elections allow Americans to combine with other voters to make concrete choices for the future of their nation, states and local communities. However, unlike most countries around the world which have uniform voting rules and procedures, the U.S. system is widely decentralized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Carter Center and Baker Institute identified ten guiding principles that are crucial to a healthy election system everywhere – even as individual policies and procedures continue to vary from community to community. The goal is to provide a framework on a national level for bipartisan and effective policies that balance what is required for Americans to have faith in their elections and the twin needs for equitable access and integrity of the results:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">America’s election system – and the democracy it supports – must be a national priority.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election laws and policies should be clear, transparent and well-communicated to the public.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter registration should be widely available, easily accomplished, secure and well-run.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting – specifically, the act of receiving and casting a ballot – should be flexible enough to meet voters’ needs equitably, especially between rural and urban populations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting technology should be a gateway, not a barrier, to the voting process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">States and localities should prioritize policies that allow ballots to be cast and counted on or before Election Day so that the final count can be completed as soon as possible after the close of polls.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military and overseas voters should continue to have the opportunity to cast timely and valid ballots.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tabulation of election returns should be transparent – and proceed in an orderly fashion.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurisdictions should commit to regular and rigorous audits of the election process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. should embrace recognized standards and best practices for election observation.</span></li>

In </span><a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/02/03/combined-precincts-other-changes-cause-headaches-horry-county-voters/?outputType=amp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horry County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the county previously announced it would be combining some precincts for both the Democratic and Republican presidential preference primaries. Officials said it was based on guidance from both parties and the South Carolina Election Commission. Some voters said they arrived at the wrong polling place due to the combined precincts or didn’t know where to go due to signage in the area. Horry County elections director Sandy Martin said their office “addressed each issue” as it came up throughout the day. “There are signs at all locations that are closed instructing the voters where to go,” she said. “If we received a complaint, or our rover notified us of issues with signage, we have provided more at locations where needed. We are making notes of all these precincts so that extra signage will be sent for the Republican primary.” It was slow going at the polls in </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/03/south-carolina-democratic-primary-poll-workers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Charleston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but that didn’t deter poll worker Annette Green from noting the importance of her job. “I find that to be important for young kids to learn. Democracy was not ours. We had to earn it, and we’re earning it when we teach our young children – like my daughter’s coming out here to work the election poll – it taught them how important it was for them to keep encouraging each other to get out and vote.” </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nevada-primary-turnout-rcna137533"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s first presidential primary in decades was drawing light voter interest Tuesday, with Democrats having banked ballots through early and mail-in voting while Republicans looked ahead to competing caucuses to be held Feb. 8. Ultimately, only about 125,000 Nevadans voted in the Democratic primary and 80,000 in the Republican primary, NBC News estimates. There was some confusion about the Republican primary and caucus system. The </span><a href="https://www.kunr.org/local-stories/2024-02-07/nevada-election-officials-report-no-issues-at-the-polls-on-primary-election-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washoe County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interim registrar of voters, Cari Ann Burgess said the Nevada Secretary of State’s office asked her team to stay late and count as many ballots as possible on election day. She called the election successful and said her office has fielded many questions about the caucus. “We just give them the phone number for the Republican Party. We’re a nonpartisan office, we don’t get into that,” Burgess said. “We do a very honest and fair election, and try to be as transparent as possible to make sure that everybody has the right information.” Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said polls opened on time and there were no issues to report across the state. He said while Washoe and Clark counties had sufficient election workers, rural counties needed more support, particularly Douglas County. “Clark and Washoe were able to use some creative recruiting to be able to fill the spots that they had open,” Aguilar said. “I know some of the rural communities struggled a little bit. And we tried to help supplement some of that staff and that team to be able to make sure that there were enough poll workers in those counties. We now have four months to figure this out.”</span></p>

Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) said. Democratic members agreed with Republican colleagues that election administrations should be publicly funded, but argued GOP lawmakers’ specific focus on who the private funders were drew attention from the reason for the hearing — helping underfunded local election administrations. “All of us can agree that no private funding should be funding our elections — it should be public funding,”  Rep. Teri Sewell (D-Ala.), said. “I really have no tolerance for the unrelenting assault perpetrated by the partisan and extreme organizations represented by today’s Republican witnesses,” Sewell said. Zachary Mohr, associate professor at the University of Kansas testified that through auditing the more than 8,000 election jurisdictions, the University of Kansas estimates these local election administrations shoulder a collective $2 billion in cost to operate. “I really think that with states banning private funding, which there may be valid reasons for that, but if that’s going to be the case, elections administration has been underfunded for years, now it is getting critically underfunded because it doesn’t have the resources it needs – we need the federal government to step in here,” Mohr said.</span></p>

The Pew Research Center survey, conducted Jan. 16-21 among 5,140 adults, also finds smaller majorities supporting allowing anyone to vote by mail if they want to (57%), as well as automatic and Election Day voter registration (57% each). Americans are more divided on whether groups should be banned from collecting completed ballots to return to official voting centers (47% favor, 50% oppose) and whether people should be removed from registration lists if they have not voted recently or confirmed their registration (44% favor, 55% oppose). Nearly half of Americans (47%) favor banning groups from collecting completed ballots to return to official voting centers, while roughly the same share (50%) oppose this. The public is also relatively divided over removing people from voter registration lists if they have not voted recently or confirmed their registration, with slightly more opposing this (55%) than supporting it (44%). Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats (60% vs. 27%) to support the removal of inactive records from registration lists. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats (56% vs. 41%) to favor banning groups from collecting and returning ballots. The single widest partisan gap on the voting policies asked about in this survey is over “allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to.” And that gap is now substantially wider than it was in April 2020, the result of a sharp decline in support among Republicans: Today, just 28% of Republicans say any voter should be allowed to vote by mail if they want to. Four years ago, 49% of Republicans said this. An overwhelming share of Democrats (84%) continue to say voting by mail should be available to all voters. Democratic support is essentially unchanged over this period.</span></p>

Under Act 150, county elections offices “may not receive, accept, or expend gifts, donations, or funding from private individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, or any third party not provided through ordinary state or county appropriations.” State Sen. Chip Campsen, R-Isle of Palms, was involved in the elections reform that was ultimately signed into law in May 2022. He said he never imagined these innocuous stickers getting banned. “That’s not the type of thing we were targeting,” Campsen said, admitting the language was meant to prohibit outside donations and grants like the so-called “Zuckerbucks” that flowed into local elections office around the country to help them deal with the coronavirus pandemic. “But with the ‘I Voted’ stickers, there’s no element of those stickers trying to put the thumb on the scale,” Campsen said, adding, “I didn’t know that they came from a nonprofit.” That means the S.C. State Election Commission is picking up the tab. In the fall of 2023, the state agency paid $23,255.26 for stickers, according to agency spokesman John Michael Catalono. The latest shipment added up to $16,264. “Moving forward, the State Election Commission will print and provide our own stickers to the county offices,” Catalono said, adding that counties also have the option to buy their own stickers from third-party vendors.</span></p>

Election security remains a paramount concern for CISA, the lead federal agency entrusted with securing the nation’s elections infrastructure. The agency continues to proudly stand shoulder-to-shoulder with state and local election officials who are on the frontlines of defending our electoral process, and is committed to providing them with the resources, capabilities, and actionable information to help them ensure the security and integrity of the elections process. As part of the #Protect2024 initiative, CISA developed a webpage to serve as a central point for consolidated critical resources, training lists and security service offerings to support the over 8,000 election jurisdictions for the 2024 election cycle. These efforts build upon prior years of working with elections officials to mitigate the cyber, physical, and operational risks to election infrastructure. “The #PROTECT2024 website provides a consolidated set of free resources for state and local election officials, those on the front lines of securing the democratic process,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “This year, we are placing particular focus on support to local election offices in order to help them strengthen their security posture.” CISA encourages stakeholders, government officials, and the public to explore the #Protect2024 website, joining the collective effort to ensure a secure and resilient 2024 election cycle.

Election experts consider a paper backup to be a critical security measure to ensure that ballots are counted as the voter intended. By 2024, that number has dropped dramatically, with only three states likely to still use paperless voting equipment in 2024. Indeed, we estimate that in the upcoming presidential election, nearly 99 percent of all registered voters will live in jurisdictions where they can cast a ballot with a paper record of the vote, including <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9702" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VerifiedVoting-300x67.png" alt="" width="300" height="67" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VerifiedVoting-300x67.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VerifiedVoting.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />100 percent of voters who will cast ballots in battleground states. Much of the progress that has been made since 2016 is due to an influx of federal funds for election security. In 2017, in the wake of unprecedented cyber threats to elections, the Department of Homeland Security designated election equipment as critical infrastructure. After this designation, Congress </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/grants/election-security-funds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $380 million in 2018 to help states acquire secure election technology, followed by another $425 million in 2020. Since the 2020 election, Congress has continued to provide election security grants, but in far lower amounts — just $75 million in both 2022 and 2023. This federal funding is the first of its kind since 2010 and helped make it possible for many states to </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/EAC_2022_Grant_Expenditure_Report_Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outdated equipment.

SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, passed the committee on a 7-3 party line vote. The bill, substituted prior to the vote, would make it illegal to “knowingly” provide an absentee ballot that is pre-filled with any voter information and would require applicants to submit their own applications. The legislation would provide an exception for voters who receive emergency treatment by a licensed physician within five days before an election. The legislation would make it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a third party to “knowingly” receive payment or a gift for distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining or delivering an absentee ballot application. A person who “knowingly” pays or provides a gift to a third party to distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, complete, obtain or deliver a voter’s absentee ballot application would be guilty of a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison. A voter who needs assistance due to blindness, disability or inability to read “may be given assistance by an individual of the voter’s choice, other than the voter’s employer or agent of that employer or officer or agent of the voter’s union.”  Military stationed overseas would not be impacted by the legislation.</span></p>

The move is part of an effort to deflate the state’s voter rolls, which currently contain many more people than are eligible to vote in the state, an artifact of the state’s transient population and the fact that it’s much easier to add someone to the rolls than it is to remove them. If signed into law,</span><a href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/33?Root=HB%20129"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 129</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow the state to remove someone from its rolls in six years instead of eight. Alaska’s existing eight-year timeline is one of the longest in the country, according to records kept by the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the new six-year timeline is longer than the four-year minimum in federal law.  In addition, the bill would put into law best practices for maintaining the list and require the Alaska Division of Elections to promptly notify voters if their information is released in a data breach. One such breach took place in 2020, but elections officials didn’t notify the public until after the election.</span></p>

At a hearing, House Republicans like Rep. Rachel Jones (R-17) spoke in favor of the bill and said precinct voting helps preserve election integrity and reduces wait times. “It&#8217;s actually more convenient because they are right there, whether it&#8217;s at their neighborhood, school or church, they can go before work or after work,” Jones said. 12 Arizona counties currently use voting centers, including the two with the highest populations. Pima County started using them in the 2022 election, while Maricopa County has been using them since 2016. Democrats in opposition like Rep. Laura Terech (D-4) said densely populated areas would struggle to find the number of poll workers the bill would require. With 2.7 million registered voters in Maricopa County, the bill would mandate 2,700 voting locations and require 16,000 poll workers to staff them. Pima County would require at least 625 precincts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill sponsored by state Sen. John Kavanagh sets a </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/abekwok/2024/02/07/arizona-bill-voter-turnout-elections/72504606007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimal bar of a 25% turnout in local elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aren’t held in conjunction with a statewide or federal election. If less than 25% of the electorate votes, the results are declared void and the election gets repeated on a date when a statewide or federal office is on the ballot. Kavanagh said he’s not targeting any particular offender or type of election. He cited as an example — presumably theoretical — a sanitation district that’s proposing a fee increase. “It’s the principle of the thing,” Kavanagh said. “Elections with fewer people are simply undemocratic.”</span></p>

The measure (</span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/562"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 562</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) would make it illegal to harass, intimidate, threaten or coerce an election worker with the intent to impede or interfere with their official duties or to retaliate against them for doing so. First-time offenders would face a first-degree misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and $1,000 in fines. “This bill is a safeguard of the integrity of the election process by deterring and penalizing harassment against those individuals involved in its administration,” said its sponsor, St. Petersburg Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson. “The most critical component of our republic is the right to vote. We protect voters. Certainly, we should protect those who administer the elections process.” Rouson’s peers on the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee agreed this week, voting unanimously to send his bill to the second of three panels it must pass through before reaching the Senate floor.</span></p>

Instead, ballots would be counted from the printed text or filled-in ovals next to candidate names.= Republicans supporting the bill said it would improve election security and reduce the risk of hacks or tampering that could flip votes. There’s no indication that Georgia’s voting machines have been breached during an election. It’s unlikely that the change could be made in time for this year’s presidential election. “The biggest challenge that a voter has is knowing that their vote was correctly recorded,” said Sen. Max Burns, a Republican from Sylvania. “Let’s eliminate QR codes. Let’s make sure that electors can read the ballot and be clear about how they voted.” Democrats critical of the proposal said it would be expensive and impractical to implement before this November’s presidential election. Under</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-legislative-navigator/#bills/SB/189"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 189</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ballot scanners would count votes directly from the ballot text or a machine mark, such as a computer-printed oval filled in with voters’ choices. The text or bubbles would become the official vote rather than the QR code. The cost of technology changes needed to count ballots from the text starts at $15 million — and possibly much more — for thousands of new ballot printers and election computers across the state. So far, lawmakers haven’t appropriated money in the state budget for replacement election equipment. The legislation cleared the Senate on a 31-22 vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed. The bill now advances to the state House.</span></p>

The bill would also allow the state to “crosscheck” voters’ addresses from the Statewide Voter Registration System with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles’ list of temporary credentials. “Election security is and always should be a top priority in our state,” said Wesco, chair of the House Elections and Apportionment Committee. “Verifying voting records will ensure that every vote cast is legitimate and makes sure our elections are held to a high standard.” Wesco said his bill would also provide the state with the ability to identify noncitizens who are registered incorrectly.</span></p>

House Bill 2512, however, would end early in-person voting on the Sunday before an election. Clay Barker, general counsel for the Kansas secretary of state, remained neutral on the bill and said it was mostly a resource debate on what counties can accommodate on a weekend. Some smaller communities with fewer staff may welcome the shorter timeframe as they prepare for the election, said Harvey County Clerk Rick Piepho, who added that it’s a popular time to vote. “About 10% of our total in-person voters vote in that four-hour period on Monday,” Piepho said, referring only to early-in person votes in his county. Further restrictions were proposed for counties sending advanced ballots to voters in Senate Bill 366. Under the bill, voters would have to request an application for an advanced ballot and counties would be prohibited from pre-writing portions of it, such as the name and address of the voter. Legislators backing the bill said counties can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars mailing prefiled applications to voters, while supportive citizens claimed mail-in voting is more susceptible to fraud.</span></p>

The bills are part of Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) legislative agenda comes in response to increased threats and attacks, around the nation, on government officials as well as a shortage of law enforcement officers. Eric Luedtke, the governor’s chief legislative officer, testified on</span><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0585?ys=2024rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 585</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Protecting Election Officials Act) that would create a new misdemeanor charge in state election law for threats against election officials or someone in their immediate family. According to the legislation, election officials include state and local administrators of elections, members of state and local boards of elections, employees of state and local boards of elections and election judges. Immediate family members include a spouse, children and parents. As defined in the bill, a threat can be made orally, by electronic communication or in any written form whether or not it’s signed “with a fictitious name or any other mark.” In the bill, harm includes serious injury or serious emotional distress. The charge would be a misdemeanor and a person found guilty could be sentenced up to three years, be fined up to $2,500, or both. Under current law, a person who interferes or hinders an election official who is performing official duties could be found guilty of a misdemeanor. The punishment could be a fine from $50 to $1,000, a sentence of up to a year in jail, or both. The state Office of the Attorney General wrote a letter of support but requested that the definition of election official be amended to include “counsel to a local board of elections or counsel to the State Board.”</span></p>

State Senator Theresa Gavarone from (R &#8211; Bowling Green), one of the sponsors of Senate Bill 137, along with Democrat William DeMora, told WTOL’s sister station WBNS in Columbus that it comes down to time and money. “It takes longer, it can takes several weeks to come up with a result, and with each tabulation increases costs to our boards of elections. So it undoes a lot of the good we’ve been trying in Ohio, so we want to ban it,” said Gavarone.</span></p>

Rep. Tyler Tordsen, R-Sioux Falls, presented his latest proposal during a House State Affairs Committee hearing less than a month after his resolution with similar aims failed in the same room. Currently, legislative, federal and gubernatorial candidates are selected by primary voters in South Dakota. The state is one of three that still chooses its candidates for the remaining constitutional offices – lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, commissioner of school and public lands, and public utilities commissioners – at a convention of party delegates. Tordsen’s initial effort to change that would have placed a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot asking voters to switch some nominations to a primary system. That proposal, House Joint Resolution 5001, failed 8-5 during the second week of the legislative session.</span></p>

In public speeches, she has expressed concerns about the integrity of the voting machines in Mesa County, particularly after voters declined to elect several conservative candidates during the 2021 Grand Junction municipal election.</span></p>

The case over whether voting touchscreens are vulnerable is now in the hands of U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg, who didn’t immediately rule on whether the election equipment creates an unconstitutional danger to voting rights. Five hours of closing arguments focused on the potential for subverting the voting system Georgia bought for $107 million in 2019. “The train that is coming at us is the November 2024 election. The question is: Are we going to be ready?” said Robert McGuire, an attorney for the Coalition for Good Governance, an election advocacy group and a plaintiff in the case. “What makes this decision a hard one is the political moment.” Attorneys for Georgia election officials said the case failed to show any actual violation of voting rights because voting machines haven’t been hacked or altered during an election. The possibility of election hacking doesn’t justify changing the voting system used by 94% of Georgia voters who cast ballots either during early voting or on election day in the 2022 midterms, lawyers representing the state said. About 6% of voters used absentee ballots filled out by hand. “This is the most battle-tested and stress-tested election system in the country, without a doubt,” said Carey Miller, an attorney for the state. “The outlandish nature of the claims have taken on a life of their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair Fight Action filed notice that it would</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/group-will-appeal-court-ruling-that-georgia-voter-challenges-dont-violate-federal-law/PV3Q3MKXK5F5DKVU7BFLPN3ZGY/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ask the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the lower court&#8217;s ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic lawyer Mark Elias said his firm would handle the appeal without charging Fair Fight. U.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled last month that Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote did not violate the Voting Rights Act when it announced it was challenging the eligibility of more than 360,000 Georgia voters just before a 2021 runoff election for two pivotal U.S. Senate seats. Fair Fight, a voting rights group founded by former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, had sued True the Vote and several individuals, alleging that their actions violated a section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that prohibits voter intimidation. Although Jones ruled that True the Vote didn&#8217;t intimidate or attempt to intimidate any particular voter, he expressed concerns about the group’s methods. Jones wrote that its list of voters to be challenged “utterly lacked reliability” and “verges on recklessness.”</span></p>

The Public Interest Legal Foundation is challenging restrictions that the state imposed on the release of data from its voter file, which includes the names, addresses, voter status and other information on all Maine voters. For years, the state restricted the release of that information to only political campaigns. Three years ago, lawmakers added an exception that would allow the data to be shared with other groups, in order to ensure the state is compliant with federal voting laws. But the law said that no information could be shared publicly that would identify specific voters. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows has said those measures are intended to protect voter privacy, but the foundation challenged those restrictions. And late last week, an appeals court sided with the group and affirmed an earlier ruling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its decision, the court said the state law is pre-empted by the National Voter Registration Act, and that releasing information to the public is &#8220;necessary&#8221; if groups are ever going to &#8220;identify, address, and fix irregularities in states&#8217; voter rolls&#8221; through federal law. The court also notes that there are other federal statutes that address privacy concerns, and that the &#8220;proper redaction of certain personal information in the Voter File can further assuage the potential privacy risks implicated by the public release of the Voter File.&#8221;</span></p>

The court further ruled that it must be notified by Feb. 20 whether an agreement has been reached, according to the opinion issued by Chief Justice Matthew J. Fader. The court heard oral arguments Monday in Derek Harvey, et al v. Jared DeMarinis, et al. Harvey is a Washington County Commissioner; DeMarinis is the state administrator of elections. The suit was filed after the Maryland State Board of Elections rejected the Hancock Town Hall as the second of three early voting centers proposed by the Washington County Board of Elections and approved by the county commissioners. After an Anne Arundel Circuit Court judge upheld the state board&#8217;s decision, Harvey appealed that ruling to the state&#8217;s Supreme Court.</span></p>

It is a legal maneuver that could have widespread implications for mail voting ahead of this year&#8217;s presidential election. The Mississippi lawsuit was filed last week. The North Dakota lawsuit was filed last year. Democratic and voting rights groups are concerned about the potential impact if a judge rules that deadlines for receiving mailed ballots that stretch past Election Day violate federal law. “This effort risks disenfranchising Mississippi voters, but we don’t want that to also be precedent for other states,” Abhi Rahman, communications director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in response to the most recent lawsuit.</span></p>

Rossiter called the agreement &#8220;fair, reasonable and adequate&#8221; in a Jan. 26 order that provides for the settlement of a lawsuit in which the Winnebago and Omaha tribes and several individuals said the county and the board of supervisors had violated the Voting Rights Act with its previous district map in 2022. &#8220;The settlement reasonably resolves difficult voting rights issues in a manner that is fair to all parties,&#8221; Rossiter said in his ruling. The settlement includes a new district map, which the Thurston County Board of Supervisors has approved for implementation in this year&#8217;s election. The map will be in place until after the next census in 2030, when population shifts could require the redrawing of districts.</span></p>

U.S. Attorneys accused Callaway and other unnamed subordinates of paying Atlantic City residents between $30 and $50 to act as authorized messengers and request mail-in ballots for voters whom they had never met. Prosecutors allege that those ballots were later cast without the actual voters’ knowledge. The charges appear to stem from work Callaway did for Rep. Jeff Van Drew’s 2022 reelection campaign. There’s no indication Van Drew (R-02) knew about the alleged scheme. “Holding free and fair elections is a bedrock principle of our democracy,” U.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger said in a statement. “As alleged in the complaint, the defendant attempted to deprive New Jersey residents of a fair election by fraudulently procuring and casting ballots. Today’s charges reflect our office’s commitment to hold to account those who try to undermine the electoral process.” Prosecutors did not seek to detain Callaway before trial, though he must provide a $50,000 appearance bond, forgo international travel, and avoid contact with others involved in the case as conditions of his release.</span></p>

The ruling by Ryba was a victory for Democratic lawmakers, who passed the mail-in voting bill over Republican opposition last June. They argued it strengthens democracy by giving busy voters another way to cast ballots and increasing their participation in elections as a result. New York became the 36th state in the U.S. to allow or require voters to mail their ballots. The law effectively made permanent a voting option New York offered for three years during the pandemic, when any voter could request absentee ballots without the usual restrictions on who could obtain one. Ryba denied New York&#8217;s constitution mandates in-person voting or prevents the legislature from allowing mail-in ballots. She said it simply allowed special accommodations for those who can&#8217;t make it to the polls. She wrote in her ruling: &#8220;The mere fact that the framers specifically authorized the Legislature to establish a different voting method for a specific category of voters does not necessarily signify their intent to restrict the Legislature&#8217;s power to establish alternative voting methods for other voters.&#8221;</span></p>

Traynor said Burleigh County Auditor Mark Splonskowski lacks standing to bring the case, and failed to show he was harmed by the law or that his constitutional rights will be violated. The auditor alleged state and federal law conflict as to the counting of mail ballots received after Election Day. “According to Splonskowski, following his understanding of federal law will inevitably result in criminal prosecution under North Dakota law because he will have to forego his duty to follow North Dakota election law,” Traynor wrote, adding later, “This is deeply concerning to the Court that an elected official openly advocates for violating the law he was elected to enforce because he has independently concluded it contradicts federal law.” The judge also said the reasoning in Splonskowski’s lawsuit, if successful, “could be utilized against” overseas and military voters’ rights to vote.</span></p>

In a court filing, Yost said the July 3 cutoff for the “Ohio Voters Bill of Rights” to make the fall ballot is a false deadline. Ballot campaigns are often mounted in presidential election years in order to take advantage of high turnouts or to motivate certain voter groups. “Indeed, Relators’ petition is in its infancy and they offer no support for their blanket assertion that their petition will survive the constitutional hurdles in time for the 2024 general election,” he wrote, adding that the group can always try for some future election cycle. The coalition, which includes the A. Philip Randolph Institute, NAACP and others, told the court that needing to sue the attorney general shouldn’t “unduly delay” access to the ballot for the voters on whose behalf they filed the lawsuit. At issue in the coalition’s lawsuit is a Jan. 25 finding by Yost that the proposed constitutional amendment’s title was “highly misleading and misrepresentative” of its contents. He issued the decision even while acknowledging that his office had previously certified identical language, including a Nursing Facility Patients’ Bill of Rights in 2021 and another Ohio Voters Bill of Rights in 2014. In his rejection letter, Yost cited “recent authority from the Ohio Supreme Court” giving him the ability to review petition headings, authority challenged in the lawsuit. The coalition wants the court to order Yost to certify their petition language.</span></p>

A lawyer who represented Erie postmaster Robert Weisenbach, who filed the lawsuit, confirmed to NBC News that it had been settled on undisclosed terms. Weisenbach — who voted for Trump in 2020 election — said accusations of voter fraud lodged by postal worker Richard Hopkins and spread by O’Keefe and Project Veritas forced him to flee his home after his address was posted online, The Associated Press reported. Hopkins, a supporter of former President Trump, gained Republican attention over allegations that officials tampered with mail-in ballots in the swing state that President Biden won in 2020. In a statement posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Project Veritas said Hopkins has “since come to learn that he was wrong,” and that Weisenbach and the U.S. Postal Service did not engage in election fraud. The organization said it is not aware of any other evidence of fraud in the Erie Post Office during the 2020 election.</span></p>

														<p><a href="https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2024/real-right-vote-richard-l-hasen-erwin-chemerinsky"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Real Right to Vote with Richard L. Hasen &amp; Erwin Chemerinsky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Throughout history, too many Americans have faced needless barriers to voting. Part of the blame falls on the U.S. Constitution, which does not contain an affirmative right to vote. Richard L. Hasen, Director of UCLA Law’s Safeguarding Democracy Project and author of the new book A Real Right to Vote: How a Constitutional Amendment Can Safeguard American Democracy, draws on troubling stories of state attempts to disenfranchise military voters, women, African Americans, students, former felons, Native Americans, and others, arguing that American democracy can and should do better. Joining Hasen is Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and leading scholar of the U.S. Constitution, Erwin Chemerinsky. Co-presented with the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law. Limited books will be available for purchase. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 15, 7:30pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Los Angeles.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/events/misinformation-and-disinformation-is-democracy-in-crisis-and-is-it-at-risk-of-failing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misinformation and Disinformation: Is Democracy in Crisis, and Is It at Risk of Failing?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: According to a 2023</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/poll-democracy-partisanship-trump-biden-trust-221f2b4f6cf9805f766c9a8395b9539d"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only one in 10 Americans have confidence and give high ratings to the way that democracy is conducted in the United States. Nearly 50 percent of those surveyed believe our country’s democracy is flawed. People are concerned about the state of elections, the performance of Congress, inflation, crime, and the southern border. Fear about these issues is exacerbated by rampant misinformation and disinformation. Join us for an in-person and virtual panel that will provide insights and solutions to these threats to democracy. Panelists will also explain the best way to fight misinformation and disinformation before elections this year. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 22, 12pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online and in-person in Washington, DC. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/real-right-vote-conversation-rick-hasen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Real Right to Vote: A Conversation with Rick Hasen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For many Americans, the freedom to vote is unfairly conditioned on where they live, the color of their skin, or how much money they have. Several amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been passed over the decades extending this fundamental freedom to voters of color, women and citizens who are 18 years of age. However, the lack of an overarching amendment guaranteeing the right to vote leaves our democracy vulnerable because the freedom to vote is treated differently depending on where voters live and how courts handle disputes over their rights.  In his new book, “A Real Right to Vote,” Law Professor Rick Hasen explains why a constitutional amendment is necessary, and why now is the time to begin a campaign in support of such an amendment. As Professor Hasen explains, enshrining voting rights in the Constitution will benefit all Americans, no matter which side of the political aisle they sit on.   In discussion with Campaign Legal Center President Trevor Potter, Professor Hasen will describe his vision for the freedoms an amendment on voting rights would protect, its potential impact on our democracy, and why he believes it’s possible to pass such an amendment, despite a challenging political climate. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 29, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_OsRZONm5Ta-_5rEDedaJ3w#/registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race and Risk of Election Subversion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA promotes research, collaboration, and advocacy under the leadership of UCLA Law Professor Richard L. Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Speakers: Matt Barreto, Lecturer in Law UCLA School of Law; Sophia Lin Lakin, Director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project ACLU; and Spencer Overton, The Patricia Roberts Harris Research Professorship and Professor of Law George Washington Law. <strong>When:</strong> April 9, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online and Los Angeles</span></p>
