							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>USDR Relaunches Tailored Services for Election Officials </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know firsthand how short-staffed, under-resourced, and under-funded election offices can be. Election offices are all stretched thin especially this time of year, and technical support is difficult to request, as jurisdiction’s digital departments have limited capacity. At </span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Digital Response (USDR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are a nonpartisan nonprofit that works alongside governments at all levels <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11712" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USDR_Logo-color-horiz-org-punchout-300x100.png" alt="" width="300" height="100" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USDR_Logo-color-horiz-org-punchout-300x100.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USDR_Logo-color-horiz-org-punchout-1024x340.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USDR_Logo-color-horiz-org-punchout-768x255.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USDR_Logo-color-horiz-org-punchout.png 1161w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />to ensure you have the capacity needed to do your job best.  We take requests all year long, but we realize that this is when you might need us the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDR is relaunching our popular “</span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/election/custom-technical-projects"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Support Desk” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to offer technical assistance to election offices during the hectic 2024 presidential election season. Our network of nearly 10,000 expert volunteers are at the ready to work alongside offices across the country to help create or fix election office-specific efforts. Originally launched in 2022, the support desk is truly a resource for whatever your team needs, from automating your copy/paste tasks, social media, analyzing/displaying historical voter data on your website, or just a quick training on better understanding AI &#8211; we can help you pull off any idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Key Features of USDR&#8217;s Tech Support Desk include</strong>: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand, rapid support for election officials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network of experienced technologists and election experts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wide range of assistance for election office administrative duties</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free where legally permitted, affordable options otherwise</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We listen to all ideas, whether they are needs, wants, or a combination. To get a taste at what’s possible, check out some of the projects we’ve completed with election offices across the country: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Security and public confidence</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working towards enhanced security, transparency, and gaining public confidence and trust is a main goal of our partnerships. In </span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/stevens-county-wa-ballot-box-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevens County, WA, USDR helped the rural community meet heightened concerns regarding election security </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by deploying a solution to document and demonstrate the security measures surrounding their ballot retrieval process without overburdening their staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right at the time I&#8217;m installing drop boxes to comply with state law, folks were very concerned about dropbox security, saying they were unsafe to use or components in election fraud,&#8221; Lori Larsen, Stevens County&#8217;s elected auditor and chief election official, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori worked with USDR to design a system that asked ballot retrieval teams a few questions and had them take time-stamped pictures with their smartphones. All information was sent to a central database, which Lori could view and know exactly where and when ballots had been picked up, when drop boxes were opened or sealed, and if there were any unusual circumstances when teams visited the drop boxes. Lori also received an easy way to share this information with concerned voters and fulfill public records requests. After the USDR project was complete, Lori continued to build on this system by purchasing and deploying AirTags for all her ballot containers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about this project at </span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/stevens-county-wa-ballot-box-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Study: Stevens County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Communication with Voters</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right before the 2022 mid-term election, Orange County, North Carolina faced a critical challenge. With local elections approaching, their plan to implement an online wait time monitoring system for 110,000 registered voters fell through due to technical issues. Rachel Raper, the county&#8217;s director of elections, found herself in a bind with mere days until Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembering a USDR presentation from an elections conference, Rachel reached out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Within the day, we had a meeting set up,&#8221; she recalled. USDR delivered a focused, user-friendly tool two days later that met the county&#8217;s needs and exceeded community expectations. </span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/election/voting-wait-time-tracker"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wait Time Tracker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">required minimal training and provided real-time data throughout Election Day, earning praise from voters. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/how-orange-county-nc-used-new-technology-to-modernize-election-administration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read Orange County’s full story here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Download the template and set up your own </span><a href="https://electionexcellence.org/resources/live-wait-time-display/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Wait Time Display</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>So many tasks, so little time</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/election-worker-management-grand-rapids"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Rapids, MI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/mercer-county-pa-election-administration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercer County, PA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all election offices face the daunting task of preparing for Election Day, far before the date arrives. For these two jurisdictions and others, USDR developed a “Task Tracker,” a central place to organize the to-do lists for your entire department and view them by assignee, deadline, or even in a calendar view.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Task Tracker is great because you can build out your entire election year in detail, with reminders. It allows you to use a “days before election” feature so you can reuse the same base set of tasks year after year, aligned to your election dates. It is how I keep on task and prioritize my activities throughout the year,” Thad Hall, Mercer County director of elections said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Task Tracker, you can assign tasks to team members, get a daily or weekly reminder of upcoming deadlines, and review everyone&#8217;s tasks at a glance. This is a very simple yet powerful tool to have in your Election administration toolkit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Day Poll Worker Helpline</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We haven’t heard of an Election Office that doesn’t get an overwhelming number of calls on Election Day, especially in a presidential election. It’s daunting to keep track of all the requests and ensure they are resolved by the end of the day. Davidson County, TN, home of Nashville, worked with USDR to solve this problem by creating a “Helpline” &#8211; an internal tool that election offices can use to receive, track, and triage calls from polling locations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is simple: as poll workers call in, a staff member fills out a simple form that pre-fills useful information like polling location, poll worker’s role, and their cell phone number. There’s no need to retype anything. Then, they categorize the call, make notes, and submit. From there, a lead can assign the call, specify what action should be taken, and track the ticket to resolution</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part? There are multiple ways you can look at the data. A dashboard lists the total number of calls, calls by hour, and by polling location &#8211; all designed to keep you and your office organized and in control on Election Day.</span></p>

Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections. In addition to these sustained efforts to complicate the ability of any U.S. administration to <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />pursue a foreign policy at odds with Iran’s interests, the IC has previously reported that Iran perceives this year’s elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, increasing Tehran’s inclination to try to shape the outcome. We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns.  This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />President Trump’s campaign, which the IC attributes to Iran. The IC is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new.  Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.   Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority.  As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible. We will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns. As an interagency we are working closely with our public and private sector partners to share information, bolster security, and identify and disrupt any threats.  Just as this activity demonstrates the Iranians’ increased intent to exploit our online platforms in support of their objectives, it also demonstrates the need to increase the resilience of those platforms. Using strong passwords and only official email accounts for official business, updating software, avoiding clicking on links or opening attachments from suspicious emails before confirming their authenticity with the sender, and turning on multi-factor authentication will drastically improve online security and safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="237" height="98" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" />Ransomware</strong>: As part of their public service announcement (PSA) series to put potential election day cyber related disruptions during the 2024 election cycle into context for the American people, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly released</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/just-so-you-know-ransomware-disruptions-during-voting-periods-will-not-impact-security-and"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just So You Know: Ransomware Disruptions During Voting Periods Will Not Impact the Security and Resilience of Vote Casting or Counting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA to inform the public that while ransomware attacks against state or local government networks or election infrastructure could cause localized delays, they will not compromise the security or accuracy of vote casting or counting processes. To date, any successful <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />ransomware attack on election infrastructure tracked by the FBI and CISA has remained localized and successfully managed with minimal disruption to election operations and no impact on the security or accuracy of ballot casting or tabulation processes or systems. In prior U.S. and foreign elections, malicious actors have sought to spread or amplify false or exaggerated claims about cyber incidents in an attempt to manipulate public opinion, discredit the electoral process, or undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions. We could see foreign actors attempt to mislead American voters about the actual impact of a ransomware event on elections in this election cycle as part of their larger foreign malign influence campaigns. It is important for the public to know that election officials use a multi-layer approach to security that employs a variety of technological, physical, and procedural controls to prevent cyber intrusions, like ransomware, from impacting the security and resilience of vote casting and counting systems. “While ransomware continues to be a significant cybersecurity concern, it is important to note that security measures put in place by election officials and election vendors ensure these incidents will not impact the security of the vote casting or tabulation systems and processes,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley. “We will continue to work tirelessly with our election infrastructure partners to uphold the American people’s confidence in 2024 elections and our democratic process.”</span></p>

Ballot design varies widely across states. Some states use machines to record in-person votes digitally, while others require voters to mark a ballot to be scanned.

In <strong>Alaska</strong>, the U.S. Department of Justice was on hand to monitor the state’s compliance with </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/justice-to-monitor-alaska-primary-election-for-compliance-with-language-requirements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">language requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Two rural Alaska polling places </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/3-rural-alaska-precincts-fail-to-open-for-primary-voting-after-workers-dont-respond-to-state/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">never opened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at all and a third was able to </span><a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2024/08/22/few-rural-alaska-polling-locations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open for about 45 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “On election day, the region calls every precinct to make sure they are open and everything is working smoothly,” said Alaska Elections Director Carol Beecher. “Unfortunately, despite best efforts, there are instances where election workers quit, or don’t show up on election day, leaving the agency to try to find others in the community to assist.” Besides the results, the biggest story out of <strong>Florida</strong> on Tuesday was a widespread failure of a reporting system that meant many counties were </span><a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2024/08/20/florida-election-result-sites-face-technical-difficulties-across-state/74880725007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to post their results to the county elections website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The problem didn’t affect how counties reported the primary vote to the state, nor did it affect the state’s ability to provide election updates. But people checking local election websites Tuesday night couldn’t access results as they came in. “We share everyone’s sense of urgency to identify why people may have experienced problems accessing our customers’ websites,” </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-florida-technology-glitch-fd9c48ea3c4f929c6c9b6c343b382115"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company said in a brief statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “First and foremost, the election night reporting of the unofficial results was not impacted, and there is no indication of malicious activity.” The company said an increase in website traffic contributed to the problem. VR Systems didn’t return emails and phone calls from The Associated Press seeking more details on the glitch. Many supervisors of elections were on the ballot on Tuesday. In </span><a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/recount-st-lucie-county-supervisor-elections-office-republican-primary/61934800"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Lucie County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Republican primary for supervisor of elections will go to a recount.

It’s unclear whether the state’s new law requiring voters to re-request a mail ballot contributed to that. And in </span><a href="https://www.nbc-2.com/article/poll-worker-rescued-car-plunges-pond-naples/61929258"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collier County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it wasn’t into a polling place, but one poll worker drove her car into a pond at a polling place and had to be helped from the pond by a passerby. The poll worker was reportedly unhurt and walked away. And finally in <strong>Wyoming</strong>, while there was</span><a href="https://www.powelltribune.com/stories/voting-machines-retested-reaffirmed-after-mistake-made,136996"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a lot of angst prior to the primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about equipment testing, voting day on Tuesday went smoothly and there were few reports of problems.This year’s primary </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-primary-yields-lowest-voter-turnout-since-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attracted the lowest number of Wyoming voters since 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the unofficial early counts from the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office. The trend held in the state’s more populous counties, with some like Sweetwater tallying the lowest numbers in 10 years or more. The percentage of voters who turned out for these races were also some of the lowest rates recorded. Voters in </span><a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/election/new-party-affiliation-law-frustrates-teton-county-voters/article_1d239c5a-5f2d-11ef-89aa-a7c46c597213.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teton County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were frustrated about the state’s new crossover voting law that prevented registered voters from switching their party for three months before primary election day. “It’s revenge legislation,” Bobby Thomson, a 39-year-old voter, said Tuesday morning as he left the the vote center at the Teton County/Jackson Recreation Center. “Even though they got who they wanted into office.” In </span><a href="https://county17.com/2024/08/20/election-judge-absences-may-delay-courthouse-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no-show election judges slowed the process down a bit. </span></p>

We just want people to exercise their right to vote,” said Jamie Sheehan-Willis, the deputy superintendent of elections for Bergen County. The new technology is “better because there is a paper trail now. We never had a paper trial before,” Sheehan-Willis said. </span><a href="https://www.ldnews.com/story/news/2024/08/07/video-series-on-voting-and-elections-film-in-lebanon-county-courthouse/74686860007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lebanon County, Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently filmed a series of short educational videos using the county courthouse as a mock polling place.

In addition to all the candidates voters will be voting on 15 ballot measures. City officials told the San Francisco Examiner that this is shaping up to be the</span><a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/politics/sf-voter-guide-for-november-ballot-could-total-300-pages/article_d1aefd5a-5b4e-11ef-a8cf-87ed42632d8d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest ballot in the city’s history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. San Francisco elections director John Arntz. Arntz said 15 measures is substantial, but it’s “a lot less than we would normally have for a presidential general election.” “We were actually expecting around 30 measures,” Arntz told The Examiner. “That would have put us probably into an eight- or nine-card ballot.” Arntz explained that officials have not formatted the ballot yet, but as it stands, it’s on the border of either a five- or six-card booklet. If it needs to be pushed to six cards, that will be the largest ballot San Francisco has ever had in terms of content. The final length, Arntz said, will be largely determined by the amount of paid arguments the city receives, which have yet to be submitted. Any San Franciscan can submit arguments for or against measures that will appear on the ballot. Entries cost $2 per word in addition to a $200 publication fee. The maximum length is 300 words, meaning paid arguments can cost as much as $800. “We expect a lot of those,” Arntz said. “We’re probably going to have an information guide that’s around 300 pages, which will be the biggest in the state, and one of the biggest in the country, if not the biggest.”</span></p>

Nearly a dozen high school students entered the contest held in conjunction with the county office of elections and the county’s office of community engagement. Brewer won for her hand-drawn design featuring a cardinal perched on a dogwood branch. The design symbolizes the pride and beauty of Virginia. Members of the electoral board voted on each design and said that the detail of Brewer’s design is why she won the honor of seeing her sticker handed out to voters in November. “I am delighted with the results and appreciate the Schools and Stafford Government partnering with me on this effort,” said General Registrar Anna Hash. “Thank you to the Stafford County Electoral Board for their work in selecting the finalists and the winners.” Entries were evaluated on uniqueness of the design in relation to Stafford County and its identity; clarity, strength, and effectiveness of design; and overall aesthetics or eye-catching ability. Students were also awarded gift cards at the meeting.</span></p>

The legislation is being billed by supporters as a way to protect democracy and ensure equal access at the ballot box. SB7 has reportedly gained full support of the entire Senate Democratic Caucus. Identical legislation is expected to be filed in the House by Representative Adline Clarke. Supporters of the bill says the Alabama Voting Rights Act will position Alabama as a state that safeguards democracy by ensuring all eligible voters have access to fair and safe election processes, without undue and unnecessary barriers. Key provisions of the bill: Set-up preclearance protections for election-related changes at the state and local level; Provide for same-day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting; Streamline the process for voting rights restoration; Establish an Alabama Voting Rights Commission to provide non-partisan oversight of changes in election procedures; and create a state-wide database for assisting in the administration of elections and to publicize certain information relating to voting.</span></p>

The motivation for the resolution is to increase voter turnout. It would direct the borough clerk to work with the clerks from the Cities of Fairbanks and North Pole to identify barriers and solutions for implementing mail in voting … and the impacts it might have on local elections. The resolution asks the task force to report on its findings by December 2025. The vast majority of those who have testified about the resolution at the last two assembly meetings, were opposed to the investigation and mail in voting in general. Mail-in voting is used by Golden Valley Electric Association, the Municipality of Anchorage and the City and Borough of Juneau, and it was used statewide in the fall of 2020 during the pandemic. The mail in voting resolution is on the Assembly’s agenda for its Thursday night meeting. It doesn’t require a public hearing, but residents can comment in the open period at start of the meeting.</span></p>

On Monday they adopted a rule that requires county election officials to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-certification-rule-26551bd40f5a246035bc3d4c06e4d9b9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generate lists of voters who cast ballots in an election,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> categorized by voting method, and to examine them for duplicates. After any discrepancies have been investigated and resolved as required by law, all returns “which are entitled to be counted” shall be recorded and verified as accurate. The rule also requires county officials to meet by 3 p.m. on the Friday after an election to review precinct returns — that’s before the 5 p.m. Friday deadline for overseas and military ballots to be returned and for any issues with provisional or absentee ballots to be rectified by voters. And it says county election officials “shall be permitted to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections” before they certify results. They </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-board-rejects-widespread-use-of-paper-ballots-for-november-election/GQRRVI7AKJCHXEIIGGMMGBUSYY/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected calls to implement widespread use of paper ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filled out by hand in the November election. Election integrity advocates asked the board to authorize the statewide use of hand-marked paper ballots, citing concerns about the security of Georgia’s Dominion Voting System machines. The board unanimously rejected two similar rules calling for the use of hand-marked paper ballots. Among other things, board members said they lack the authority to implement sweeping changes to the way Georgians cast their ballots.</span></p>

Lincoln County Commissioners Brent Teske and Jim Hammons voted to keep the Election Department under the purview of the Clerk and Recorder’s Office earlier this month. Commissioner Josh Letcher was absent from the meeting. But Teske said that Letcher had told him he also was against the proposal. Election Administrator Melanie Howell told The Western News that she was hopeful her department could improve relations with the Clerk and Recorder’s Office, which is led by Corinna Brown. “I would hope so,” Howell told The Western News following the meeting. “I’ve been trying for a year and a half and haven’t had any luck yet.” Howell presented the idea of breaking away from the Clerk and Recorder&#8217;s Office at the commissioners&#8217; July 10 meeting. She cited election security concerns; communication issues when she and assistant Sierra Gustin had to move from the county annex building on Mineral Avenue to the courthouse on California Avenue; and the stress of handling multiple elections as well as clerk and recorder responsibilities. Tasked with researching the concept, Deputy County Attorney Jeffrey Zwang said he didn’t find anything that would preclude separating the departments, but he did share logistical concerns.</span></p>

Joe Lombardo in 2023. The committee will sponsor a bill to allow a voter’s cured signature to become the voter’s signature on file and require the secretary of state’s office to mail notices informing people who have been registered via automatic voter registration that their paperwork is missing information, such as an affiliated political party. Rural counties could be allowed to establish dedicated election offices under one BDR approved by the committee. Only counties with populations of 100,000 or more — Clark and Washoe — are currently authorized to have registrars of voters offices whose top administrator is solely focused on elections. The committee also approved a bill to allow former felons to become field registrars — people who help register qualified voters. Currently, felons who have been convicted of theft or fraud are barred from working as field registrars. The committee is backing a proposal to establish a $1,000 filing fee for candidates wishing to participate in the presidential preference primary. The resurrected bills include </span><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/10004/Overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly Bill 246</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the 2023 Legislative Session would have required the state and counties to provide voting materials in certain languages if their limited-English proficient population reached a certain threshold — 20,000 statewide or 5,000 in a county. Those thresholds for ensuring language access go beyond existing federal requirements.</span></p>

The two election reforms could have appeared on the November ballot, but Ithaca City Clerk Alan Karasin told Common Council on Wednesday he was unable to certify the petition “from a strictly legal standpoint.” The petition did not meet one key requirement: petitioners failed to include a plan to pay for the costs associated with switching local elections voter to ranked-choice voting and open primaries.  Tompkins County Board of Elections Democratic Commissioner Stephen DeWitt and Republican Commissioner Alanna Congdon told The Ithaca Voice in a July 18 interview they weren’t sure how expensive adopting the election reforms could be, but they gave a rough guess that it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to pay for training, as well as voting machine changes, like new software. While the petition was not certified, Mayor Robert Cantelmo said on Wednesday he would appoint a working group at the September meeting of Common Council to explore ranked-choice voting. There appears to be broad support among the city’s elected officials to implement some version of ranked-choice voting.</span></p>

The decision comes a week after the board approved a number of other IDs, including state and local government IDs as well as IDs from Duke and Campbell universities. The state now has well over 100 approved forms of ID for use by voters. The decisions last week were unanimous; Republicans said their opposition to the UNC IDs was that they disliked the idea of allowing any digital IDs. That stance could portend a future debate that&#8217;s likely to affect the entire state, not just one college campus. The North Carolina legislature recently passed a law allowing for digital driver&#8217;s licenses. They&#8217;re not expected to be ready and approved in time for this year&#8217;s elections, but they could be in use for the 2025 municipal elections, the 2026 midterms or other future elections.</span></p>

The bill also would direct the elections office to verify the citizenship status of any applicant for voter registration with Homeland Security. DeMarco, an at-large GOP member of council, said after this week’s meeting that he introduced the bill to make sure only citizens are registered to vote in county elections, and to protect any noncitizens who might jeopardize a pathway to citizenship if they vote in any elections. Councilman Bob Macey, a Democrat, joined as a co-sponsor Tuesday. Council President Pat Catena, a Democrat, referred the bill to the government reform committee, chaired by Councilman Nick Futules, another Democrat.</span></p>

The city’s registrar, Taylor Yowell, also recommended its passage in a memo to council. A push for ranked choice voting stems locally from Charlottesville as its former state delegate, Sally Hudson, carried legislation that former Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law four years ago. Now localities can adopt ranked choice voting for city council and board of supervisor elections.</span></p>

The Alabama attorney general office wrote in a Friday court filing that the new law, which has a Oct. 1 effective date, cannot be used to block people from voting in the upcoming election, because the Alabama Constitution prohibits new election laws from taking effect within six months of the general election. “The Plaintiffs ask the court to order that a new law may not be enforced until after the November 5, 2024 General Election. But there is no need for such an order, because the law in question will not be enforced until after the election,” lawyers for the state wrote in the filing responding to the lawsuit. The Campaign Legal Center had filed the lawsuit last month in Montgomery Circuit Court seeking to clarify that the new law cannot block people from voting in the November election. The center argued that there had been a lack of guidance from the state. Without clarity, they argued, it is setting up a confusing situation for voters and registrars to figure out who can and cannot vote in November.</span></p>

Those primaries would also include candidates who are politically unaffiliated. Moskowitz ruled August 15 that Prop. 140 had 536,216 valid signatures after the committee submitted nearly 560,000. The minimum number of valid signatures for constitutional amendments to make it onto the ballot in 2024 is 383,923. Prop. 140 still faces a legal challenge from opponents to the measure who say it violates the state constitution’s single-subject rule for ballot initiatives. On Aug. 9, the same judge ruled that the initiative does not violate the state constitution’s single-subject rule.</span></p>

The high court has been asked to intervene in a dispute over the election rules of the battleground state, with a case that hits on a political flashpoint of the 2024 campaign season. </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322624/20240816120403502_24A164%20Govt%20Response.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a court filing,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that “judicial intervention at this stage would undermine the orderly administration of the election, risking the disfranchisement of thousands of voters who have already registered to vote using the federal form.” The contention was backed by Arizona’s Democratic state officials who said in </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322658/20240816150550066_24A164%20Response%20to%20Emergency%20Application.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own court filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a court intervention at this time would be “destabilizing.” The Biden administration, as well as civil rights groups who have also sued over the 2022 law, argues that it runs afoul of the National Voter Registration Act by requiring that individuals using the federal registration form show documentary proof of citizenship in order to vote in the presidential election and to use mail balloting in the state. The Supreme Court was asked by the Republican National Committee and state GOP lawmakers last week to reinstate the requirement for the coming election, after a trial judge struck it down. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is co-leading with Kansas a </span><a href="https://www.wtrf.com/west-virginia/west-virginia-co-leads-brief-asking-supreme-court-to-allow-arizona-to-enforce-proof-of-citizenship-for-voter-registration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coalition of 24 states in asking SCOTUS for an emergency stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the case. The amicus brief filed late Thursday in support of the Republican National Committee and others, argues “To enforce that requirement, Arizona does the logical thing: require that a person registering to vote provide documentary proof of citizenship. This requirement, or something similar, has been around in some form or fashion for at least 20 years.” “It’s about safeguarding the integrity of our elections—the heart of our democratic process,” Morrisey said. “It’s really very simple: you should not be allowed to vote if you’re not a United States citizen, and having proof of your citizenship is vital in making sure we conduct free, safe and lawful elections.”</span></p>

The court held that the complaint—which is largely focused on the expansion of mail-in-ballot procedures and what it cites as a dilution in the voting power of in-person voters due to possible fraud—fails as it does not adequately allege that any disproportionate weight is given to some voters over others and asserts only statistically insignificant irregularities that do not amount to a fundamentally unfair process. The lawsuit was filed on Jan. 4, 2021and asserts claims against Secretary of State Shirley Weber, Attorney General Rob Bonta, and the registrars of voters in 15 counties, including Los Angeles, in which alleged irregularities occurred. The suit seeks a court order declaring nearly two dozen election administration statutes and regulations to be unconstitutional and an audit of all ballots and voting machines used in and after the November 2020 general election. District Court Judge Andre Birotte Jr. of the Central District of California granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and judgment in favor of the defendants was entered on Aug. 15, 2023. Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote the opinion affirming the judgment, saying: “The constitutional safeguards we are bound to apply in this case are clear. State and local officials may not unduly burden the right to vote….Elections wholly lacking in integrity cannot stand. Based on the allegations of the complaint, California’s election laws and regulations and Defendant Counties’ practices more than satisfy these constitutional mandates.” Circuit Judges Michelle T. Friedland and Jennifer Sung joined in the opinion.</span></p>

Peters was found guilty of seven of 10 counts. Following the verdict, Peters spoke with news affiliate Western Slope Now’s Dalen Brazelton about the trial. “It’s an interesting verdict,” Peters said, before claiming that excluded evidence was kept from the jury. “There’s a lot of excluded evidence that was never presented. I mentioned the CodeMonkeyZ video that they made such a big deal about but never would let the jury see. Also, the 12-minute audio recording that Stephanie Wenholz presented, that was played over and over. But when I presented, and Sherronna Bishop was actually in the room, I had recorded the hour and seven-minute audio recording, and they would not admit that, and that would have given a reference to what that whole meeting was about.

Labrador alleges that supporters and signature gatherers misrepresented the ballot initiative and fraudulently obtained the signatures used to qualify the initiative for the election. “This coalition obtained thousands of signatures for the initiative by telling Idahoans it would restore the open primary system Idaho had before 2011, even after the Idaho Supreme Court ruled that claim was false and that the initiative’s primary system is ‘significantly different’ than an open primary,” Labrador said in a written statement. “In reality, the initiative abolishes party primaries and institutes ranked-choice voting in the general election — an unpopular and complicated system that many petition signers did not know was included in the initiative and would not support on its own.” The supporters of the ballot initiative, which is known as Proposition 1, disagreed, saying that Labrador is using the court system to prevent voters from deciding whether the initiative should pass. “AG Labrador is doing everything in his power to interfere with the election and deny voters a voice,” Luke Mayville, a spokesperson for Idahoans for Open Primaries, said in a written statement. “Fortunately for Idaho voters, Labrador’s case is baseless and his desperate attempt is certain to fail again. The people of Idaho, not the Attorney General, will decide in November whether Idaho should restore the right of all voters — including independents — to participate in every taxpayer-funded election.”</span></p>

Kness said the injuries Bost and his fellow plaintiffs claim they&#8217;ve suffered under the law — spending more on their campaigns, dilution of votes, the specter of voter fraud — were too hypothetical to justify the suit.</span></p>

The high court said in a ruling that the matter was moot since the Washoe County Commission&#8217;s original 3-2 vote against certification was later nullified when it re-voted the following week to certify the results. The court dismissed Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar and Attorney General Aaron Ford&#8217;s request for a ruling declaring the commission acted illegally. But the justices also made clear that they have the legal authority to make such a declaration and warned they may do so on an expedited basis if it becomes an issue again. “As petitioner argues, even when an issue becomes moot, we may still consider the issue if it constitutes ‘a matter of widespread importance capable of repetition,’” the court said.</span></p>

Both courts rejected the Republicans’ argument that New York’s state constitution mandates that voting specifically occur in-person on election day and the state&#8217;s recent Early Mail Voter Act is therefore unconstitutional. Wilson and the other six judges on the panel conducted an in-depth review of New York’s constitutional history to reach that conclusion. The majority found that, although the state legislature has perhaps assumed otherwise in the past, in-person voting has never been constitutionally required in the state. The seven-judge panel had one dissenter: Judge Michael Garcia, who cited that failed 2021 vote in his opinion. Garcia found that the state constitution limits the authority of the legislative and executive branches to enact absentee voting procedures. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Though the state constitution contains no language that explicitly requires in-person voting, the legislative and executive branches have often proceeded as if our constitution requires as such,” Wilson wrote.</span></p>

They were made aware of their errors before the final day of voting and filled out provisional ballots in an attempt to have their votes counted regardless. But the county elections board rejected those ballots. The ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Public Interest Law Center sued Butler County on the voters’ behalf in April. They argued that voters who made other mistakes on their mail-in ballots were allowed to cure them, and that the two plaintiffs had just as much right to have their votes counted. The Butler County Court of Common Pleas ruled against the two voters on Friday. The opinion said that it is up to legislators to create a legal pathway for errors like theirs to be corrected. The appeal will be considered in Commonwealth Court.</span></p>

Under the terms of the agreement, Bennett County will operate a satellite office in Allen. It will provide in-person registration and absentee voting services during regular business hours for the full state-mandated 46-day absentee voting period prior to federal, state and county elections. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, commented on the agreement in a news release. “It is time to eliminate all barriers standing between Native American voters and the ballot box across our country,” Clarke said. “An inclusive democracy must provide all of its eligible voters access to the full range of voter registration and early voting opportunities required by law.” The Justice Department’s investigation found that Native Americans living on tribal lands in the county disproportionally lacked the ability to travel long distances to the county seat of Martin for in-person voting services. Since 2015, the state has made Help America Vote Act funds available to counties like Bennett to establish a satellite office on tribal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South Dakota Supreme Court has </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-elections-ballots-670378323b52c0aaa9805f2d46d4f4c5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected an effort to exclude more than 100 absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that had initially been rejected but were later counted in the state’s June election. The leader of a conservative election group and an unsuccessful Republican legislative candidate asked the court last month to order the top election official in Minnehaha County, home to Sioux Falls, to “revert to the unofficial vote count totals” without the 132 ballots, and “to conduct a thorough review” of registered voters in two precincts, among other requests. The court on Friday denied the pair’s request, meaning the ballots, which a recount board later included, will stand. In June, South Dakota Canvassing President Jessica Pollema had challenged ballots in the two precincts. She alleged that voter registration forms were either incomplete or listed addresses that weren’t where voters actually lived, in violation of state and federal law. One precinct board denied her challenge. The other, in a legislative district represented by all Democrats, rejected 132 of 164 challenged ballots. Secretary of State Monae Johnson’s office advised a county official that the challenged items didn’t meet state law.</span></p>

The plaintiffs alleged that the law — which does not explain how one can become a “bona fide” political party member — is unconstitutionally vague and was enacted to intimidate and suppress voters.  The legal challenge underscored that the law is especially confusing since Tennessee voters do not register with a particular party under the state’s open primary system. Rather, the state permits any voter to cast a primary ballot associated with the party of their choice on Election Day. Richardson concluded that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue. Richardson reached a similar conclusion in a March 2024 order dismissing an earlier version of the case, which prompted the plaintiffs to re-file their suit in May.  Richardson also held today that even if the plaintiffs did have standing to sue, the defendants in the case, including Tennessee’s Republican secretary of state and attorney general, are entitled to “sovereign immunity” — a legal doctrine that shields government officials from lawsuits without their consent.</span></p>

Hansen was originally charged in 1st District Court with willful neglect of duty by a poll worker, a third-degree felony, after court documents say he was responsible for delivering a doctored report to the Utah Lieutenant Governor&#8217;s Office, required to ensure the accuracy of vote tabulating machines. Hansen pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of willful neglect of duty by a poll worker, a class A misdemeanor, as part of a plea in abeyance. The charge will be dismissed after 12 months if Hansen meets the terms of the deal, including not violating any new laws and paying a $400 fee. Hansen&#8217;s arrest was part of a larger investigation into the November 2023 Cache County municipal primary and general election, which &#8220;exposed numerous and multiple violations of Utah election law, administrative rule, the Utah election handbook, and basic principles of election administration,&#8221; according to a report by the lieutenant governor&#8217;s office.</span></p>
