														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Zelle Yeah!</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broward County program makes paying poll workers a breeze</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After recruiting and training enough </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/poll-worker-resources-election-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes getting those poll workers paid in a timely manner is one of the most </span><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2024/06/23/dallas-county-must-pay-poll-workers-more-quickly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">daunting tasks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an elections official can face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11554 alignleft" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image001-300x124.png" alt="" width="370" height="153" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image001-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image001.png 578w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" />Beginning in 2019, the </span><a href="https://www.browardvotes.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broward County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented same day pay for poll workers with paper checks being issued on election night. While the same-day pay program was wildly successful with poll workers it did present challenges internally and so staff set out to find a better way, which in today’s world meant electronic payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the direction of our current Supervisor, Joe Scott, innovation is at the forefront of all that we do,” said Lisa Arneaud, public information officer for the supervisor of elections office. “Therefore, with the support of our administration, we sought new solutions for our payroll system and staff retention.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the March 2023 Municipal Election, Broward County deployed a pilot program of issuing election worker pay electronically via </span><a href="https://www.zellepay.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This new approach was designed to maintain timely pay for poll workers, while promoting efficiency and cost savings for the organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelle is a payment application that allows users to send and receive money instantly for free. No additional fees are included and it is typically integrated into an online banking system. It is currently incorporated into approximately 1,700 online banking applications. People without Zelle incorporated in their banking accounts can download an app directly, similar to Venmo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11552" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-11.27.34 AM.png" alt="" width="218" height="108" />“We spent a few months researching and implementing the new system,” explained Arneaud. “We wanted to be sure that the logistics and the rollout process were thoroughly planned and perfected prior to implementation. The new process of using Zelle has saved our office, as well as our workers, a lot of valuable time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Broward-County-Zelle-Yeah-Electronic-Pay-for-Election-Workers-2023-Scott-HallBall-Williams.pdf">&#8220;Zelle Yeah! Electronic Pay for Election Workers&#8221;</a> was honored as one of the 2023 Professional Practice Papers by the Election Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county did explore other sources of payment, such as PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp, but it quickly became obvious that Zelle was the preferred platform to utilize because of its ability to accommodate the county’s level of payments needed within a given day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the benefits of using Zelle is that the cash is available immediately and the county does not need to collect poll workers’ bank information, just an email or cell phone associated with their account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Arneaud, there were some costs to the county associated with the process, but there were no fees charged to poll workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, these costs are nominal in comparison to the costs we incurred previously when we had to void paper checks that were created in advance for poll workers who did not work or worked only part of the day (for whatever reason),” Arneaud said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county hires approximately 4,000 workers to staff a county-wide election. Arneaud said the initial reaction to the switch to Zelle was varied. Some were completely amenable to the idea, while others balked at the switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff spent a lot of time educating poll workers–many who were unfamiliar with Zelle–about the system. Staff worked to alleviate any concerns and provided supporting information as needed to make the transition as seamless as possible for the poll workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with coaching, some of the more-seasoned workers were not willing or able to adapt to the new procedure, and this fostered an opportunity to bring in new poll workers who were ready and excited to embrace technological advances. Approximately 100-200 poll workers decided not to return to work in the same capacity for various reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding new poll workers has never really been a problem in our county, and now that we have implemented payment by Zelle, everyone is happy,” Arneaud said. “While there is no substitute for the value and experience of long-time workers on Election Day, we are now empowering a new generation of workers who will hopefully stay with us for years to come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arneaud said because the county was diligent in researching and rolling out the program initially in 2023, no adjustments had to be made after the roll out. She and her colleagues offered some advice to other counties that may be considering moving to electronic payment for poll workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen to your staff and consider meeting their payroll needs by utilizing innovative payment systems. Take time to evaluate your current process and try to first determine what factors are contributing to any payroll delays. Take the time to research favorable options in your area and move incrementally if possible,” Arneaud said. “Before implementing any changes, think holistically about how the new changes will affect other payroll processes. Try to anticipate any shortfalls that your office may incur and mitigate them beforehand. Last but not least, reach out to other agencies that are implementing innovation and partner with them to assist you in this journey.”</span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Update</h2>
														<p><strong>CISA Releases Guide to Operational Security for Election Officials</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released its “</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-operational-security-election-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guide to Operational Security for Election Officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This essential guide aims to enhance the security of election infrastructure by providing a thorough overview of operational security (OPSEC) within the election context, highlighting potential risks and offering practical mitigation measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Operational security is a systematic approach to identifying and protecting sensitive information, data, or capabilities within an organization.  Without robust safeguards, sensitive information can be inadvertently or deliberately exposed and exploited by threat actors, potentially impacting the ability of election workers to fulfill their duties, exposing voters’ personally identifiable information (PII) and enabling unauthorized access to internal systems and facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By incorporating OPSEC principles into daily election operations and fostering a culture of security awareness, election workers can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosures while maintaining a transparent elections process and responding to public inquiries.  The guide emphases the importance of viewing data from an adversary’s perspective to holistically assess and mitigate potential threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CISA provides various training programs for election workers, including secure practices, incident response planning, and de-escalation techniques.” said CISA Special Advisor to the Director for Election Security Cait Conley. “This guide is another excellent resource CISA provides the public with to keep our elections safe and secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points from the</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-operational-security-election-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>

Make Elections Fair, the campaign sponsoring the initiative, submitted 584,124 signatures to state officials. At least 383,923 signatures must be verified for the initiative to make the ballot. The initiative would amend the Arizona Constitution to eliminate partisan primaries and replace them with an electoral system where individuals may vote for a candidate, regardless of the voter’s or candidate’s party affiliation. It would place all primary candidates on the same ballot, regardless of political party. The amendment would allow for the state legislature to pass a law providing for how many candidates would advance from the primary to the general election. It would provide for two to five candidates to advance to the general election. Under the amendment, if implementing legislation isn’t in effect by November 1, 2025, the secretary of state would decide how many candidates will advance to the general election and the voter ranking process that would be used. Supporters of major changes to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/01/initiative-83-dc-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections delivered more than 40,000 signatures to the Board of Elections for a ballot initiative to bring ranked-choice voting to D.C. elections and to allow registered independents to vote in primaries. If enough signatures are found to be valid, Initiative 83 would appear on the November ballot — and if voters approve it, I-83 could shake up D.C. elections. Under the proposal, the primaries would be opened up to thousands more people, and the tabulation of votes on election night would be changed. Currently, more than 70,000 registered independents can’t participate in any primaries, including the Democratic primary, which in deep-blue D.C. is often the decisive race. Meanwhile, ranked-choice voting would allow voters to rank candidates by preference, a method intended to ensure that the winner receives more than 50 percent of the vote. Members of </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/07/02/idaho-open-primaries-supporters-submit-signatures-to-state-for-final-round-of-verification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idahoans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Open Primaries submitted their signatures to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office for final verification last week, with supporters feeling optimistic they would qualify their ballot initiative for the Nov. 5 general election. If it qualifies for the ballot and is approved by a simple majority of voters, the ballot initiative would end Idaho’s closed primary elections and create a ranked-choice voting system for the general election. Supporters have been gathering signatures in neighborhoods and at public events across the state since last year trying to qualify the initiative for this year’s general election. To qualify for the November election, supporters must gather signatures from at least 6% of registered voters statewide and from at least 6% of voters in at least 18 of the state’s legislative districts. To meet the statewide total, open primary supporters need about 63,000 signatures in total. Open primary supporters have already completed one round of signature verification. Sponsors of a constitutional ballot initiative that would change how elections are conducted in </span><a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/briefs/ballot-measure-to-change-north-dakota-elections-misses-deadline-for-november-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> failed to submit signatures to the Secretary of State’s Office by this week’s deadline for inclusion on the November ballot. The petition was approved by the Secretary of State’s Office for circulation on Sept. 27, 2023, and the measure’s sponsoring committee has one year to gather 31,164 signatures. The ballot measure would prohibit electronic voting machines and tabulators, which would cause all election results to be hand counted. Some of the other aspects of the measure would prohibit early voting or voting by mail, except for absentee ballots; drop-boxes for ballots; and ranked-choice voting. It would also require all polling locations to be open on Election Day and a two-thirds majority voting threshold in both chambers for legislative ballot measures before they are put to the voters. The measure also would empower any U.S. citizen with the ability to request an audit of the state’s election results.

Since the Legislature allowed for ballot measures in 1968 there have been 36 attempts since its inception, only three ballot initiatives have been successful.</span></p>

Commissioners chair Omar Sabir tells Axios this is the most his office has spent on a media blitz in recent years — an effort to make Philly&#8217;s more than 1 million registered voters feel secure that their voices are heard in the contentious rematch between President Biden and Trump. The nonpartisan messages will span radio, billboards and social media, Sabir says. They&#8217;ll encourage higher voter turnout, remind voters of options for casting ballots and recent changes to mail-in voting, and dispel conspiracy theories that cause people to lose faith in the integrity of the process. Commissioners issued a bid for the contract last month. The contract, running Aug. 1, 2024, to July 31, 2025, will be awarded to a firm later this month, per city records. The chosen firm will also produce training videos for election workers and handle press inquiries and other issues that arise during and after the election.</span></p>

However, there are wide partisan divides on this question: 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say early or absentee voting should be available to any voter without the need for an excuse and 62% of Republicans and Republican leaners say these voting methods should only be available to those who have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day. Both early and absentee voting are far more common today than in prior decades. In the 2022 midterm election, fewer than half of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day. And in 2020 – the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic – only about a quarter did so. Despite the greater access, Americans are now less likely to support no-excuse early or absentee voting than they were prior to the 2020 election. This is the result of shifting views among Republicans. Americans who live in states where mail-in ballots will automatically be sent to every voter this November are more likely to have a favorable view of no-excuse early or absentee voting than those who live in states where voters have to request absentee ballots.</span></p>

Cascos was elected Cameron County Judge in 2006 and reelected in 2010 and 2014. He also served on the Texas Public Safety Commission and as a Cameron County commissioner from 1991 through 2002. Though Cascos started out his political career in the Valley as a Democrat, he switched over to the Republican Party by the time of his nomination to be secretary of state in 2014. &#8220;He reached across party lines which I respected him for and I admired that of him,&#8221; former state Sen.

Now, in the leadup to the 2024 election, Bridging Divides has released the </span><a href="https://spia.princeton.edu/news/first-its-kind-dataset-tracks-threats-and-harassment-against-local-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats and Harassment Dataset — a first of its kind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — that captures more than 1,000 events ranging from death threats to digital provocation against local officials. The longitudinal event-based data tracks the rate, frequency, types, and targets of threats and harassment faced by a wide range of local officials around the country, from elected officials at the municipal, county, and township levels to appointed officials, election workers, and more. The data identified four key trends: Hostility towards local officials is a national problem, though trends vary by locality. A threat or harassment event targeting a local official has been reported in nearly every state since 2022. Death threats and invasions of privacy are the top forms of hostility faced by local officials.* Death threats encompass 60% of all threats in the data set, while invasion of privacy makes up 34% of all harassment in the data set. Threats and harassment against local officials tend to rely on more anonymous methods, creating challenges for accountability, with over two-thirds of threats and harassment being delivered by a perpetrator who was not physically present at the time of targeting (sending emails, making social media posts, Zoom bombing, etc.). The ways in which threats and harassment are expressed are impacted by hot-button issues and triggering events. Perpetrators have used anti-religious language — especially antisemitic and Islamophobic rhetoric — in their targeting of officials at heightened rates since October 2023, when the Israel-Palestine conflict became a primary driver of offline mobilization.</span></p>

The report covers election-related state legislative activity in the 46 states that had legislative sessions from Jan. 1 through June 6.  During that time, they tracked 3,735 election-related bills. In 2023, we followed 3,719 bills, and in 2022, we identified 2,505 bills. Three hundred-five of the bills they followed this year became law. Lawmakers enacted 400 bills in 2023 and 165 bills in 2022. Governors vetoed 35 election-related bills in 2024. That’s more than the number of vetoed bills in 2023 and 2022, respectively. All but five of this year’s 35 vetoes came from states with divided governments. States with Democratic trifectas considered more election-related legislation than states with Republican trifectas. However, states with Republican trifectas enacted more than three times as many new election laws as their Democratic counterparts. The report includes summaries of some of the trends we’ve seen this year and information about current state law and legislative activity across various election policy areas. </span></p>

But a</span><a href="https://democrats-cha.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-cha.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024_July_Voting%20for%20Native%20Peoples_Report-vm3.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from House Administration Committee Democrats argues that the nation has failed to keep that promise of voting rights because casting a ballot is simply too difficult in many indigenous communities. “Despite the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, states and localities continue to deny Native peoples the full rights of U.S. citizenship, including the most fundamental right — the right to vote,” Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, D-N.Y., the committee’s ranking member, said in a statement. “Native peoples continue to face substantial and unique barriers to equal participation in federal, state, and local elections.” “</span><a href="https://democrats-cha.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-cha.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024_July_Voting%20for%20Native%20Peoples_Report-vm3.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting for Native Peoples: Barriers and Policy Solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” lays out logistical and practical barriers to voting on tribal lands. Polling locations are few and far between in these rural areas, often requiring long car trips on dirt roads. Some voters living on the Navajo Nation, which covers large swaths of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, trek nearly 100 miles to cast a ballot. Given indigenous poverty rates, these trips aren’t just time consuming, but can be prohibitively expensive as well. Some of the voting issues highlighted by the report are a product of the challenges of reservation life in general, including poor mail service that makes mail-in voting difficult and a lack of standardized residential addresses on some reservations that, combined with indifferent state election officials, makes registering to vote tougher. The report also takes aim at state laws that require voter identification but do not recognize tribal IDs; the failure to provide voting-related materials in indigenous languages; and electoral maps that split native communities into different districts, diluting their political strength.</span></p>

That act is already illegal, since under current U.S. law, only citizens can vote in federal elections, but the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 prohibits states from confirming citizenship status. The SAVE Act, introduced by GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in May, would require most individuals to have a passport to register to vote. Only about 48% of U.S. citizens have a passport, according to State Department data. Driver’s license and tribal ID cards typically do not prove a person’s citizenship and couldn’t be used to register under the SAVE Act. Voting rights advocates have expressed concern over the SAVE Act, saying it contains many falsehoods and conspiracy theories that perpetuate extreme views. The Biden administration issued a </span><a href="https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAP-HR8281.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Administration Policy against the legislation, saying there is no cause for concern about noncitizen voting and that it would only hinder the voting rights of eligible Americans. </span></p>

The slate of six bills — House Bills</span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2024-HB-5571"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 5571</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2024-HB-5576"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5576</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which passed through the House Elections Committee earlier this month —  were recommended by the bipartisan Board of State Canvassers after it convened a workgroup of bipartisan election lawyers and experts to examine the current petition process. State Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) sponsored one of the bills in the package and said the legislation would secure the petition process in Michigan.  “Active civic engagement in our elections is a sign of a strong and healthy democracy,” she told her House colleagues. “All citizens deserve to make their voice heard. The petition process offers an opportunity for voters to organize and get important issues on the ballot. However, there are some bad actors that misuse this process by falsifying signatures.”Tsernoglou said the legislation will help prevent that by allowing the bipartisan Board of State Canvassers to codify the use of statistical random sampling to determine the validity of signatures. She said it would also allow canvassers to disqualify obviously fraudulent signatures and refer them to the attorney general for investigation.  “Election integrity is not a partisan issue. Our bipartisan Board of State Canvassers brought these issues to our attention and we addressed them with the bills before us today,” she said.Other changes made by the legislation include no longer requiring canvassers to check signatures against the state’s qualified voter file before disqualifying them nor having to forward a petition to a city township or clerk if it is unable to verify a signature on a petition. However, the board could still require local clerks to help determine the validity of signatures by checking them against registration records including the qualified voter file.  Additionally, the timeline for local boards of canvassers to carry out their duties would be lengthened, which Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), a former township clerk, supported.</span></p>

Chris Sununu (R) has signed </span><a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1096&amp;txtFormat=html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1264</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law. Under the legislation cities and towns will be required to provide accessible voting machines for all elections after January 2025. The bill states that every municipality must “ensure that each polling place has at least one accessible voting system” during every election. And it creates a pilot program requiring the Secretary of State’s Office to share those machines with towns and cities in spring 2025. “Now those of us with vision and print disabilities will be able to vote independently and keep our votes private like everyone else,” said Jean Shriner, an activist, in a statement reacting to the signing Friday. “For me, as a blind person, it’s empowering and exciting.” Currently, the Secretary of State’s Office provides accessible voting machines to cities and towns only during federal elections – as required by federal law. That includes the September state primaries, the November general elections, and the presidential primaries. But the state does not provide the machines to cities and towns for other elections, such as town meetings. And only two New Hampshire municipalities – Concord and Exeter – currently own such machines for those elections. Both municipalities purchased the machines only after residents threatened to bring legal action against them using the Americans with Disabilities Act.</span></p>

The voting rights proposal wouldn&#8217;t change any rules in practice. The state constitution already says only citizens may vote, and the proposed amendment would say the same thing but with slightly different language. Supporters point to a handful of cities in other states that are letting non-citizen residents vote in local elections like for city council. That wouldn&#8217;t be possible in North Carolina, but supporters of the amendment say it&#8217;s needed regardless to send a message opposing that idea in general. Two other elections related proposed constitutional amendments failed to pass in the rushed final days of the legislative session: Literacy test repeal: Like many states, North Carolina enacted literacy test rules after Reconstruction, during the period now known as the Jim Crow era. They were abused for generations to stop Black people and other minorities from voting. The federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests, as part of the Civil Rights Movement, but North Carolina voters chose in the 1970 elections to keep the rules anyway. The suggestion to ask voters in 2024 to repeal them passed the House unanimously Thursday, but was rejected by the Senate. Voter ID: The amendment would&#8217;ve added voter ID rules for mail-in voters to the state constitution. That&#8217;s already required by state law, but putting it in the constitution would make it harder for judges or a future legislature to undo. It passed the Senate but failed to receive a vote in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the final days of the legislative session, Rep. George Cleveland (R-Onslow) urged his colleagues to greenlight legislation that would </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/06/27/house-advances-bill-requiring-state-board-of-elections-to-work-with-election-integrity-groups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require the State Board of Elections to establish a new system for investigating and correcting data provided by “election integrity” organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist in maintenance of the state’s voter registration lists. Cleveland told members of the House Rules Committee that the state board was reluctant to rely on groups that could be discriminatory, but</span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NCGA_H1071-SMST-106e1-v-4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1071</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require it to examine data brought forth by election integrity organizations and provide quarterly reports to the General Assembly organized by county on corrections made to the voter rolls. Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said in an email that the State Board staff is concerned that this bill could run afoul of federal law, which requires voter list maintenance efforts to be conducted in a uniform and nondiscriminatory way. “HB 1071 appears to require the State Board to remove voters from the rolls based on lists supplied by any third party that claims to be an election integrity organization,” wrote Gannon. “Additionally, there is no definition for what sort of private organization qualifies as an “election integrity organization.” It would be difficult for the State Board to determine whether any such private organization is gathering lists of voters to remove in a uniform and nondiscriminatory way.” The Board of Elections also notes the new bill provides no new funding to expand its voter list maintenance program.</span></p>

Bill DeMora, a Columbus Democrat, and Theresa Gavarone, a Bowling Green Republican &#8212; now heads to the Ohio House, which would need to approve it before it would go to Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature for it to become law. Lawmakers broke for the summer after a marathon session on June 26 and aren’t expected back until the fall, leaving little likelihood that the law will be in effect before the November presidential election. Senators approved the bill in a 30-1 vote. It would add elections workers to a list of public officials whose personal addresses don’t appear in government records, including voter registration rolls and property records. Among those who already are on this list are police, firefighters, judges, prosecutors and some medical and social-service workers. The exemption would apply to Board of Elections members, county elections directors and full-time board of elections workers. It also would apply personally to Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who has not taken a position on the bill, and his successors, as well as many staff in the Secretary of State’s Office.</span></p>

The first proposal would require watermarks on ballots, a move that would cost millions and one that even the sponsor acknowledges no other state employs. The second establishes weekly screening of voter rolls. Any voter whose information doesn’t match up — say, from a recent move — would have to cast a provisional ballot. State Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, compared watermarking ballots to similar security measures used for currency.</span><a href="https://legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb546"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross’ proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> however doesn’t follow the currency model with a single, uniform watermark on every ballot. Instead, her bill calls for a “unique, randomly assigned identifying image, pattern, or alphanumeric code.” The watermark in this rendering would be more like the bill’s serial number than any other security feature.State Reps. Scott Wiggam, R-Wayne County, and Beth Lear, R-Galena, want to see county boards</span><a href="https://legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb552"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> checking their voter rolls for discrepancies on a weekly basis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among the problems they want flagged — mismatched driver’s license numbers, social security numbers, addresses or birthdates. Under the bill, if any one of those discrepancies went unaddressed, the voter would be forced to cast a provisional ballot come election day.</span></p>

Lawmakers can begin filing legislation for the next legislative session in mid-November.  “I’ve heard from many of my constituents in Carter County who are frustrated with the way this race has to be decided because of an outdated statute,” Townley said in a written statement last week. “I started working to draft the bill the same day I learned there could be a drawing.” In the instance of a tied June primary election, Townley said the state could opt to place the candidates on the August runoff ballot.</span></p>

A federal law passed in 2022, the Electoral Count Reform Act, set a strict deadline for states to certify slates of presidential electors: Dec. 11. But Pennsylvania doesn’t have its own set of deadlines to meet that target, which could set the state up for a potential conflict with the federal law. “This gap poses a significant risk of missing the federally mandated deadlines for certifying presidential election results,” said Rep. Benjamin Sanchez (D-Montgomery), the bill’s prime sponsor. “Our goal with HB 2473 is to mitigate this risk and guarantee Pennsylvania’s voice is heard and respected when Congress counts the state’s electors.” If a voter, candidate, or party wants to challenge a decision of a county board of elections — such as a county’s decision whether to count certain ballots — the bill would require that courts resolve that appeal within seven days. In the event of contested presidential election results, if a party in a case wants to challenge a lower court’s decision, they have one day to appeal to the state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must resolve the dispute no later than seven days before the presidential electors meet to cast their votes. This year, the court’s deadline would be Dec. 10, the day before the federal deadline for states to certify their slates of electors under the Electoral Count Reform Act. The bill also places requirements on the Department of State. The secretary of the commonwealth would be required to certify the state’s election results by the fifth Tuesday after the election, which also falls on Dec. 10. It would also require the secretary to notify legislative leaders if they are going to miss the federal deadline to certify the election.</span></p>

Lawmakers this year agreed to state elections board-generated proposals to open mail drop boxes earlier and tack on three more days for local boards of canvassers to accept mail ballot applications. Saving local election workers time and hassle is also the intent behind another new, Secretary of State-backed law that removes the requirement for voters to affiliate, or change affiliations, before participating in a party primary. The secretary of state’s backing also helped secure passage for another bill that will apply to upcoming elections, specifically, the ballot questions, which now must be written in “plain language” at an 8th-grade reading level. Also receiving approval was a bill that changed the word state to statewide in an audit law. Not getting approval this year were bills on same day voter registration and ranked choice voting. </span></p>

In a 6-3 decision, the court’s conservative majority ruled that presidents must be able to operate the executive branch “without undue caution” of potential criminal liability when carrying out “official acts” and that Trump is immune from criminal prosecution related to many of his actions to stay in power, including his attempt to pressure the Justice Department to aid in subverting the election.  The court’s ruling draws a distinction between “official” and “unofficial” acts, noting that unofficial acts are not covered by presidential immunity. The Supreme Court asked a lower court to resolve the question of whether Trump’s other alleged actions to keep hold of the White House, such as drumming up slates of fake electors, also fall within the bounds of his official powers — a process that means the case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith is unlikely to be resolved before this fall’s election.  Election experts said the ruling provides unprecedented authority to the executive to deem nearly all of its actions “official acts” and thus evade prosecution, conceivably capturing most of the actions Trump and his allies took when attempting to overturn the 2020 election results. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, called the definition and breadth of immunity granted by the Supreme Court for official presidential acts “incredibly broad, and in my mind, deeply disturbing.” “I think putting aside this particular prosecution, for any unscrupulous individual seated in the Oval Office who might lose an election, the way I read this opinion is it could be a roadmap for those seeking to stay in power,” Becker told reporters shortly after the opinion was released.</span></p>

The voting system was narrowly adopted by Alaskans in a 2020 ballot initiative and first used in 2022. Shortly after, a group of conservative Alaskans launched a new ballot initiative to repeal the voting method and return to closed primaries and traditional pick-one general elections. Since then, the organizers of the repeal effort have been plagued by allegations of violating Alaska’s law concerning campaign ethics and signature collection. Supporters of Alaska’s ranked choice voting and nonpartisan primaries filed suit earlier this year alleging that the repeal initiative organizers had violated state laws by leaving signature booklets unattended, leaving them open to fraud. The lawsuit targeted the Alaska Division of Elections for certifying the ballot question despite questions about the initiative organizers’ conduct. The initiative organizers themselves joined the lawsuit as intervenors, arguing that even if there were some concerns about some unattended ballots, they were not enough to throw out the ballot petition entirely. During the six-day trial before Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin, witnesses testified about possible suspicious or questionable behavior by signature gatherers.The plaintiffs argued that 11,000 signatures should be thrown out. If the judge rules in their favor, the initiative would not meet the minimum statewide requirement nor the geographic distribution threshold.</span></p>

While a federal judge&#8217;s ruling in the broader case on this matter is already on appeal before the 9th Circuit, the lawmakers and RNC are seeking emergency action given the upcoming elections. Arizona&#8217;s primary is July 30 and early voting begins Wednesday. Secretary of State Adrian Fontes argued in a response that making last-minute changes to election procedures that would create chaos among voters and the wider public. &#8220;Such confusion and chaos on the cusp of an election will undoubtedly cause voters to harbor doubts about our election procedures, our election officials and our elections themselves,&#8221; he stated in a declaration objecting to the emergency stay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of State Adrian Fontes is asking a judge to</span><a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/fontes-says-gop-lawsuit-to-purge-at-least-500000-az-voters-should-be-tossed-from-court/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dismiss a lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">brought by the leaders of the AZGOP and a conservative dark money group demanding the state purge at least 500,000 voters from its rolls, saying the suit is not based on reliable data. In the suit, Scot Mussi, the head of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, and Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Gina Swoboda claim that the state’s voter rolls are overpopulated by people who have either died or moved out of state, in violation of the federal National Voter Registration Act. The pair, who is joined by Steve Gaynor, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for secretary of state in 2018, also say that the state has failed to develop a maintenance program to remove ineligible voters from the roll. But the data used in the suit is inconsistent and unreliable, Assistant Attorney General Kara Karlson</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.1381070/gov.uscourts.azd.1381070.20.0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote in a motion to dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed on behalf of Fontes.  The Republicans claim there are “at least 500,000 registered voters” in the state who should be removed from voter rolls, and that “other reliable data sources” show “between 1,060,000 and 1,270,000 unaccounted for voters on the state rolls.” Those numbers, according to Karlson, are “so disparate that it can only mean one thing: Plaintiffs are guessing.” Additionally, the motion to dismiss claims that the state is complying with federal and state election laws, which the suit says are being flouted. In August 2023, Fontes’ office reviewed the data provided by Swoboda and compared it to state policies, finding that voter rolls were in compliance with the National Voter Registration Act. Another motion to dismiss the case has been filed by the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino, two voter advocacy groups who are seeking to intervene as defendants in the case. Those groups also claim that the suit does not have legal standing and relies on cherry-picked data. No date has been set for a hearing in the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Scott Blaney</span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/news/2024-07-02/judge-dismisses-hamadehs-3rd-attempt-to-overturn-2022-election-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dismissed a claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Abe Hamadeh that his constitutional rights were violated in the 2022 race for attorney general that he lost as nothing more than a too-late election challenge In an extensive ruling, Blaney said it may be that Hamadeh has valid claims about problems with the election. These include problems with printers at Maricopa County voting centers that resulted in long lines that Hamadeh argues resulted in some voters simply walking away. More to the point, Hamadeh and his legal allies at AZ Voters Rights said these dissuaded voters were more likely to have been Republicans. And that, he said, could have changed the results of the race he officially lost to Mayes by 280 votes. All that, he charged, violated his rights of equal protection and due process. And that, said attorney Ryan Heath, provides legal grounds to set aside the certified results and order Maricopa County to re-do the election. But all that, said Blaney, is legally irrelevant. &#8220;This case is actually an untimely election contest,&#8221; the judge said, no matter how it&#8217;s dressed up as a violation of constitutional rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona&#8217;s election guidebook stifles free-speech rights and could nullify the votes of entire counties, a new lawsuit alleges. The complaint from two conservative-leaning nonprofits is the </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/10/arizonas-election-procedures-targeted-by-conservatives/74351413007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fourth legal challenge to the Elections Procedures Manual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a policy-thick document created by the Arizona Secretary of State&#8217;s office in collaboration with the 15 county elections officials. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court on July 8, objects to two provisions of the manual on constitutional grounds: A vote nullification provision states that if a county board of supervisors refuses to certify election results by the state&#8217;s deadline to canvass results, that county&#8217;s votes will not be counted. It is a reaction to the</span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/20/grand-jury-transcripts-charges-considered-against-kari-lake-attorney/73734651007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recalcitrance of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where in 2022 two of the three supervisors balked at certification. Ultimately, they were ordered by a court to do their duty. A provision that would bar threatening or harrassing behavior directed at voters. The lawsuit argues the provision is overly broad and could impede First Amendment free speech rights. American Encore and the America First Policy Institute filed the lawsuit. The groups are asking a federal judge to issue an injunction to block the two provisions in the manual and to direct Secretary of State Adrian Fontes to rework those parts. The complaint names Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, as well as Governor Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes. </span></p>

Ringfield is accused of taking the security key while working as a temporary election worker at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center. Last week, Ringfield was indicted by a state grand jury on one count of computer tampering stemming from the incident. That charge is classified as a Class 2 felony, because it deals with computer systems that are considered critical infrastructure. </span></p>

The Arkansas Public Policy Panel and the Arkansas State Conference NAACP, which challenged Arkansas’ new state House districts under the law, did not file a petition by Friday’s deadline asking the high court to review the ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. John Williams, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, said the decision to not seek review did not signal agreement with the court ruling that the groups believe is “radically wrong.” The ACLU represents the groups in the case. Williams said they didn’t seek review because they believe there’s still a mechanism for private groups to sue under another section of federal civil rights law. “Because that still exists, there was no need to bring this up before the Supreme Court,” Williams said. The groups’ decision avoids a fight before the high court over a ruling that civil rights groups say erodes the law aimed at prohibiting racial discrimination in voting. The groups have argued last year’s ruling upends decades of precedent and would remove a key tool for voters to stand up for their rights.</span></p>

In February, a Superior Court judge issued a surprise ruling that struck down early voting and the state’s 14-year-old permanent absentee law. The permanent absentee law passed the General Assembly unanimously, however, Attorney General Jennings immediately moved to appeal the ruling. In a 5-0 court ruling, the Court found that then-Rep. Gerald Hocker, the plaintiff in the Superior Court case, and co-plaintiff Michael Mennella, lacked standing to bring the case. “Enough of these thinly-veiled partisan attempts to suppress votes — especially of our most vulnerable citizens,” said Attorney General Jennings. “Whether you voted for me or not, this is your most fundamental right, and I promised never to stop fighting for it. I’m grateful to the Court for its ruling and for agreeing to hear this case on an expedited basis so that Delawareans know their rights going into the September and November elections.” In the last election, 56,000 Delawareans used early voting, and roughly 21,000, including veterans, the disabled, and caregivers, used permanent absentee ballots.</span></p>

PILF will have until Oct. 28 to fix deficiencies with its lawsuit, otherwise it will be dismissed for good.  PILF brought a challenge to Hawaii’s voter roll laws that require counties to maintain an electronic voter registration system with the name and district or precinct designation of every registered voter. The laws also require counties to keep any other information taken from a voter’s registration confidential.  PILF’s lawsuit also argues that the state’s policy of only providing registration data for election or government purposes violates the NVRA which requires statewide voter rolls to be accessible to the general public.The judge granted the state’s request in part, writing that PILF brought the case too early because they made an informal request to the state’s chief elections officer, but did not actually fill out a county application for voter data. Due to this, the court concluded that PILF did not suffer an injury, which would be required for PILF to have standing and allow the case to proceed.</span></p>

KFTC filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams and the State Board of Elections, which includes Republican and Democratic members.  The complaint alleges that Kentucky’s election law, which was changed in response to the coronavirus pandemic and became</span><a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/21RS/hb574.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permanent in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, violates the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. KFTC says the federal act requires registered voters who have moved to receive notice in writing to confirm their address and have time to respond before they are removed from voter rolls. Kentucky’s law “flagrantly violates these requirements,” KFTC argues, by not giving voters notice before removal.  Adams issued a statement saying he plans to defend the law in court. The 2021 changes, known as House Bill 574, were signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Adams said that undoing the law during a presidential election year would “sow chaos and doubt.” “Kentucky’s elections are a national success story,” Adams said. “Three years ago, Kentucky enacted a bipartisan law to prevent voting in more than one state in a presidential election. Now that a presidential election is underway, a fringe left-wing activist group is trying to undo that law and sow chaos and doubt in our elections. We believe voters should vote in only one state, and we expect to prevail in court.” In addition to the removal process, the 2021 state law also has provisions for no-excuse in-person early voting and updates to regulations for absentee ballots.</span></p>

This amounts to more than 1.1 million people statewide. New restrictions will criminalize vital parts of the election process and will prevent people from voting, Disability Rights Louisiana says. The group is seeking an injunction to stop the new laws before they go into effect. Two laws are slated to take effect Aug. 1 of this year, and two others are set to go into effect on July 1, 2025. Disability Rights Louisiana says that many people who have a disability tend to rely on absentee voting due to mobility issues and limited transportation. Additionally, many disabled people, especially the elderly, live in residential institutions and can only vote by absentee ballot.</span></p>

Servitto ruled SOS Jocelyn Benson and the local clerks properly responded to the FOIA request by Michael Butz, a county resident, by providing what it could but could not provide the information requested without also revealing private voter information and property information about the software. The information sought was from the November 2022 and May 2023 elections. “There is no evidence that each city and township defendant could produce the requested records in the formats requested by Plaintiff without disclosing exempt information or the software design of the EPBs (electronic poll books),” Servitto said. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessell, who defended Benson and the clerks, applauded the ruling in a news release. “I am grateful that the Court reaffirmed Secretary Benson’s authority to safeguard Michigan election records and to provide public data without compromising private, sensitive information,” Nessel said in the release. “My office will always protect election security against those who have a blatant disregard for voter privacy.”</span></p>

A previous ruling had found James Holkeboer, a Kent County election inspector, violated state election law when he inserted a personal USB flash drive into an electronic poll book with the intent to download the names of voters. In April, the Michigan Court of Appeals dismissed the original charges after concluding that none of the original files that Holkeboer had copied were damaged or destroyed in any way. “The act of copying a list of voters without affecting the integrity of the document or election is not, at least at present, prohibited,” stated the appeal’s court opinion. Now, a bipartisan group of 28 state election officials are asking the Michigan Supreme Court to review the decision. “What if someone inserted a thumb drive, and it has a virus on it? And then suddenly, no other voters can be registered or can be marked as voting in the precinct,” said Lansing Clerk Chris Swope, who has joined other clerks in filing an amicus brief.</span></p>

The Minnesota Board on Judicial Standards publicly reprimanded Mille Lacs County District Judge Matthew Quinn for making an unprompted ruling on the law’s constitutionality. The law, which took effect last year, says people with felony convictions regain the right to vote after they have completed any prison term. Quinn ruled the law was unconstitutional in a pair of orders in which he sentenced two offenders to probation, but warned them they were not eligible to vote or to register to vote — even though the law says they were. It was an unusual step because nobody involved in those cases ever asked him to rule on the constitutionality of the law. The Minnesota Court of Appeals found Quinn had no authority to rule on the law and undid his efforts to strip voting rights away from several people. The Judicial Standards Board found that Quinn broke a number of ethical rules by not acting in accordance with the law.</span></p>

The United States Court for the Southern District of Mississippi ruled in favor of the state conference of the NAACP over the Mississippi Election Commission, affirming an argument that the state has violated section 2 of the U.S. Voting Rights Act after the state redistricted the legislative boundaries in 2022. &#8220;The court rightly held that the Mississippi Legislature used the redistricting process to dilute the power of Black voters,&#8221; Mississippi ACLU Executive Director Jarvis Dortch said. &#8220;Those legislative districts denied Black Mississippians an equal voice in state government.&#8221; Those violations amounted to a loss of Black voting strength, and the court has now directed the state to create a new Black-majority Senate district in areas around DeSoto County and around Hattiesburg. The court also demands a new Black-majority House district in Chickasaw and Monroe counties. The ruling states it is the wish of the court that the state does this before the 2025 legislative session, which begins in January.</span></p>

The state Libertarian Party, the state and national Republican parties and a county election commissioner are the plaintiffs in the suit. They contend the state law runs afoul of federal election statutes because only Congress should set federal election schedules. Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office, who oversees the agency that administers elections, is the defendant in the suit.

But by effectively forcing county election administrators to reject signatures from voters marked ‘inactive,’ the Secretary has impeded Plaintiffs’ ability to reach that threshold, threatening their right to place CI-126, CI-127, and CI-128 on the ballot in November, causing injury and harm,” attorneys for the plaintiff groups wrote in the filing. “For these reasons, the inactive voter guidance violates Montanans’ right to propose constitutional amendments by initiative.” In their complaint, the groups asked the court to bar Jacobsen from enforcing the new interpretation and direct her office to immediately restore the signatures already rejected from inactive voters.</span></p>

Jenni White was fired from her alternate position on the Oklahoma County Election Board in February after questioning the absentee ballot counting process. Former member Cheryl Williams was also removed.  In a suit filed June 19, White is seeking damages in a jury trial. Mark Hammons, Sr., an attorney specializing in employment law, is representing White. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District. Defendants are State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax and members Heather Mahieu Cline, Tim Mauldin and Mignon Lambley.  White said she decided to sue because a board member should not be able to “smear the reputation” of another member because “they don’t like being challenged.” The board accused White of failure to perform duties prescribed by law; dissemination of false information about Oklahoma’s election system and procedures; failure to immediately remove false information from the public domain; lack of respectfulness and professionalism; and behavior unbecoming of an Oklahoma election official, according to Jan. 31 meeting minutes.</span></p>

Several of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are voters who say their ballots were rejected for errors on the ballot’s outer “declaration” envelope, such as for writing an “incomplete date,” or failing to sign and date the envelope in the correct place.  Had county officials correctly coded the rejected mail-in ballots into the state’s SURE ballot tracking database, the suit alleges, the voters would have been notified their ballots had been rejected, and could have voted by provisional ballot. Instead, the suit alleges, Washington County elections officials “determined which mail-in ballots would not be counted, and then implemented a systematic process to keep that information from voters and the public, in many cases affirmatively misleading voters into thinking that their mail-in ballots would be counted.”</span></p>

U.S. District Judge William Campbell ruled in June that Tennessee officials violated federal voting law by requiring formerly incarcerated felons to provide additional proof to have their voting rights restored. The Sixth Circuit’s decision, issued on June 28, temporarily blocks Campbell’s ruling, saying it required changes to the election too close to August state primary elections. The court also indicated that the state is likely to succeed in its appeal as the judges questioned whether the Tennessee NAACP had the proper standing to file the suit in the first place. The NAACP filed a lawsuit against state officials in 2020, challenging the extensive requirements for people with felony convictions to regain the right to vote after being released from prison. Tennessee law strips a convicted felon of their voting rights, but a formerly incarcerated individual can petition to have those rights restored through a complicated process that requires them to show proof they paid all their court fines and fees.</span></p>

The lawsuit states that in Utah, every ballot returned by mail or via a ballot drop box must be checked to ensure the signature on the envelope matches the signature in the voter registration records. If a poll worker determines the signature is not &#8220;reasonably consistent,&#8221; the law requires the poll worker reject the ballot, contact the voter to tell them their signature is being questioned, and let them know how they can &#8220;cure&#8221; their ballot so it can be counted.Despite applauding Jenkins’ campaign for raising the issue, a judge in Utah’s Fifth District Court in St. George </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-rejects-jenkins-lawsuit-obtain-voter-cure-list-another-fight-brewing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Republican candidate’s request to force the Washington County clerk to release the “uncured” list. Judge Jay Winward Washington County Clerk Ryan Sullivan interpreted and applied Utah election law correctly — and agreed that it’s at the clerk’s discretion whether to release the list of uncured ballots. Sullivan last week said he declined to release the list as a matter of voter privacy. “That’s how I interpret it,” the judge said at the conclusion of Monday’s hearing at the Fifth District Courthouse in St. George. “It’s very clear to me that this is how it’s supposed to occur.” However, Winward also praised Jenkins’ attorneys for their arguments, adding he was “grateful” that the campaign brought the issue to court. He said it highlighted a potential opportunity for the Utah Legislature to clarify or strengthen Utah law in circumstances of extremely tight elections.</span></p>

In the suit, Alexander alleges that 125 absentee ballots were received by the Lynchburg registrar’s office, but that records don’t show they were counted. It cites records from the Virginia Department of Elections, which are attached to the suit and detail the status of every ballot cast. The votes in this batch had a status of “marked,” meaning that they had been received in a timely manner, but that status was never updated to confirm whether those ballots were processed and counted.William Hurd, attorney for Alexander, said there’s a “disturbing irregularity” in the ballot records. “That could be an error in recordkeeping. It could be a failure to actually process the ballots,” Hurd said. “But looking at the records themselves, the ballots, what the records say … the ballots were not processed.” The registrar’s office issued a statement saying “we remain confident that every lawful vote was counted in the June 18, 2024 primary election held by each party. We respect and welcome the review process and we stand ready to assist the Lynchburg Circuit Court in its adjudication.” </span></p>

The 4-3 decision reverses a near-total ban on ballot drop boxes, which was handed down by the state’s high court two years before. A majority of justices agreed earlier this year to hear a challenge from the progressive group Priorities USA, seeking to overturn the drop box prohibition. The decision makes it easier for Wisconsinites to vote, by reinstating a “convenient and reliable option,” said attorney David Fox, who argued the case on behalf of Priorities USA. “If you put the ballot in the mail, you don’t know when it’ll get delivered, and voters worry about whether it will get delivered in time and whether it will be counted,” said Fox of the Elias Law Group. “But, if you put it in a drop box by the deadline, you know that it’s going straight to election officials and it will be counted.” Conservatives on the court opposed taking up the case, citing the legal principle that compels courts to honor precedent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican legislators  </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/disabled-voters-wisconsin-electronic-ballots-appeal-republicans-79b7bfbfcbb0c290b16f46948a4fd1e9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appealed a ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows disabled people to download absentee ballots at home in November’s presidential election. Disability Rights Wisconsin the League of Women Voters and four disabled voters sued in April demanding disabled people be allowed to download absentee ballots at home and return them to local clerks via email this fall. Currently in Wisconsin anyone can cast a paper absentee ballot but they must return them in-person to local election clerks or mail them back. Anyone could request an absentee ballot electronically until 2011, when then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a Republican-authored bill that allowed only military and overseas voters to use that method. Those voters still must mail their ballots back just like in-state absentee voters. The plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit that many people with disabilities can’t cast paper ballots without assistance, compromising their right to cast a secret ballot, and struggle to return ballots through the mail or in-person. The lawsuit seeks a ruling allowing disabled people to download absentee ballots, cast them at home using assistive devices and return them to clerks via email in the Aug. 13 primary and the November presidential election. Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell granted a temporary injunction on Tuesday that allows clerks to send voters who self-certify that they can’t read or mark a paper ballot without help ballots electronically in the November election. They will still have to return the ballots in-person or by mail, however. GOP legislators filed notice of appeal June 28 in the 2nd District Court of Appeals in Waukesha, which leans heavily Republican. The lawmakers indicated that they plan to argue that Mitchell improperly granted the injunction because the plaintiffs are unlikely to win the lawsuit and failed to show they’d suffer irreparable harm without the order. They also plan to argue that Mitchell wrongly disrupted the status quo just months before the election.</span></p>

														<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/events/ballot-battles-a-book-event-and-live-podcast-episode-of-the-voting-booth-with-edward-b-foley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballot Battles: A Book Event (and Live Podcast Episode of “The Voting Booth”) with Edward B. Foley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 2016, the Ohio State University’s Edward B. Foley explored the history of election controversies in the United States in Ballot Battles: The History of Disputed Elections in the United States. Following several subsequent election controversies—most notably the January 6 attack on the Capitol after the 2020 presidential election—he has written a revised and expanded version of Ballot Battles. While the United States has made substantial progress in expanding and strengthening democracy throughout its history, Mr. Foley argues that the structure of American elections remains a point of vulnerability. Join The Voting Booth cohosts John C. Fortier and Donald Palmer for a live podcast episode with Mr. Foley to discuss the new and expanded edition of Ballot Battles. <strong>When:</strong> July 15, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC and online</span></p>

On Tuesday, July 16 at 1:00 p.m. ET, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D) and Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt (R) join Washington Post Live for a bipartisan conversation about the state of election security, fears about political violence and the rise of disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> July 16, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/events/combating-misinformation-and-disinformation-with-free-markets-and-free-speech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combating Misinformation and Disinformation with Free Markets and Free Speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Though purveyors of misinformation and disinformation have proliferated and the problem keeps growing, solutions are proving elusive. A little-known aspect in the fight against misinformation and disinformation is the growing number of technology startups that are attacking the prevalence of fake news, conspiracy theories, and other false information. These firms are innovative, scrappy, nimble, and able to mitigate misinformation and disinformation in different and interesting ways. Meanwhile, another aspect of misinformation and disinformation is the need to stick to free speech principles. “Wrong” or “unpopular” speech is protected by the First Amendment. While we continue to worry about more misinformation and disinformation, especially in an election year, people still have freedom to express their views without government interference. We will take a look at how social media platforms are patrolling their content and how First Amendment concerns can be appropriately considered. Please join R Street to hear from those engaged in the battle to conquer misinformation and disinformation. Speakers will share stories centered around building entrepreneurial solutions and protecting free speech. <strong>When:</strong> July 17, 6pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/fix-insurrection-act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fix the Insurrection Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A law last updated 150 years ago gives presidents dangerous authority to use the U.S. military as a domestic police force. The Insurrection Act has virtually no limits on when and how this power can be used, making it a loaded weapon in the hands of any leader, Democrat or Republican, who is tempted to abuse it. Without urgent reforms, the law is a threat to civil liberties — and American democracy. Join The Brennan Center  for a live virtual event moderated by Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center Liberty &amp; National Security Program, featuring lawyer and writer Hawa Allan, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, and Brennan Center counsel Joseph Nunn.
