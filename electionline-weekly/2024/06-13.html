														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Long-Term Investments in Rural Broadband Access Strengthen Democracy</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal broadband initiatives can promote access to voting, especially in rural communities</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/elizabeth-howard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Howard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/about/staff/jiyoon-park"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiyoon Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/alice-clapman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice Clapman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Keely Varvel<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brennan Center and Arizona Secretary of State’s Office</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliable access to the internet, a critical portal to information, tools, and opportunities in today’s world, is uneven across the United States. Poorer and more rural communities often have the least access or no access, which puts them at a disadvantage compared to their well-<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11441" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />resourced neighbors. As the National Association of Counties explained, “Without access to high-speed internet, many of our rural communities are becoming increasingly isolated and left behind.” (1)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One overlooked consequence of this divide is how it impedes election administration improvements. Election jurisdictions with broadband infrastructure have many advantages, such as more options to communicate election information, including real-time updates, and more options to make voting easier for eligible voters. Lack of connectivity keeps rural communities from capitalizing on these benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/guidebook/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes significant federal funding for expanding </span><a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/BEAD%20Info%20Sheet%20-%20IFA%20Launch%20-%20Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broadband infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and states are currently developing their plans and identifying funding priorities for these grant funds. As these decisions can have a significant impact on election administration, federal and state grant administrators should ensure that election officials are recognized as important stakeholders and consider their input when making grant resource investment decisions to guarantee that improving access to, and thereby strengthening, our democracy is properly prioritized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Impact of Broadband Connectivity on Elections</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanded broadband connectivity allows states and municipalities to bring security-enhancing technologies that are not connected to the vote-tabulation system, such as electronic pollbooks, to underserved communities. With electronic pollbooks, election officials can <img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11440" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Broadband1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />instantaneously update lists of eligible voters and voter information, such as addresses, to ensure that voters receive the correct ballot. They can also more efficiently direct voters to the correct polling location, if necessary, and reduce wait times with quicker processing. Not only does this technology boost the accuracy of ballot distribution, but it also prevents double voting, thereby strengthening the overall reliability of the electoral process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a common misperception that all connectivity at the polls is dangerous to election security. To be sure, there are risks associated with certain kinds of connectivity, such as online voting or connections involving voting equipment. But jurisdictions can and should take advantage of tools like connected electronic pollbooks while ensuring that voting equipment stays unconnected and that machines continue to produce paper records. And they can protect e-pollbooks through robust security measures, such as encrypting communication between the e-pollbooks and mandating strong passwords that are changed after each election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadband connectivity is important when election officials establish vote centers, which allow voters, regardless of their residential address within the county, to vote on the correct ballot and have their ballot counted. The vote center model offers greater flexibility, as the voter is no longer limited to a polling place in a specific precinct and can vote at more convenient locations, like somewhere closer to their work or school. This added convenience not only makes voting more efficient and accessible but could also reduce the number of provisional ballots that are rejected because they were cast in the wrong precinct. To establish more than one vote center in a single jurisdiction, administrators need e-pollbooks capable of real-time updates to the centralized voter file so that they can print the appropriate ballots for voters and confirm that they have not already voted at a separate center. This requires sufficient connectivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, some states allow jurisdictions to replace traditional precincts with vote centers, while others have implemented this change statewide. New Mexico’s </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/chapter-1/article-3/section-1-3-4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding the use of vote centers explicitly mandates that vote center locations have a broadband internet connection, in order to use e-pollbooks. The requirement for a secure connection is common and found in other state statutes governing vote centers, further emphasizing the need for competent infrastructure. Thus, while broadband opens the door to more accessible voting options, not every jurisdiction has the resources to meet these technological requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6478" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Maricopa-Flag-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Maricopa-Flag-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Maricopa-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Maricopa County, Arizona, is a prime example of how connectivity can improve election administration and increase access. The county used broadband technology to adopt a vote center model, effectively eliminating out-of-precinct provisional voters. As a result, </span><a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/80026/Maricopa-County-Response-11-27-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provisional ballots dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 52,173 in 2016 to 18,310 in 2020, reducing ballots rejected due to wrong-precinct voting and the amount of postelection processing. With e-pollbooks at these vote centers, administrators can rapidly update voter registration addresses, leading to more accurate and up-to-date voter lists. This kind of shift toward a more modern and accessible voting system exemplifies one of the many ways that connectivity can benefit election security and foster civic engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connectivity also promotes voting access by enabling voters to readily find detailed and accurate information about candidates, policies, and voting procedures, including how to register or update registration records. It also allows voters to contact their local election departments more easily if they have questions or concerns about the process. Furthermore, connectivity can improve election <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />administration by enabling poll workers and local election officials to rapidly communicate about any urgent problems, from security threats to logistical snags. This kind of seamless coordination through an open communication channel, made possible by robust broadband connectivity, has the potential to markedly improve the voting experience for voters and election workers alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, disparate internet access can exacerbate existing barriers to voting, particularly in rural and historically underserved communities. The lack of internet access in Arizona’s tribal lands, for instance, hinders the use of e-pollbooks and reduces the options available to communicate important information with voters. Without sufficient broadband infrastructure, e-pollbooks may be unable to instantly access and verify the most current voter records, which could result in some voters </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2024/03/15/maricopa-tests-voting-technology-tohono-oodham-nation-ghaka-kaka/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">having to cast provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, because addresses on tribal lands are often not standardized,(2) some voters are assigned to polling locations that are far away from their homes. A number of those voters have tried to vote at their closest polling place, only to find that they can’t vote a regular ballot at that location. In 2020, Arizona’s Apache County, most of which is made up of tribal lands, experienced the state’s </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2022/11/3/23438048/navajo-nation-apache-county-native-american-voting-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highest rate of provisional ballot rejections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, primarily due to voting in incorrect precincts. Moreover, inadequate internet connectivity impedes access to vital voting information, including registration details, polling locations, and ballot drop-off points. And it limits the ability to get in touch with election offices, </span><a href="https://time.com/5895299/native-american-vote-arizona-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deepening the challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faced by voters on reservations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11443" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NTIA-300x110.png" alt="" width="300" height="110" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NTIA-300x110.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NTIA-768x282.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NTIA.png 872w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Poorer and rural areas often lack the broadband infrastructure necessary to offer more technologically advanced options. To remedy this, the federal government recently allocated billions of dollars in grant funds to close the digital divide through initiatives administered by the </span><a href="https://www.ntia.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Telecommunications and Information Administration </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(NTIA). This sweeping development presents important opportunities for productive partnerships between NTIA officials, state broadband agencies, and election administrators. Many states, under the leadership of their designated state broadband agency, are obtaining feedback from state and local stakeholders as they draft plans for how to invest these funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regrettably, election officials have largely been absent from these important discussions. (3) It’s critical for the long-term health of our democracy that they be brought in so that these federal resources can be invested in our election infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Understanding the NTIA and BEAD Program</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11442" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/broadbandUSA-300x117.png" alt="" width="300" height="117" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/broadbandUSA-300x117.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/broadbandUSA.png 622w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Department of Commerce, supports state, local, and tribal governments working to expand broadband connectivity and foster digital inclusion. Recognizing connectivity’s crucial impact on the vitality and accessibility of key societal sectors, including commerce, education, and civic participation, the NTIA supports initiatives such as the </span><a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/funding-programs/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This program funds collaborative projects among states, territories, communities, and key stakeholders to build necessary infrastructure and broaden high-speed internet access nationwide. With a focus on reaching </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2023/06/un--and-underserved-definitions-ta-memo-pdf.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unserved and historically underserved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regions, these efforts seek to bridge the digital divide, with all 50 states and U.S. territories eligible for this funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many states and territories have already submitted their BEAD proposals to the NTIA for review, including election administrators in ongoing consultative discussions presents an opportunity to explore the benefits of expanded broadband connectivity for voters and the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Integrating Elections into the Conversation</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NTIA can support election infrastructure through various means. Among its </span><a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/BEAD-Frequently-Asked-Questions-%28FAQs%29_Version-2.0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top priorities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the BEAD Program emphasizes its objective of “deploying and/or upgrading broadband network facilities to provide or improve service to an eligible community anchor institution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon addressing broadband needs in unserved and underserved regions, states and territories with BEAD funding could strategically prioritize the allocation of resources to multifunctional community institutions — places such as schools and libraries, already deemed by the NTIA as community anchor institutions, that are also common voting centers — to maximize the impact of these investments. Alternatively, in their state plans, state broadband agencies could categorically classify all voting locations as community anchor institutions, recognizing their role in providing essential community services to local voters. This classification would ensure dedicated support for election infrastructure and could enhance the voting experience, particularly in underserved communities. It would also support the diligent efforts of county governments, which typically fund the resources essential for administering safe and secure elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstering election infrastructure with these funds closely aligns with the directive stated in the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued on March 7, 2021. This order emphasizes the importance for agencies to “consider ways to expand citizens’ opportunities to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Election Official Engagement in Broadband Expansion<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 6, 2023, the Brennan Center for Justice submitted a </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/BCJ%20Public%20Comment%20on%20AZ%20BEAD%20Proposal.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public comment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) regarding Volume II of Arizona’s initial BEAD Program proposal. We urged the ACA to involve election officials in these discussions to guarantee that <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona’s BEAD funding implementation strategy adequately incorporates considerations for election infrastructure and recommended that state officials recognize designated polling locations as key community anchor institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/2024.03.15%20-%20Thank%20You%20Letter%20to%20NTIA%20Associate%20Administrator%20Kinkoph.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes and the Brennan Center met with NTIA representatives to discuss the essential contributions of secretaries of state and election administrators across the nation in delivering safe, secure, and accurate elections, and the significant role that broadband connectivity could have in bolstering these efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials, deeply familiar with and dedicated to their communities, stand as invaluable advisors, and they should be included in the discussions about the investment priorities for this funding that are currently underway. The NTIA should encourage state and territorial governments receiving BEAD funds to proactively engage and collaborate with state and local election officials during the review of implementation proposals. It could direct its representatives in each state or territory to incorporate election infrastructure into their discussions about community anchor institutions and to involve state and local election authorities as key community stakeholders in these deliberations. Election officials can also leverage this opportunity to identify and get in touch with </span><a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/funding-recipients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relevant points of contact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their state or territory to begin engaging in these conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, election officials can collaborate with state broadband offices to utilize connectivity maps from the </span><a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/resources/data-and-mapping?_gl=1*1799h1z*_ga*MTI5NDIwOTIzMC4xNjk3MDQ2NTY3*_ga_H50FXLW992*MTY5NzA1NzE3MS4yLjAuMTY5NzA1NzE3NS4wLjAuMA..*_ga_55V70TEFYT*MTY5NzA1NzE3MS4yLjAuMTY5NzA1NzE3NS4wLjAuMA..&amp;_ga=2.131798799.1257049043.1697046567-1294209230.1697046567"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Broadband Availability Map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the </span><a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Communications Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to guide the strategic placement of polling locations for optimal access. In areas with tribal communities, officials should partner with liaisons from the </span><a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/funding-programs/tribal-broadband-connectivity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to understand connectivity on tribal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadband expansion has untapped potential for election administration. The BEAD Program, with its historic investment in high-speed internet access, provides a framework through which existing and potential voting locations can be supported as vital hubs of community and civic engagement. This consideration would not merely be administrative — it would be a strategic move to equip these critical nodes in our democracy with the technological infrastructure necessary to safeguard and secure every vote.</span></p>

Overall things went well this week with the biggest story from most primary states being turnout–or lack thereof. In </span><a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/thousands-mainers-cast-absetee-ballots-before-primary-day/61068064"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said turnout was “extraordinarily low”. A spokesperson for the secretary of state’s office said Tuesday evening that turnout appeared to remain light at polling places throughout the state. This week’s election was the</span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/02/13/unenrolled-voters-get-to-cast-ballots-in-maine-primaries-but-little-sign-of-mass-registration-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first semi-open primary for state races</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under a new law that allows unenrolled voters to cast ballots in party primaries that were once open only to each party’s membership. “We’re</span><a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/06/11/mainers-head-to-polls-to-vote-in-party-primaries-local-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continuing to educate the unenrolled voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they can participate,” Bellows said. “We’re still trying to get the word out because a lot of unenrolled voters who call themselves independents have been trained to think that they can’t participate on primary day. That’s changed.” Bellows said she had not heard of any polling problems Tuesday but said it’s not uncommon for there to be some small technical issues that election officials at local precincts are equipped to work through. </span><a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/2024-primary-election-day-live-blog-polls-now-open-but-many-ballots-already-cast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s primary election day was marked by low turnout, excessive heat in the state’s most populous county, and a smooth execution of universal mail-in voting across the state. “Early voting ran smoothly, and Election Day went well,” said Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar. Aguliar attributed the </span><a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/06/12/smooth-primary-election-day-bodes-well-for-general-but-low-turnout-a-concern-says-sos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smooth election process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to his office’s Voter Registration and Election Management Solution (VREMS) project, which streamlined vote tabulation through a centralized statewide voter registration database and election management system..

The</span><a href="https://cdce.umd.edu/publicationprofile/1137"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shared first with NPR, also show disparities by race, ethnicity and political affiliation. U.S. citizens of color are more likely than white citizens, who do not identify as Latino, to say they lack citizenship documents (3% of people of color compared to 1% of white people) or can’t readily access them (11% of people of color vs. 8% of white people). Independents are more likely to report that they don’t have documents (4%) compared to Democrats (2%) and Republicans (1%). They are also more likely to report not having ready document access (13%) than Democrats (10%) and Republicans (7%). “We&#8217;ve got a huge crisis on our hands when we think about the people who lack the documents required to prove their citizenship and identity. And we really need to think about the far-reaching implications for that when it comes to economic and social and voting access,” says Lauren Kunis, executive director of VoteRiders, a voting rights organization focused on voter ID issues that sponsored the survey alongside groups including the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school and the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement. The findings come as top Republicans are lining up behind</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8281"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration in federal elections. </span></p>

To respond to this threat, Aspen Digital said, in part, that social media platforms could employ emerging technologies to identify false election information, including through the use of “AI tools to monitor content-level narratives to identify trends and detect malign influence actors that may vary language to avoid detection.” To combat language-based influence operations powered by AI — which the document said “reduces the effort needed for bad actors to create malicious content in any language by automating translation” — Aspen Digital also said that election officials could utilize similar capabilities of their own. “Translate first-party resources and consider responsible ways to use AI tools to translate social media and other official communications,” the report suggested for election administrators. “If using AI translation tools, perform quality checks, notify readers when automated translation has been used and link to an authoritative resource, where applicable.” Aspen Digital said election officials and other organizations should develop verification and mitigation protocols now to identify this type of generated content and work to inform communities about the likelihood of this threat.  In addition, the report said social media platforms should monitor content on “niche forums” to identify deepfakes that might spread to their sites and “consider using AI-enabled, narrative-level summation tools to monitor real time narrative trends.”</span></p>

We learned this week that </span><a href="https://www.dailygazette.com/news/ballot-the-beaver/article_b58fb420-21b0-11ef-8d51-df1a2b1e8903.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the New York State Board of Elections has a mascot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! A mascot! Ballot the Beaver made their debut this week to coincide with the board&#8217;s 50th anniversary. The beaver was also named the state’s official animal 49 years ago. “As two children of the ‘70s, they seemed like a natural pair,” NYSBOE spokesperson Kathleen McGrath told the Daily Gazette in an email. Ballot serves in an educational and promotional role. The male cartoon beaver has already appeared in a social media post, explaining that 16- and 17-year-olds can pre-register to vote. Ballot will be used in agency materials to provide facts about elections and combat false information. “With Ballot’s help, New Yorkers can become more informed and vigilant voters,” McGrath said. “They can learn to question dubious information, verify facts, and report false claims.” “While I cannot speak to other state agencies and their potential mascots, Ballot the Beaver is definitely here to stay,” McGrath said. “Look for him all year long!” The mascot already has made a fan out of Schenectady Republican Committee Chairman Thomas Kennedy. He saw the character after it first debuted on Facebook.  “I absolutely love it,” Kennedy told the Daily Gazette. While electionline doesn’t do any sort of endorsements, we endorse this idea and look forward to seeing what other elections offices come up with. </span></p>

The bill would also require contributors who spend $10,000 or more on voter-requested recounts to be reported to county election officials and publicized within 24 hours. Low was subject to a voter-requested recount with unknown funders in the Congressional District 16 contest, during which he tied with Supervisor Joe Simitian for second place in the March primary election. He said automatic recounts on tight races will protect election integrity and ensure recounts are impartial. “Locally in Santa Clara County, very close races are already recounted automatically and that should be the case for any state race that is extremely close,” Low told San José Spotlight. “AB 996 will ensure California election integrity and transparency by requiring recounts in close races and disclosure of large donors in voter-requested recounts, helping boost voter confidence in California’s elections.” AB 996 is awaiting referral to a state Senate committee.</span></p>

Jared Polis signed into law a bill that would </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/06/06/polis-signs-bill-delay-election-overhaul/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delay the implementation of a sweeping election overhaul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poised to make the 2024 ballot. But the governor and top lawmakers on both sides of the aisle pledged to promptly take up legislation fulfilling the intent of the measure, which proposes to abolish the party primary and assembly system and implement ranked choice voting for state and federal offices, if the initiative wins approval from Colorado voters. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-210"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 24-210</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed by large bipartisan majorities in the General Assembly last month, included a variety of reforms to election security and administration broadly supported by voting rights groups and local elections officials. But it also contained a last-minute amendment introduced on the House floor by Democratic state Rep. Emily Sirota of Denver, enacting a series of hurdles that must be cleared before the new election system could go into effect. Under SB-210, the proposed system could not take effect until a number of Colorado local governments meeting various population and demographic criteria have implemented ranked choice voting, and the Colorado secretary of state has completed an analysis of its implementation and impacts on “historically under-represented communities.” The Colorado County Clerks Association, which represents local elections officials from across the state and supported “guardrails” on a ranked choice voting rollout like those added to SB-210, had urged Polis to sign the bill. A coalition of left-leaning interest groups also lobbied against a veto, writing in a letter that Unite America’s proposal would enact “expensive, untested, and inaccessible processes that hurt voters and disproportionately benefit money-backed candidates.”</span></p>

Along with codifying vote-by-mail procedures in Illinois nursing homes, the proposed law would remove all caps on transfers from political party committees to candidates during primary elections. Previously, caps were only absent in general elections. Opponents are concerned poll watchers won&#8217;t be able to verify vote-by-mail procedures conducted in nursing homes where voters may be physically and mentally incapacitated. “They’re already able to vote-by-mail in nursing homes, we are just clarifying a rule that was put in place during the pandemic and putting it in statute,” said Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford. In Illinois, opponents fear the proposed law will allow incapacitated voters to be coerced into turning in incomplete ballots by nefarious ballot harvesters.  State Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, raised concerns that nursing home voters could cast a vote through vote-by-mail procedures. Previously, those voters only casted ballots on the premises. Proponents argue the change will expand voter rights and provide convenience to older voters. The proposed law applies to federally operated nursing homes, veterans&#8217; homes, hospitals or facilities.</span></p>

The City of Evanston authorized this through its Home Rule powers, however, the Cook County Clerk has not taken any action to implement these changes, according to the ordinance.  Because of this, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss recommended the approval of this ordinance in order to “eliminate all barriers to implementation.” “This is an action in support of any effort to make sure that the will of the voters of Evanston — as overwhelmingly expressed in November 2022 — is reflected in the way elections are implemented in April of 2025,” Biss said. The ordinance was passed by a 7-1 vote, with Ald. Juan Geracaris (9th) absent and Ald. Devon Reid (8th) dissenting, voting “hell no.” The ordinance will be voted on again at Council’s next meeting, June 24, for action.</span></p>

In a home rule petition introduced this week, Louijeune argued that while 55% of Massachusetts voters in 2020 spurned a system where voters would rank a series of candidates by preference rather than simply select their top choice, there was actually “broad” support for the change in Boston, where 62% were in favor. Such a change, she said, would “modernize how we vote and how every voice is heard in our elections.” It would also foster greater civic engagement and reduce  political polarization, she added. The change would promote the top four district council and mayoral candidates from the preliminary election, rather than the top-two-vote-getting candidates that currently advance. Voters would then rank up to four candidates in the order of their preference for each race in the final municipal election. If no candidate wins more than 50%, the bottom vote-getter is eliminated, and all of the ballots that went to them are allocated to voters’ second-place choices. If no one is above 50%, the process repeats, eliminating one candidate per round until there are only two candidates left, at which point the one with the most votes wins.</span></p>

It also would require Ohioans to show a photo ID to register to vote – not just to cast a ballot like under current law – and expand a recently passed voter ID requirement to also apply to mail-in voting – a carve out that was retained in the last elections overhaul lawmakers passed in late 2022. The 258-page bill makes myriad changes to elections administration, many of which involve requiring elections officials to do more extensive and frequent checks of voting records to verify voting rolls only include eligible voters. Some proposed changes have no clear precedent – like requiring the state’s voter registration system to be converted to blockchain, the digital ledger software that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so that any changes can be publicly tracked and scrutinized. The bill’s opponents include elections officials, who view it as a costly and unnecessary update of an already secure system. The County Commissioners Association of Ohio, which represents county governments, voted Monday to oppose the bill for similar reasons. Democrats have described the proposal during committee hearings a voter suppression bill. “We see this bill as something that’s going to squeeze taxpayers across the board as well as burden voters,” said Paul Adams, director of the Lorain County Board of Elections and president of the Ohio Elections Officials Association. “It’s an unfunded mandate in search of a problem.”</span></p>

Under SB1750, a law authored by state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, the Texas Legislature last year forced Harris County to return duties for overseeing elections back to the two elected positions that ran them until Commissioners Court voted in 2020 to create an appointed administrator. At a Texas House Elections Committee hearing on Wednesday, Committee Chair Reggie Smith, R-Sherman, raised the question of whether they should broaden the law moving forward to apply to more counties. The next legislative session won&#8217;t convene until January 2025, but lawmakers are holding interim committee hearings over the summer to monitor key issues and prepare for the year ahead.  Committee members on Wednesday questioned Christina Adkins, director of the Texas Secretary of State&#8217;s elections division, and Harris County Clerk Teneshia Hudspeth about how the law has been implemented since going into effect last September. Hudspeth took over election duties, while Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Ann Harris Bennett assumed responsibility for voter registration. More than half of Texas&#8217; 254 counties have appointed elections administrators, but SB1750 applies only to counties with a population greater than 3.5 million. Harris County is the only county of that size.</span></p>

Warner – along with the secretaries of state of Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Wyoming – </span><a href="https://wvrecord.com/stories/660510732-w-va-leads-group-asking-u-s-supreme-court-to-strike-down-order-federalizing-voter-registration-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> May 28 asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule Executive Order 14019 is unconstitutional and violates the authority granted to the states to regulate elections by the United States Constitution.  Specifically, the secretaries of state seek to protect the voter registration process currently administered by the states. Biden issued the order March 7, 2021, directing federal agencies to develop ways and means to expand and promote voter registration and to increase participation in vote-by-mail ballot applications. The secretaries of states say the order inappropriately allows federal agencies to use non-appropriated federal funds to fulfill those directives. &#8220;The President&#8217;s use of executive action to convert federal agencies into get-out-the-vote operations is prohibited by the United States Constitution,&#8221; Warner said. &#8220;The Elections Clause of the Constitution specifically declares that the manner of running elections is left to the states, not the federal government. Registering eligible people to vote is an essential component and manner of running fair and secure elections.&#8221;  The legal action says neither the National Voter Registration Act nor the Help America Vote Act allow a president to designate federal agencies as voter registration agencies. It says only Congress has the power to override state regulations by establishing uniform rules for federal elections.</span></p>

Filed in the United States District Court of Alabama, the Attorney General argued in a 25-page filing that the plaintiffs have not shown they would likely succeed on the merits of the case and that the injunction would harm the state. “SB1 strikes a balance between security and accessibility, deterring fraudulent conduct while insulating vulnerable voters and the electoral system from manipulation,” the filing states. </span><a href="https://arc-sos.state.al.us/ucp/L1499132.AI1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 1,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, makes a person receiving a payment or gift for “distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining or delivering” an application a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. If a person knowingly pays or provides a gift to a “third party to distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, complete, obtain or deliver,” then it would be a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Civil Rights groups, including the ACLU of Alabama and the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, filed a lawsuit to block the bill on April 4, which cited the state’s history of voter suppression and said that volunteers could be punished. The plaintiffs in a case against Alabama’s absentee ballot application law</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/06/11/plaintiffs-in-case-over-absentee-voting-lea-respond-to-states-motion-to-dismiss/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a response Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the defendants’ motion to have the case dismissed. In the 52-page filing in the Northern District of Alabama, the plaintiffs responded to claims by the Alabama Attorney General’s office’s motion to dismiss that alleged the law was not a burden on freedom of speech and that it was a “shotgun pleading.” “Defendants’ voluminous efforts to manufacture any cognizable deficiencies in Plaintiffs’ claims fall short,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/06/12/department-of-justice-files-statement-of-interest-in-absentee-ballot-application-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice submitted a statement of interest </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the case over the state’s absentee voting law expressing doubt of the legitimacy of the state’s arguments regarding absentee ballots. In the 12-page filing, attorneys for the Department of Justice wrote that the case presented “important” questions over Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act and that Congress gave the Attorney General authority to enforce the section. “Accordingly, the United States has a substantial interest in ensuring the proper interpretation of Section 208,” they wrote. “The United States takes no position on any factual disputes or any other legal questions in this case.”</span></p>

Rankin sided generally with the state and rollback supporters, saying elections officials acted appropriately by allowing petitioners to fix problems with petition booklets needed to call a vote this November.  A group of plaintiffs who support the current system had sued the Alaska Division of Elections in April, claiming the state improperly certified the rollback measure. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs had challenged state officials’ decision to allow petitioners to fix signature booklets that had not been properly notarized. If the booklets were disqualified, petitioners wouldn’t have had enough signatures to advance the rollback measure to a November vote. But Rankin, citing instructions given by the Division of Elections as far back as 2015, noted that the division has long allowed petitioners to make minor fixes to their booklets after the deadline to submit them for consideration. That practice is legal, she concluded, under a 2006 Alaska Supreme Court decision that said in part: “The right to initiative is a key feature of Alaska’s governance. Our Supreme Court has reiterated on several occasions that the right to initiative is not to be defeated by technical rule violations.” Rankin said the problem cited by plaintiffs is “precisely the type of technical rule violation that warrants application of the constitutional principle of interpreting legislative procedures in favor of placing initiatives on the ballot.”</span></p>

The lawsuit claims that the state’s list of registered voters contains up to 1.27 million voters who have either died or moved out of state, violating the National Voter Registration Act. Four counties in Arizona have more registered voters than total voting-age citizens, the group’s suit says — Apache, La Paz, Navajo and Santa Cruz. The suit uses 2022 voter registration figures and data  from the U.S. Census Bureau. The suit was filed by Scot Mussi, president of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club; Arizona GOP chair Gina Swoboda; and Steve Gaynor, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for Arizona secretary of state in 2018. “Election integrity is a serious issue in our nation,” said Mussi in a written statement announcing the lawsuit. “Ensuring that Arizonans can have faith in the integrity of our election system and representative government starts with clean voter rolls that leave no doubts about who is able to cast a ballot. In the suit, Mussi and the others claim that Secretary of State Adrian Fontes has failed to develop a maintenance program to remove ineligible voters, and that he has admitted to that failure, describing the program as “in development.” Arizona Secretary of State spokesperson JP Martin said that the state’s voter registration monitoring is “up to date and compliant with federal and state laws.” Martin said that Fontes’ office would not comment on an ongoing legal case, but voters have no reason for concern and that the lawsuit is based on speculation rather than evidence.</span></p>

The DA’s Office investigated the case after receiving a referral from the Sonoma County Registrar of Voters’ Office. Another local resident notified the office after noticing Eschenbach posting comments on X, formerly known as Twitter, about voting twice in two separate elections in 2022. In January 2024, Eschenbach posted on X saying he believed mail-in voting was “insecure” and that he did “an experiment” to prove it by voting twice in the last two elections. After his experiment, Eschenbach said he “never heard back” from election officials, so he believed he had “proved that mail-in is insecure,” the DA’s office said. Unbeknownst to Eschenbach, the Election Management System (EMS) automatically voided his extra vote-by-mail ballot when officials noticed he submitted more than one vote, the DA’s office said. Through further investigation, officials determined that Eschenbach had first sent in his first mail-in ballot before election day, and while that was getting processed, he voted in person on election day “with the intention to cast two votes,” the DA’s office said. Eschenbach did this in both the June 2022 primary election and the November 2022 general election. Due to election safeguards, both of Eschenbach’s attempts to vote twice resulted in a single vote. “It is important to understand that the election safeguards worked as intended to prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the vote,” Registrar of Voters Deva Marie Proto said.</span></p>

According to the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office,Anzulewicz, submitted more than one fraudulent ballot in the November 2022 election when he forged and submitted his mother’s mail-in ballot without her permission, as well turning in his own mail-in ballot and attempting to vote himself in person. According to the news release, Anzulewicz was charged with mail-in ballot/election fraud, a class 2 misdemeanor, after a two-year investigation. As part of his sentence, Anzulewicz must serve 20 days in jail by Aug. 30 in addition to complying with all of the standard terms and conditions for two years of supervised probation. He was also ordered to pay $1,245 in fees and court costs. Because Anzulewicz entered a guilty plea so soon after being charged, District Attorney Matt Karzen said the investigation didn’t reach into a potential motive for why Anzulewicz cast the fraudulent ballots, nor did the investigation show which candidates or issues his fraudulent votes might have favored. “We want the citizens of Routt County to know that we are working hard every election to identify any type of election offense, and we have processes in place to catch this type of fraud,” Routt County Clerk and Recorder Jenny Thomas said in the release. “I appreciate the hard work of the Routt County Elections Division and the office of the district attorney. We will continue to work hard for the citizens of Routt County and prosecute anyone who violates our election laws.”</span></p>

The state charges stem from the 2019 Democratic primary in Bridgeport — and are separate from allegations of misconduct in the 2023 mayoral contest in the city, which led to a judge ordering a do-over primary. Those charged are Wanda Geter-Pataky, a Democratic official in Bridgeport; and Alfredo Castillo, a city councilor; along with Nilsa Heredia and Josephine Edmonds. Their charges include unlawful possession of absentee ballots. &#8220;I hope these prosecutions will send a message that deters tampering with election results in the future in Connecticut,&#8221; Patrick Griffin, Connecticut&#8217;s chief state&#8217;s attorney, said in</span><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dcj/press-room/press-releases/06112024bridgeport"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing the charges. All four defendants are charged with unlawfully possessing another person’s absentee ballot. Geter-Pataky, Edmonds and Heredia also face charges for “tampering with a witness,” on top of several other election related crimes. The four individuals were arrested Tuesday morning, and were released with a promise to appear in Bridgeport Superior Court on June 24 to be arraigned.</span></p>

However, no one disputes that the affected envelopes arrived at the board in a condition that complies with the requirements,” Blee said.  “There was no testimony, nothing in the letter briefs or the testimony here today that suggests that the ballots in the prematurely opened-up ballots were taken out, examined, altered, or tampered with.” Those ballots, and others still uncounted, should determine the outcome of the Democratic primary for Congress in New Jersey’s 2nd district, where Joseph Salerno leads Tim Alexander by a scant 412 votes. Blee acted as the tiebreaker after the commissioners of the Board of Elections deadlocked 2-2 in a vote on the counting of the ballots on Tuesday.  Democrats wanted the votes counted, but Republicans, citing the need to strictly follow state election laws, opposed it.  He heard from two election workers called as witnesses by Deputy Attorney General Steven Gleeson.</span></p>

The plaintiffs are challenging the rejection of mail-in and absentee ballots that omit the last two digits of the year. Lancaster County ballots display the first two numbers of the year as 20 and require voters to fill out the last two. The suit was filed in the Lancaster Court of Common Pleas by the Pennsylvania Alliance for Retired Americans, which is represented by Fair Elections Center and LeVan Stapleton Segal Cochran LLC. The filers argue that since the current year is displayed on the ballots themselves and that there is little ambiguity as to what year an election is taking place in, the writing of the year is redundant.  &#8220;These ballots are not from the past,&#8221; said Jon Sherman, the litigation director at the Fair Elections Center. &#8220;They&#8217;re not from the future. They&#8217;re not from 2023. They&#8217;re not from 2025. We know what year these ballots were issued. We know what year they were cast in. It&#8217;s reading Pennsylvania law into absurdity to require this as a mandatory requirement when they filled out the month and day.&#8221; The plaintiffs intend to file a motion for a preliminary injunction.</span></p>

But, there are exceptions. Before 1981 this felony vote-stripping law didn’t exist or only applied to a narrow set of convicted crimes.  U.S. District Judge William Campbell ruled in May that the state violated federal voting law when requiring a group of formerly incarcerated felons convicted before 1981 to prove they were entitled to register to vote, even though this group never lost the right to vote in the first place.  Campbell, in his ruling, said Tennessee officials should stop requiring formerly incarcerated felons to provide additional proof in order to have their voting rights restored. Instead, he ordered the state to write up a new policy and procedure for processing felony voter registrations and to train election workers how to follow it.  Attorneys for the state filed a one-page notice that they were appealing Campbell’s order two after days after it was issued.  Officials asked the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears appeals from district court rulings in Tennessee, to stop the Middle Tennessee district court from enforcing Campbell’s order while the state appealed it.</span></p>

However, the court also ensured on June 11 that municipalities across the battleground state can use the same method in place since 2016 to determine where to locate early voting sites for the August primary and November presidential election in 2024. They just can’t use mobile sites, like Racine did in 2022 when it allowed ballots to be cast in a van that traveled around the city. The order came just ahead of a June 12 deadline for municipalities to designate alternate locations for voters to cast early, absentee ballots. Wisconsin state law prohibits locating any early voting site in a place that gives an advantage to any political party. At issue in the current case is how to interpret that law. The Racine County Circuit Court said in January that the mobile voting vans in Racine were not allowed under the law. Additionally, the van was placed in areas that were advantageous to Democrats, also in violation of the law, the court ruled. The court said state law means that an advantage to a political party can only be avoided if voters in the immediate vicinity of the early voting location cast their ballots exactly the same as voters who live in the immediate vicinity of the municipal clerk’s office. The Supreme Court put that interpretation on hold on June 11. “At this stage, just months before the August primary and November general elections, there is a risk that the circuit court’s ruling will disrupt ongoing preparations for those elections by creating uncertainty about which sites may be designated as alternate absentee balloting locations,” the court said in its 4-3 order supported by the liberal majority. The underlying case proceeds in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is expected to schedule oral arguments in the fall, too late to affect absentee voting rules for the 2024 elections. While the case is proceeding, the elections commission asked the Supreme Court to put the earlier court ruling on hold in light of the June 12 deadline for selecting early voting sites. The Supreme Court on June 11 said there was little harm in granting a stay that would keep the same criteria in place for determining early voting locations that has been used since 2016. But it declined to lift the ban on mobile voting sites, a win for Republicans.</span></p>

What are lawmakers and election administrators thinking about now to prepare? Find out in this four-part series, hosted  by the National Conference of State Legislatures in partnership with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We’ll focus on the elections workforce; counting and recounts and more post-voting work; the voters’ perspectives and voter confidence.  Voter confidence is top of mind for elections stakeholders this cycle. In the final part of NCSL’s spring webinar series, U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Christy McCormick will delve into state policies that can increase voter confidence. Perfecting processes and procedures comes first: clarifying all policies before the first vote is cast; cleaning voter lists; adopting strong chain-of-custody procedures for ballots and equipment; updating emergency plans; using pre- and post-election audits; and more. The next job is to ensure all that good technical work is transparent and communicated well to voters and the public. <strong>When:</strong> June 14, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</span></p>

The Voters: A Conversation with Joshua Douglas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In recent decades, we have witnessed an alarming trend at our nation’s highest court. From headline-grabbing cases like Bush v. Gore and Citizens United to lesser-known but still impactful cases like Crawford v. Marion County Elections Board, the Supreme Court of the United States has significantly changed American elections. &#8220;The Court v. The Voters: The Troubling Story of How the Supreme Court Has Undermined Voting Rights&#8221; examines each of these cases in turn and explains how each decision impacted our democracy and the voting rights of everyday Americans. In plain, accessible language, “The Court v. The Voters” uses real human stories to allow readers to understand the real and present danger of an activist court that consistently undermines those it is meant to serve — while highlighting solutions that will empower readers to plot a course for change. In conversation with Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith, professor and author Joshua A. Douglas will take his knowledge of election law to lead attendees behind the scenes of the most significant cases in the history of voting rights in America. Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky J. David Rosenberg College of Law.
