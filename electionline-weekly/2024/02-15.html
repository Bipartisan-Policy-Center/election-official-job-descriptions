														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Preparing for and Responding to the Unexpected</strong><br />
<em>Election Communications Help Is Just a Click Away </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By <a href="https://www.ideas42.org/">ideas42</a> and <a href="https://electionsgroup.com/">The Elections Group</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidential election years always mean significant workloads for election administrators. Yet 2024 already feels different. People are paying close attention to the nuts and bolts of election administration, as they’ve done for the past four years, keeping the spotlight on election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10807" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-300x174.png" alt="" width="300" height="174" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-300x174.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-1024x595.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-768x446.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-1536x892.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7.png 1549w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Luckily, election officials don’t have to go it alone. There are tools, resources, and organizations to turn to for support, especially when mistakes happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Group is partnering with ideas42, a nonpartisan nonprofit that uses insights from behavioral science to improve lives, to present a webinar about how election officials can navigate unforeseen challenges: </span><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_kzcy9GKZTo2eV24FP1Npdw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sh%t Happens: How Election Officials Can Respond Effectively When Mistakes Are Made</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At noon ET on Tuesday, February 20, our teams will address how to both prepare for and respond to crisis situations that can arise in election administration communications. Experts from ideas42 and The Elections Group will share insights and communications resources to assist election administrators this election year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, ideas42 and The Elections Group are dedicated to providing solutions and connecting election officials with effective resources. With decades of experience both supporting and working as election officials, The Elections Group team is aware of the challenges election administrators face and how to navigate them. Similarly, ideas42 is experienced in supporting dozens of election offices to discover creative ways to streamline their work and help increase voter confidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give election officials across the United States the tools they need to help every voter feel more informed, confident, and prepared to cast their ballot, ideas42 developed </span><a href="https://votercast.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoterCast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This tool is the outcome of ideas42’s behavioral scientists’ research to uncover best practices in voter communication and incorporate those insights into customizable materials available for use by every election official in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10801" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ideas42-300x181.png" alt="" width="300" height="181" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ideas42-300x181.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ideas42.png 333w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />By signing up for VoterCast, election officials gain access to tailored communications content on a range of topics, from upcoming election notifications to Election Day reminders. The VoterCast technology automatically customizes the content to reflect the specific laws and election calendars of every jurisdiction, giving election officials access to best-in-class voter communications made just for their voters. Content is available for social media, print (flyers, posters, advertisements), email, and SMS formats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For broader questions about communication tactics and strategy, and when election officials need help fast, they can turn to The Elections Group’s </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/communications-resource-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communications Resource Desk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even with back-up plans to back-up plans, mistakes will happen and election officials will address them. The Elections Group’s team of election communications experts is ready to help officials keep voters well-informed along the way. The team is available to discuss communications needs; provide communications solutions; and write, design, and produce tailored, free or low-cost communications for state and local election offices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Communications Resource Desk also offers dozens of free communications tools, guides, and templates that election officials can download and customize on their own. These range from poll worker recruitment tools to handouts to set realistic expectations for election observers, and from guides for writing effective press releases to best practices for creating informative videos about election processes. The Communications Resource Desk can help officials with the critical work of communicating how elections are run and why they can be trusted, along with the steps taken to ensure their accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials across the country are doing great and innovative work. But they will undoubtedly face a host of new challenges in 2024. And mistakes and unforeseen circumstances will happen. With meaningful support from organizations like ideas42 and The Elections Group, election administrators can prepare for and respond effectively to the challenges of 2024 and deliver for voters and our democracy.</span></p>

							<h2>AI Election Security Handbook</h2>
														<p><strong>The ASD AI Election Security Handbook</strong><br />
<em>Resource for responding to threats to election security</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance for Securing Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the German Marshall Fund of the United States released </span><a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/asd-ai-election-security-handbook"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ASD AI Election Security Handbook”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a resource for elections officials responding to unprecedented threats to election security supercharged by technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10796" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-2.15.49 PM-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-2.15.49 PM-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-2.15.49 PM-790x1024.png 790w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-2.15.49 PM-768x996.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-2.15.49 PM-1184x1536.png 1184w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-2.15.49 PM.png 1206w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" />Crafted by leading experts in emerging technologies and election integrity, the handbook describes the new threats looming over this election cycle and offers real solutions for officials to safeguard democratic processes. From AI-generated disinformation campaigns to sophisticated cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, the authors analyze the ways these technologies might be misused, share what experts are watching out for this cycle, and offer specific action items for officials and policymakers to safeguard election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASD Senior Fellow for Emerging Technologies Lindsay Gorman said: “Generative AI is upending our relationship to information, democratizing the ability to create realistic fake calls, videos, and images. Nowhere is quality information more vital to a democracy than in selecting political leaders, and now AI and the largest election year in history are headed for a near-on collision. Equipping front-line election officials with the tools and tactics to meeting evolving technology threats is an urgent national priority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The emergence of generative AI tools comes at a time when the demands and expectations facing election officials continue to grow, trust in US elections is at an all-time low, and threats to elections continue to increase,” said ASD Senior Fellow for Elections Integrity David Levine. “Election officials are the biggest reason recent US elections have been successful, and this handbook offers tips that should help them replicate that success in 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some of the steps the authors recommend that election officials take:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simulate AI threats to election infrastructure. Conducting mock elections and tabletop exercises to test resilience against AI-driven phishing campaigns and disinformation help officials identify vulnerabilities in voter registration databases, voting systems, and election day operations, testing partnerships with state, federal, and academic entities for comprehensive threat assessment.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain hard copies of voter registration for resilience against ransomware. Keeping organized, easily accessible hard copies of voter registration cards to mitigate the impact of AI-enhanced ransomware attacks. This ensures continuity in the signature verification processes for mail ballots, even in the event of digital system compromises, safeguarding against delays and exploitation.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot content authenticity technologies before the election. Exploring technologies that embed data on content creation and modification to combat deepfakes, enhancing trust in digital communications. Some election officials—particularly those in well-funded, tech-savvy jurisdictions—should pilot integrating these technologies into their election infrastructure to increase public trust.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create reading rooms for public records requests. Mitigate the administrative strain caused by a potential surge in AI-generated public records requests by expanding public records reading rooms to proactively offer frequently requested public records streamlines the process and alleviates the burden on election officials</span></li>

														<p><strong>Election Mail Handling Procedures to Protect Against Hazardous Materials</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">CISA, FBI, EAC and USPIS publish new tool for elections officials</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) published</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/election-mail-handling-procedures-protect-against-hazardous-materials"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Mail Handling Procedures to Protect Against Hazardous Materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This resource helps officials understand safe mail handling procedures and provides guidance on responding to potential hazardous materials exposure.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two decades, U.S. government offices and employees have been the target of multiple incidents using letters containing hazardous materials, including suspicious letters mailed to election offices in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png" alt="" width="209" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" />Since mail is a key component of both standard office operations and mail balloting across the country, this guidance document provides information for election offices on how to identify and handle potentially suspicious mail and respond to potential hazardous materials exposure while handling suspicious mail. The guide also provides specific information on how to protect against the three hazardous powders of greatest concern, fentanyl, anthrax, and ricin, in addition to more routine mail hazards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CISA is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with state and local election officials who face a complex threat environment,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Today’s guidance on safe mail handling procedures will help election officials and others on the frontlines of our democracy take steps to protect themselves and their personnel from hazards sent through the mail.  We will continue to work with our partners to ensure election officials have the information and resources they need to run a safe, secure and resilient election.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is essential for the FBI to leverage force multipliers, through strong partnerships and informational campaigns, like this one, which focus on election mail handling procedures,&#8221; said Susan Ferensic, Assistant Director of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate. &#8220;This guidance will further strengthen the ability of those on the frontlines to be better prepared to identify and handle suspicious mail. The FBI will continue to reinforce proactive partnerships in an <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px" />effort to protect election workers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks said in the following joint statement: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The safety of election workers is a top priority for the EAC, as it should be for all Americans. To ensure our elections run smoothly, election officials must be able to carry out essential tasks such as opening and receiving mail without risking their health. Due to the multiple incidents involving election offices being sent hazardous materials, we urge election workers to exercise caution when handling mail by following the guidance in this resource. We will continue to work with federal partners to support officials as they conduct fair, safe, and <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10802" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-11.02.33 AM.png" alt="" width="206" height="160" />secure elections in 2024 and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to ensuring the safe and secure delivery of Election Mail, the integrity of our elections and the protection of election offices and election officials from threatening and dangerous mail,” said Gary Barksdale, Chief Postal Inspector.  “This guidance is part of our collaborative efforts with our federal partners to raise awareness with the election community of suspicious, threatening, and dangerous mail and steps that can be taken to prepare for, and respond to, these incidents should they arise.  We encourage all election offices to implement the recommendations that are part of this guidance.”</span></p>

During the conference, they held a </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/02/12/county-election-officials-call-for-security-ahead-of-2024-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit on Election Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Officials met with federal government officials, members of Congress, representatives from the private sector and senior administration officials for a series of workshops and panels on issues ranging from disaster preparedness to artificial intelligence, to </span><a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/finance/2024/02/counties-want-more-money-elections-washington-unlikely-provide-it/394143/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more ahead of 2024’s elections. “Each election cycle, counties play a role in managing over 100,000 polling places and coordinating the training of over 630,000 poll workers that are essential to ensure that citizens can exercise their right to vote,” said Curtis Koch, auditor of Utah’s Davis County and chair of one of NACo’s policy steering committees, as he kicked off a session on election administration. Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil (R), chairman of the Committee on House Administration heard from many elections officials at the event about the need for funding but didn’t seem optimistic about it. “I just don&#8217;t want anybody to walk out of here thinking that all of a sudden a massive flow of funds is going to come forward,” he told them. President Joe Biden was the </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4463210-biden-election-workers-at-risk-means-somethings-wrong/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keynote speaker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the conference and during his remarks he thanked election workers and directly addressed the threats they are facing. “To all the county … election workers, thank you. I never thought I’d have to say this to anybody but thank you for your physical courage, thank you for your courage and your service to the community,” Biden said. “The idea that I’d ever thought I’d be standing before over 1,000 country officials and having to thank somebody for being an election worker because they’re putting their life at risk,” he said. “Something’s wrong, folks, we’ve got to change this. We’ve got to change the attitude in this country.”</span></p>

In the FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress dedicated $1 million in funding for grants to encourage college students to serve as nonpartisan poll workers for the first time since 2010. The EAC received more than 40 applications for a total request of over $3.3 million in funding from a broad range of educational institutions, local governments, and organizations. The EAC awarded the full $1 million in available HAVCP funding, including 14 Poll Worker Grants totaling $937,050 and seven Service Day Mini-Grants totaling $62,950. The organizations selected for HAVCP awards include accredited colleges and universities, state and local election offices, and nonprofits across 19 states. HAVCP programming will engage more than 7,000 college students through targeted recruitment and training initiatives, civic education courses, and established partnerships with local stakeholders. EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks issued the following joint statement:  “The relaunch of the Help America Vote College Program has come at a pivotal time for election offices across the country. The EAC looks forward to seeing how the recipients use these funds to engage young people as poll workers and in the election process. The agency appreciates Congress’ recognition of the need to develop the next generation of poll workers and election workers. We hope the efforts of grantees will benefit their communities, and we will provide updates as their programming moves forward.”</span></p>

Clay County residents, 14 years old and older, were asked to submit their artwork for a new “I Voted” sticker design involving the themes of Clay County and democracy. The goal of the competition was to further encourage our community to engage in the voting process in a fun and creative way. The picture of the Great Blue Heron, against a vibrant backdrop of water and trees, was snapped by Harvey. She then edited it to add the words “Clay County” and “I voted!” to it. As she explained “I think these wading birds represent the natural beauty our county has to offer.” Originally, the sticker templates were either a circular or rectangular shape, but Supervisor of Elections Chris H. Chambless thought printing them in the shape of Clay County would add a personalized twist to the overall design. The new stickers will be handed out to voters during Early Voting and Election Day for the Presidential Preference Primary on March 19, 2024, as well as the Primary and General Elections later this year.

Despite having the right to vote, incarcerated persons often confront challenges in registering and/or voting while being detained.

It presents the evolution of jail voting in the city, what it took to get it to happen, logistics of its successful implementation, challenges, and how different stakeholders in the process have made it work. The District of Columbia’s success demonstrates that providing incarcerated people with a true opportunity to vote is not overly burdensome and is something they will enthusiastically participate in. “It may sound trivial, but [what] was very important to those residents that I saw vote was that they wanted that ‘I voted’ sticker&#8230; And one of the reasons I heard was they wanted to send it home to their family to let them know they are being included, that they are taking a step to being a part of the community, making decisions for the community. That’s one of the things that really impacted me on the election days,” Danjuma Gaskins, inmate grievance process program manager and voter registration liaison for the D.C. Department of Corrections.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> The Senate approved a bill that would </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/14/alabama-senate-approves-harsher-penalties-for-some-absentee-ballot-assistance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalize some forms of absentee voting assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have more aggressive penalties for “ballot-harvesting.” SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, would make it illegal for someone to “knowingly” provide an absentee ballot application with pre-filled information, with exceptions for emergency medical care. “This is a bill about voting rights and the integrity of our elections in the state of Alabama and this bill is and should be a bill for every Alabamian,” said Gudger. The bill passed 27-8 on party lines, after a nearly three-hour filibuster from Democrats who said the bill would make it much more difficult for people with disabilities in rural areas to vote. Gudger’s bill makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a person to receive payment or a gift for “distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining or delivering” a voter’s application. A person who knowingly pays or provides a gift to a “third party to distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, complete, obtain or deliver” an application for an absentee ballot would be guilty of a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The bill includes exceptions for some disabilities and does not impact members of the armed services stationed overseas. Four amendments to the bill were also added on the floor. The amendments allow some handwritten requests; allow the marking of which election the ballot is for; require a person must declare they are not barred from voting because of a felony or that their voting right has been restored rather than they have not been convicted of any disqualifying felonies; and makes allowances for those who work for utilities in cases of needing to travel to provide mutual aid.</span></p>

County officials warned that an increase in the number of mandatory recounts triggered by a law passed in 2022 would not leave them with enough time to issue ballots to UOCAVA voters after the August primary by a federally-imposed deadline. There are different fears about the general election, when an influx of recounts could create delays that conflict with a new federal law that requires the state to certify its presidential electors by Dec. 11. All parties involved, including both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, agreed they needed to solve that problem by giving election officials more time to perform recounts and other post-election activities. Democrats sought to roll back the 2022 recount law. Republicans, who hold a slim one-vote majority in the state House and Senate, backed a different bill that included other election calendar changes sought by county officials that run elections, including moving the primary this year up by a week to July 30. The bill also limits the days primary candidates have to proofread ballots from five to two days; allows counties to transmit their official vote counts to the state electronically; and speeds up the state’s official vote tally. It also allows counties to conduct the five-day cure period, or the time period after an election when mail-in voters can correct any problems with their signatures on a ballot envelope, over five calendar days instead of the five business days that counties currently allow. But the GOP bill also codifies signature verification standards for mail-in ballots in state law, a Republican election priority that is unrelated to the election deadline issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a party-line vote, a Senate committee passed a bill that would ban </span><a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1871168/bills-restrict-voter-registration-worker-pay-keep-adot-open-pass-arizona-senate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter registration workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from getting paid strictly by the amount of names they register. Republican Sen. Ken Bennett, the bill&#8217;s sponsor, says the current rules incentivize workers to commit fraud by adding names. &#8220;It doesn’t prohibit people employing people to do a voter registration project. You just can’t pay them by name,&#8221; Bennett said. Bennett says Hobbs had vetoed a similar bill last legislative session, so he would be willing to modify his latest bill to avoid a repeat of last year.</span></p>

The proposal would enable voters to check ballots and count votes for themselves after each election. If the bill becomes law, millions of ballots could be put online this year. In the last presidential election, 5 million Georgia voters turned out. State Rep. John LaHood, the sponsor of House Bill 974, said it’s the latest step toward greater transparency and accountability in elections. “Those who want to count for themselves and inspect can do so to their heart’s content,” said LaHood, a Republican from Valdosta and chairman of the House Governmental Affairs Committee. LaHood’s bill requires the secretary of state’s office to create a statewide program to display ballot images for 24 months after each election. Ballot images are already public records in Georgia, available at a cost from county election offices. Original paper ballots would remain sealed unless a judge requires their disclosure. Absentee ballots, which have received the most scrutiny from election skeptics, would be posted at the highest resolution available, according to the bill. Ballots printed from Georgia’s touchscreens could be displayed at a lower resolution. The bill doesn’t include any funding, but LaHood said the expense would be minimal because the secretary of state’s office is already working on a ballot image website. The secretary of state’s office did not weigh in on the bill.</span></p>

The bill is the latest Republican-sponsored proposal to tweak election rules ahead of this year’s presidential race. The bill calls for the top race on the ballot to be audited each election along with another statewide race chosen by the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the House and the minority leaders in the state House and Senate. The House passed the bill on a 164-3 vote, and it will next be considered by the state Senate.</span></p>

GEC offered testimony in support of all of them. Program Coordinator Tom San Agustin said, “Bill 216 allows for Guam Police Department intervention should electioneering occur at the polls, and provides further collaboration with GPD. GEC seeks to establish safer electioneering parameters for the polling sites throughout the island.”  “Bill 217  seeks to change the deadline for tabulating provisional ballots which would allow the GEC to synchronize its timetable for tabulating both absentee and provisional,” He added.  San Agustin also said, “Bill 218 seeks to change the close of registration 10 days to 21 days prior to an election, which would consistently apply the close of registration to all avenues, further this additional time will help the GEC to ensure and protect the accuracy of the voter registry.”  Among the other bills: there&#8217;s one that would require write-in names to be published only if the total would impact race results. Another would eliminate the Attorney General and the Public Auditor races from the primary election, because they&#8217;re non-partisan positions.</span></p>

But it’s also rankled voting rights advocates — who fear it could disenfranchise some eligible voters — and deadlocked the bipartisan state clerks association. The bill creates new requirements for first-time voters, proof of citizenship and more. It also would allow state election officials to pay for commercially available data — likely Experian’s TrueTrace — and let county voter registration offices use the information for voter list maintenance. The measure also requires people registering to vote for the first time in person to show proof of residency. If the application doesn’t include the person’s Indiana driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number, additional proof would be needed — a current and valid photo ID or a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or government document that shows their name and address.</span></p>

The bill with the more significant changes of the two,</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=SSB3161"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Study Bill 3161</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would do the following: Limit challenges of petitions of federal candidates to the legal sufficiency of the petition, or the residency, age or citizenship requirements of the candidate. Create a pilot program for a third party to maintain Iowa’s voter database. Ban ranked choice voting. Ban the use of ballot drop boxes in the state. Require that absentee ballots be received by a county auditor’s office the day before the election, and allow the auditor to begin mailing absentee ballots two days earlier. The bill was passed out of a Senate subcommittee by the two Republican members. Democratic Sen. Janice Weiner, of Iowa City, did not vote to advance the bill. Sen. Jason Schultz, R-Schleswig, the chair of the Senate State Government Committee and sponsor of the two bills, said the bill was a “settling of our election procedures” and intended to instill trust in Iowa’s election process.</span></p>

Cherry County Election Commissioner Brittny Longcor said 13 fewer days could make a big difference in mailing absentee ballots and getting them back in time.

This year, she said, several changes have been added to protect gun owners who are walking by or happen to be near a polling station but don’t intend to vote there. There’s also carve-outs for people who leave their guns in the car while they vote. Another exception was added on the House floor.. As the bill has moved through committee, conservative legislators have pushed to allow concealed carry license holders to bring their weapons to the polling station. Until Tuesday, those amendments have failed to gain traction. During the debate, Rep.

The same section is being argued at the Supreme Court.  Chaudhuri’s plan follows a complaint filed in December with the elections board by retired North Carolina attorney Brian Martin, who says the Constitution disqualifies Trump because of his involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection. The board</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-presidential-primary-trump-challenge-4b93259b9779ceb6edc41c6aa5416ca5"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held 4-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that state law didn’t give them the authority to consider a challenge to a presidential candidate being on a primary ballot.</span></p>

Rep.

The measure would ban voters listing candidates for public office in order of preference on their ballots, and election boards from certifying race results determined that way. Roberts said changing the way the state conducts elections would fix an unbroken system. “It has been said that Oklahoma’s election laws are some of the best in the nation,” Roberts said. “Why would we scrap them for another system that relies on computer algorithms to choose the winner?” Rep. Mickey Dollens, D-Oklahoma City, was a vocal proponent of ranked-choice voting at the committee meeting. He said the voting method can save the state money, reduce partisanship in elections and give third-party candidates a fighting chance. He said voters he’s talked to support preference-based voting. Paul Ziriax, the Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary, testified during the committee meeting and backed up Roberts’ concerns. Ziriax said the voting machines the state uses now cannot read ranked-choice ballots and aren’t due to be upgraded for another four to eight years. The measure was approved in committee with a 5-2 vote and can now be heard by the full House.</span></p>

Richard Briggs, R-Knoxville, would require voters who wish to vote absentee to request an absentee ballot at least 10 days before Election Day – up from the current seven-day deadline. The bill would have no impact on qualified medical exemptions. “We’re misleading our voters and people who want to vote for them to think that they can request a ballot on day seven and their vote will be counted,&#8221; Briggs said. &#8220;In reality that&#8217;s just not true.&#8221; If adopted, the bill would take effect on Nov. 6, 2024, so it would not impact any elections taking place this year. Currently, Tennessee absentee voting procedures rely almost entirely on U.S. mail delivery. Once requested by mail, fax, or email, election officials are required to mail absentee ballots to voters. Then voters are required to mail absentee ballots back to their Election Commission via USPS, FedEx, or UPS. Tennessee is one of only a few states that does not allow voters to hand deliver ballots to county election commissions. Briggs noted during the Knoxville mayoral election last year, 90% of the absentee ballots requested on the seventh day before the election were not counted because they were not received by the Election Commission in time to be counted.</span></p>

The pilot project, which allowed municipalities to opt in to use the alternative form of voting, would have run until 2026. Under HB 290, it would end this year. Rep. Katy Hall, R-South Ogden, argued the pilot project was not showing signs of success and there were issues with ranked choice voting. But she faced pushback from some who testified in support of it, including the League of Women Voters of Utah and Salt Lake City Council member Dan Dugan, who was elected in a ranked choice voting election. &#8220;I spoke in opposition to the bill as I believe municipalities should be allowed to make the decision on whether or not to use [ranked choice voting] and to let the pilot program continue,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

It’s one of the closest votes taken so far during this legislative session. The bill will give cities, towns and certain special-purpose districts the option to hold their elections in even-numbered years instead of odd-numbered years. Currently, odd-numbered years are primarily dedicated to local elections, while even-numbered years encompass statewide and national elections alongside certain local measures. This discrepancy often results in lower voter turnout during odd-numbered years, prompting concerns about democratic representation at the local level. Under the proposed bill, jurisdictions wishing to transition to even-numbered-year elections would have the flexibility to do so through various mechanisms. The legislative body of the respective jurisdiction could adopt an ordinance or policy, or alternatively, voters could approve an ordinance or charter amendment referred to by the legislative body. However, any decision to make the switch must be finalized before Jan. 15 of an odd-numbered year to take effect in that election cycle. Lawmakers eliminated a mandate in a previous version that said jurisdictions with voter turnouts below 40% in four consecutive general elections must switch to even-numbered year elections.</span></p>

Two deal with purging inactive voters or voters who’ve moved away from the voter rolls. SB 622 trims the time period for removing inactive voters from eight years to six years. As explained by committee counsel and by Deak Kersey, secretary of state’s general counsel, when a voter is inactive for four years, which would include not voting and not renewing a driver’s license among other things, the county clerk must send out a confirmation notice to the voter. If the card isn’t returned the person goes on inactive status, and after two more federal election cycles of inactivity – another four years – the clerk would then purge that voter from the rolls. The bill would shorten the period the clerk has to wait to send out the confirmation notice to two years. This bill and the other two would all take effect Jan. 1, 2025 – after the current election – if passed into law. SB 624 also deals with purging the rolls and would come into play when the state is up and running with the State-to-State information sharing program. Under the program, when a West Virginia voter acquires a driver’s license in a participating state, that information would be transmitted to West Virginia, allowing purging of the voter from the rolls without the confirmation process. SB 623 requires the Division of Motor Vehicles to send images from a resident’s driver’s license or photo ID to the secretary of state for voter identification purposes. Kersey told the senators that the DMV already sends images of voter signatures to the office, which are sent out to the county clerks. This will give an extra layer of security and can make the poll workers’ jobs easier by giving them an extra form of identification when a signature might be unclear or not match the voter’s signature that day.</span></p>

A separate bill that has bipartisan support would establish a final-five runoff system for the state’s congressional elections. In both systems, voters can rank all the candidates on the ballot or only one. Critics of the systems say the process can be confusing to voters and take a long time to determine a winner. The proponents of the final-five bill in Wisconsin say those problems are limited to straight ranked choice voting, and their system solves those problems.&#8217;</span></p>

The bill’s proponents say it clears up ambiguity around who exactly is qualified to vote in Wyoming. However, some lawmakers argue it represents a solution to a problem Wyoming doesn’t really have. In general, voter fraud in the state is rare, and they say this proposed requirement would be another barrier to voting. Fremont County Clerk Julie Freese said this bill could clear up some misconceptions. It comes as poll workers and election officials have been under increased scrutiny in recent years following attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The new regulation would make people sign an updated oath when registering to vote, but wouldn’t require them to bring physical identification to prove their residency. If a voter lies about the length of their residency when registering, county clerks can refer them to law enforcement, according to Freese.</span></p>

The new suit against Secretary of State Adrian Fontes is the second his office is facing by Republicans complaining about the Elections Procedures Manual issued in December. The manual provides detailed guidance for county officials on how to run elections. State Senate President Warren Petersen and House Speaker Ben Toma sued Fontes on Jan. 31 over five provisions in the manual they say undermine previous Republican &#8220;voter confidence measures.&#8221; The latest lawsuit, filed in Maricopa County Superior Court, adds nine other complaints. &#8220;The new EPM weakens safeguards against non-citizen voting during a time of unprecedented illegal immigration on Arizona’s southern border, unlawfully limits the ability to challenge early ballots, and violates numerous provisions of Arizona law meant to protect election integrity,&#8221; RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who&#8217;s stepping down from her position this month, said in a statement about the lawsuit. A statement by Gina Swoboda, the new chair of the Republican Party of Arizona who previously worked in the Secretary of State’s Office, accuses Fontes of releasing the manual &#8220;at the last second during the holidays&#8221; to avoid scrutiny. Fontes is reviewing the lawsuit, according to spokesman Aaron Thacker. The office declined other comment for now. The office put out a statement after the Jan. 31 lawsuit filing saying Fontes was &#8220;prepared to defend the EPM that was created to provide uniformity and clarity for elections officials, so they can administer free and fair elections for the people of Arizona.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The America First Policy Institute on behalf of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club has sued Secretary of State Adrian Fontes over the most recent iteration of the state’s elections rulebook, specifically on the </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/02/13/new-suit-challenges-az-voting-rulebook-limits-on-drop-box-monitors/72575353007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance on poll watchers and drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The suit alleges its limitations on monitoring ballot drop boxes and polling locations are unconstitutional. Their latest suit argues drop box monitors are protected by the First Amendment. It contends the new voting rulebook aims to &#8220;criminalize&#8221; their conduct. They note their organization is &#8220;interested in observing activities at drop boxes&#8221; and &#8220;conveying a message to others that the drop boxes are being watched and should be watched.&#8221; &#8220;These activities — watching drop boxes, speaking to people at election sites, and photographing activity at election sites — all constitute forms of speech,&#8221; the suit reads.</span></p>

According to SCOTUS Blog, the high court appeared ready to hold that Colorado cannot exclude Trump from the ballot based on his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol. During an oral argument that lasted for more than two hours, justices of all ideological stripes questioned the wisdom of allowing a state to make its own decisions about whether a candidate should appear on the ballot, both because of the effect that such decisions would have on the rest of the country and because of the hurdles that courts would face in reviewing those decisions. A central issue at the oral argument was whether the question of how Section 3’s ban on government service by individuals who have “engaged in insurrection” can be enforced – do states like Colorado have the power to enforce it themselves, as the voters contend, or (as Trump argues) can it only be enforced through laws passed by Congress? There is no way to know when the justices will issue their decision, SCOTUS Blog wrote. The Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling is currently on hold, so Trump will remain on the ballot there unless the justices decide otherwise, but the court is nonetheless likely to act relatively quickly to resolve the issue because of its significance for other states where challenges to his eligibility are pending.</span></p>

Walker previously had ruled that restrictions in Florida’s 2021 election law would have suppressed Black voters, but parts of that decision were overturned by an appellate court and sent back to the Tallahassee judge to reconsider. Often sounding conflicted about how to respond to the appellate court decision, Walker said in his latest ruling that the voting rights groups that had challenged Florida’s election law failed to show that the restrictions on drop boxes unduly burdened voters. The judge also said that restrictions in the law on third-party voter registration groups also failed to be proven unduly burdensome. </span></p>

Under the challenged laws, former residents of Hawaii or other states who live in a foreign country or the Northern Mariana Islands remain free to vote for president by absentee ballot in their former state of residence. But former residents who live in Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other territories cannot. The Borja plaintiffs argue this violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. The hearing was an appeal of a 2022 district court decision denying their claims, according to a press release from Right to Democracy. Neil Weare, co-counsel in the case and co-director of Right to Democracy, which has joined Borja to sue to advance democracy, equity, self-determination in U.S. territories, said the Ninth Circuit has the opportunity to ensure the same legal standards apply to voting in U.S. territories as they do to voting anywhere else. The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by Right to Democracy to advance democracy, equity, and self-determination in U.S. territories.</span></p>

Dick rejected the state House and Senate maps, saying that they violate the Voting Rights Act.  Her ruling comes in the case Nairne v. Ardoin, in which Black voters sued the secretary of state and Republican legislative leaders. The plaintiffs argued the maps unlawfully dilute Black voting strength by gerrymandering the districts to minimize the number of majority-Black House and Senate seats. Dick’s order gives the state a “reasonable period of time” to approve new legislative districts that do not violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.  Dick did not specify in her ruling what a reasonable period of time is or the number of majority Black districts necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Plaintiffs have said the state should add six in the House and three in the Senate. Currently, 28 out of 105 House seats are majority Black, as are 11 of 39 Senate seats. Her ruling also does not specify when the maps need to take effect. One possibility would be 2027, when the next legislative elections are held.</span></p>

The U.S. District Court in Winston-Salem announced this week that Judge Loretta Biggs will convene the nonjury trial starting May 6 over the law, which was implemented just last fall. While the state’s photo ID requirement remains in place for the March 5 primary elections, a spring or summer ruling after the trial by Biggs to strike down the law could threaten its use in the November general election. The May date is about three months later than the date that lawyers for the state NAACP and several local chapters had requested several months ago. They sued over the 2018 law claiming it is marred by racial bias.</span></p>

State House Republicans David Zimmerman and Kathy Rapp sued over a disparity between the Pa. Constitution and the state’s Election Code. Currently, voters use drop-off boxes or return absentee ballots to their county board of elections office. Zimmerman and Rapp argue that all absentee ballots should be returned to the voting district that the voter resides in. Officials then canvas the ballots – the number of ballots received is counted, not the number of votes. After canvassing, ballots from each voting district should be sent to their county office for vote counting, according to the state’s Constitution. However, all Pa. counties follow the state’s Election Code, which states the opposite. Officials canvass and count absentee ballots at their county board of elections office. The lawsuit asks the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania to decide whether election officials should follow the state’s Constitution or the Election Code’s regulations on absentee voting.</span></p>

The three matters targeted in the lawsuit are: Wisconsin’s requirement that returned absentee ballots must be accompanied by a valid witness signature; the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that unmanned absentee ballot drop boxes are illegal; and state law setting an 8 p.m. Election Day deadline for when voters can “cure” or correct errors on their absentee ballots. The plaintiffs in the case argued the rules “infringe upon the fundamental right to vote in violation of the Wisconsin Constitution.” In her decision, Judge Ann Peacock ruled the lawsuit did not meet the “high burden” needed to find the voting rules cited in the lawsuit were unconstitutional. Peacock did not address the legality of absentee ballot drop boxes, noting she leaves “any revisiting of that decision to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.” Elias Law Group later filed notice of an appeal to Peacock’s ruling and last week issued a new request seeking to bypass the Wisconsin Court of Appeals and have the state Supreme Court take up the matter directly.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/real-right-vote-conversation-rick-hasen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Real Right to Vote: A Conversation with Rick Hasen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For many Americans, the freedom to vote is unfairly conditioned on where they live, the color of their skin, or how much money they have. Several amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been passed over the decades extending this fundamental freedom to voters of color, women and citizens who are 18 years of age. However, the lack of an overarching amendment guaranteeing the right to vote leaves our democracy vulnerable because the freedom to vote is treated differently depending on where voters live and how courts handle disputes over their rights.  In his new book, “A Real Right to Vote,” Law Professor Rick Hasen explains why a constitutional amendment is necessary, and why now is the time to begin a campaign in support of such an amendment. As Professor Hasen explains, enshrining voting rights in the Constitution will benefit all Americans, no matter which side of the political aisle they sit on.   In discussion with Campaign Legal Center President Trevor Potter, Professor Hasen will describe his vision for the freedoms an amendment on voting rights would protect, its potential impact on our democracy, and why he believes it’s possible to pass such an amendment, despite a challenging political climate. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 29, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
