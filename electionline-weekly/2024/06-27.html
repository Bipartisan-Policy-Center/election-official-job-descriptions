							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note</strong>: electionlineWeekly will not publish on July 4. The next edition will be July 11. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CEIR Focus Brief </strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Responding to Deluge of Public Records Requests Aimed at Election Officials</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Kyle Yoder, April Tan, and Christopher Mann<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024A/bills/2024a_1296_01.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new Colorado law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that clarifies reasonable response times for public records requests in the heart of an election cycle is the most recent attempt by a state to protect the time and energy of election officials from an overwhelming and often misinformed flood of such requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado County Clerks Association Executive Director Matt Crane, whose organization urged passage of the law, called the tactic of inundating officials with records requests “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/09/11/trump-election-deniers-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a denial-of-service attack on local government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” referring to an attempt to shut down a system by overwhelming its resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public records requests are vital for government transparency. But recent years have seen a sharp increase in the proportion of requests directed at election officials that are frivolous, based on misinformation, or intentionally burdensome, leading to a significant diversion of resources and time from crucial election administration tasks.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/public-records-requests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Focus Brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CEIR) identifies four types of legislative responses to this challenge enacted or considered by states since the 2020 general election:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing all election-related records requests at the state level, relieving local offices of this responsibility.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating election records into publicly searchable databases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granting officials greater power to challenge or deny clearly frivolous or burdensome requests.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarifying what constitutes a reasonable effort in fulfilling requests.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9826" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The states taking or considering these actions are varied both politically and in actions taken. In 2023,</span><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5459&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Washington State</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required that all requests for records from the statewide voter registration database be made to and fulfilled by the secretary of state, relieving local offices of an unsustainable burden. Hawaii, Kansas, Michigan, and New York all considered bills in their 2024 legislative sessions that would consolidate elections records into free, publicly accessible databases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several legislatures have given election officials greater latitude to distinguish between good faith and bad faith requests. Maryland, New Jersey, and Tennessee have moved to permit government officials to challenge or deny requests under certain circumstances.</span><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Laws/StatuteText?article=ggp&amp;section=4-1B-04&amp;enactments=false"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permits the State Public Information Act Compliance Board to consider the requester’s pattern or history of requests when resolving complaints related to alleged frivolous or bad faith requests. Similarly, in</span><a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0135&amp;ga=112"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if an individual makes repeated requests for public records “with the intent to disrupt government operations,” officials overseeing such records are authorized to petition a court to prevent that person from making requests for up to one year. As of June 14, 2024, at least two states—New York and Pennsylvania—have considered but not enacted bills in their 2024 legislative session that would create similar pathways for relief.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/files/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/SB270-int.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title74/t74ch1/sect74-103/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/112/Fiscal/SB1682.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have joined Colorado in clarifying what constitutes a reasonable effort by a government office to fulfill a public records request. A new Alabama law that takes effect on October 1, 2024, specifies that public officers are not required to respond to a public records request that is vague, overly broad, or unreasonable in scope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to studying the state-level response to the problem, the CEIR Focus Brief underscores the significant negative impact of overwhelming records requests. In Wake County, North Carolina, officials</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/9/15/23874134/celia-nabor-maricopa-county-arizona-election-fraud-signature-verification-public-records/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported a sevenfold increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the number of election-related records requests received from 2020 to 2022, requiring a budget increase to hire a new staff member dedicated to processing incoming requests. In 2022, the elections department of Maricopa County, Arizona dedicated nearly half its staff for four days to</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pro-trump-activists-swamp-election-officials-with-sprawling-records-requests-2022-08-03/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sorting and scanning 20,000 documents to fulfill a single request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—time taken from the many tasks of election administration in a large, complex county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By considering strategies like these, states can help election officials maintain fair and efficient elections while still upholding transparency and accountability for the 2024 general election and beyond. “It gives county officials some much-needed peace of mind,” said Matt Clark of the new Colorado law. “Now they have more time to respond, which helps them maintain focus on conducting elections.”</span></p>

While there were isolated problems in some places there were no major issues in Colorado, New York, South Carolina or Utah. <strong>Colorado</strong>: With many Coloradans voting by mail and overall turnout light regardless of the mode of casting a ballot, it was a fairly quiet Tuesday in The Centennial State. One Colorado Public Radio reporter noted that when they were outside an </span><a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/06/25/colorado-primary-election-2024-live-blog-results-updates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote center they could hear the elections workers inside playing an elections trivia game. The Oak Ridge fire forced the closure of one </span><a href="https://www.kktv.com/2024/06/25/oak-ridge-fire-forces-ballot-box-closure-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pueblo County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot box. The Beulah General Store ballot dropbox shut down at 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday because of the Oak Ridge Fire.  County officials asked Beulah residents to use a drop box in Pueblo instead. <strong>New York</strong>: Some voters received a text message from an advocacy group that included </span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2024/06/24/n-y--officials-warn-voters-of-scam-text-messages-ahead-of-primary-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorrect information about polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a news release, the New York State Board of Elections said voters across the state have been receiving “unsolicited text messages in recent days from an outside group” that include the misinformation. “The State Board would like to remind voters that the best place to get information about elections and voting is directly from the New York State Board of Elections and the County Boards of Elections,” the release said. In </span><a href="https://westchester.news12.com/voting-issues-reported-at-scarsdale-polling-sites"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westchester County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Scarsdale voters experienced delays and confusion at two polling sites on Tuesday, according to reports. The Board of Elections confirmed that bags containing ballots were mistakenly delivered to the wrong locations. In </span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/news/2024/06/26/the-monroe-county-board-of-elections-responds-to-concerns-about-its-primary-night-election-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monroe County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some candidates expressed concerns about the election night process. <strong>Utah</strong>: </span><a href="https://ksltv.com/656802/data-shows-most-utah-county-voters-didnt-mail-ballots-turnout-rates-differed-slightly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faced controversy after the decision was made in January not to pay for return postage for mail ballots. Both sides of the postage stamp debate thought the decision would have a much larger impact on voter turnout, but projections show it’s a little less than 2 percentage points higher than the last primary election. Still, Utah County Clerk Aaron Davidson considers it a win. “It was a success for as far as I’m concerned,” he said. There were no reports of any threatening behavior on Tuesday. Volunteer workers in </span><a href="https://ksltv.com/656598/utah-election-volunteers-say-they-havent-seen-threats-during-primaries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salt Lake County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tell KSL TV they haven’t experienced threats or anything too alarming so far, but they have seen more online bullying and skepticism from voters. “It can be very demoralizing to see some of what the trolls put online,” said Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman. It isn’t always a bad thing, however. Chapman says she’s watched Utahns become more involved by showing up to observe and understand how the process works.</span></p>

We are immensely proud of the systems change work we have led; the collaborative team we have helped build; and the knowledge we have co-created about the impact of young people as voters and leaders. We’re so gratified by all that CIRCLE has accomplished together with our partners, the CIRCLE advisory board, and the many colleagues and stakeholders who have joined us to support and situate young people as important actors in democracy. Though it may seem a bit unorthodox, we are transitioning out together so that two new, strong leaders committed to the resilience of youth-focused fields and accessible research, can take the organization to even greater heights. These new leaders will join an extraordinary team that has already spent years together conducting impactful work—and will continue to do so into the future. Their collective commitment to CIRCLE’s mission and values inspires us. We are announcing our departure now, months before we plan to depart, so that we have plenty of time to continue to prepare the organization and support a smooth transition. The process to identify new CIRCLE leaders has already begun, and a national search will begin fully next month. We will both spend these final months here overseeing CIRCLE’s work during this pivotal election cycle and guiding a successful transition. We are thankful to our team at CIRCLE, and at Tisch College and Tufts University, especially our Dean Dayna Cunningham and Associate Dean Peter Levine, who previously directed CIRCLE, for their ongoing support and leadership throughout that process. We’re also immensely grateful and indebted to many other colleagues and friends, past and present, who are too numerous to name now but who we have learned, strategized, and advocated with over many years. It has been an honor to stand with you.”</span></p>

The Electoral Board is assigned two youth representatives through an initiative of local nonprofit Citizens for a Better City (CBC), and this year’s representatives were students Megan Carpenter and Preston Lieu. The Electoral Board discussed with Carpenter and Lieu running a sticker contest in the schools, and they enthusiastically agreed and began advertising in the schools. The contest received 12 submissions from six middle- and high-school students. The Electoral Board and the Youth Reps then made a selection of the top five submissions and sent them out to the student body for a vote. Out of 150 ballots cast, Miller’s design won with 88 votes. Second and third place submissions received 26 and 17 votes, respectively. Miller’s design will be made into the official “I Voted” stickers that will be available in the Office of Elections at City Hall starting Friday, September 20 (the first day of early voting for the November 5 Presidential Election).

She was 70. Clem is remembered for leading voters through voting system changes, recounts and hanging chads in the 2000 presidential election. &#8220;She enjoyed everything she was doing,&#8221; said her husband of 37 years. Elections Supervisor Leslie Swan agreed, &#8220;she had such a great sense of humor, and she had a great laugh.&#8221; Clem was elected to the elections supervisor position in 1996, and she remained in office for 14 years. In 2010, she resigned for health reasons, her husband said. She led the county through three different voting changes, Swan said: In 2000, voters cast ballots with a punch card, choosing candidates by punching a perforated box. This led to the infamous &#8220;hanging chads&#8221; — caused by an incomplete punch that incorrectly recorded a person&#8217;s vote. During the 2000 presidential election, ballots with hanging chads were recounted by hand. In 2002, the county moved to a touchscreen voting method in which ballots were cast when the voters selected choices on a touchscreen. In 2008, the county changed again to an optical scan system, similar to how votes are cast today, Swan said. Clem also was instrumental in changing over to a statewide voter registration database in 2006, Swan said. It was through her daughters that Clem met — and hired — Swan to work in the elections office in 2004.</span></p>

Measure 26-228 revised the city’s charter, expanding the number of City Council members from four to twelve and electing them in four multi-member districts rather than at-large districts. Additionally, it introduced ranked choice voting and a professional city administrator. These changes aimed to diversify representation and ensure a more equitable distribution of power across the city. “These reforms were both significant and surprising, representing the city’s most fundamental changes in over a century,” note Max Kiefel, Nick Chedli Carter, and Archon Fung in a newly published case study examining Portland’s innovative approach to charter reform. Using articles, meeting minutes, reports, and interviews, Kiefel, Carter, and Fung<a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/how-portland-oregon-embraced-voting-reform-and-democratic-innovation/"> document the reform process for scholars, elected officials, and advocates</a> while seeking to answer the question: why now? Between 1907 and 2007, there were at least seven ballot initiatives aimed at reforming Portland’s commission governance structure. They all failed, often focusing more on consolidating mayoral power rather than improving democratic processes. “Why then, in 2022, was voting representation and democratic reform firmly on the agenda, and did this contribute to Portland finally voting for change?” ask the authors.</span></p>

Summer Lee (D-Pennsylvania) this week introduced a new bill that would create a statutory right to vote in federal elections, in an effort to curb the growing number of state-level voting that restrict voting and access to voting. </span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/rep-summer-lee-introduces-legislation-to-create-right-to-vote-in-federal-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Right to Vote Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow Americans to challenge in court “any policy that unduly restricts ballot access,” and make it more difficult for states to implement policies that make it harder to participate in elections. The bill was announced on the eighth anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which removed the requirement for  states to have their election changes pre-approved by the federal government, to ensure they don’t hurt minority voting. The court ruled that the formula the Voting Rights Act used to determine which jurisdictions needed pre-clearance was unconstitutional. The legislation would establish the first-ever affirmative federal voting rights guarantee, “ensuring every citizen may exercise their fundamental right to cast a ballot,” Lee’s office said in a statement. It would prohibit state and local governments from restricting voting access in federal elections, to prevent state governments from enacting laws that diminish or substantially impair the ability to vote; and would expedite judicial review to protect citizens’ voting rights. U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) introduced a Senate version of the</span><a href="https://www.ossoff.senate.gov/press-releases/watch-sen-ossoff-introduces-legislation-establishing-first-ever-statutory-federal-right-to-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill in March.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It has the support of eight senate colleagues and 25 members of the House.</span></p>

Monique Limón would have changed the current “opt-out” system of voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles to one where someone applying for a driver’s license or ID would be automatically registered if eligible and notified after — a system in place in 11 other states.  The bill was amended to take a step back, and instead just allow the Secretary of State to create a list of people “preapproved for registration” — those of voting age who have provided the DMV with proof of citizenship.  There are no details yet on what the trigger would be to move people on this proposed list to the rolls of registered voters, but it would require the person to take “some action to acknowledge and confirm their registration,” according to Neal Ubriani, policy and research director for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Responsive Government, the group behind the effort in other states. That addressed one concern expressed by elections committee Chairperson Gail Pellerin and opponents. Limón said passing the bill would allow stakeholders to develop that process. The committee passed the bill on a 5-0 vote.  “I do believe the author and I and all the groups in support and opposition all have the same goal: To improve voter registration for all Californians,” Pellerin, a Democrat from Santa Cruz, said in her recommendation to support the bill.</span></p>

That comes after the Idaho Legislature in March widely approved House Joint Resolution 5, with only 12 votes against it and 91 votes in support across the Idaho House and Senate. “No person who is not a citizen of the United States shall be a qualified elector in any election held within the state of Idaho,” the resolution says. The Idaho Constitution already lists U.S. citizenship as a qualification to be a qualified elector. The Legislative Council — a committee of legislative leaders — approved ballot language for the constitutional amendment. The council will submit the language to the Secretary of State’s Office, a spokeswoman for the office said, and the office will publish the language in several newspapers and its voter pamphlet that is sent to all Idaho voters before the November election. The vote by the council largely accepted ballot language drafted by the Legislature’s research arm, the Legislative Services Office. That includes statements in support of and against the amendment.</span></p>

State Senator Jeremy England (R)</span><a href="https://vicksburgnews.com/week-10-statehouse-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authored SB 2144</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed during the 2024 session and changed the runoff period. The legislation, which went to conference, passed the House by a vote of 118-1 and the Senate by 50-1. Governor Tate Reeves (R) signed the bill, with an effective date of July 1. England told Magnolia Tribune that the primary reason for moving runoff elections from three weeks to four was to give Circuit Clerks and election officials more time to prepare properly for a runoff. “In Mississippi, results must be certified within 10 days after Election Day,” England explained. “That leaves only 11 days before the runoff. Clerks’ offices also have to open for two Saturdays before an election. This has always been a difficult time crunch. It was made worse with the move to paper ballots.” He said many of the people who handle elections in the state requested moving runoff elections back a week. This includes the Secretary of State’s office and associations for the County Circuit Clerks and Election Commissioners.</span></p>

Kathy Hochul’s desk that would authorize </span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/politics/2024/06/20/bill-authorizes-absentee-drop-boxes-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop boxes </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for absentee ballots. Supporters say it will increase access to voting, but opponents say they are concerned it will encourage voter fraud. Co-sponsor state Assemblymember Tony Simone told Spectrum News 1 that in each election, thousands of votes aren’t counted because of issues stemming from absentee ballots. The boxes would only be used for absentee ballots, and they would be optional for each county Board of Elections to decide whether or not to use. Sen. George Borrello said that making it easier to vote isn’t worth what he described as an increased opportunity for fraud. Even if there isn’t fraud, and there isn’t evidence that widespread fraud related to drop boxes elsewhere has taken place, he stressed that the perception there could be issues takes a toll. “It undermines the foundation of our republic, and it’s not something that makes for a healthy representative democracy,” he said.</span></p>

According to The Associated Press, GOP senators are trying to advance the legislation quickly as an indefinite recess looms over the General Assembly due to budget negotiations. The bills — which passed a Senate elections committee on June 20 — deal with artificial intelligence in political advertisements, absentee ballot challenges and signature verification — as well as the three amendment proposals that could appear on ballots this fall. The proposed constitutional amendments would cover citizens-only voting, voter ID laws and income taxes. If the amendment projects are successfully enacted by the legislature, voters can cast their ballot for or against the referendums in November, making them law with a simple majority of votes. The first amendment — which also was proposed by House Republicans earlier this month — clarifies that only U.S. citizens who are at least 18 years old and meet other qualifications &#8220;shall be entitled to vote at any election.&#8221; The Constitution originally stated that everyone who is born in the U.S. or was naturalized as a citizen can vote.The second amendment states that all types of voting in North Carolina require photo identification, whereas the state constitution previously only specified in-person voting. Similarly to the citizens-only voting, photo ID is already required for all voting types in the state. </span></p>

By a 6-3 vote, the justices threw out lower-court rulings that favored Louisiana, Missouri and other parties in their claims that officials in the Democratic administration leaned on the social media platforms to unconstitutionally squelch conservative points of view. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the court that the states and other parties did not have the legal right, or standing, to sue. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented. The states had argued that White House communications staffers, the surgeon general, the FBI and the U.S. cybersecurity agency are among those who applied “unrelenting pressure” to coerce changes in online content on social media platforms. The justices appeared broadly skeptical of those claims during arguments in March and several worried that common interactions between government officials and the platforms could be affected by a ruling for the states. The justices did not weigh in on the substance of the states’ claims or the administration’s response in their decision. “We begin — and end — with standing,” Barrett wrote. “At this stage, neither the individual nor the state plaintiffs have established standing to seek an injunction against any defendant. We therefore lack jurisdiction to reach the merits of the dispute.” In dissent, Alito wrote that the states amply demonstrated their right to sue. “For months, high-ranking government officials placed unrelenting pressure on Facebook to suppress Americans’ free speech.

The 11th Circuit ruled that although Alabama does have to release information to nonprofit groups, it does not have to do so in a way that is accessible or cost effective for those groups. In 2022, Greater Birmingham Ministries — a nonprofit civil rights organization — filed this lawsuit against former Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) due to his refusal to produce records of voters who were purged after the 2020 election and voter registration applicants who were denied registration or purged from the state’s voter rolls because of felony convictions dating back at least two years.  Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Merrill refused to produce the requested voter purge records without payment of over $1,000 and also refused to produce the felony records altogether, claiming that they were “outside the scope” of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). In 2022, the trial court issued an opinion in favor of the plaintiff on all claims and ordered the Alabama secretary of state to produce all of the records requested by the plaintiff in digital form. Greater Birmingham Ministries was able to gain access to the purged voter records, but the Republican secretary of state appealed and  the 11th Circuit reversed that opinion today. As a result of the opinion, nonprofit organizations  will retain the ability to have access to purged voter information, but they will not be able to get that information electronically. Additionally, the court is now allowing the Alabama secretary of state to impose a fee that is greater than the cost of producing the records. As the dissent by</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/voting-rights-attorney-nancy-abudu-confirmed-to-11th-u-s-circuit-court-of-appeals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting rights attorney Judge Nancy Abudu points out, this can be a “cost-prohibitive” barrier to groups doing important pro-democracy work.</span></p>

In</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24774817-240621-court-order-in-ahe-v-apoc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 54-page order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hartz upheld almost all fines issued in January by the state’s campaign finance regulator and concluded that Alaska’s “true source” disclosure laws apply to ballot measures.  Those laws state that if a nonprofit contributes to a political campaign, it must reveal the names of its donors, the true source of the money. Hartz said one fine, levied for the misreporting of $2,358 in cash contributions, may not have been warranted and remanded the issue back to state regulators. That was a small aspect of the overall case, which involved more than $94,000 in fines levied by the Alaska Public Offices Commission against groups and individuals who backed a ballot measure that seeks to eliminate both ranked choice voting and the state’s open primary, which places all candidates — regardless of party — into a single election for each office. The repeal measure is slated for the November general election. A separate lawsuit has challenged the signature-gathering process used to put it on the ballot.</span></p>

He is in custody and won’t be released unless a court order allows, according to court documents. Ringfield told detectives during his arrest that he took the fob for 20 minutes the day before and then gave it back. But detectives located the fob in his house after obtaining a search warrant. His motive for taking it was unclear, but he suggested to detectives that it may have been a mistake. “Walter said the job was temporary and he was trying to make it permanent, so he wanted to clean up,” the report states, providing no further explanation. Ringfield could not immediately be reached for comment. Ringfield started on June 3 as a temporary election worker for the tabulation center. He had previously been charged with theft after an incident in July 2023, but he entered a diversion program and was not convicted, according to county court records. Maricopa County spokesperson Jennifer Liewer said that the county conducted a background check on him before hiring him, and that no convictions were found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet another attempt from Kari Lake and Mark Finchem to </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/06/25/another-attempt-by-lake-and-finchem-to-revive-their-tabulator-case-was-dismissed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revive a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sought to ban the use of electronic ballot tabulators in Arizona’s most populous counties has been dismissed by a federal appeals court.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on June 20 issued</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24776673/appeal-denied.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a two-sentence ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying without further explanation that it would not take up the case a second time. Lake, a Republican U.S. Senate hopeful, and Finchem, a former state representative who is now running for Arizona Senate, have been shot down at every turn since they first filed the suit in April 2022. In the tabulator suit, Lake and Finchem alleged that the electronic ballot tabulators used to count ballots in Maricopa and Pima counties — and required to be used by Arizona law — were “hackable” and that the courts should place an injunction on their use ahead of the November 2022 election. In August 2022, U.S. District Court Judge John Tuchi threw out the case and issued a scathing ruling. Later, he ordered the attorneys representing Lake and Finchem to pay $122,000 in sanctions because their claims amounted to mere “conjectural allegations of potential injuries.” In October 2023, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with Tuchi’s decision to throw out the case, agreeing that it was “frivolous.”  Lake and Finchem again tried to revive their case in March when they petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and overrule the lower courts, but about a month later, the highest court in the nation declined to take up the case. In their June 13 filing, Lake and Finchem asked the federal appeals court — for a second time — to reverse the lower court’s decision to dismiss the case. This time, Olsen asked the appeals court to send the case back to the trial court because, he alleged, Maricopa County’s attorneys had misled the trial court, the Supreme Court and the appeals court.</span></p>

Former candidate Laura Hobbs sued the county elections office and her winning opponent Allen Long, shortly after she lost the March 5 primary. She has alleged, among other things, that her name being placed in the incorrect order on the ballot affected the election outcome.  Attorney Christopher Pisano, who represented the county, acknowledged early on in the case that the Elections Office had made a mistake in how names on the ballot were ordered. But, Pisano argued, the simple clerical error was neither evidence of mal-conduct by elections staff, nor a reason to invalidate the election outcome. Baker agreed, saying that Hobbs’ attorney, Alex Haberbush, had failed to offer any expert witness testimony to attempt to prove that the mistake made by the Elections Office changed the outcome of the election. He asked Haberbush how he could possibly expect to prove his case without such testimony. In a statement that accompanied his ruling, Baker issued a definitive rebuke against Hobbs and her attorney, saying that evidence presented in the case was “ill-defined, vague, full of irregularities and lacking in foundation.” In fact, the only qualified elections expert interviewed during the case at all, Baker said, was the acting County Clerk and Registrar of Voters herself, Joanna Francescut, who faced hours of questions that he referred to as “argumentative”, “misleading” and “undignified.”</span></p>

She has not,” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Scott Matheson, in an 18-page opinion. “She has made no argument that state law clearly bars her from raising her claims.” Prosecutors say in April and May 2021 Peters allowed unauthorized individuals to access voting equipment during a sensitive security update and leaked voting machine passwords to a social media site. Peters faces three felony counts of attempting to influence a public servant; four felony counts related to impersonation and identity theft; and a misdemeanor count each of official misconduct, violating her duties and failing to comply with the secretary of state’s requirements.</span></p>

The group’s claims, however, appear to contradict facts about how the state’s voting systems work, reflecting what one election expert suggested is a “gross misunderstanding of election law.” Much of the information in the suit comes from groups with histories of making false claims about the state’s voter rolls, and the suit includes at least one easily disproved claim. The lawsuit is part of a broader strategy that the lead plaintiff, United Sovereign Americans, has acknowledged: to challenge voter rolls across the country, in separate federal court jurisdictions, to force the issue up to the U.S. Supreme Court in time to affect the 2024 general election. The group filed a similar suit in Maryland that was dismissed in May because the plaintiffs didn’t have legal grounds to sue.

Senate Bill 1, or the Election Integrity Protection Act of 2021, modified policies for early voting, voting by mail and voter assistance. It also made changes to election-related criminal statutes, and added new ones — for instance, making it a crime for an election officer to refuse to turn away a poll watcher. Three groups of plaintiffs updated their complaints to include Ogg as a defendant after after a the Fifth Circuit found in a 2022 ruling in State v. Stephens that another law, which granted the Texas attorney general unilateral authority to prosecute election law violations, went against the state’s constitution. Ogg argued she had sovereign immunity from prosecution in this case, but the lower court denied her motion to dismiss the whole case against her on that basis. Instead, a federal judge allowed the challenges to the criminal provisions of SB 1 to continue, and found that Ogg did not have immunity from those specific challenges, citing a 1908 Supreme Court case, Ex parte Young, as the basis for an exception to Ogg’s claim of sovereign immunity. A three-judge panel reversed parts of the that decision and vacated others,</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fifth-circuit-kim-ogg-immunity.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the plaintiffs “failed to demonstrate an adequate enforcement connection between Ogg and the challenged provisions of [SB 1] for Ex parte Young to apply.”</span></p>

Mitchell’s order came in a lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Wisconsin, the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and four voters with disabilities. The lawsuit alleges that the current absentee voting system discriminates against voters with disabilities such as blindness because they can’t cast their ballots without assistance under the current rules, violating the right to cast a secret ballot. Mitchell issued the temporary injunction, ordering the Wisconsin Elections Commission to “facilitate the availability of electronically delivered (i.e., emailed) accessible absentee ballots for the November 2024 general election for absent electors who self-certify to having a print disability and who request from their municipal clerk an electronically delivered absentee ballot in lieu of mailing.” The emailed ballots must be able to be read and marked electronically using assistive technology such as a screen reader.  Despite a request from the groups bringing the lawsuit that ballots be allowed to be returned electronically as well, the completed absentee ballots will still need to be printed and mailed back to voters’ municipal clerks, with Mitchell writing that the order “shall not be construed to permit electronic return of a marked absentee ballot.”</span></p>
