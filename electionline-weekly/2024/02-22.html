														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Election Science and Election Administration Research Frontier</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Small Update from the Big Easy</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/paul-gronke/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Gronke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.pdx.edu/center-for-public-service/tribal-government/tribal-government/visit/nonprofit-institute/visit/profile/paul-manson"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Manson</span></a><br />
<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Since 2014, researchers working in election science and election administration have been organizing a “conference within a conference” (CwC) at the </span><a href="https://spsa.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern Political Science Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SPSA) meeting each year. The CwC format allows scholars to organize thematic panels and roundtable discussions. This provides a supportive and collaborative setting to share new research and to help grow the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s conference took place in New Orleans in January and had eight panels, 33 papers, and one roundtable. It showed the growth and vitality in this critical research area. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sysilviakim.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seo-Young Silvia Kim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sogang University) and </span><a href="https://yimeng-li.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yimeng Li</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Florida State University) organized the CwC. Silvia and Yimeng are both recent PhDs from Catech, who worked with </span><a href="https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/r-michael-alvarez"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R. Michael Alvarez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who continues to develop and place superb scholars. They are all co-authors, along with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadamsco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas Adams-Cohen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, of a recent book titled </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/securing-american-elections/44DB59AB97CD8538ABCC6AD0AD00CCF4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing Elections: How Data-Driven Monitoring Can Improve Our Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CwC at SPSA functions in many ways as a complement to the summer </span><a href="https://esra-conference.org/2024-conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Science, Reform, and Administration (ESRA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conference, being held on May 16-17 in Los Angeles. ESRA is increasingly becoming the “public face” of election science research. The CwC is open to anyone who pays the SPSA conference fee – and the conference has benefitted from participation by practitioners and other stakeholders outside of academia who have included: </span><a href="https://nevadacountyca.gov/241/Meet-the-Clerk---Recorder"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie Adona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Nevada County, CA), </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathercreek/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather Creek, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Democracy Fund), </span><a href="https://twitter.com/kammi_foote?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kammi Foote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (U.S. Election Assistance Program), </span><a href="https://www.magentasage.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Shafer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EVIC and Magenta Sage Strategies), and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-stafford-92877999/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Stafford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CISA and formerly Escambia County, FL). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SPSA retains the trappings of a traditional academic conference, full of complex equations and UTC (unreadable tables of coefficients). It’s important to keep this space for many scholars whose primary focus needs to be on producing academic research publications and who may be unfamiliar with public engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5781" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />On the other hand, the Election Administration CwC provides a valuable lens into where political scientists are focusing their research lenses. Thanks to Mindy Moretti and electionline for generously allowing us to share some of this important work with this broader readership who may be interested in the cutting edge of political science research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silvia and Yimeng did a fantastic job and we ended up with nine panels over a day and a half. The full program for the CwC is available here: </span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/tinyurl.com/spsa-cwc-2024__;!!PhOWcWs!1YHlaoAvL-r6iLagcwWttwPuT1Wwqzm29xGrfP-95ulKBB35N_jo9TFaGli5OHso6o50m-iFmQ3DK1H8UBTSe2RH$"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://tinyurl.com/spsa-cwc-2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we encourage folks to review those topics to get an overview of the event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of this article focuses on what we think are three panels and papers that will be of interest to electionline readers, but there are many others that we could have written about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Policing the Vote: A Comparative Case Study of Election Integrity Units in Florida and Ohio</strong>. </span><a href="https://pa.fiu.edu/about-us/people/full-time-faculty/profiles/amanda-clark1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Clark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-bustinza/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monica A. Bustinza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://allvotingislocal.org/our-team/nicholas-martinez/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas Martinez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This paper provided a first look at two “election integrity” units which were created after the 2020 election, exploring the legal framework that established the units, how these oversight boards were constituted, and how the units have operated. What was most interesting about this research is what the team could not find about these agencies – getting basic information on things like budgets and staffing proved to be quite difficult. The authors closed with a provocative question: what does it mean to create an organization with a mission that may be unattainable – finding lots of fraud that may not exist – and what do these kinds of organizations do with their time and resources? As those who study organizations know, these entities rarely chose to stop existing and instead look to pivot to ensure ongoing survival! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be an intriguing project to follow as the team collects more information and tracks these units through 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>No Home, No Voter Registration: A Case Study of Homeless Registration in Wake County, North Carolina</strong>. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/epuzikova"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elena Puzikova</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://election.lab.ufl.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael McDonald.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A fascinating and creative paper that explores the voter registration challenges faced by individuals lacking a permanent address. The research was motivated by a feature of the North Carolina law where anyone who registers by mail needs to be able to receive a second mailing that serves to confirm their voter registration. The researchers geocoded known shelter addresses in Wake County, NC, and were able to compare registration success in the general population and among those whose application came from a shelter. The results were stark–registration success exceeded 80% overall, but was around 20% from the shelter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This paper has obvious implications for any election official who is interested in helping eligible citizens from a vulnerable segment of the population successfully register. In light of the challenges of houselessness in America, this is a pressing area for research and practice!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is especially impressive is that the project was started by Elena when she was a junior in Michael’s undergraduate Election Science course, and Elena is now working toward her BA at Florida. </span></p>
<p><strong>Voter Files, List Maintenance, and Measurement in Elections Data and Surveys<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third featured research findings come from a full panel – CwC Panel #3 – and it shows how much information is contained in voter registration files and how creative scholars can use their research skills to answer policy questions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044810"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moved Out, Moved On: Assessing the Effectiveness of Voter Registration List Maintenance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="https://www.pores.upenn.edu/people/stephen-pettigrew"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Pettigrew</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/charles-stewart-iii"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Stewart III</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examined the ebbs and flows of voter registration files, and what changes in the files really matter. The paper is a great resource for reporters and other media actors, to help them understand the ins and outs of registration file maintenance and avoid reporting on misleading comparisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switchers or New Registrants? Analyzing Trends in Vote Method Usage by </span><a href="https://www.bernardfraga.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernard Fraga</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://sysilviakim.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silvia Kim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> builds upon their </span><a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/learning-from-elections/research-grants"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEDSL funded research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that uses historical voter file data to help understand changing levels of Election Day, early in-person, and voting by mail in a number of states, and whether or not changes are driven by new voters or voters who change their method of voting. The outcome of this research would be valuable to election administrators who are trying to predict usage rates and allocate resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Voter Registration Files to Sample and Contact Voters by </span><a href="https://coss.fsu.edu/polisci/faculty/lonna-atkeson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lonna Atkeson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://yimeng-li.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yimeng Li</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other researchers at the </span><a href="https://lci.fsu.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LeRoy Collins Institute, Florida State University.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This paper is focused on the survey research community, and compares the accuracy of using voter registration files vs. other methods for conducting an online survey. Using data from surveys they conducted in Florida in 2020 and 2022, they show how different data sources can miss different categories of voters, and how statistical sampling weights can adjust for these differences. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any review of the CwC in New Orleans, however, would not be complete without a shout out to </span><a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derek Willis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, now at the </span><a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Merrill School of Journalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, University of Maryland. Many may know Derek from his time at </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProPublica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his working as founder of </span><a href="http://openelections.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derek has many friends, one of whom operates the renowned </span><a href="https://www.nolitanola.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nolita Bakery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in New Orleans. Our final afternoon of panels were enlivened by a wonderful King Cake, and rumor has it that Silvia even found the baby! </span></p>

At presstime, nearly 20,000 Michiganders, including </span><a href="https://www.whmi.com/news/article/sos-benson-among-6500-michigan-voters-to-cast-ballot-early"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, had </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/secretary-of-state-reports-more-than-18k-michiganders-voted-early-in-person/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken advantage of the new system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Secretary Benson says she was proud to cast her vote along with over 6,500 voters statewide who chose to participate in Michigan&#8217;s first day of early voting. Benson said, “All across the state, thousands of clerks and election workers ensured the historic day was a success.”While some elections officials did express concerns about the costs associated with early voting, there were no reports of problems through Feb. 21. “As election officials, our priority number one is the accuracy and integrity of the system itself,”  </span><a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/early-voting-significant-new-option-voters-significant-challenge-clerks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ottawa County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Justin Roebuck said. “Sometimes, when you inject a lot of changes into a system, that can be really challenging.” Despite the heavy lift, Roebuck said he’s “confident that we’re there” after weeks of training election workers and prepping for the shift. He views early voting as a good thing for election security and for boosting the confidence of voters who want to vote before Election Day, but also want to “actually watch the ballot go through.” In </span><a href="https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2024/02/19/poll-workers-report-quiet-start-early-voting-delta-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not only was early voting new, but so was the equipment. Four election workers were onsite to help voters through the early voting process. Election workers said by the end of the day, only one voter from Precinct 1 had come in to vote, 14 from Precinct 2 and out of Delta County’s more than 32,000 registered voters, only 43 have taken advantage of early voting since it started this past Saturday. “It’s a learning experience for all of us,” Election Worker George Kulik said. “It’s more electronic now, because of everything we have to do that’s connected into the state through the laptops and printing the ballots and everything,” Kulik said. “So, it’s a little bit more involved than what it used to be.” In </span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2024/02/mayor-kicks-off-early-voting-in-ann-arbor-heres-how-it-works-with-new-ballot-on-demand.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Arbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mayor Christopher Taylor had the honor of casting the first ballot at city hall as voting began at 8 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 17, with Mayor Pro Tem Travis Radina right behind him. “It was super easy,” Taylor said after going through a new “ballot on demand” process where a ballot is freshly printed for each voter based on their precinct and political party.

Given the widespread use of National Change of Address data to inform voter file list maintenance, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission has produced a memo that provides</span><a href="https://eac.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/NCOA_Memo_Final_508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> best practices to keep voters’ address information current</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the EAC, while most voters will still be able to use the USPS’ change of address service, those unable to provide identity verification will no longer be eligible. Consider the following additional best practices to keep voters’ address information current: Utilize all available sources to update voter addresses allowable by law;  Provide your local post office(s) with voter registration forms; Remind voters about address updates in voter-facing materials; Include information about the need for address updates in voter mailings or other communication; Utilize the USPS’ Address Correction Service (ACS); and Regularly review incoming data to check for unexpected changes.</span></p>

He had respect from fellow officials from both parties, including election administrator Alan Farley, a Republican who had support from Taylor to serve in the full-time job to oversee county elections. &#8220;Johnny Taylor was a good man,&#8221; Farley said. &#8220;He cared about voters.&#8221; Farley recalled serving as a Republican-appointed election commissioner in 1991 to 2002 when Taylor was chairman. &#8220;I always found him to look out for what was best for the electoral process and not what could gain an advantage for a political party,&#8221; said Farley, adding that Taylor served on the Election Commission for more than 30 years until 2019. &#8220;He was the longest serving chairman in the Election Commission history from what I&#8217;ve been able to find.&#8221;</span></p>

Michael Carbone, would basically ban the state’s no-excuse early voting system, with exceptions only for the elderly, disabled and for people who must be out of their precinct on Election Day. The bill, dubbed the </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/02/15/republicans-want-to-roll-back-the-clock-30-years-and-end-no-excuse-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Free, Fair and Transparent Elections Act,” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would also ban voting centers, a polling place model that Maricopa and Pima counties both use in which there are fewer voting locations, but anyone within the county can vote at any of them. Yavapai County, one of the most Republican counties in Arizona, was the first to use voting centers. The act would force a return to a precinct model in which there are more voting locations, but each voter would only have the opportunity to cast their vote at their designated precinct location. Those who try to vote at an incorrect polling location would not have their ballot counted.  The proposal would also cut down the time for signature curing on early ballots to two days instead of five, and allow 12 days to canvass the votes following the election instead of 20. The bill passed out of the committee by a vote of 5-4 along party lines, with Republicans voting in favor. It heads next to the full House of Representatives for consideration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Republicans want </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/02/16/fueled-by-conspiracy-theory-republicans-are-pushing-for-strict-rules-on-ballot-tabulators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tighter specifications on how electronic ballot tabulators are tested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prior to elections, but the proposed legislation itself falls short on specifics. The proposal would require public testing of all electronic ballot tabulators no more than 25 days prior to the start of early voting, with a 48-hour notice to the public before the testing begins. The Secretary of State would be required to give all candidates on the ballot and their political parties notice of the testing as well, to give them the option to observe.  Following the testing, the machines would be sealed until the start of early voting, and anyone who breaks the seal and tampers with the machine or reprograms it, and does not perform another test, would be guilty of a felony. Sen. Wendy Rogers, the chair of the Senate Elections Committee, said that</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/proposed/S.1288ROGERS.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1288</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation would “ameliorate some concerns of voters” and provide consequences for anyone who tampers with the tabulators.</span></p>

The bill would expand upon and replace a voters pamphlet already mailed to Idahoans. Many Western states, where many new Idaho residents are often moving from, have state-issued voter guides, McGrane said.  An Idaho guide, he said, would provide crucial information to voters in need. Voters headed to the polls often know their vote for president, McGrane said. But not necessarily for races further down the ballot, he said. “A common thing I hear from voters is they’ll request an absentee ballot not because they want to vote absentee, but they just want to get the ballot in advance so they can go do their research,” McGrane said. The Idaho Senate State Affairs Committee voted unanimously Friday to advance the bill to the full Senate. To become law, the bill would also need to clear the full Idaho House and be reviewed by Gov. Brad Little. A similar bill McGrane sought last year</span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/03/01/idaho-senate-oks-bill-creating-new-election-voter-guide-that-will-be-mailed-to-idahoans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Idaho Senate, but did not advance in the House.  Under the bill, Idaho’s new voter guide would have “uniform information about issues, measures, and candidates to be voted on.” Candidates could also submit a photo, a statement and campaign contact information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One year after modifying </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-bill-would-remove-six-month-requirement-for-no-fee-id-cards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter registration requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Idaho Legislature is taking steps to revise its requirements for Idahoans to obtain no-fee identification cards.  In a 62-7 vote, the House of Representatives passed</span><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/h0532/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 532</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would remove the six month waiting period for individuals to qualify for a no-fee identification card through the Idaho Department of Transportation.  The bill addresses issues that arose from two laws last year. The bill sponsor, Rep. Brandon Mitchell, R-Moscow, said the legislation would fix those situations that sponsors did not initially consider when they first passed the bill.  “Let’s say we’ve got grandma moving in from Montana, and grandma had a driver’s license in Montana but cannot drive anymore, so she’s moving in with family,” he said during the floor debate. “Well because she had a Montana driver’s license within the last six months, she does not qualify for the free ID. What this does is simply remove that six months so that she will qualify for the free ID.” The bill is now headed to the Idaho Senate for consideration.</span></p>

Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican and the Senate committee chairman, introduced Senate Bill 367. He said he relied on allegations raised by Opportunity Solutions Project, a conservative Florida think tank. The organization has previously sought passage in Kansas of laws to restrict voting and curtail welfare benefits. The current Senate bill would forbid Kansas election officers from accepting millions of dollars in financial assistance from the federal government for elections without consent of the Legislature and a governor. The secretary of state’s office raised questions about the legislation and argued there was no clear purpose for the bill. Loud Light Civic Action, which has sought to improve Kansas’ compliance with federal voting laws, opposed the bill based on a belief it was inspired by misguided conspiracy theorists. Clay Barker, general counsel to the secretary of state, said Schwab was neutral on the bill. He said purpose of the legislation wasn’t apparent despite testimony by Opportunity Solutions Project.He said the bill targeted election officials in Kansas, but not governors or county commissioners with budgetary roles in management of elections. He said the secretary of state’s office routinely provided House and Senate committees with information about deployment of federal HAVA funding.</span></p>

In written neutral testimony, Clay Barker with the Secretary of State’s Office agreed that this bill would help expand the pool of available poll workers. However, Barker said the bill lacks clarity regarding the requirements for U.S. citizenship for military personnel, dependents and students, as well as the process for determining political affiliation to ensure compliance with mandatory staffing partisan balance.</span></p>

Wes Moore, would make threatening an election official a misdemeanor punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to $2,500. The measure would prohibit someone from knowingly and willfully making a threat to harm an election official or an immediate family member of an election official, because of the election official’s role in administering the election process. “This has been a phenomenon which has occurred across the country,” said Eric Luedtke, Moore’s chief legislative officer, at a bill hearing Wednesday. “It’s a phenomenon that has targeted election workers, regardless of political affiliation, race, gender, what roles their filling.” Ruie Marie LaVoie, who is vice president of the Maryland Association of Elections Officials and now serves as director of the Baltimore County Board of Elections, testified about her experience being threatened during the 2022 election. She testified before the Senate Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee that the measure would help ensure the safety and security “of those at the forefront of preserving our democratic processes.”</span></p>

Bob Lynn of Windham. Under this bill, voters would need to be able to show proof at the polls of not simply their identity and domicile status — which can be done with a driver&#8217;s license — but also also their citizenship, which would require a birth certificate, naturalization papers, or a passport. Several local election officials said voters don’t always carry such official documents to the polls. &#8220;If you want to vote, you provide the documentation,” Lynn, a former chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, told the House Election Law Committee Tuesday. “You can register on the day of the elections, but if you don&#8217;t provide the documentation you don’t vote. Simple as that.” But critics — including several town election officials, the League of Women Voters and other voting rights groups — said the bill, which is identical to a proposal Lynn sponsored last year that failed in the House, wasn’t so simple and would put unnecessary hurdles in front of legitimate voters. “A small minority do not have all the paperwork. Having the affidavits makes it work,” said Hancock Supervisor of the Checklist Katherine Anderson.</span></p>

House Bill 3156 by Eric Roberts, R-Oklahoma City, would prohibit ranked-choice voting in statewide and municipal elections. A handful of other states and dozens of municipalities utilize the method, where voters rank candidates by preference, and results are narrowed until one candidate receives a majority of votes.  While no municipality in Oklahoma has authorized ranked choice voting, and the state’s current fleet of voting machines cannot accommodate the voting method, Roberts told members of the House Elections and Ethics Committee the bill is necessary to protect the elderly and others from a more complex voting system. He said possible errors could “hide the true intent of the voting public.”</span></p>

Tim Brennan, D-Bucks, is introducing legislation to </span><a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2024-02-16/pennsylvania-guns-polling-places-ban-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent firearms at polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. C-sponsored with Rep. Mary Jo Daley, D-Montgomery, the bill would allow gun owners to keep their weapon stored in their car, but would make it a misdemeanor offense to bring it inside a polling place. Pennsylvania already forbids guns in schools and courthouses. Many polling places are at such locations, and so firearms are already banned at those sites. Currently if a polling place is at a private business, then firearm possession is the decision of the building’s owners. The ban would not apply to law enforcement and active military personnel. The bill would take effect after 60 days. This means if passed even immediately after the House returns on March 18, it would not be in effect for the April 23 primary.</span></p>

A request to fund the program in partnership with Trinity Metro was rejected by commissioners during the Tarrant County Commissioners Court meeting on Wednesday. The vote was 3-2 along party lines, with the two Democrats on the court voting to fund the program. County Judge Tim O&#8217;Hare spoke out against the program, which was offered during elections from 2019 through 2023. Although the program was not approved countywide in 2023, it was approved for Fort Worth voters. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s the county government&#8217;s responsibility to try to get more people out to the polls,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the responsibility of candidates, it&#8217;s the responsibility of political parties, it&#8217;s the responsibility of political groups.&#8221; The program would have given free rides for Tarrant County residents to voting locations for the March 5 primary election, early voting for the May 28 runoff election and on runoff election day.</span></p>

Similar efforts have failed late in previous sessions, and the new complications in the Senate highlight the complexity of trying to get partisanship out of an election system that’s inherently political. Instead of the next governor being able to hire someone to lead the Virginia Department of Elections, the bill under consideration by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly would give that ability to the five-person State Board of Elections. By law, the governor’s party controls that board, but the pending legislation would require a supermajority vote (four of five members) in order to hire and fire elections commissioners. At a committee hearing, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, asked whether it’s realistic to expect Democrats and Republicans to agree on who should run the elections department given the threats and intimidation directed at election officials from the right.  Proponents of the bill have said the elections board, which includes ex-legislators from both parties, has worked in a mostly bipartisan manner and has a real chance of making a “consensus pick” on the next commissioner. “I don’t think it’s far-fetched to think that you could have a 5-0 vote,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Bristol, the bill’s sponsor.</span></p>

SB 593 is the bill, and says local governments may not use ranked-choice voting for any local, state or federal election. It defines the method at length: “Tabulation proceeds in rounds such that in each round either a candidate or candidates are elected, or the last-place candidate is defeated; votes are transferred from elected or defeated candidates to the voters’ next ranked candidate or candidates in order of preference; and tabulation ends when a candidate receives the majority of votes cast or the number of candidates elected equals the number of offices to be filled.” The committee approved the bill in a voice vote without debate and it goes next to Judiciary.</span></p>

Currently, a voter can go four years without voting or updating voter information before being considered inactive. This bill moves it to two years. For example, if a voter didn’t vote in one presidential election, they could be ineligible to vote in the next presidential election. The bill is a use it or lose it voting law. If voters don’t vote for more than two years, they get flagged. However, if voters confirm their address or register for a change of address, they will stay registered to vote, and their inactive status will be dropped. Voters can vote in any local, state or federal election or ballot to stay an active voter. Lead sponsor of the bill Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, said the bill is to make sure voters are not registered to vote in two different precincts and to verify voter eligibility.</span></p>

The state Assembly</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/politics/bipartisan-proposal-allow-clerks-process-absentee-ballots-earlier-passes-assembly"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation in November that would allow election workers to begin processing absentee ballots the day before an election. But in an interview that aired Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, told WISN-TV that the bill is likely dead, saying he doubts the legislation will make it out of a Senate committee. “I think a couple members of the committee have problems with the bill,” LeMaheiu said. The Republican-authored bill would allow municipalities to begin canvassing absentee ballots the day before an election, and require it in communities that use a central location for counting absentee ballots, like Milwaukee. Election workers would not be allowed to tally the ballots during early canvassing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change has been proposed by both Democrats and Republicans for years. Large cities often take longer to process the large quantity of absentee ballots they receive, sometimes leading to late-night swings in unofficial election results. That fueled former President Donald Trump’s false claims of vote “dumping” in 2020, when the final tally of votes in Democratic cities like Milwaukee weren’t known until the middle of the night.</span></p>

Prominent cheerleaders of former President Donald Trump&#8217;s efforts to overturn the election including Sidney Powell and Lin Wood were among the nine lawyers who initially faced sanctions for filing the lawsuit. Powell called the group &#8220;the Kraken.&#8221; The appeals court upheld sanctions against seven of them, including Powell and Wood.

The lawsuits target the state’s Election Procedure Manual — which is designed to guide Arizona election officials in conducting and certifying elections.

Their argument was met with opposition from state officials, who say the law helps curb fraud. Attorneys for both sides sparred in a court hearing over the constitutionality of a key component of Republicans’ efforts to restrict voting rights in the wake of unfounded claims of voter fraud during the 2020 election. The hearing took place on the final day for Kansans to register to vote in the state’s 2024 presidential preference primary election, which is scheduled for March 19. Elizabeth Frost, an attorney arguing for the voting rights groups, asked the court to swiftly block the law or direct a lower court to do so. “Every single day that goes by that the plaintiffs are under this threat is a harm not just to them,” she said, “but to the public.” The law violates the First Amendment of voting rights groups, she said, and is overly vague and broad — making it liable to arbitrary enforcement by the courts and law enforcement. Voting rights groups say the law has caused them to cancel voter registration drives and other outreach activities because their volunteers are scared they could be prosecuted for helping people register to vote. Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Attorney General Kris Kobach are defending the law. Bradley Schlozman, an attorney arguing on their behalf, said the law was meant to crack down on what he described as “nefarious actors” gathering information from voters during the 2020 election and using it to commit identity theft.</span></p>

The 2022 law has not yet gone into effect, since it faced immediate legal challenges. It sought to let green card holders and other people living in New York City with federal work authorization to vote in local elections for offices including mayor and City Council — applying to some 800,000 new eligible voters in a city of 8.5 million. In a 3-1 ruling, the appellate court agreed that the clause in the state constitution that “every citizen shall be entitled to vote…” refers exclusively to United States citizens. And the court ruled that a provision of state Municipal Home Rule Law requires changes to elections to be passed by voter referendum, rather than a local legislature.</span></p>

The question of whether ballots with a missing or incorrect date should be counted has been a factor in elections since Pennsylvania’s no-excuse absentee voting law took effect in 2020. And the outcome of the case now before the Third Circuit will determine how such ballots are handled in the 2024 presidential election in which Pennsylvania is considered a must-win state. Erie-based U.S. District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter</span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/voting/federal-judge-rules-mail-in-ballots-returned-on-time-with-wrong-or-missing-dates-must-be-counted/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that election officials may no longer reject ballots that lack a date or have an incorrect date on the outside of the return envelope. Baxter found that throwing out ballots over the dating requirement violates a federal law against disenfranchising voters with requirements not material to their qualifications to vote. Lawyers for the ACLU, the NAACP, League of Women Voters, and other organizations and for Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt argued that the lower court’s decision is correct.</span></p>

Hansen — who was an elections coordinator with the Cache County Clerk/Auditor’s Office — was charged Feb. 16, according to court records. Charging documents say Hansen was responsible for sending a test of vote tabulating machines to the Utah Lieutenant Governor’s Office, which is the body that oversees all elections in the state. Hansen allegedly forged the date of the test, charging documents say. The lieutenant governor’s office suspected the document was forged, and Cache County prosecutors later found that Hansen allegedly, “had used PDF editing software on his work computer to alter the document.” In an emailed statement, interim Cache County Attorney Taylor Sorensen told The Salt Lake Tribune members of his office, “unanimously agreed that the conduct alleged met the elements of the charge under Utah law.” Prosecutors have proposed issuing a summons to Hansen to appear in Logan’s 1st District Court. Hansen does not have an initial appearance date set, and he does not have an attorney listed in court records.</span></p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

Several amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been passed over the decades extending this fundamental freedom to voters of color, women and citizens who are 18 years of age. However, the lack of an overarching amendment guaranteeing the right to vote leaves our democracy vulnerable because the freedom to vote is treated differently depending on where voters live and how courts handle disputes over their rights.  In his new book, “A Real Right to Vote,” Law Professor Rick Hasen explains why a constitutional amendment is necessary, and why now is the time to begin a campaign in support of such an amendment. As Professor Hasen explains, enshrining voting rights in the Constitution will benefit all Americans, no matter which side of the political aisle they sit on.   In discussion with Campaign Legal Center President Trevor Potter, Professor Hasen will describe his vision for the freedoms an amendment on voting rights would protect, its potential impact on our democracy, and why he believes it’s possible to pass such an amendment, despite a challenging political climate. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 29, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

Simultaneously, the profile of elections has shifted dramatically with increased emphasis on cybersecurity, disinformation, technology, and data. As a result, elections have been under the microscope like never before with increased attention from the public and the press. The Director will advise the Secretary of State, lead an experienced team, and will be expected to bring a vision, new ideas, and new solutions to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving profile of election administration. The Elections Division engages in continual improvement processes and requires that all staff contribute to policy and operations development.

PRP is building a rapid response litigation hub to support up to 200 election officials across 12 or more states. The goal of the hub is to provide training, technical assistance, and legal backup to election administrators to enable them to respond to election threats quickly and effectively. Public Rights Project seeks to hire a Temporary Staff Attorney to join the new Elections Hub. The Temporary Staff Attorney will staff PRP’s in-house efforts to represent and advise state, local, and tribal governments and elected officials in support of election administration and the expansion of voting rights.  Although this position does not incorporate formal supervisory responsibilities, the Temporary Staff Attorney will sometimes lead case teams and may review the work of other attorneys, alongside more independent work or work as a contributor to other case teams.
