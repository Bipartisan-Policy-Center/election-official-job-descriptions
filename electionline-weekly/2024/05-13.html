														<p><strong>How Americans Vote at Home</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em>New tool from NVAHI helps voters wade through mail ballot policies state-by-state</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Vote at Home Institute (NVAHI) launched its comprehensive state-by-state</span><a href="https://voteathome.org/how-americans-vah/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How Americans Vote at Home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Mail ballot policies vary widely; this resource provides state-specific particulars on Vote at Home policies and processes to support nationwide efforts to promote mail ballot use. How do voters request and return their mail ballot? Is there a witness requirement? Can they track their ballot from being mailed to being counted? What happens if there’s an issue with their ballot? Are there limits on third-party involvement?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More Americans voted at home in 2020 than by any other method, and that helped drive voter turnout to its highest level in more than a century,” said Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute. “While the popularity of Vote at Home has continued to grow, many states have changed their rules on how to access it. As we approach the next presidential election, we want to make sure that voters can continue to utilize the safety and convenience of voting at home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-5306 alignright" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAH-300x60.png" alt="" width="300" height="60" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAH-300x60.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAH.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Vote at Home (vote-by-mail or absentee voting) has become increasingly popular with American voters as access to it has expanded. Today, 3 in 4 voters can Vote at Home for any reason, and nearly 40% are automatically delivered or can opt-in to be delivered a mail ballot for all elections. Voting at home centers the voter’s convenience by delivering their ballot to their doorstep, offers more time and opportunities to return it, and eliminates the concerns of long poll lines, work or child care conflicts, or weather emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last twenty years, NVAHI estimates that over 1 billion ballots have been delivered nationwide for presidential and midterm elections, party primary races, special vacancies, and local elections. The convenience of Vote at Home has led to higher voter turnout in states that automatically deliver ballots to every active registered voter. In 2022, Oregon, which pioneered full Vote at Home, had the highest turnout of eligible voters at over 60%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As an Oregonian, I’ve been Voting at Home since 2000. Now, in a year that faces poll worker shortages, long wait times and safety concerns, we want to help as many voters as possible to Vote at Home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool is primarily intended for civic engagement groups of all shapes and sizes nationwide, to help them successfully integrate Vote at Home into their voter registration and voter engagement programs. Using state specific information about</span><a href="https://voteathome.org/how-americans-vah/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How Americans Vote at Home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, available on the NVAHI website, can help boost voter access and turnout through the increased use of mailed-out ballots.</span></p>
<p><strong>About the National Vote at Home Institute<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2018, the National Vote at Home Institute is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) organization that works to increase voters’ access to, use, and confidence in voting at home, where voters are delivered their ballot, return them by postage-free mail or in-person to a range of accessible, convenient and secure locations, and can track them online to ensure their vote is counted.</span></p>

All vote centers in the county were seeing a “steady stream” of voters come through, “but we’re not seeing lines anywhere,” Lentz said. “It is low,” Lentz said of the turnout. “…It’s disappointing for sure.” The biggest issue for voters and elections officials was the weather. The primary election in the Wabash Valley had to battle some severe weather. </span><a href="https://wibqam.com/2024/05/08/local-clerks-discuss-how-operations-went-for-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermillion County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> circuit court clerk Tami Lowry said that it impacted them in a big way. “We had four of our precincts lose power, however, they either had generators and backup batteries, so they didn’t end up having any problems and came right back up,” she said. </span><a href="https://wibqam.com/2024/05/08/local-clerks-discuss-how-operations-went-for-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clay County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clerk Amy Jordan said that they are already putting precautions into place if a storm like this comes through again on election day. “We need a place for emergency preparedness, because we don’t have that,” she said. “We are going to get generators so if we do have an emergency, we have all that in place.” However, Lowry said that the staff on hand made it a point to not let the weather hinder the election process. “Everything went well as far as the materials, the machines, and getting everybody voted,” she said.</span></p>

Developed by experts in election administration, cybersecurity, and AI, this new tool provides scenarios for hypothetical situations involving AI-related attacks on election infrastructure, attempts to spread misinformation about voting, and efforts to interfere with election officials’ work. The scenario planner offers practical advice for responding to these threats. “Many election officials we’ve spoken to have said that despite the considerable hype around how AI may disrupt elections, they do not have the detailed guidance they would like to prepare,” said Lawrence Norden, senior director of the Elections &amp; Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. “This scenario planner provides them with that guidance, and shows they already have much of the knowledge and technology they need to help prevent AI from unsettling election operations this year.” The planner was inspired by authors’ conversations with election officials about concerns over AI and lessons learned from Arizona election officials’ tabletop exercises on AI in December 2023. Among the hypothetical situations in</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-election-officials-can-identify-prepare-and-respond-ai-threats"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the scenario planner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deepfake video uses an election official’s voice and image to spread false instructions on how to vote.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An election staffer receives a convincing, AI-generated phishing email directed at election officials with bait links that could infect the election systems with malware.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logistical disruptions such as phone calls seeking information about polling place hours are automated to flood election office phone lines as well as staff mobile phones. AI systems can generate calls that are highly personalized to mimic real people and voters by sharing real voters’ data, and can potentially overwhelm staff, resources, and interrupt election work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each scenario in the planner, the authors make recommendations for handling it, with specific steps for stopping an attack and reducing the damage.</span></p>

Kennedy Library Foundation. Adams is being recognized with the award for making absentee voting easier in Kentucky, along with increasing the number of in-person voting days. The award recognizes public officials at the federal, state, or local level who demonstrate leadership and political courage. He&#8217;ll receive the award at a ceremony in Boston next month. The award has been presented since 1990. “President Kennedy’s admonition to put country before self rings true now more than ever,” Adams said Monday. “I’m honored to accept this award on behalf of election officials and poll workers across America who, inspired by this call, sacrifice to keep the American experiment in self-government alive.” Part of why Adams says he is particularly “honored” is because the JFK Library Foundation “recognizes that we need problem solvers, that we need to reward people who do the right thing.” The award noted this, saying, “as he advocated for this legislation, Adams knew it was deeply unpopular with much of his party, but he persisted and faced primary challenges from candidates who embraced voter fraud claims.”</span></p>

The amendment would authorize Congress to protect the right to vote through legislation, require any efforts to limit the right to vote to be subject to the strictest level of review in court and ensure that states cannot use Section 2 of the 14th Amendment to prevent Americans who have criminal convictions from voting. Durbin — who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee — first introduced the resolution in August 2020 ahead of the 55th anniversary of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act.  “In the words of the late John Lewis, the right to vote is ‘the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument we have in a democratic society,’” Durbin said in yesterday’s statement. “When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, an overwhelming bipartisan majority supported the measure. When it was reauthorized in 2006, not one Senator – Democratic or Republican – voted against the bill.” Cosponsors of the resolution include Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Or.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). The resolution is also endorsed by multiple civil rights organizations, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Advancement Project and Color of Change, according to Durbin’s statement.</span></p>

Sarah Vance, R-Homer, to allow the state to trim its voter rolls more quickly. The state has 108% of its 20-and-older population registered to vote, and House lawmakers supported the bill on a bipartisan vote in February. On May 2, the Committee turned the bill into a comprehensive elections overhaul with a major amendment that incorporates elements of other bills: Voters would be allowed to register for an election within 30 days of Election Day, something currently allowed only for presidential votes. The Division of Elections would have to create a method for voters to fix errors on absentee ballots that have already been mailed.Absentee ballots would no longer require the signature of someone who witnesses the voter fill out the ballot. Ballots filled out by voters with special needs couldn’t be rejected because of errors by poll workers or the person delivering the ballot to the polls. If someone uses AI computer software to fake a candidate’s appearance in an election ad, the fake would have to include a legal disclaimer. A candidate would be able to transfer leftover campaign donations to a legal fund for election-related lawsuits. The Division of Elections would have to develop a cybersecurity program and develop procedures for audits intended to reduce risks. Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks and the chair of the State Affairs Committee, had planned a separate, multipart elections bill, but that bill hasn’t advanced in the Senate.</span></p>

Board Director Chris Madison told the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee on May 2 that the rule was designed to create consistency because electronic signatures were being accepted by some county clerks and rejected by others. According to the rule, electronic signatures are permitted at agencies that are identified in Amendment 51 of the Arkansas Constitution that are specifically authorized to use computer processes as part of its interaction with customers and program recipients. Authorized agencies include the Office of Driver Services of the Revenue Division of the Department of Finance and Administration, State Revenue Offices, public assistance agencies and disability agencies. The new rule directly impacts the work of Get Loud Arkansas, which has used an online portal to help register around 500 voters in 63 counties since the start of the year. The emergency rule went into effect May 4 and will be in effect for 120 days. The Arkansas Board of Election Commissioners will next work on a permanent rule that will require a 30-day comment period and a public hearing.</span></p>

It would require that sheriffs establish polling stations within local jails across Colorado each general election to operate for at least one six-hour period. It would also require every jail to designate a ballot drop-off location, for those who want to vote by mail. Colorado would be the first state to enact a mandate of this sort. Nevada, Massachusetts, and Washington state have recently passed initiatives meant to make jail voting easier, but none feature the central requirement of Colorado’s: turning local jails into in-person polling places. SB 72 builds on recent efforts in Denver, where local officials set up in-person voting from jail starting in 2020, to great effect so far: The jail’s turnout rate has occasionally surpassed the city’s overall rate. Elections workers and outside voter-engagement groups have also been able to enter the Denver jail to register people to vote and help them access ballots. The reform does not affect who is already eligible to vote. Colorado, like nearly every other state, bars people from voting while they are incarcerated if they’ve been convicted of a felony, and SB 72 keeps it that way. Rather, the bill seeks to improve ballot access for a group of people who already have the right to vote but face major barriers to actually using it. Should Polis sign SB 72 into law, it’ll go into effect in time for this November’s election “I’m so proud Colorado is first to address this embarrassingly antiquated system that discriminates against confined voters merely because they (literally) can’t get to a polling place,” said Judd Choate, Colorado Director of Elections. </span></p>

Mandatory surveillance cameras at absentee drop-boxes and improved tracking of ballots, as well as new protections for poll workers, are among the proposed changes in a bill that easily cleared the House of Representatives. Democrats and Republicans said it was important to pass legislation that increases the public&#8217;s confidence in state elections, even though no one has been charged yet in connection with the alleged ballot irregularities in the September mayoral primary in Bridgeport &#8211; the results of which were tossed out by a judge. The bill would require cities and towns by July 1, 2025, to install a video camera for each absentee ballot drop box and make the footage available to the public. It also includes new measures for tracking where and when individual absentee ballots were collected and tighter procedures for obtaining an absentee ballot. There are also provisions to address redundancies in voter rolls and speed up referrals of potential criminal violations of election law to the appropriate authorities. The bill additionally allows poll workers to apply to have their home addresses not subject to open records requests for 90 days before and after an election — a measure aimed at protecting them from possible harassment. Anyone who reveals the worker&#8217;s address would face a misdemeanor charge under the legislation. While questions of election security have led to bitter partisan fights in other states this year, Connecticut&#8217;s bill passed the Democratic controlled House of Representatives unanimously. It now awaits final legislative action in the Democratic controlled Senate. </span></p>

The three-bill package reflects Republicans’ latest efforts to revise election rules in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, when many supporters of Donald Trump said they mistrusted the voting process after he lost in both machine and hand vote counts. The new laws solidify the ability of conservative activists to challenge the eligibility of voters who appear to have moved, a priority among Republicans who say outdated registrations could be used for fraud unless they’re more quickly removed. Few cases of illegal voting have been confirmed by State Election Board inquiries, and voting rights advocates say legitimate voters have been targeted by challenges. The laws also satisfy conservative demands for more access for partisan election observers, visible watermarks printed on ballots and an eventual move to stop counting ballots based on computer QR codes, which are unreadable by the human eye. In addition, digital ballot images will be available online for public review, fewer voting machines will be required in election day polling places, and third-party presidential candidates will automatically appear on Georgia ballots if they also are on the ballot in at least 20 other states and territories. </span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/974"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 974</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Adds watermarks to ballots, displays ballot pictures online, requires more audits of statewide elections and uses technology to verify the accuracy of text on ballots. </span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/1207"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1207</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Requires election workers to be U.S. citizens, allows fewer voting machines on election days, guarantees poll watchers close access and allows candidates to proof ballots for errors. </span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/189"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 189</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Changes rules for mass voter challenges, eliminates computer QR codes from ballots, adds ballot security procedures and eases requirements for third-party presidential candidates to appear on Georgia ballots.</span></p>

Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, advanced from the House Judiciary Committee in a 8-1 vote May 1 and is pending on the House floor for final approval. Miguez’s bill would prohibit local governments from using ranked-choice voting for any elections in Louisiana, with an exception for out-of-state military members who have used it in Louisiana elections for decades. According to the Louisiana Luminator, the proposal virtually sailed through the committee hearing with few questions from lawmakers about Miguez’s claims, many of which don’t hold up under scrutiny. During Senate floor debate last month, Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, argued the proposal is unnecessary because Louisiana would have to first enact a law just to allow ranked-choice voting, which it has not done. “Do you have any other bills that define things that we don’t do in Louisiana?” Luneau asked Miguez. “I’m just curious how many different things are there in Louisiana that we don’t do that we need to define.” Miguez would not give a straight answer to the question.  “Let’s not complicate the matter,” Miguez said. “Let’s just look at the crux of this thing. If you support ranked-choice voting, then vote against my bill.” Other lawmakers who opposed the bill argued the state would overstep by telling local governments how to conduct local elections.  Miguez’s bill is part of Republican Secretary of State Nancy Landry’s legislative agenda. During the hearing, Landry did not repeat Miguez’s false claims of “trashed ballots” but instead argued that ranked-choice voting can sometimes be complex and confusing, which has been the case in some elections.  She said a study of a ranked-choice election in another state indicated it caused low-voter turnout.</span></p>

But its most notable proposal would be to take the state’s recently enacted voter ID law — which requires a voter to show a valid photo ID in order to vote — and extend that to voter registration and absentee ballots. Under H.B. 472, absentee ballots must be accompanied by a scan of the voter’s valid state ID, which Democrats pointed out could be tough to obtain for elderly Ohioans, who often vote by mail and might not have a photocopier. The sponsors said the bill was developed in consultation with the Ohio Secretary of State and various local boards of elections throughout Ohio. The bill contains a provision that allows Ohioans who have a religious objection to being photographed to register, and vote absentee, using the last four digits of their Social Security number as proof of their identity. “We’re trying to make sure we have good, identifiable, not only features but data, that helps the individual voter and helps boards of elections to ensure that that person is a valid elector,” said Rep. Bernie Willis, R-Springfield. Democrats questioned the burden such a law might put on absentee voters. Cincinnati Democrat Rep. Dani Isaacsohn asserted that if the last four digits of a Social Security number is enough to register and certify some Ohioans, then it ought to be enough for every Ohioan. “If we can trust that registration… What is inherently different about the security of their registration versus someone who doesn’t have a religious objection and therefore needs a picture taken? What is different about those people, inherently?” Isaacsohn asked.</span></p>

Due to what the U.S. Department of Justice called “repeated absentee ballot irregularities,” the city’s Democratic primary for his district was redone twice. During the 2017 and 2018 primaries, in addition to the 2018 general election for his seat, he faked voter documents and forged signatures, leading to stolen ballots being counted.</span></p>

A panel of federal judges issued a 2-1 ruling striking down Louisiana’s map, finding that adding a second majority Black district created an impermissible racial gerrymander. The groups said the lower court ruling was an “aggressive incursion on state sovereignty” that prevented Louisiana lawmakers from solving a violation of the Voting Rights Act with the Legislature’s policy priorities. “It is precisely to preclude cases like this one that the court recognized the principle that government actors must be given ‘breathing room’ to comply with the VRA, when they have good reason to believe they must, without facing constitutional liability,” Stuart Naifeh, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund,</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/robinson-callais-stay-app.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote in the application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Louisiana was under a court order to draw new congressional maps after the Fifth Circuit ruled that the state’s districts violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting power of Black residents. In a January special session, Louisiana drew a new map that would comply with the act by creating a second majority-Black district.</span></p>

The lawsuit filed earlier this year by two organizations alleged that the Maryland State Board of Elections violated state and federal election law as well as the Maryland Public Information Act. Gallagher, in dismissing the case, said the “plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims and this court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction.” Two groups — Maryland Election Integrity LLC and Missouri-based United Sovereign Americans — filed suit in March against the state board and an amended complaint in April. The suit alleged the state board maintained inaccurate voter registration lists and violated federal election law. Earlier this month, the groups asked Gallagher to issue an injunction preventing the board from certifying election results until the errors are fixed. Late last month, the Maryland State Board of Elections asked the judge to deny the request for a restraining order and dismiss the lawsuit. Gallagher granted the state’s motion. “Despite plaintiffs’ numerous assertions of problems with Maryland’s voting system, this Court can begin and end its analysis with Plaintiffs’ standing,” Gallgher wrote in her nine-page opinion. Both corporate entities “lack standing to seek relief for injuries to themselves,” Gallagher wrote. “Here, Maryland Election Integrity was ‘created for the purpose of resolving violations of Maryland law and restoring trust in Maryland Elections,&#8217;” Gallagher wrote. “Although the company’s mission might theoretically be impeded by the alleged voting violations, the company does not appear to conduct any regular activities for achieving that mission besides bringing the instant lawsuit and conducting investigations to support the lawsuit. Therefore, the alleged harm is ‘simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests’ rather than a ‘concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities.&#8217;”</span></p>

The department said Scott withheld the tabulator until it was seized by Michigan State Police executing a search warrant.  The department also contends that Lambert Juntilla illicitly transmitted data concerning the 2020 general election from the Adams Township electronic poll book under Scott’s direction. “Ensuring election security and integrity stands as the cornerstone of our democracy,” said Nessel, a Democrat. “When elected officials and their proxies use their positions to promote baseless conspiracies, show blatant disregard for voter privacy, and break the law in the process, it undermines the very essence of the democratic process. Those who engage in such reckless conduct must be held accountable for their actions.” Lambert Juntilla</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/special-prosecutor-announces-final-charges-in-2020-voting-machine-probe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was previously indicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for allegedly attempting to access and tamper with voting machines following the 2020 election, along with former state Rep.

The man, whose name was not released, was identified in a release from Nessel&#8217;s office as an individual who previously worked as an election inspector in the City of Plymouth. The man came forward during the investigation and admitted to placing the non-functional camera and solar light, saying his intent was to deter tampering and promote honest voting, the release said. “My department takes allegations of voter intimidation and election fraud very seriously,” Nessel said. “We will continue to thoroughly investigate each referral we receive from both local or state partners, and prosecute any criminal offenses we uncover. “While this incident did not rise to illegal activity, it serves as an important reminder for all Michigan voters, election workers and volunteers to know what is and what isn’t allowed at polling locations and to comply with the law.”</span></p>

On May 6, lawyers for the Democratic National Committee, which is working to reelect President Joe Biden, said two suits filed by the Republican National Committee in Michigan in March were part of &#8220;extensive&#8221; and &#8220;wide-ranging&#8221; efforts to make people believe the upcoming election will be unfair. &#8220;The only practical effect of this litigation is to sow doubt about the integrity of Michigan’s elections and generate talking points for future claims of voter fraud,&#8221; the Democratic attorneys wrote in one of their briefs.</span></p>

They claim the law chills their rights to vigorously observe and challenge the election process for fear of being arrested under the law. U.S. District Judge Cristina Silva has found that the plaintiffs don’t have standing to bring the case because they can’t show they have been harmed or would be harmed by the law. The plaintiffs are Beadles, Susan Vanness, Alexandrea Slack and Martin Waldman. Their claim rests not on the fact that the law could harm them but that someone could misinterpret the law and thus harm them, the judge said, which doesn’t give them cause to bring the lawsuit. No details about the reasoning behind the appeal were available. A spokesperson for Nevada Secretary of Stater Cisco Aguilar, who is named in the lawsuit, said she was unable to comment on ongoing litigation. When the lawsuit was rejected last month, Aguilar said in a statement that he was grateful to Judge Silva for her decision. “The Election Worker Protection Act was brought by a Democratic Secretary of State, passed with unanimous bipartisan support, and was signed by a Republican Governor,” he said in a statement. “Nevada has said loud and clear: threats and harassment against election workers will not stand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party and presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump sued Nevada and its two biggest counties over the </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/gop-sues-nevada-over-late-mail-in-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy of accepting late-arriving vote-by-mail ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to four days after Election Day. &#8220;Nevada effectively extends Nevada’s federal election past the Election Day established by Congress,&#8221; the parties say in their federal</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nevada-republic-party-v-Washoe-county.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The result of Nevada’s violation of federal law is that timely, valid ballots are diluted by untimely, invalid ballots, which violates the rights of candidates, campaigns, and voters under federal law.&#8221; In a statement, Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said, &#8220;Our office will not comment on ongoing litigation, but I hope the RNC is putting as much time and energy into educating voters on how to participate in elections as they put into suing the state of Nevada.&#8221; He added: &#8220;Nevada runs some of the most secure, transparent, and accessible elections in the country. The key for that accessibility is allowing working Nevadans to vote using the method that works best for them, including voting by mail.&#8221; The DNC has </span><a href="https://www.2news.com/news/dnc-asks-judges-to-dismiss-gop-led-lawsuits-over-mail-in-ballot-deadline/article_aa5a686a-0974-11ef-b43f-9f99fb662b28.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking that the suit be thrown out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nevada Supreme Court heard arguments May 8 on the legality of a </span><a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-supreme-court-weighs-whether-proposed-voter-id-ballot-measure-amounts-to-poll-tax"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed ballot measure to require voter identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after a lower court dismissed a lawsuit challenging it in February. The appellant — represented by a group of Nevada and Washington, D.C.-based attorneys who typically represent Democrat-backed causes — argues that the petition would cost money while not explicitly outlining a funding source, which would be unconstitutional. Voter ID proposals are favored inside and outside of Nevada by Republicans, who say they are necessary to ensure election security, but the proposals have failed to gain momentum in the Democrat-controlled Legislature. The hearing comes less than two months before the deadline for petition supporters to gather and submit enough signatures for the measure to qualify for the November ballot. So far, supporters have received about  60,000 signatures, according to David Gibbs, the head of the Repair the Vote PAC behind the effort. To make it on the ballot, petition supporters still must gather 102,362 signatures from voters by June 26, with at least 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts.</span></p>

Lawyers for the plaintiffs told U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs, an Obama appointee, that the law disenfranchises Black and Latino voters, violates the Voting Rights Act, and deters minorities from voting. The defendants, which include Republican leaders and the state Board of Elections, argue that their voter ID requirement is one of the most permissive in the nation and that the legislature wasn’t required to provide any exceptions to the photo ID rule, but still did, allowing voters to fill out an exemption form.   “North Carolina allows voters to vote with or without ID, and any deterrent is minimal,” said David Thompson, attorney for intervenor-defendants Speaker Tim Moore and President Pro Tempore Phil Berger. Kathleen Roblez, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the requirement “attempts to solve a voter ID problem, which simply doesn’t exist,” adding it was passed based on lawmakers&#8217; false notions of the prevalence of in-person voter ID fraud. In-person voter fraud is practically nonexistent in North Carolina. The Board of Elections reported only one case of it in the 2016 general election out of nearly 4.8 million votes. The current version of the law accepts a variety of voter identification cards, including drivers licenses, tribal IDs, military identification cards, and certain employment and student IDs. Residents attempting to vote without an ID can fill out a &#8220;reasonable impediment declaration form&#8221; explaining what prevented them from presenting identification. Voters can also cast a provisional ballot and return with their photo ID for their ballot to be counted.</span></p>

It’s a change of position the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation chairman calls “unconscionable” after the tribe and state had previously been aligned. North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said the state is trying to gain clarity on how legislative district lines can be drawn to comply with both the U.S. Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act.  “We’re inviting them to … decide that well-intentioned racial discrimination is still discrimination,” Wrigley said. The case goes back to 2021, when the Republican-dominated North Dakota Legislature redrew legislative district lines based on the 2020 census results.  The legislation created subdistricts in districts 4 and 9 for two reservations. District 4A follows the borders of the Fort Berthold Reservation, home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. The state filed a motion asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider that decision. The motion was filed after plaintiffs Walen and Henderson appealed the ruling. The state now seeks to vacate the ruling of the three-judge panel and send it back for further proceedings.</span></p>

Zapata was found guilty of one misconduct in public office felony and three election fraud misdemeanors at her jury trial in March. Prosecutors argued that, just ahead of the 2022 midterms, she used fake voter information and her governmental access to send three military absentee ballots to a Republican lawmaker who has signal-boosted election conspiracy theories. The defendant pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Zapata’s attorney Dan Adams portrayed her as a whistleblower intending to draw attention away from far-out conspiracy theories and toward concrete issues with election administration. At the conclusion of a 40-minute sentencing hearing on May 2, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Kori Ashley sentenced Zapata to 9 months’ jail time stayed for 12 months of probation and 120 hours of community service for the misconduct felony, finding no need for immediate imprisonment. Zapata received a $1,000 fine for each of the three election fraud misdemeanors. Assistant District Attorney Matthew Westphal reiterated at sentencing that Zapata was not a whistleblower, but a public employee who violated the public’s trust and committed fraud amid already fraught tensions surrounding mis- and dis-information about voter fraud. Calling Zapata’s actions “an extremely serious offense” and “an attack on our electoral system,” the prosecutor recommended a 12-month sentence for the misconduct felony and 60 days of concurrent jail time for each election fraud misdemeanor to be stayed for 18 months’ probation plus community service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Public Interest Legal Foundation has </span><a href="https://captimes.com/news/elections/conservative-group-sues-for-easier-access-to-wisconsin-voters-details/article_61704d18-08bb-11ef-89ad-47be0899c9ad.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">once again made Wisconsin’s voter rolls a subject of litigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead of the November elections, arguing that state election officials should be forced to more easily disclose voter registration lists. The group&#8217;s latest legal challenge in Wisconsin centers on the accessibility of the state’s voter registration list. The federal National Voter Registration Act lays out a set of basic standards for members of the public to request and inspect voter registration lists, guaranteeing the documents can be made available and limiting the costs that can be charged for their production. However, Wisconsin is among a half-dozen states that had same-day voter registration when the federal law was enacted in 1993 and are exempt from some of the requirements. The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) argues that two states, Minnesota and Wisconsin, should not be exempt from the requirement to more easily and cheaply produce copies of the voter registration rolls under federal law. The lawsuit claims that the exemptions are unconstitutional because they treat some states differently from others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">]The state Supreme Court announced May 3 that it will decide </span><a href="https://wausaupilotandreview.com/2024/05/05/wisconsin-supreme-court-will-decide-whether-mobile-voting-sites-are-legal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether mobile voting sites are legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without allowing any lower appellate courts to rule first. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative law firm, sued in December 2022 on behalf of Racine County Republican Party Chair Ken Brown, alleging Racine city officials illegally used a voting van to collect absentee ballots that year. A circuit judge ruled in January that state law doesn’t allow mobile voting sites to operate. Racine City Clerk Tara McMenamin and the Democratic National Committee asked the state Supreme Court in February to review the case without letting any lower appellate courts rule on it first. The justices issued an order Friday afternoon indicating they had voted 4-3 to take the case. All three conservative justices dissented. Chief Justice Annette Ziegler, a member of the conservative block, wrote that the case hasn’t been fully briefed and the liberal justices are trying to help Democrats make political gains ahead of the November elections.</span></p>
