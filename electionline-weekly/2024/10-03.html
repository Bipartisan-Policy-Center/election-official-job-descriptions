</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local elections officials in six states assess the damage and get to work</span></em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/helene-live-updates-rcna173390"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Helen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made landfall on Thursday, September 26, just 40 days before the November 5 election. The storm quickly became one of the <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11862" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-5.59.22 AM-300x163.png" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-5.59.22 AM-300x163.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-5.59.22 AM-1024x555.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-5.59.22 AM-768x416.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-5.59.22 AM.png 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />deadliest and costliest storms to hit the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While search and recovery missions are ongoing and survivors are surveying the damage and trying to begin the process of putting their lives back together, elections officials in </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-voting-ballots-46a7fbecb44464409d796dd687d3cb9d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">six impacted states have begun the work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of making sure that those who want to vote can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections officials have extensive contingency plans. And when an event happens that doesn’t fall into one of the categories covered by the contingency plans, things like </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2021/09-09/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a terrorist attack on Election Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2011/08-25/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">East Coast earthquake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2020/04-02/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2012/11-01/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SuperStorm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just days before a presidential election, elections officials are incredibly resourceful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What follows is a look at the reported impacts Hurricane Helene had on elections officials and millions of voters and what’s being done to prepare for November 5. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida, which has seen its fair share of damaging storms during an election year, the election process was impacted in at least 10 counties. In advance of the storm, several counties adjusted their vote-by-mail dates. Following the storm, Florida Supervisors of Elections (</span><a href="https://www.myfloridaelections.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FSE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) Executive Director David Ramba, in a letter this week,  implored Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews to </span><a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/699102-florida-supervisors-of-elections-seek-looser-rules-adjustments-after-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support an executive order allowing workarounds in 10 counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include Charlotte, Citrus, Dixie, Hillsborough, Lee, Levy, Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota and Taylor.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11906" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11906" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11906" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FLStormDamage-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FLStormDamage-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FLStormDamage-1024x682.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FLStormDamage-768x512.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FLStormDamage.png 1288w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11906" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Helene damage on Cedar Key, Florida | GREG LOVETT/THE PALM BEACH POST</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hurricane Helene devastated counties in many parts of Florida (and) displaced countless voters and poll workers from their homes in a number of impacted counties,” Ramba wrote. “The Supervisor of Elections in each of these counties wants to continue to provide its voters with the best possible voting experience … in an efficient and orderly manner while ensuring the security and integrity of the Nov. 5 General Election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that his administration will </span><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/10/02/desantis-says-hes-likely-to-allow-supervisors-of-elections-to-make-changes-in-light-of-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">likely “be doing something” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">shortly in response to the request from supervisors of elections to allow changes to accommodate voters post Hurricane Helene, with just under five weeks before Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll look at all the different requests,” DeSantis said while speaking at a press conference in Madeira Beach in Pinellas County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When [Hurricane] Ian hit at the end of 2022 that was at the end of September. We had an election coming up in November, and we were able to make some accommodations and so, I think, we will be doing something. The question is what, and I gotta look, I gotta vet it, but we’re going to basically continue to be consistent with what we’ve done in past practice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/698993-pinellas-county-supervisor-of-elections-launches-voter-info-portal-to-help-helene-victims/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinellas County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Supervisor of Elections Julie Marcus set up a </span><a href="https://www.votepinellas.gov/Home/Hurricane-Information-Page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Information Page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide residents with the most up-to-date information. Current information includes any office closures, the plan for mailing ballots and how to obtain ballots if a voter’s address is not receiving mail due to the storm. The site also contains details on early voting, Election Day polling places and poll worker training resources. The page will be updated frequently to provide any additional information as it becomes available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) said </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4910830-georgia-elections-offices-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no election offices were ruined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the storm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been monitoring status reports from all 159 counties,” Raffensperger said in a Tuesday statement on  X. “We’re thankful that election offices were spared from substantial, long-term damage. Our staff will be working hand in hand with the counties that need the most support to ensure election operations remain on schedule.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11907" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11907" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11907" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GAStormDamage-300x209.png" alt="" width="300" height="209" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GAStormDamage-300x209.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GAStormDamage-768x534.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GAStormDamage.png 912w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11907" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Damage from Helene in Valdosta, Georgia | NBC</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Raffensperger announced that his office is continuing to coordinate directly with election offices in Georgia’s 159 counties ensuring election operations remain on schedule and that counties have the needed resources for a swift recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election workers across Georgia had begun the pre-election testing processes of equipment and facilities to be used in the 2024 election,” said Raffensperger. “My office is working hard to make sure the election workers in the affected counties are safe, that their equipment is undamaged and secure, and that their early voting locations will be functional by the time early voting starts.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor road conditions and ongoing power outages were scattered across the southern, central and eastern portions of Georgia as of Wednesday, which was slowing evaluation procedures in some areas hardest hit by the storm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Georgia’s Emergency Management Agency (GEMA), linemen from Georgia Power and other utilities, all the state and local first responders and legions of citizen volunteers and faith-based organizations are doing a great job at getting people fed, housed, and back on their feet,” said Raffensperger. “But this was a massive and deadly storm and recovery is likely to take a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raffensperger added that any counties having to relocate early voting locations will notify voters through the</span><a href="https://sos.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bb95d9c7cf4b94c9f44421f7c&amp;id=fde99d2612&amp;e=5acf40cd72"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> My Voter Page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> portal and local radio, television, and social media outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to let the first responders finish doing their jobs, but as power is restored and voting locations can be assessed, we will make sure that the upcoming election is safe, secure and convenient for all Georgia voters,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some elections offices were without power for several days. In </span><a href="https://decaturish.com/2024/10/county-offices-on-memorial-drive-still-without-power-following-hurricane-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeKalb County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one elections office only reopened on the morning of October 2 after being without power since the storm hit on September 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest concern remains the U.S. Postal Services ability to handle mail ballots. The </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/damage-from-hurricane-helene-in-georgia-could-create-problems-with-mail-in-ballots/ADHD3FXZUJB2NHM5BA5FR327BE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Postal Service </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has suspended operations at scores of its facilities across Georgia in the wake of Hurricane Helene, reigniting fears about its ability to process hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots in time for this year’s presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Postal Service is dispatching “recovery teams” to parts of the state impacted by the hurricane, said Tiffany Rowland, a spokeswoman for the agency</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The status of operations is being continually evaluated and adjustments made to ensure safe and swift restoration of delivery and retail services in locations as soon as possible,” she said Monday. “Efforts will continue as long as needed until full services are restored.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgians will have three weeks of in person early voting as well as election day to cast their vote. Any voter whose absentee ballot has not been accepted by the county elections office may still vote in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While residents of the Tar Heel State expect and are prepared for hurricanes each season, no one expected the remnants of Hurricane Helene (a tropical storm by the time it reached North Carolina) to cause the devastation that it did in Western North Carolina. About </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/about-a-fifth-of-registered-voters-live-in-western-nc-counties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-fifth of the state’s voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> live in the impacted areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff from the </span><a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/news/press-releases/2024/09/30/election-officials-plan-voting-post-helene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina State Board of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have contacted election officials in the affected counties in Western North Carolina to make sure they are safe, to gather information on damage to election and voting facilities, and to assess potential effects on absentee and in-person voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absentee voting is underway in North Carolina. In-person early voting begins Oct. 17 and ends Nov. 2. Election Day is Nov. 5.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11908" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11908" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11908" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NCStormDamage-300x207.png" alt="" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NCStormDamage-300x207.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NCStormDamage-1024x707.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NCStormDamage-768x530.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NCStormDamage.png 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11908" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Damage from Helen in Western North Carolina. | Melissa Sue Gerrits / Stringer/Getty Images</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hearts go out to all North Carolinians affected by Hurricane Helene, including our neighbors, friends and colleagues in Western North Carolina,” said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. “When disasters strike elections, we use this mantra: ‘We do not stop an election; we figure out how to proceed.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we do not know exactly what is ahead, our guiding force between now and Election Day will be to do everything possible to ensure every eligible North Carolina voter can cast their ballot. Natural disasters have affected elections here in the recent past. As we did at those times, we will conduct a safe, secure, and successful election in 2024,” Brinson Bell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under</span><a href="https://ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_163/GS_163-230.1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, county elections boards are to start holding weekly meetings on the fifth Tuesday ahead of Election Day to review absentee ballots. On Monday, the State Board of Elections </span><a href="https://www.whqr.org/2024-09-30/absentee-ballot-meetings-western-north-carolina-helene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held an emergency meeting </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to adopt a resolution allowing officials in counties slammed by Helene to reschedule the statutorily required absentee ballot meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the resolution, the county boards may reschedule the meetings and, in keeping with state law, must give the public 48 hours&#8217; notice of changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is a tough time in the mountains of western North Carolina,&#8221; Board member Stacy Eggers said from his home in Boone in Western North Carolina. &#8220;A lot of our infrastructure has been damaged, much of it quite significantly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eggers said the emergency rule change over absentee ballot meetings would be greatly appreciated by local elections officials in the affected areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are several county seats that still have no electricity, and I believe all five of the courthouses in my judicial district are going to be closed for the entire week,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state and affected counties are still working to assess how to deal with damaged early voting and Election Day polling places that may not be available. There is also the issue of internet access which is not needed for voting machines but is for poll books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Board will provide special emergency kits to counties without internet service. These “election offices in a box,” contain resources that will allow county elections workers to continue registering voters and processing absentee ballot requests.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11733" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11733" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11733" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BucombCoNCIVoted24-300x281.png" alt="" width="240" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BucombCoNCIVoted24-300x281.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BucombCoNCIVoted24-768x720.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BucombCoNCIVoted24.png 774w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11733" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Buncombe County&#8217;s 2024 &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/30/how-is-helene-affecting-mail-service-and-voting/75450664007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buncombe County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, home to Asheville and one of the most impacted areas, preparations for November 5 continued. The county’s elections offices were not damaged and they did have power but no water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working to account for all staff and board members,”  said Corinne Duncan, elections director for Buncombe County. “Some are stranded due to road blockage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while mail service was suspended in a number of rural counties, the post office closest to the Buncombe office was still open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We dropped 200 ballots in the mail today,” Duncan said on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.thesylvaherald.com/news/article_4ac8927a-80be-11ef-a0ef-1704cf29a609.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jackson County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Elections was open Monday but had no internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our office is safe, we’ve had no loss of equipment or ballots, and our office is open,” Elections Director Amanda Allen said. “We’re experiencing the same challenges as many local folks &#8211; internet and phone outages. We’re working on solutions to get systems that require internet up and running, but that may take time to perfect. We encourage folks to try to call and send emails, but be patient with response time. Elections must go on and we’re doing everything we can to adapt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be the first presidential election with a strict voter photo ID law in North Carolina. If a voter has lost their photo ID in the storm, the odds are high they may have also lost the documentation necessary to replace that ID. Fortunately when the ID law was written, an </span><a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/enactedlegislation/statutes/pdf/bysection/chapter_163/gs_163-166.16.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exception for natural disasters </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was included. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone affected by Helene can fill out an affidavit, either in-person at a polling place or via absentee ballot, saying that they have been a victim of a natural disaster and are unable to produce their ID. They will then cast a provisional ballot, which will be reviewed by the county board of elections before being accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Orr, a retired state Supreme Court Justice, told WTVD in Asheville that </span><a href="https://abc11.com/post/hurricane-helene-nc-votes-election-officials-work-ensure-voting-access-hardest-hit-areas-is-not-strained/15381082/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional funding for already squeezed elections offices will be crucial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s almost incomprehensible. I know the election officials at the state level say even if it&#8217;s a disaster, we move forward with the election. But they need the funding so that they can get additional equipment, (that) they can get people to polling places. Maybe they have to find new polling places, (but) that&#8217;s going to cost money,&#8221; said Orr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday,</span><a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorBerger/status/1840839256752738654"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate President Phil Berger posted on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the General Assembly is assessing a disaster recovery package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just elections officials in the impacted areas who are dealing with the fallout from Helene. Elaine Best, director of elections for </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/north-carolina/north-carolina-elections-workers-reaffirm-election-security-following-impacts-helene-aftermath/291-afba7976-af76-410d-8d50-eed4a08c3a41"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camden County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told WVEC she&#8217;s gotten at least one call from a county voter drawing attention to the fact that they haven&#8217;t received their absentee mail ballot, while they are residing in Florida this time of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She knows the postal service down there is trying to-regroup, we don’t know if the ballot is sitting in the post office waiting to be delivered,&#8221; Best said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best said she’s prepared to re-send ballots in the event Hurricane Helene disrupted a voters reception of their requested ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>South Carolina<br />
</strong>There have been very few press reports out of South Carolina about the storm&#8217;s impacts there.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reached out to the <a href="https://scvotes.gov/">South Carolina Election Commission</a> and got this response.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At this point we are unsure of impacts on polling locations around the state. There are still many areas of the state without power with restoration timelines stretching throughout this week and next week, said TJ Lundee, a spokesperson for the state election commission. &#8220;We anticipate there will be changes required to early voting centers and polling locations, we just don&#8217;t have that information as of right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least six polling locations and two county election offices in </span><a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/01/tennessee-polling-places-damaged-helene-floods-presidential-election/75430390007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">East Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were damaged or are inaccessible from Hurricane Helene floods, state election officials said Oct. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting in the Nov. 5 election is scheduled to begin in just two weeks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the coming days, county officials in the region will continue their assessment to determine whether impacted polling locations will be able to be used by Election Day,” said Doug Kufner, a spokesman for the Tennessee Secretary of State’s office, which includes the Division of Elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.wate.com/news/election-news/cocke-county-election-commission-opens-in-new-location-after-helene-flooding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocke County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Elections Commission had to relocate due to flood waters. The Cocke County Election Commission ceased operations at the Courthouse Annex and relocated its main office to its Early Voting Site in Newport. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the result of a team effort, all voting system equipment and relevant items were spared from the flood,” a news release stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elections commission has a new mailing address as well, but wanted to assure voters that all mail addressed to the old, flooded location would get to the new spot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rest assured that any election commission mail addressed to the Courthouse Annex – Main Street address will be handled by the postal service and appropriately forwarded to the election commission,” the news release stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections offices in </span><a href="https://www.elizabethton.com/2024/10/01/elections-still-on-carter-countians-minds-as-voter-registration-deadline-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were damaged by the floods as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have shown up at our door and we are trying to accommodate them as best as possible,” Carter County Administrator of Elections Tracy Tanner-Harris said in an email. She expects the office will resume regular office hours of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognize this may be the last thing on people’s minds at a time like this,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kufner said the number of polling places and elections offices affected could rise as officials are able to get into the impacted areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The election community in Tennessee is united. When one hurts, we all hurt. The heartache, shock and devastation are massive,” Kufner told The Tennessean. “However, we are confident that the challenges caused by the flooding will be overcome because of the planning and resilience of election officials in the impacted counties.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The southwestern part of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/hurricane-helene-deaths-in-virginia-up-to-2-future-rain-prompts-more-concern/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was impacted by Helene including two deaths and thousands of people without power. Elections officials were largely impacted by power outages.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, there were several localities whose voter registration offices were closed on Friday, September 27 and Monday, September 30 due to power outages. All election offices across Virginia were open as of Noon on Monday, September 30,” said Andrea Gaines, external affairs manager for the Virginia Department of Elections. </span></p>

The rallies were organized by the American Postal Workers Union, which is calling for the public&#8217;s help in demanding improved staffing for postal workers, better customer service, and more opportunity for public input. All of this comes ahead of the presidential election, where millions of Americans will be voting by mail. Mark Dimondstein, President, American Postal Workers Union </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/postal-workers-union-sounds-alarm-about-usps-staffing-service-and-election-preparedness"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told PBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that postal workers are committed to vote by mail work. “Postal workers are absolutely dedicated to our mission in general, and specifically around making sure that the people of this country have that kind of access to the ballot box and their cherished right to vote on a nonpartisan basis that the Postal Service can bring to the people of this country,” Dimondstein said. At almost the same time, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy </span><a href="https://www.nass.org/node/2619"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined a virtual meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the </span><a href="https://www.nass.org/committees/elections-committee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Secretaries of State Elections Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to the structure of the meeting, DeJoy did not engage in an active dialogue with secretaries of state. “A more open meeting with Postmaster DeJoy would have allowed us to further emphasize the concerns Chief Election Officials have. There are numerous unresolved issues, and we simply need more specifics on the solutions he has proposed. With only 35 days until the general elec­tion, we very much hope to continue this dialogue with USPS,” said Steve Simon, NASS President and Minnesota Secretary of State. “Voters who choose to vote by mail should have the utmost confidence in the process because election officials are invested in our democracy and USPS has committed to do everything within their abilities to deliver ballots on time. We will continue to ramp up our education efforts around mail ballots, return methods and ballot tracking options.” As the meeting concluded, DeJoy offered to connect with secretaries individually as needed on specific election-mail related issues they may be experiencing. </span></p>

Diny admitted he moved the drop box to his office on Sept. 22 and “took a few photos to memorialize the action.” Initially, he said the box “was relocated to a safe indoor location until certain issues that the clerk is aware of are addressed.” He also provided a photo. Wausau City Clerk Kaitlyn Bernarde said in a news release  she </span><a href="https://www.wkow.com/news/election/city-clerk-refers-drop-box-removal-to-marathon-county-da-and-wisconsin-elections-commission/article_5f89b7e2-b348-549b-8416-f6d694a70869.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported the absentee drop box removal as an election irregularity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Wisconsin District Attorney and the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Diny initially defended his actions to a Wausau Daily Herald reporter, saying the box was unsecured and he was just moving it to safety, but on September 29 he released a contradictory statement to media saying he wants the issue brought before the Wausau City Council. Diny has been on the record throughout 2024 about his opposition to drop boxes. The </span><a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/wausau-replaces-absentee-ballot-drop-box-at-its-city-hall-after-mayor-carted-it-away/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop box was back in front of City Hall </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Monday. The Wausau city clerk said the box was available outside of city hall “for residents to submit absentee ballots, payments, and other important city requests as was intended.” Bernarde said in a statement that the box has been secured to the ground in accordance with guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission and the United States Election Assistance Commission. The box was not attached to the ground when the mayor took it. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in July ruled that drop boxes are legal, but left it up to local communities to decide whether to use them. More than 60 towns, villages and cities in nine counties have opted out of using the boxes for the presidential election in November, according to a tally by the group All Voting is Local. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of Wausau voters have </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/voters-bring-federal-complaint-against-wausau-mayors-removal-of-absentee-drop-box/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a request with the U.S. Department of Justice </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to investigate the mayor of Wausau over his removal of an absentee ballot drop box from outside of city hall.</span></p>

Not only cybersecurity, but also physical security. This week, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania took an interesting approach to beefing up security around their elections office. </span><a href="https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2024-10-01/luzerne-county-installs-boulders-around-penn-place-building-as-election-security-move"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials are placing boulders around the building</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in downtown Wilkes-Barre that is home to the county&#8217;s election bureau. Luzerne County Manager Romilda Crocamo said the installation is in keeping with recommendations made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Luzerne County Manager Romilda Crocamo said, and will remain in place after the election. &#8220;This is a measure taken to safeguard staff, the public and the ballots,&#8221; Crocamo said. In August county officials participated in the Security Assessment At First Entry, or SAFE, conducted by CISA. One suggestion was to consider barriers as a protection against vehicles ramming into the building. &#8220;Following the inspection, I requested they identify potential risks and concerns. One of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recommendations was boulders, which we adopted,&#8221; Crocamo said. The work costs about $1,700, she added, and may be partially funded through a $1 million state election integrity grant received by the county. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luzerne’s move comes as others around the country are </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/after-threats-officials-fortify-election-offices-ahead-of-voting-220720197800"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fortifying security at county elections offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation into law that would prohibit localities from enacting their own </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/29/california-outlaws-local-voter-id-rules-00181608"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter ID requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The legislation is a direct response to a controversial ballot measure approved this year by voters in Huntington Beach requiring people to show photo identification at the polls. It will take effect on Jan. 1. In response, Huntington Beach Mayor Gracey Van Der Mark</span><a href="https://laist.com/news/politics/huntington-beach-voter-id-law-newsom"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told LAist </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Newsom’s ban doesn’t apply to Huntington Beach, because it is a charter city, which means it has its own version of a constitution. “The state cannot pass any laws that strip us of our constitutional rights, so that law does not apply to us or affect our new election laws,” she wrote in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsom </span><a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article293275804.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a Senate bill that would have automatically registered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> millions of eligible voters who had opted out of signing up when conducting business at the Department of Motor Vehicles. “While the goal of streamlining voter registration is commendable, this bill raises several concerns,” Newsom stated in his veto message on Senate Bill 299. “It would place the DMV in the role of determining voter eligibility, a function more suitable for elections officials.” The governor noted the implementation of such a system would not respect residents’ decision to decline to register, which he described as “a matter of personal prerogative.” Newsom also said that developing the new system would require “costly and complex changes” to the current Motor Voter system that he said were estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. These expenditures, he said, would come at a time when he and legislators already have had to cut costs to balance the budget.</span></p>

The Erie County Board of Elections is considering a resolution that would impact how the canvassing process is observed on Election Day. &#8220;Earlier in the spring, we met with the Department of Homeland Security and they made a number of recommendations,&#8221; said Erie County Clerk Karen Chillcott. &#8220;We&#8217;ve taken a lot of them under advisement, and a lot of the changes that you see in the department are a result of that assessment. In one in particular, they said that no one should be coming through our doorways.&#8221; The Erie County Board of Elections is considering a resolution that would require people to watch the canvassing process from the hallway of the courthouse. The election office has already made several changes. &#8220;In the hallway, we&#8217;ve installed three windows with open access,&#8221; said Chillcott. &#8220;People can view right inside the canvassing and pre-canvassing area of the office. Inside here, we&#8217;ve installed a security door with badge-access only. We&#8217;ve also put a customer service window.&#8221; The election board is also considering using the Erie County Council caucus room as an overflow area, complete with a live stream of election workers as the canvass mail-in ballots. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very important that our election process is transparent,&#8221; said Chillcott. &#8220;We want people to have confidence in their vote. We want them to know that we take the election very seriously and there is election integrity here in our office.&#8221; The Erie County Board of Elections is expected to vote on the resolution on October 10.</span></p>

The charter change, which would’ve placed a proposal to eliminate the city’s standalone election to be aligned with the county, was voted down in a 3-4 vote with Morgantown Mayor M. Joe Abu-Ghannam. Deputy Mayor Jenny Selin and Councilors Bill Kawecki and Louise Michael voting against the proposal. “As a major city in the state, it’s something that we can do and that we have been doing, and I would like to continue having such elections,” said Morgantown Deputy Mayor Jenny Selin ahead of her ‘no’ vote. The charter change focused on the city election was the most contentiously debated proposal that was discussed by the members of the council. If it was passed, the proposal would’ve been placed before voters as part of the city’s upcoming election in April 2025, with the city elections being hosted as normal in April 2025 and 2027 before joining the county ballot starting in May 2028 if a simple majority vote was achieved. Councilor Brian Butcher, who voted in favor of the charter change along with Councilors Dave Harshbarger and Danielle Trumble, expressed a need to support some measures to improve municipal election voting numbers that have not peaked over 15 percent in over a half decade. “I think we’re pretty dismayed by the kind of participation that we’re getting right now and the absenteeism that we kind of have on boards and commissions,” said Butcher ahead of his ‘yes’ vote. “Maybe being on a May primary would allow us to have more of a prominence,” he said.</span></p>

Kalshi, an online platform where users can bet on the outcomes of future events, relaunched its congressional control contracts a few hours after the ruling, letting Americans bet on which party will control the House and Senate in 2025. It is unclear whether the New York-based startup will launch more election markets. A panel of three judges unanimously ruled this week that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which had argued that the wagers were illegal and could harm the integrity of elections, failed to demonstrate how it or the public “will be irreparably harmed while its appeal is heard.” “In short, the concerns voiced by the Commission are understandable given the uncertain effects that Congressional Control Contracts will have on our elections, which are the very linchpin of our democracy,” Judge Patricia Millett wrote for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. “But whether the statutory text allows the Commission to bar such event contracts is debatable, and the Commission has not substantiated that risks to election integrity are likely to materialize if Kalshi is allowed to operate its exchange during the pendency of this appeal.” The ruling allows the agency to make another bid to pause the ruling while the appeal plays out “should more concrete evidence of irreparable harm develop.”</span></p>

The September 26 settlement occurred during the jury selection process. A four-week trial was scheduled to begin in Delaware on September 30. Neither side made details of the settlement public. Smartmatic emailed a statement to NPR saying it is “very pleased to have secured the completion of the case against Newsmax.” The statement said Smartmatic is now shifting gears to focus on its related suits against Fox News and Fox Corp. Much like Dominion’s case against Fox, Smartmatic’s case against Newsmax centered on false statements made on dozens of television segments in late 2020 in which hosts, producers and guests linked the voting machine company to vote-switching conspiracy theories. Smartmatic operated only in Los Angeles County during the 2020 elections. No fraud was alleged there. Given California’s strong Democratic tilt, no influence could have affected the broader outcome. The network’s guests and hosts embraced allegations that Smartmatic software flipped votes during the election that year. In legal filings, Newsmax denied that it engaged in any defamatory action toward Smartmatic.</span></p>

Secretary of State Wes Allen on Aug. 13 announced a crackdown on what his office called “noncitizen voters,” saying that more than 3,500 people who were registered to vote had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security. His office did not specify when those voters had received the ID numbers. The Justice Department said Friday that the voter roll purge announcement took place 84 days before the Nov. 5 election and therefore violated the National Voter Registration Act. “As Election Day approaches, it is critical that Alabama redress voter confusion resulting from its list maintenance mailings sent in violation of federal law,” the Justice Department said in a news release announcing the lawsuit. “Officials across the country should take heed of the National Voter Registration Act’s clear and unequivocal restrictions on systematic list maintenance efforts that fall within 90 days of an election.” Allen’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the pending litigation, but the secretary of state said in a statement that it’s his “Constitutional duty to ensure that only Americans vote in our elections.”</span></p>

Liburdi said that under the rule all votes in a given county could be excluded if its officials fail to certify the results. The provision, the judge said, would give Fontes “nearly carte blanche authority to disenfranchise the ballots of potentially millions of Arizona voters.” Liburdi, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Donald Trump in 2019, said the provision would impose a severe burden on voters who may comply with voting requirements yet could be excluded based on the actions of public officials. The provision was challenged by the America First Policy Institute; another group, American Encore. which describes itself as a defender of freedom and promoter of free markets; and an Apache County voter. Lawyers representing Fontes defended the provision, arguing that the state’s interests in protecting Arizonans’ votes outweighs the speculative claims of harm by those who filed the lawsuit. In a statement, Fontes’ office said, “We are still reviewing the decision to determine our next step.”</span></p>

In a court hearing last week, Frank Barton, the chair of the Crittenden County Board of Election Commissioners, testified that he did not intend to hold early voting in West Memphis. Standerfer filed the suit against Barton and election commissioners Anita Bell and James Pulliaum on Sept. 19. On behalf of West Memphis voters Shirley Brown and Lavonda Taylor, Standerfer argued local election officials were abusing their power by refusing to prepare early voting sites, despite having designated locations. Thyer’s ruling sided with both parties. Repeating similar pleas from a hearing last week, he also asked both sides to appeal his ruling to the Arkansas Supreme Court for clarity on statutory construction. “This court certainly appreciates the deep water it has been thrown into and only hopes one or both of these parties appeal this decision so that this court and future litigants may know what this enigmatic statute [about early voting polling sites] means,” Thyer wrote.</span></p>

Eternal Vigilance Action amended its existing lawsuit on Wednesday to also challenge that rule adopted Friday by the board. The group, founded and led by former state Rep. Scot Turner, a Republican, was already suing the board over rules that it earlier adopted on certifying votes, a step that finalizes results. One of those rules provides for an undefined “reasonable inquiry” before county election officials certify while another allows county election officials “to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.” Turner’s lawsuit is scheduled for an Oct. 4 hearing before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox. Eternal Vigilance Action is asking Cox to overturn the rules, or at least put them on hold until after November’s presidential election.</span></p>

During a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/georgia-judge-signals-a-need-to-clarify-vague-new-election-certification-rule/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bench trial in the case </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney said the “reasonable inquiry” rule “on its face is vague and needs clarification.”  At several other points during the trial, McBurney also raised concerns about the election board changing election rules so close to this year’s contest, saying that “new rules seem to pop up every 20 minutes.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And the election is getting closer, not further away,” the judge said, pushing back on an argument from Republicans that intervened in the case to defend the new rules that his hands are tied by a judicial principle established in a 2006 Supreme Court case, Purcell v. Gonzalez. </span></p>

Three Republican members of the board met to approve two election rules at the meeting despite warnings from the attorney general’s office that it might not comply with the law. One rule allows more partisan poll monitors to observe ballot counting, while the other requires counties to post daily ballot tallies on their websites. American Oversight filed a lawsuit that sought to nullify the rules and fine the three election board members. The board members said they did nothing wrong. But the board voted again to approve the rules at a subsequent meeting. Cox dismissed the lawsuit. Though American Oversight sued the board and its members, the judge found the lawsuit should have named the state of Georgia as the defendant. It’s unclear whether American Oversight will refile the lawsuit with the state as the defendant.</span></p>

West and De la Cruz are not qualified to run for president in Georgia, the court ruled unanimously, marking a win for Democrats, who sought to keep the left-wing candidates off the ballot. A lawyer for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told justices during arguments September 24 that it was too late to change ballots, but if the court ruled against the candidates, Raffensperger’s office would place notices at polling places and within absentee ballot envelopes that votes for either candidate will not be counted. With this decision, Georgians will choose between Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Kamala Harris, Libertarian Chase Oliver and Green Party candidate Jill Stein on Nov. 5.</span></p>

Smith made many trips to her polling place in Muskegon County but was told that her address wasn&#8217;t turning up in an electronic roster of voters and that she wouldn&#8217;t be given a ballot on Nov. 8, 2022. By the evening, Holton Township Clerk Jill Colwell-Coburn told Smith “she was sorry but that there was nothing more she could do,” the lawsuit alleged. Smith said she had a voter registration receipt and a sticker to put on her driver&#8217;s license to show her new address. Smith&#8217;s attorneys said she could have been given a provisional ballot, which would have given local officials a few days to try to clear up the problem. “No voter should ever be treated like Ms. Smith,” attorney Mark Brewer said. A message seeking comment from an attorney for the township and clerk wasn&#8217;t immediately returned Monday.

The six members of the Fort Peck Reservation want satellite voting offices in their communities for late registration and to vote before Election Day without making long drives to a county courthouse. The plaintiffs in the Montana lawsuit reside in two small communities near the Canada border on the Fort Peck Reservation, home to the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Plaintiffs’ attorney Cher Old Elk grew up in one of those communities, Frazer, Montana, where more than a third of people live below the poverty line and the per capita income is about $12,000, according to census data. It’s a 60-mile round trip from Frazer to the election office at the courthouse in Glasgow. Old Elk says that can force prospective voters into difficult choices. “It’s not just the gas money; it’s actually having a vehicle that runs,” she said. “Is it food on my table, or is it the gas money to find a vehicle, to find a ride, to go to Glasgow to vote?” The lawsuit asks a state judge for an order forcing Valley and Roosevelt counties and Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen to create satellite election offices in Frazer and Poplar, Montana. The offices would be open during the same hours and on the same days as the county courthouses.</span></p>

The ACLU argues the action requested in the lawsuit would violate state and federal law that prohibits conducting systematic voter roll maintenance within 90 days of an election, which they say are part of a broader effort to disenfranchise voters nationwide. In an email, the Citizens Outreach Foundation, who filed the lawsuit, says they have requested that the Washoe County Registrar send out confirmation letters to voters and say that voters will not be removed unless they fail to return that letter. They are now urging the court to reject the attempt made by the Citizen Outreach Foundation. “This isn’t just about Washoe County. We’re seeing similar voter purge attempts across the country, targeting voters with flawed data and reckless methods. It’s a coordinated national plan with the same goal: to make it harder for people to vote. We’re standing up against this nationwide attack on voting rights and ensuring every eligible voter can cast their ballot,” said ACLU of Nevada executive director Athar Haseebullah.</span></p>

It will require all people registering to vote for the first time in New Hampshire to show a passport, birth certificate or naturalization papers at the polls to prove their citizenship, making New Hampshire one of the strictest states in the country for voter registration. The new law replaces the existing system that allows people to swear they are qualified to vote by signing a legally binding affidavit, if they didn’t have certain documents in hand when registering. The new measure also does away with any exemptions for registered voters who fail to bring an identification to the polls on Election Day. “The elimination of the affidavit option for New Hampshire registrants would have serious and irremediable impacts on qualified would-be New Hampshire voters seeking to participate in democratic elections,” the ACLU argues in its court filing. “Accordingly, the law poses an improper and unconstitutional burden on the right to vote unsupported by any legitimate or relevant state interest.” Lawyers for the plaintiffs also allege that the elimination of all affidavits could leave voters whose qualifications are challenged at the polls by partisan election observers with no way to cast a ballot.</span></p>

The suit, filed September 26 in state District Court, says the plaintiffs have been unable to register to vote ahead of the Nov. 5 election because of “unnecessary burdens and hurdles” caused by what they say are violations of the state Voting Rights Act. The law restored voting rights to people with felony convictions who are not currently behind bars. The lawsuit says the state’s system flags people with felony convictions as ineligible to vote, and Toulouse Oliver has “told county clerks to deny voter registrations from people with past felony convictions if they are flagged as having ever been convicted of a felony unless they appear in person to prove they are not currently in prison,” according to a post on the website of the Campaign Legal Center, the organization representing the plaintiffs. “The Secretary of State, Corrections Department, and county clerks have had over one year since the [act] went into effect to ensure that every eligible New Mexican can exercise their freedom to vote, but still have not done so,” the post says. “Now, on the eve of a major federal election, New Mexico voters are paying the price.” The Voting Rights Act, signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in March 2023, sought to ensure the voting rights of convicted felons the day they get out of prison, irrespective of parole or probation status, and instituted an automatic voter registration system through the Motor Vehicle Division. Previously, people with prior felony convictions couldn’t vote until they were off probation or parole.</span></p>

They argue Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s directive requiring people to fill out an attestation when returning someone else’s ballot amounts to making “new requirements and voting restrictions out of whole cloth.” At the end of July, a federal judge ruled that Ohio’s narrow list of family members legally allowed to return an absentee ballot on behalf of a relative would have to go — at least for disabled voters. Federal law guarantees people with disabilities can get help from anyone they want as long as it’s not their employer or union rep. The court ruled disabled Ohioans, and only disabled Ohioans, must be allowed to select an assistant of their choice. Despite that narrow ruling, LaRose urged state lawmakers to think about getting rid of drop boxes altogether. “I strongly encourage you to consider codifying any additional safeguards that might be necessary due to attempts to erode the integrity of our elections,” he wrote in an Aug. 29 letter, “including possibly banning drop boxes as a result of this court decision which makes it harder to guard against ballot harvesting.” In the meantime, he issued a directive requiring anyone returning a ballot for someone else to — whether they’re assisting a disabled voter or a family member — sign an attestation verifying that they are complying with state law. That directive is what is now being challenged.</span></p>

It follows a separate request from voting rights groups this week to Pennsylvania’s highest court for an expedited ruling on the date requirement. “The right to vote is one of the most important in this country,” said Janette Wallace, general counsel of the NAACP. “Ballots should not be rejected because of irrelevant errors. We will continue to fight so that voters’ voices may be heard. That’s why we’re taking this to the Supreme Court.” The case is one of several challenging the rules around mail ballot voting in Pennsylvania, and centers on whether the state’s requirement that voters handwrite a date on their mail ballot return envelope violates the materiality provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That provision says a person cannot be denied the right to vote because of “an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under State law to vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Luzerne County residents sued to overturn a local official’s announcement that she will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/luzerne-pennsylvania-mailin-ballots-drop-boxes-6c48f0d71924565881678e2a0114c7db"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent all four of its drop boxes from being deployed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for use by those voting by mail and absentee ballot in the Nov. 5 election. The lawsuit argues county manager Romilda Crocamo lacks authority for statements made last month that the county would not use drop boxes “because of purported safety and security concerns.” Drop boxes are used to hand over completed ballots by those who don’t want to put mail-in ballots through the mail. The voters who sued said the Luzerne County Board of Elections and Registration plans to deploy four drop boxes, as it has in other recent elections. The board in February voted down a proposal to eliminate all drop boxes, their lawsuit states. The lawsuit accuses Crocamo of violating state election law and it claims her policy will “lead to irreparable harm to the voting rights” in Luzerne. The plaintiffs want a county judge to stop Crocamo from implementing her decision.</span></p>

The ruling immediately halted the state’s ability to investigate alleged cases of vote harvesting, such as the investigation into the League of United Latin American Citizens by Attorney General Ken Paxton. Before the ruling, a person who knowingly provided or offered vote harvesting services in exchange for compensation was committing a third-degree felony. This meant that organizers of voter outreach organizations and even volunteers could spend up to ten years in prison and fined up to $10,000 for giving or offering these services. Paxton vowed to appeal the ruling. Before the law, organizations like OCA-Greater Houston, an advocacy organization for people of Asian and Pacific Island descent, would host in-person election events and allow attendees to bring their mail-in ballots in order to receive help like language assistance.</span></p>

The five-justice panel grilled attorneys for the Legislature earlier Wednesday before siding with opponents of the amendment who argued it would have been presented to voters in a misleading manner. Republican legislative leaders, who penned the ballot question, had asked the high court to overturn a district judge’s ruling and put Amendment D back before the public. The amendment would have given lawmakers constitutional authority to rewrite voter-approved ballot measures or repeal them entirely. Lawmakers also could have applied their new power to initiatives from past election cycles. But the summary that voters would have seen on their ballots only asked if the state constitution should be changed to “strengthen the initiative process” and to clarify the roles of legislators and voters. “The description does not submit the amendment to voters ‘with such clarity as to enable the voters to express their will,’” the high court wrote in its opinion.</span></p>

Janel Brandjten (R-Menomonee Falls), one of the Wisconsin Legislature’s most prominent election deniers, has sued the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) to </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/election-denying-state-rep-sues-wec-to-force-state-out-of-voter-data-sharing-organization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">force the state out of ERIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Brandjten filed the lawsuit last month in Waukesha County Circuit Court. Election conspiracy theorists have regularly targeted ERIC in recent years, and a number of Republican-controlled states have dropped out of the compact, despite its role in assisting state election officials in keeping voter rolls updated. Election deniers in Wisconsin and across the country have frequently complained that the voter rolls don’t get updated enough and leave the election system open to fraud.  Brandtjen brought the lawsuit despite voting in 2016 for a bill that required the state to enter into an agreement with ERIC. She is being represented by Kevin Scott, who worked as an attorney for former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman during his ill-fated review of the 2020 election. Scott represented Gableman in court during Gableman’s attempt to jail the mayors of Green Bay and Madison.  The case has been assigned to the circuit court of Judge Brad Schimel, the former Republican Attorney General under Gov. Scott Walker who is now running a campaign for a seat on the state Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a seven-page opinion, ruled that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/state-high-court-ruling-keeps-rfk-jr-on-wisconsins-presidential-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  “failed to demonstrate” that a Dane County judge had erred </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">when denying Kennedy’s petition for a court to remove him from the ballot.   Kennedy, running under a third-party banner, filed nomination papers in early August to be included among presidential candidates on the Wisconsin ballot. Kennedy subsequently dropped out of the race, endorsing former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Shortly before the Wisconsin Elections Commission met Aug. 27 to certify candidates, Kennedy wrote the commission seeking to withdraw as a candidate. The commission voted 5-1 to deny his request. Commission Chair Ann Jacobs cited a state law that candidates who file nomination papers and qualify to run cannot withdraw and must remain on the ballot, unless they die. Kennedy sued in Dane County Circuit Court, asking the judge to review the commission’s decision but also seeking a temporary injunction that would order the commission to remove his name from the ballot. Judge Stephen Ehlke denied Kennedy’s requests, ruling that state law does not allow a candidate to withdraw from the presidential race after filing nomination papers. After Kennedy’s lawyer appealed the state Supreme Court approved the elections commission’s request to bypass the appeals court. According to the Supreme Court’s majority opinion, appellate briefs Kennedy’s lawyers filed in the case were inadequate for the court to review his claims of harm or of his potential for success. “Consequently, because there is no basis in this appeal on which we could determine that the circuit court erroneously exercised its discretion, we must affirm the circuit court’s order denying Kennedy’s motion for a temporary injunction,” the opinion states.</span></p>
