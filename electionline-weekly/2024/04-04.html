</b><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contra Costa, Calif. election observer program</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t always have to recreate the wheel when creating a new program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While election office tours are routinely available to the public, the team in <a href="https://www.contracostavote.gov/elections/">Contra Costa County, California</a> saw an opportunity to expand those tours into a new outreach program as a way to further combat misinformation, election skepticism, and public mistrust of elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10991" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO1-236x300.png" alt="" width="236" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO1-236x300.png 236w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO1.png 604w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /> In June of 2022, in conjunction with the primary election, staff piloted the first <a href="https://www.contracostavote.gov/wp-content/uploads/Website-page-for-CEO-program.pdf">Certified Election Observer (CEO) Program</a>, giving constituents an intensive, guided, multi-day, “behind the scenes” tour of the entire elections process in Contra Costa County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The program has worked for us since day one,” said Tommy Gong, deputy county clerk-recorder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO Program offers Contra Costa residents an opportunity to follow the elections process from beginning to end and to learn why and how each part of the process is important and protects voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is rigorous with a combination of online and in-person sessions that provide a complete elections experience and understanding. There are up to four personal visits scheduled to the election office to observe processes related to the vote counting system, vote-by-mail ballot processing, and canvass activities. Polling place activities include attending a poll worker training class and visiting an early voting site or polling place on Election Day. The total time each applicant is expected to dedicate to the program is approximately 12-14 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program begins with the public logic and accuracy test of the voting system during an election cycle and includes a facility tour, observation of the machinery used to sort ballot envelopes, presentations from staff on the path a ballot takes, and review of security measures among other parts of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After each part of the election process has been observed/explained, the participants receive a stamp from the election staff member who leads that part of the process in a specially designed passport to designate completion of that segment. According to Gong, the passport gives the program a fun way to highlight each destination in the elections journey for the participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10992" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO2-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO2-300x164.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO2-1024x560.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO2-768x420.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO2-1536x840.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO2-2048x1120.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />As with any new program, costs are always one of the first questions people may have. Is this doable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With election officials being resourceful, we created and launched the CEO with no upfront costs other than the time involved with creating the materials and scheduling the days the CEO members would visit,” Gong explained. “Today, the program is part of our outreach and education team’s activities, which coordinates with election operations for scheduling and to provide their portion of the tour. It does involve time, but we see it as an investment to build public trust, a way for observers to join when they happen to show up, and a venue for us to formalize the observation process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the limited space, the maximum number of participants in each cohort is 10 people. Upon completion of the program, the newly minted CEOs receive a certificate of appreciation and a special CEO pin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10993" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO3-186x300.png" alt="" width="186" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO3-186x300.png 186w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO3-634x1024.png 634w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CCCEO3.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />According to Gong, the typical class membership has come from League of Women Voter members and recommendations by county supervisors. However, since the program has become more visible they’ve recently had members of conservative-leaning groups participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All in all, everyone has been very congenial. Although some may disagree with some of the laws or policies in California set in statute, they are impressed with all the work we do to ensure the integrity of elections,” Gong said.” It’s up to us to shine a light on all the things we do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback from participants and county officials has been positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ‘graduate’ the CEO members in front of the county supervisors during the same meeting when we certify the results of the election” Gong explained. “County leadership has been very supportive of the program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the board of supervisors have been promoting the program with their constituents and during the programs’ third cohort there were representatives from all five supervisorial districts in the county. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After each program, we have asked for feedback from our participants and in each of the cohorts, every one of the participants have expressed their surprise at some part of the process that they were unaware of previously,” Gong said. “Providing this awareness and understanding of the elections process to members of the public is one of the primary goals of the program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, the office is currently developing a program to bring the CEO Program “on the road” into schools and focused on age-appropriate techniques to teach students in grades 3-12 about the election process in Contra Costa County. And that’s just the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe jurisdictions will shift observation as a necessary evil to an opportunity to educate and build trust in elections,” Gong said. “[Officials] have to find the balance of educating vs overwhelming the [public] with facts and details.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Contra Costa County CEO program received a <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2023-Contra-Costa-County-Certified-Election-Observer-Program.pdf">paper of merit</a> acknowledgement as part of the Election Center’s 2023 Professional Practice Paper In Election Administration and Voter Registration and Gong was chosen by his peers to <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CEO-Program-Presentation.pdf">present the paper</a> at the 2024 Election Center Special Workshop in Nashville, Tennessee in February. </span></p>

With 90% of ballots counted, 54% of voters approved a ban in the Wisconsin Constitution on private grants to help offset the cost of election administration, and 58% approved an amendment stipulating that only election officials “designated by law” can handle tasks relating to election administration. A special election was held in </span><a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/kansas-city-voters-told-remove-chiefs-royals-gear/60372995#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas City, Missouri </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to determine public financing for stadiums.

The vote was split along party lines by the members of the Board of Elections and Elections Administrator Clint Ludwig recused himself from the vote, saying he did not want to vote on an agenda item that directed him to perform a task. Seven speakers at the Election Board meeting spoke in favor of purchasing the prenumbered ballots, and five spoke against it. Using prenumbered ballots, the elections administration will instead assign them to the county’s polling locations. There, voters will now select prenumbered ballots that have been laid out on a table and mixed up to preserve the secrecy of the people’s vote. At the end of the night, the election judge will track which ballots were used, which ballots were spoiled, and which ballots went unused. The county will then store the unused prenumbered ballots for three years before destroying them along with the rest of the election records, as required by state law. Blank ballot paper costs the county $290 for every 1,000 ballots. Prenumbered ballots would cost $320 for every 1,000 ballots purchased by the city. The cost difference would be $39,000 per election, County Judge Tim O’Hare estimates about $13,000 worth of ballots would be wasted during the Nov. 5 presidential election. Tarrant County will hold four elections in 2024, if Tarrant County used prenumbered ballots for all four elections, it would result in about $52,000 worth of extra ballot paper. Only two other Texas counties use prenumbered ballots. </span></p>

According to the Arizona Republic, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer is exploring using artificial intelligence to aid in pulling data from voter registration forms and other recorded documents. </span><a href="https://www.bidsync.com/bidsync-app-web/vendor/links/BidDetail.xhtml?bidid=2126618&amp;returnPage=searchResults"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bid proposal put out by his office in March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeks applicants for &#8220;a solution to improve processes around document identification, data extraction, and comparing handwritten signature images with on-file signature images by way of artificial intelligence.&#8221; He hopes to use the technology to &#8220;improve internal processes and streamline workflow,&#8221; according to the pitch. The move could greatly reduce his staff&#8217;s workload. Spokesperson Sierra Ciaramella said Recorder&#8217;s Office employees spend &#8220;thousands&#8221; of hours per week reviewing and manually processing papers that come in to be officially documented. Ciaramella said any artificial intelligence tool would not be used to verify voter signatures on early ballots, and any documents recorded with assistance from artificial intelligence would be subject to a human check. &#8220;We are exploring tools to help us process and index recorded documents and paper voter registration forms so we can better utilize county resources, while ensuring staff continues to review everything,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Anything having to do with signatures is strictly limited to the recordation function of our office.&#8221;</span></p>

Petitioners looking to put the issue up for a reconsideration vote on the June primary ballot were still thousands of signatures short of the total required to qualify as of a late March deadline. Jeni Dodd, a Great Falls resident who spearheaded the effort, confirmed for Montana Free Press last week that petitioners had managed to collect fewer than 2,000 signatures of the roughly 7,300 needed. Dodd attributed the shortfall to the suddenness of the commission’s action, lack of widespread awareness of the petition effort and what she characterized as a narrow timeframe allowed in state law.

In the episode Larry David is arrested for violating the 2021 law when he offers a bottle of water to someone standing in line to vote. Jeff Schaffer, one of the show’s executive producers,</span><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-david-trump-mugshot-season-12-episode-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TheWrap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he immediately decided to focus on the law after he saw coverage of it in 2021. “We were always going to Atlanta because of that barbaric law that you can’t give anybody water or food when they’re in line for voting,”</span><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-david-trump-mugshot-season-12-episode-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schaffer said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When we were talking about stories, Larry said: ‘This law is insane. I think it’d be funny if I got arrested for that.’” Needless to say, this </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/with-enthusiasm-raffensperger-advises-larry-david-to-curb-attacks-on-voter-law/GW5XLU53EFE6BIOYRTLSZW2S7Y/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caught the attention of folks in the secretary of state’s office including Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Raffensperger offered tongue-in-cheek kudos to David for becoming the first “and to our knowledge, only person” arrested for running afoul of a provision in Georgia’s 2021 voting law forbidding the distribution of food or beverages to voters waiting within 150 feet of a polling site. The Republican tried to capture the spirit of “Curb” in his tone, and it was pretty on the nose. “We apologize if you didn’t receive celebrity treatment at the local jail,” Raffensperger wrote in a letter obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution through a public records request. “I’m afraid they’ve gotten used to bigger stars. It’s the TMZ of mugshots.” The tongue-in-cheek letter continues, “Given the obvious concern you have about access to voting in Georgia, you’ll be glad to hear that waiting times for all voters, including Leon’s aunt, in the last two major elections were under two minutes, even as we experienced record turnout.”</span></p>

A panel of experts selected the top designs from each category, then the designs were presented to the public for voting in January 2024.  The adult and youth design winners will be printed on stickers that will accompany 2024 ballots (about 430,000 for each election) for the state primary in June and the general election in November.

Dubbed the </span><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2024/04/03/new-legislation-seeks-to-increase-voter-registration-among-youth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High School Voter Registration Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the legislation would ensure all high school students in California, starting with the 2026-27 school year, receive the opportunity and resources necessary to pre-register to vote at least once by the end of their 11th grade year. The goal of the legislation is to get a variety of resources into students’ hands, including information on whether and when they’re eligible to vote, what kind of services they could receive from the county elections office and about the secretary of state’s online voter registration tool at registertovote.ca.gov. Students would also be introduced to the Student Poll Worker program, which allows high schoolers age 16 and older who are U.S. citizens and maintain a 2.5 grade point average to earn a stipend working at the polls on Election Day. And if a student or their parent or guardian asks for a paper copy of a voter registration card, schools would be required to provide it. The legislation would largely leave it up to schools and education boards to decide how to provide these resources to students, but suggests engagement could be done in class or through family information sessions and school counselors. Under the legislation, schools and education boards would also be allowed to contract with a third-party nonprofit with “demonstrated experience providing nonpartisan youth civic engagement” to implement the law. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the proposals in Landry’s package is</span><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&amp;b=SB218&amp;sbi=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 218</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen. It would make it a criminal offense to give an absentee ballot application form to two or more people who are not immediate family members. It would also make it a crime to place application forms in a mailbox or deliver them by any other means to a parish registrar for two or more people who aren’t immediate relatives.  The Senate passed the bill in a 26-10 floor vote, sending it to the House for consideration.  A provision in the bill would require parish registrars to record the name, address and relationship of any person providing assistance to a voter during an early voting period and whether the helper was being paid to provide the assistance. The prohibition would apply to the application form voters have to fill out just to request an absentee ballot. Those forms are available for the public to save and print from the Louisiana Secretary of State’s website and can be delivered by hand, mail or fax to the parish registrar’s office. Kleinpeter’s bill would also effectively prohibit assisted living facilities, retirement communities and other group homes from providing application forms to their residents and placing them in a mailbox. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=246264"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 506</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Polly Thomas, R-Metairie. Thomas’ bill would require voter registration groups to first register with the Louisiana Secretary of State before holding any registration drives. Requiring groups to register with the secretary of state would allow election officials to keep track of voter drives and contact volunteers to make sure they fill out forms correctly and turn them in, according to the Secretary of State. The House passed Thomas’ bill in a 73-27 vote and transferred it to the Senate for consideration.</span></p>

The 32-12 vote clears the way for Diane Butler to serve on the board. The Ellicott City resident faced additional scrutiny because of a social media post and emails attributed to the former Howard County elections official. “I think one of the qualifications that we need to consider when selecting members of the state board of elections is their temperament,” said Senate Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee Vice Chair Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery), who spoke at length in opposition to the nominee Friday. “Another is their judgment. I have found this nominee to be severely lacking on both.” Butler faced tough questions earlier this month over a social media post and emails attributed to her. In one 2021 post about mask mandates during the COVID pandemic, a comment attributed to Butler compared the masks to “Nazi armbands.” Butler, during her March 12 testimony, said she could not remember the post. In other 2021 emails, Butler writes to a state board of elections staff member raising concerns about custody of ballots, absentee balloting, and staffing. Butler, however, was defended by Republicans and some Democrats on the Senate floor.</span></p>

Hill, R-Picayune, did not conduct a single committee meeting over the last two weeks to consider any House bills that the lieutenant governor’s office referred to her committee for consideration. The Pearl River County lawmaker wouldn’t substantively comment on why she declined to advance any bills.  “The constitution speaks for itself,” Hill said. This was the closest ex-felon voting rights restoration had ever gotten to passage in Mississippi. Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of any of 10 felonies — including perjury, arson and bigamy — lose their voting rights for life. A 2009 opinion from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office expanded the list of disenfranchising felonies to 22. Mississippi is one of only a handful of states that does not automatically restore voting rights to people who complete their sentences. About 37,900 names are on the Secretary of State’s voter disenfranchisement list as of Jan. 29. The House overwhelmingly passed legislation last month that created an automatic process for people previously convicted of some nonviolent felony offenses to have their voting rights restored.  A bipartisan pair of House members told Mississippi Today on Tuesday afternoon they were disheartened to hear that Hill declined to advance their measure in committee, given that a large majority of Republicans and Democrats supported the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi will remain one of only three states that </span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2024/04/01/early-voting-mississippi-legislature-kills-absentee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not have in-person early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a House committee chairman killed legislation last week. House Elections Chairman Noah Sanford said in a committee meeting last week that he will not bring up Senate Bill 2580. The bill would have allowed 15 days of no-excuse early voting before election day. Sanford said he received concerns over the plan from some county circuit clerks, the local officials who administer elections.  “Some circuit clerks around the state had concerns that they might have to hire an additional deputy clerk to administer early voting,” Sanford said. Instead, Sanford, a Republican from Collins, said he would like to conduct some hearings in the summer or fall to examine the issue further and allow circuit clerks and others to present information. He said that after the hearings he would be more open to passing early voting legislation.  Mississippi currently allows in-person absentee voting before elections, but voters must meet criteria, such as being over 65 or disabled, or provide one of a handful of valid “excuses,” such as being out of town for work on election day and follow a long list of rules and procedures. But Mississippi does not have no-excuse absentee voting or any type of early voting. The Senate measure would have “no-excuse” voting for all registered voters and eliminate in-person absentee voting. It also would have required voters to present a valid photo ID to vote early.</span></p>

Sponsored by State Rep. Peggy McGaugh, the bill passed with the hopes of bringing about</span><a href="https://newstalkkzrg.com/2024/04/02/missouri-house-passes-comprehensive-election-reform-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several crucial changes to election administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state. HB 2140 addresses various aspects of the electoral process, from updating filing dates for candidacy declarations to enhancing protections for election officials. The bill also introduces measures aimed at safeguarding the integrity of absentee voting and expands access to provisional ballots. Here is a breakdown of the key provisions and changes proposed in the bill; Notification of Elections via Email: The bill allows the officer or agency responsible for calling an election to notify the election authority via email. Changes to Filing Dates for Declaration of Candidacy: The bill alters the opening and closing dates for filing a declaration of candidacy for offices in political subdivisions or special districts. In-Person Voting for Covered Voters: Covered voters, including those eligible to register to vote, interstate former residents, and new residents, may now vote at the office of the election authority on Election Day for presidential and vice presidential electors. Confidentiality of Lists of Absentee Voters with Permanent Disabilities: The bill specifies that lists of absentee voters with permanent disabilities shall be kept confidential and not be publicly displayed or shown to unauthorized persons. Signature Verification for Absentee Ballots: Election authorities are required to compare the signature on the absentee ballot envelope with the signature on the voter’s registration record. Inconsistent signatures will result in rejection of the ballot. Expansion of Provisional Ballots: Provisional ballots, previously available only at elections with federal or statewide candidates or measures, are now available at any public election. New Election Offenses and Penalties: Threatening or harassing election officials, attempting to pressure them to violate election laws, and doxxing them or their families are designated as election offenses, with varying degrees of severity. Extension of Electioneering Restrictions: Restrictions on electioneering activities, previously applicable only near polling locations on Election Day, are extended to locations where in-person absentee voting occurs during the absentee voting period. Circulating initiative and referendum petitions are also added to the list of prohibited activities near polling locations. Creation of Missouri Elections Sovereignty Act: This act reserves the right for the State of Missouri to determine the time, place, and manner of its state elections, asserting that federal laws regulating elections shall apply only to federal elections. HB 2140 received bipartisan support during its passage through the House. The bill will now move to the Missouri Senate for further consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate gave initial approval to a resolution that would ban ranked choice voting in the state. If approved by the House, it would be sent to the ballot for voters to decide on later this year. </span><a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/24info/bts_web/bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=433"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate joint resolution (SJR) 78</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Sen. Ben Brown, R-Washington, would also ban noncitizens from voting in any elections within Missouri, including local and county elections. This is already law. The resolution was approved on a voice vote after almost 45 minutes of negotiations between Brown and Sen. Karla May, D-St. Louis.</span></p>

Currently, there is a separate state form to cancel voter registrations, which the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Gary Click said is rarely used. The result is that there is some number of voters who are registered in multiple counties at once, he said. The new standard voter registration form would add a line where voters can list their most recent address. The proposed law would require elections officials to use that information, if it showed the voter has moved to a different county, to notify elections officials in the previous county where that voter lived. If a voter moved to Ohio from a different state, elections officials would have to notify the top state elections official in the voters’ former state. But the field would only be optional, and wouldn’t prevent anyone from voting if they didn’t complete it, he said. He said he got the idea after his son moved to a different state temporarily and forgot to cancel his Ohio voter registration while he was gone. “I think it streamlines the process it makes it easier for everyone. There’s no compulsion, there’s no consequences. It’s just convenience,” Click said.</span></p>

The bill is authored by Rep. Regina Goodwin, R-Tulsa, and Sen. George Young, D-Oklahoma City. HB1629 attempts to </span><a href="https://www.kswo.com/2024/03/30/oklahoma-bill-seeks-clarify-voting-rights-after-commutations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clarify state statutes on voting rights for citizens convicted of a felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who’ve received a commutation or pardon. Specifically, the bill allows those convicted of a felony to immediately register to vote after their original sentence is commuted, instead of having to wait until their original sentence time frame is finished. The Senate author for the bill, Democrat George Young, said there’s been confusion surrounding voter eligibility for years, and believes this will help spark those individuals to become more politically involved. “I think particularly for people, individuals who have gone through difficult times who wants to be a part of the system, who wants a voice in where this state is going, I think it opens up a great possibility of them seeing themselves more involved, more invested in what’s happening in our state,” Young said. “They can now vote for their representatives, their senators, they can vote for governor, they can vote on the policies and issues of the state. So, I think psychologically, it has a very very big impact upon the state of Oklahoma.”</span></p>

Mark Gordon recommending, with a 7-2 vote, that he </span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/03/29/legislative-council-says-gordon-should-reject-chuck-grays-voter-registration-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reject Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s proposed rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to tighten voter registration requirements at the polls. If approved by the governor, the new rules would require people registering to vote in Wyoming an additional requirement to prove residency if their form of identification doesn’t already show it. The letter argued that the proposed rules don’t fall within the scope of authority granted to the secretary of state. This is a similar argument to the one made by legislators who spoke against Gray’s rules at a Jan. 26 hearing on the matter, although most of the people who attended the meeting expressed support for the rules. Gray said the rules are within his statutory authority and the LSO memo ignores that his rules solely require proof of Wyoming residence. “Our rulemaking ensures that only Wyomingites are able to vote in Wyoming, not non-residents and illegal aliens,” Gray told Cowboy State Daily. “As did some members of the Management Council, I disagree with the Legislative Service Office’s recommendation and analysis, and would encourage the governor to sign the rules as written to ensure illegal immigrants cannot vote in Wyoming elections.” State Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, R-Cheyenne, a member of the council who voted against accepting Gray’s rules, told Cowboy State Daily there appears to be an ongoing trend at play. “It’s certainly concerning considering state statute doesn’t give him that authority to make these changes,” Zwonitzer said of Gray’s rules. “It’s the second time in six months the Legislature has said that we think he’s exceeding his authority in this realm.”</span></p>

The named defendants in the case are Division of Elections Director Carol Beecher, the Division of Elections, and Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstom — who oversees Alaska elections. In an email, Beecher said the complaint is “under review” and directed questions to the Department of Law. Dahlstrom, a Republican running for U.S. House, directed questions to the Department of Law through her chief of staff Kelly Howell. Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson for the department, said the complaint was received and was being reviewed.</span></p>

Cavanaugh cites emails from a so-called whistleblower, someone claiming to work with Lewis, who says Lewis spread rumors the supervisor is secretly recording her conversations. Cavanaugh, who’s now running for Pinal County sheriff, claims Lewis defamed him by accusing him of making those recordings. Cavanaugh is demanding $456,000 in damages and wants Lewis removed from office. The emails, obtained by KJZZ, mostly contain claims that the county’s ballot security and tabulation systems are unsecure – and that Lewis allowed the county to use election machines she knew were faulty. “The issues that have been brought up were potential problems that had to do with machines or equipment, perhaps human error,” Cavanaugh said. “Those things need to be examined.” Cavanaugh also claims Pinal County Attorney Kent Volkmer did not thoroughly investigate the whistleblower’s claims after Cavanaugh shared them with the attorney’s office. According to KJZZ, Lewis could not be reached for comment.</span></p>

Newsmax and the voting technology company Smartmatic could still reach an out-of-court settlement, and further delays are possible. But if the September 24 trial date holds, the fallout from former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election will be on full display as he tries to return to the White House. The trial would also be the first of more than a dozen high-profile defamation cases to face a jury, all stemming from the false claims that Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems rigged the 2020 election by flipping millions of votes from Trump to Joe Biden. Those lies — championed by Trump and his allies in Congress and the right-wing press — fueled the deadly insurrection on January 6, 2021. The Newsmax trial is slated to take place in Delaware Superior Court, and Judge Eric Davis, who presided over the historic case brought by Dominion against Fox News last year, is similarly handling the Newsmax-Smartmatic lawsuit. The case is still in the discovery phase, and it’s possible Davis decides later that it shouldn’t proceed to trial. Smartmatic filed the lawsuit in 2021, claiming that Newsmax intentionally promoted lies that the company was involved in rigging the election because it helped the network close the ratings gap with Fox.</span></p>

Ross determined that a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/29/dc-ranked-choice-lawsuit-dismissed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit to stop an open primary/ranked choice voting ballot initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was filed prematurely and affirmed the city’s motion to dismiss the case. The campaign to open up primaries to independent voters and bring ranked-choice voting to the city launched in May and later became known as Initiative 83. It would allow more than 73,000 people registered as “unaffiliated” with a party to vote in DC’s primary elections, which are closed to those voters, starting in 2026. It would also implement a ranked-choice balloting system. Initiative 83 has drawn opposition from the D.C. Democratic Party, which filed this lawsuit and a previous one last summer. The first lawsuit was withdrawn in November 2023. In both suits, the D.C. Democratic Party argued that the measure violates the U.S. Constitution and Home Rule charter.</span></p>

Pritchard must pay a $5,000 fine and receive a public reprimand from the State Election Board, according to the decision. Prichard has said he didn’t do anything wrong and thought he had completed his probation before voting in Georgia. But that didn’t convince the judge in the case. “The court does not find the respondent’s explanations credible or convincing,” Boggs wrote in her 25-page decision. “At the very least, even if the court accepts he did not know about his felony sentences, the record before this court demonstrates that he should have known.” Pritchard, who currently hosts a talk show, has repeatedly claimed that the 2020 election was stolen through voter fraud. </span></p>

In May 2022 Rep. Michael Bost (R-12th) and two other GOP officials sued the state board of elections, hoping to enjoin a state statute which allows for mail-in ballots to be counted up to two calendar weeks after election day. U.S. District Judge John Kness tossed the case in July 2023, finding the trio lacked standing. Kness said the injuries Bost and his fellow plaintiffs claim they&#8217;ve suffered under the law — spending more on their campaigns, diluting votes in their favor, the specter of voter fraud — were too hypothetical and &#8220;not certainly impending&#8221; to justify the suit. The three-judge appellate panel raised the same concern, grilling Bost&#8217;s attorney Russell Nobile over what concrete injuries the congressman might suffer as a result of the law. The appellate panel took the case under advisement but didn&#8217;t say when it would issue a ruling.</span></p>

Four months will be served in prison and four months will be home confinement. She will also have two years of supervised release immediately after her release from prison. She will also pay a special assessment of $5,200. Not only a fraction of the maximum sentence, but much less than the government had asked for. The judge said guidelines called for a sentence of 18-24 months, but he says that’s not justified in this case. Taylor was found guilty of 50 counts of voter fraud earlier this year. </span></p>

The incident happened on Dec. 15 at the county complex in Pontiac. A release from the prosecutor&#8217;s office said officials were overseeing the recount of several local elections from November last year when Hess made the alleged statement. He walked out of a room where votes that were cast during local elections in Oakland County were being recounted and stated &#8220;Hang Joe for treason.&#8221; Prosecutor Karen McDonald said the threats made against election workers impact not just their work, but democracy in general. &#8220;We need dedicated, ethical public servants to conduct that process, and to do it transparently – we should invite public scrutiny. But there are individuals who seek to undermine the integrity of the election process by threatening and intimidating election workers and supervisors,&#8221; she said. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $20,000 if he&#8217;s convicted.</span></p>

Last year, the Minnesota Legislature passed and Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill that restored the right to vote to over 55,000 Minnesotans who were convicted of a felony and are no longer in prison, allowing them to vote while still on parole, probation or supervised release. Prior to the 2023 law, felons had to wait until they were off probation, parole or supervised release and paid their fines or restitution; given Minnesota’s lengthy probation sentences, that could mean years. The conservative group challenged the new statute last year, arguing the Legislature had exceeded its authority granted under the Minnesota Constitution. The Upper Midwest Law Center, a right-wing public interest law firm, filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Alliance.  The Minnesota Voters Alliance constitutional challenge relies on a grammar point in the restoration of “civil rights.” The justices seemed skeptical of the Minnesota Voters Alliance’s emphasis on civil rights in the singular versus in the plural. </span></p>

The decision is potentially a grave blow to the state’s powerful political machines, which have for decades used the so-called county line to prop up their endorsed candidates. The system is currently used in 19 of the Garden State’s 21 counties. The preliminary injunction is almost certain to be appealed, but, for now, it means that New Jersey voters will use office block ballots – the standard across most of the country – during the June primary. The lawsuit was brought by Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who is running for the seat of incumbent Sen. Bob Menendez, and two other South Jersey-based House candidates, who argued that the current system is unconstitutional. Quraishi’s order includes specific language barring county elections officials from organizing their ballots “by column or row” and replacing it with a “randomized ballot order system … which affords each candidate for the same office an equal chance at obtaining the first ballot position.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/03/new-jersey-ballot-andy-kim-00150411"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied a request from county clerks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to block the lower court’s decision that would eliminate the state’s unique ballot design for the June Democratic primary.

They joined county clerks from Burlington and Hudson Counties, who said prior to the 3rd Circuit’s decision that they would not appeal the decision.</span></p>

In the 329-page ruling Browning found that the National Voter Registration Act preempts state restrictions. He stated that he was concurring with other federal courts that have considered the issue. Voters Reference Foundation sued election officials in Pennsylvania over similar records requests, and the state of Maine failed in its recent effort to protect its state voter records from being posted online. The New Mexico legal case dates back to 2022. Voters Reference Foundation had initially posted New Mexico voting records from April 2021 after obtaining them through an out-of-state company. However, it removed them from its website at the request of New Mexico election regulators who contended that the foundation’s website violated state restrictions on the purchase and dissemination of voter registration records. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, contended that state law permits voter rolls to be used for campaign or government activity only. A spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office  said the agency will appeal the ruling to the 10th Circuit Court and will ask for a stay pending the appeal.</span></p>

Schroeder rejected motions from defendants who include Republican legislative leaders and the State Board of Elections. The lawsuits target a 2023 law that changes when election officials can disqualify a vote cast by someone who registered the same day during the 17-day early voting period. Defendants had sought to dismiss the lawsuit following changes made to the state’s law. But Schroeder noted that under state law, rules the State Board of Elections rewrites in response to a court decision are temporary. In this case, the changes expire in early 2025. Schroeder acknowledged that it&#8217;s likely the General Assembly will pass a law to make the state board&#8217;s rules permanent. But for now, the rules remain temporary, he wrote, and legislators haven&#8217;t shown that the “interim rule moots the complaint.” In separate orders denying dismissals of the lawsuits, the judge, who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, also wrote that the plaintiffs had legal standing to sue or that their allegations surpassed a low plausibility threshold. The judge also set a June 3 trial date for one of these lawsuits, filed by Democracy North Carolina, the North Carolina Black Alliance and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina.</span></p>

A lower court has ordered the state to adopt redistricting maps proposed by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewas and the Spirit Lake Nation. The ruling would enforce parity for the reservations’ electorate in the upcoming 2024 races. Secretary of State Michael Howe appealed the case to the 8th Circuit Court. The tribes responded by filing a motion on March 14 to quash the North Dakota appeal. “We hope and expect this challenge to North Dakota’s Native voters, and voting rights generally, to be rejected in line with decades of precedent,” said Mark Gaber, senior director of redistricting at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. Gaber contributed to a March 18 brief reiterating that the state’s 2021 redistricting map violates the federal Voting Rights Act and raises concerns over threats to dilute the Native vote. The Native American Rights Fund released the brief. “In this case, North Dakota was sued under two laws: Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects each citizen from racially discriminatory voting restrictions and Section 1983, which allows any U.S. citizen to sue when their rights are violated,” said NARF Staff Attorney Michael Carter. The earlier court ruling declared that the 2021 state legislative map for North Dakota dilutes the votes of Native Americans living in the northeastern part of the state. According to the case document, plaintiffs proved at trial that North Dakota’s map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 2 prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate based on race, color, or membership in one of the language minority groups.</span></p>

The decision means she is formally acquitted of the felony voting charge. The court said in the decision that there was no evidence Mason knew she was ineligible to vote when she cast her ballot — which is a condition that must be met in order to convict her of illegal voting. Mason has maintained throughout the seven-year case that she did not know she was ineligible and would not have risked her freedom if she had. She said Thursday in a statement that her long legal fight, which gained international attention, was devastating. “I am overjoyed to see my faith rewarded today,” Mason said. “I was thrown into this fight for voting rights and will keep swinging to ensure no one else has to face what I’ve endured for over six years, a political ploy where minority voting rights are under attack.” The Second Court of Appeals initially upheld her conviction but two years ago was instructed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to “evaluate the sufficiency” of the evidence against Mason, saying that the lower court had “erred by failing to require proof that [Mason] had actual knowledge that it was a crime for her to vote while on supervised release.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge David Peeples, a visiting judge from Bexar County heard arguments this week in t</span><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/redo-2022-harris-county-judicial-election-19382204.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he last trial contesting the 2022 election in Harris County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Peebles was tasked last year with all 21 lawsuits filed by unsuccessful Republican candidates challenging their election outcomes. While Peeples has previously upheld election results, he could be persuaded to order a redo in this final race given the razor-thin margin. He upheld the results in 15 other cases as well, and another three candidates dropped their lawsuits before his ruling. Lunceford&#8217;s case is currently on appeal. While Harris County&#8217;s midterm elections were marred by a ballot paper shortage on election day that impaired voting at around 20 out of 782 polling locations, Republican candidates&#8217; grievances eventually expanded to include numerous allegations concerning election errors and illegal votes. Peeples did not indicate when to expect a decision. In November, he issued a 36-page ruling three months after the trial concluded. Pierce&#8217;s attorney asked the judge to expedite his judgment in this case.</span></p>

Hansen is accused of forging the date on a test of the county’s voting machines, according to charging documents. Documentation of the test — which is required for every county clerk’s office in the state — was later sent to the Utah lieutenant governor’s office, which suspected the document had been forged. In charging documents, prosecutors alleged Hansen altered the document using software on his computer. Hansen resigned from his job as an elections coordinator with the Cache County clerk/auditor’s office days before he was charged. Hansen appeared in person before Judge Angela Fonnesbeck on Monday. He spoke once during the short hearing, responding “OK” after Fonnesbeck outlined the next steps in his case. Hansen’s attorney, Jonathan Nish, said during the brief hearing he was not yet ready to set a preliminary hearing date. Hansen’s next court appearance was then scheduled for June 10.</span></p>

A lower court judge recently enacted a remedial map after claims of Latino vote dilution, but the Republicans say the new map is more discriminatory than the first.  “Far from preserving the existing enacted map as much as practical, as binding precedent demands, the remedial map here made sweeping and needless alterations — almost all uniformly benefiting one political party,” the Republicans&#8217; attorney Jason Torchinsky of Holtzman Vogel wrote in their emergency appeal.  The court did not explain its denial of the emergency application. There were no noted dissents.  In 2022, voting rights groups claimed in a lawsuit that legislative maps redrawn after the 2020 census intentionally split Latino voters into several districts in the Yakima Valley region. The groups said the redistricting commission created a “facade Latino opportunity district” but in fact diluted Latino voting power.</span></p>

Tony Evers (D) is asking the state Supreme Court to roll back its 2022 ruling that </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/governor-files-brief-calling-on-state-supreme-court-to-allow-ballot-drop-boxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibited using drop boxes </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to receive absentee ballots in elections. </span><a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2024/04/02/file_attachments/2833746/Evers_Drop%20Boxes%20Brief.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed this week on Evers’ behalf states that the 2022 ban by the former majority created a prohibition that was nowhere in Wisconsin election law. That decision “rewrote the text of the law through a circuitous analysis that ended with new, confusing rules for election administration,” the brief asserts. Municipal clerks who administer elections cover jurisdictions ranging from fewer than two dozen voters to more than 300,000, the brief argues. The 2022 decision “imposed one-size-fits-all, judicially created constraints on these municipal clerks’ authority to administer elections in a manner that is both responsive to the needs of their unique communities and compliant with the law,” it states. “The right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy,” the brief adds. “Such an important right warrants every effort on this Court’s part to ensure that the best and most accurate reading of statutes relating to its exercise prevails.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-wont-weigh-in-on-maps-for-special-elections/73190993007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to clarify </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which legislative maps should be used for any potential recall or special elections held before November, denying a request from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The commission had sought clarification because the court previously deemed the state&#8217;s current maps unconstitutional, but new maps signed into law by Gov. Tony Evers do not take effect until November. In its ruling, the court acknowledged that in a Dec. 22, 2023 decision, it blocked the elections commission from using the state&#8217;s current maps &#8220;in all future elections.&#8221; &#8220;Based on the submissions before us, we decline to further clarify or amend the opinion and order,&#8221; the court wrote, noting that the maps passed by the Legislature and signed by Evers are not before the court in the existing redistricting case.</span></p>

What are lawmakers and election administrators thinking about now to prepare? Find out in this four-part series, hosted  by the National Conference of State Legislatures in partnership with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We’ll focus on the elections workforce; counting and recounts and more post-voting work; the voters’ perspectives and voter confidence. The election doesn’t end when the polls close. Counting (and confirming the count) comes next—along with reporting results and, sometimes, recounts. Join us for the second installment of NCSL’s four-part webinar series on election administration to learn about what happens after voting is over. U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Donald Palmer will consider how all states address these tasks that ensure accurate and verifiable results. <strong>When:</strong> April 12, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>

They are spread by authoritarian state actors and malign non-state actors bent on undermining and damaging free and liberty-loving republics. Unfortunately, most solutions come internally from social media platforms or rest with governments to devise. A new grassroots strategy is needed: bottom-up rather than top-down. That is why R Street Institute and George Mason University are holding an Idea-thon to address the problem and find new solutions. Teams will form to attack misinformation and disinformation from four tracks: government, business/technology, nonprofit, and education. Winning teams will receive prizes. Examples of work products include new legislation and regulations, a business plan for a tech start-up, a mobile app, an academic course, or a new nonprofit. Be creative! Software developers are needed, but no computer science skills are necessary to participate. Just bring your best ideas for combating misinformation and disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> April 20. <strong>Where:</strong> Fairfax, Virginia</span></p>
