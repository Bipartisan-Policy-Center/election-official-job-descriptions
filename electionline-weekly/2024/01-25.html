</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Benito County, California pulls back the curtain on drop boxes</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States that allow vote-by-mail had been using </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-9-ballot-drop-box-laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ballot drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more than a decade without much fanfare </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/16/ballot-drop-boxes-have-long-been-used-without-cont/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">until 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they became the target of mis-and disinformation campaigns.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, these useful tools for voters and election administrators alike were seen as vessels of evil by some. In an effort to combat the mis- and disinformation surrounding the drop boxes, one California county came up with a unique idea to help educate the public on how drop boxes are used. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sanbenitocounty-ca-cre.gov/elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Benito, California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> County Clerk-Recorder/Registrar of Voters Francisco Diaz, who was assistant county-clerk-recorder at the time, came up with the idea for a ride along program. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_10722" style="width: 378px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10722" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-10722" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cheyenne-Wiles-Elections-Supervisor-explainign-the-process-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="276" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cheyenne-Wiles-Elections-Supervisor-explainign-the-process-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cheyenne-Wiles-Elections-Supervisor-explainign-the-process.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10722" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Cheyenne Wiles Elections Supervisor explaining the process</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaz said the inspiration struck him when he came across an article highlighting how police ride-along programs contribute to enhancing public perception, confidence, and trust in local law enforcement. He said he saw an opportunity to apply a similar concept to elections, particularly in light of the widespread mistrust in drop boxes that emerged after the 2020 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Benito County, in particular, witnessed a significant number of people expressing concerns about the installation of drop boxes. Recognizing the need to address this issue, Diaz envisioned a program that could foster transparency and trust in the electoral process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any new program, a lot had to be worked out before it launched. With a program such as this, it required even more work between the clerk-recorder/registrar of voters office, the county human resources department, the county counsel and risk management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The initial discussions about the program were filled with excitement as everyone recognized its potential benefits,” Diaz said. “However, concerns arose among the county counsel, risk management, and HR staff regarding the potential liabilities associated with the program,” Diaz explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, support was garnered from the county’s insurance carrier as well as the county Board of Supervisors. While this was a first-of-its kind initiative with no known examples to draw on from other parts of the country, the San Benito County Sheriff’s Office does ride-alongs so Diaz was able to use that as a foundation for elections staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to allay concerns of staff, during the initial pilot program in 2021, Diaz personally rode along on all the ride-alongs. His direct involvement and the development of clear procedures played a crucial role in alleviating the initial concerns and building confidence among the staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through hands-on experience and a trial-and-error approach, [we} developed procedures and talking points to address potential issues,” Diaz said. “After completing 30 ride-alongs in the pilot program, staff became more reassured about the program&#8217;s safety.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program launched in 2021 with about 30 ride-alongs. Participants included members of the Republican Central Committee, Democratic Central Committee, Election Integrity Group, and several city and county elected officials. That  number grew to about 40 ride-alongs in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Notably, the second round of attendees primarily consisted of members of the public who were initially skeptical of drop boxes and exhibited heightened concerns regarding local elections,” Diaz said. “This shift in participants underscores the program&#8217;s effectiveness in engaging and addressing the concerns of a broader cross-section of the community.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10723" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10723" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-10723" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/public-member-sitting-participating-on-the-ride-along-program-300x267.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="267" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/public-member-sitting-participating-on-the-ride-along-program-300x267.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/public-member-sitting-participating-on-the-ride-along-program-768x684.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/public-member-sitting-participating-on-the-ride-along-program.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10723" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A member of the public participating in the ride-along.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Diaz, especially with the second round of participants, many harbored skepticism regarding the security of drop boxes, entering the ride-along with preconceived notions often influenced by news reports.  However, as they engaged in the ride-along process, their opinions underwent a transformation Diaz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Witnessing the careful preparation, meticulous issuance of seals, and the thorough collection, documentation, and return of the ballots, participants gained a firsthand understanding of the process. Following the ride-along experience, many participants departed with a newfound confidence in the safety and security of the ballot collection process in San Benito County,” Diaz said. “The hands-on exposure dispelled their initial doubts and provided them with assurance about the integrity of the procedures involved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In preparation for the 2024 election, elections staff intends to enhance the initiative by securing a van from the Sheriff&#8217;s office to facilitate group tours. This adjustment aligns with a specific request made by the Superior Court Grand Jury, emphasizing elections commitment to meeting community needs and ensuring a comprehensive and informative experience for all participants.</p>
<p><strong>So how does it actually work?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants arrive at the election office one hour before ballot collection. They begin with a 20-minute lecture from Diaz, covering laws, rules, and regulations related to drop boxes. Following this, Diaz provides a 10-minute overview of the dos and don&#8217;ts while riding with election officials. The subsequent 30 minutes are dedicated to answering questions from the attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants then have the opportunity to observe the ballot collection team, receive their numbered seals, documentation sheets, and ballot pouches, and are provided with the day&#8217;s route. Subsequently, everyone boards the election van and proceeds to the first of eight stops. Upon arrival at each drop box, participants witness the team inspecting for tampering or damage, opening the drop box, collecting and counting each envelope, logging the ballots and time of arrival in the drop box in duplicate form, and finally, sealing the ballots in pouches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process repeats seven more times, and upon returning to the elections office, the ballot collection team returns the seal pouches and documentation. Elections staff then review, inspect, and recount the ballots in each pouch, sorting and securely storing them in the designated ballot room. Following this final step, observers convene with Diaz in a separate room for any additional questions and clarifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there were some hurdles to implementing the program, Diaz said additional costs were minimal and he strongly recommends other jurisdictions consider emulating it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While each jurisdiction may have its unique characteristics, the overwhelmingly positive outcome of this initiative is evident,” Diaz said. “Though there were initially skeptics, the program has been successful in disseminating accurate information. Participants, upon returning to their communities, share their experiences and newfound knowledge with friends and family, contributing to a broader understanding of the electoral process.”</span></p>

It was a relatively smooth day with a large </span><a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-primary-voter-turnout-exceeds-prediction/46528363"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turnout that exceeded expectations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Several communities including: Amherst, Brentwood, Concord, Hanover, Holderness, Hollis, Hopkinton, Newmarket and Windham all </span><a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-extra-republican-ballots-requested/46510137"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested additional Republican ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While there were calls for additional ballots, there were no reports of any precincts actually running out of ballots. The write-in campaign for President Joe Biden caused additional problems in some precincts according to local media. Ballot boxes at some locations were missing a key feature that accommodates write-in ballots. “On some ballot boxes, when you insert the ballot, if it’s a write-in vote, it will separate out those ballots. This one does not do that, so we’re going to have to hand-count almost every ballot tonight,” </span><a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/election-officials-hand-count-primary-ballots/46511098"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nashua</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election official John Guilmartin told WMUR. “If we’re smooth and efficient, hopefully we’ll get out at a decent hour, hopefully before midnight,” Guilmartin said. In </span><a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-ballots-primary-write-in/46526596"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Londonderry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, town clerk Sherry Farrell said the write-ins weren&#8217;t a problem. The town had a team dedicated specifically to the write-in ballots and hand-counting. She said her team worked together nicely to count all the write-ins in a timely fashion. She said she would love to see the same kind of enthusiasm in other elections. &#8220;What we would love to see, as your election teams and your town halls, is that same number of wonderful voters that cast their ballots in this election come out for our town elections,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Because that&#8217;s where all of the important issues are going to be determined for your towns, where you live, where you work, where you&#8217;re raising your families. So please come out and vote at each of the elections.

According to Wired, in the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Facebook group (more than 6,500 members), members were convinced of election fraud within minutes of the polls opening on Tuesday morning and throughout the day, in dozens of posts and hundreds of comments, the group’s members posted messages of support for each other’s efforts, reaffirming each other’s beliefs in the conspiracies despite no actual evidence of fraud. New Hampshire’s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/23/metro/nh-voters-rave-about-i-voted-stickers-designed-by-fourth-graders/">“I Voted” stickers</a> were a big hit with voters. “The sticker I got for voting was crazy cool,” Dan Kelleher, 25, of Concord told The Boston Globe. The state chose three winning designs back in October and printed about two million of them for a cost of around $10,000. </span></p>

Declining interest in working at polling locations started during the pandemic. Gwen Freeman with the Tulsa County Election Board said the average worker is 75 and they are in recruitment mode for workers of any age. “We have our hands virtually in every pie, trying to beg people to work for us and getting little to no response,” said Freeman. Smaller elections they are not as worried about, but come presidential primary day, Tulsa County needs to open 251 precincts. “I think it’s alarming,” she said. When asked what the board will do if there aren’t enough volunteers, Freeman responded, “I have no idea—it’s never happened.” Tulsa County alone is about 300 workers short. The Tulsa Regional Chamber recently announced an “Adopt a Precinct” initiative that encourages businesses to allow employees paid work days to train and volunteer for elections. Tulsa Young Professionals, or TYPROS, organized a Saturday training event to make it easier for employed people to get trained without taking off work. Freeman is hoping last-minute pleas to the public will help. If not, she says legislative action may be necessary.</span></p>

Originally submitted in October, the books were deemed not appropriate for the time of year they were being offered, they were not age-appropriate or not on the state Department of Education’s pre-approved reading list. </span><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/01/23/florida-rejects-books-on-voting-tuskegee-airmen-for-museums-storytime/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the books rejected was “VOTE!” by Eileen Christelow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scheduled for this month. The book was on the state’s pre-approved list and rated for first- through fourth-graders. “You’re joking,” Christelow said from her home in Vermont. “I’m just speechless. I don’t know what to say.” “No books were blocked; only moved to align with more relevant timing,” said Mark Ard, external affairs director for the Department of State, which oversees the state’s museums and historical programs as well as elections and corporations. Ard called the situation a big misunderstanding, but couldn’t say when the books would be rescheduled, nor would he say who ultimately decided to reject the books. He said it came about as a result of a group discussion where he was present. “VOTE!” was resubmitted by itself in December for January storytime, but once again it was turned down, Ard said, because it was deemed more topical for another month. When pushed to explain when would be a good time to discuss voter registration and elections in Florida, Ard switched gears, saying the book was rated for first through fourth graders. “Storytime programs held during school hours should be geared toward much younger children,” Ard also said, noting the age range for storytime was 3 to 8. The illustrated picture book, published in 2008, is the story of a Black woman, Chris Smith, running for town mayor against a white man. It includes passages about the long history of getting all people to vote regardless of sex and skin color. “When this country started, only white men who owned property could vote,” the book says. Christelow has seen it have a positive impact at events where she’s spoken. “One woman stood up and said she had never voted before reading this book, and now was going to vote,” Christelow said.</span></p>

The contest was open to students from first-grade to 12th-grade to show creativity and encourage civic pride and community engagement. There was considerable interest and excitement with the contest with approximately 150 submissions. Election judges evaluated the submissions, narrowing the list down to the top 16. The public then played a role in selecting the four winners. The entries featured “I Voted”designs for stickers that will be handed out in the upcoming June primary and the November general elections. The winners are, two fourth-graders, Kinsley Trimble from Pomona Elementary and Whitley Bonner from Dual Immersion Academy; one seventh-grader Layla Lesjak from Redlands Middle School, and eighth-grader Berklie Jones from Redlands Middle School. “I am beyond excited about the entries we received — I love community engagement,” said Mesa County Clerk &amp; Recorder Bobbie Gross, “Having an opportunity to educate our youth about the importance of voting and offering our voting community with this top-notch local art has been such a wonderful project.” The winning designs and young artists will be honored at the County Commissioners public hearing on Feb. 6. “Mesa County Elections extends heartfelt congratulations to the winners and a big thank you to all participants who contributed to making this contest a resounding success,” added Gross.</span></p>

CISA provided an overview of relevant generative AI-enabled capabilities, how these capabilities can be used by malicious actors to target the security and integrity of election infrastructure, and basic mitigations to counter those enhanced risks. “For the 2024 election cycle, generative AI capabilities will likely not introduce new risks, but they may amplify existing risks to election infrastructure,” CISA said in the document. “Election officials have the power to mitigate against these risks heading into 2024, and many of these mitigations are the same security best practices experts have recommended taking for years.” The agency highlighted that malicious actors – like cybercriminals and foreign nation-state actors – have used generative AI capabilities to spread disinformation through deepfake videos, AI-altered images, phishing scams, and voice cloning.</span></p>

In his letter, Sen. Warner cited a recently</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">declassified intelligence assessment that shows the continuing threat of foreign election interference – including from China, Iran, and Russia. “CISA’s commitment to leading the Federal government’s engagement on physical security and cybersecurity ahead of each Federal election is crucial,” wrote Sen. Warner. “Since the designation of election infrastructure as critical infrastructure in 2017, CISA has led a collaborative effort to assist state and local governments, election officials, Federal partners, and private sector partners in protecting election systems from cyber threats. “The complex and often highly varied election processes and systems across the U.S. are markedly more secure today as a result of CISA’s important efforts,” he added.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona:</strong> The Arizona Senate Elections Committee has passed a bill that would allow candidates for federal office to </span><a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1869164/az-senate-bill-allows-federal-candidates-send-observers-vote-counting-centers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">designate observers at vote counting centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are already rules that allow the general public, as well as representatives from each political party, to observe the counting of ballots. Senate Bill 1060 adds to that list one designated representative of a candidate for federal office, like president or U.S. Senate but only during the general election. It would also allow political parties at each county to send challengers to voting centers in addition to precincts. Observers would be barred from approaching officials’ tables or voting equipment or obstructing ballot processing and election administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The</span><a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/66092"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 355</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measure passed the Senate panel by an 8-1 vote following hour-long testimony and debate on whether the state should take a preemptive strike banning a ranked choice voting method that’s becoming more common in municipal elections across the nation and is the way candidates are elected in states like Alaska. Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson sponsored the bill that limits ranked choice voting in Georgia to military members who have federal protections protecting their absentee voting rights. Robertson said he wants to prevent local or state election officials from adopting a new election process that he said can become confusing for voters and election administrators alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 358 would give the Board of Elections the </span><a href="https://www.wuga.org/local-news/2024-01-24/senate-committee-approves-state-election-board-authority-to-investigate-georgia-secretary-of-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">power to investigate both the Secretary of State and local elections officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how those officials conduct elections. It also gives the Board the power to hire its own investigators instead of relying on the Secretary of State’s office to conduct investigations. Senator Max Burns, a Republican from Sylvania, chairs the Senate Ethics Committee. He is also a sponsor of the bill. He said that the bill was driven, at least in part, by a debate among Board of Elections members last year. Burns told his colleagues on the Senate Ethics Committee that the legislation was requested by members of the Board of Elections. The bill would also remove the Secretary of State from the State Elections Board. The Secretary of State’s office has questioned whether the bill is constitutional, but a lawyer for the Ethics Committee says the bill should pass constitutional muster. SB 358 passed the Ethics Committee and could be voted on by the full Senate in the coming weeks.</span></p>

The Senate State and Local Government Committee gave the bill favorable passage Wednesday in a vote of 9-2.  The bill’s primary sponsor, Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, told the committee such IDs are issued with less personal information than government-issued IDs used for primary voter identification, such as driver’s licenses. She said university IDs are “not enough to compare, for any purposes really.” Southworth’s bill also removes credit and debit cards from a list of accepted forms of identification if a voter lacks a driver’s license or other government-issued ID. “Our Photo ID to Vote law was carefully drafted to ensure success against court challenges, and Secretary Adams was successful in three such challenges,” said Michon Lindstrom, Adams’ director of communications. “We are concerned that this bill could get the Photo ID law struck down. Also, as a Republican, Secretary Adams believes his party should be careful not to gratuitously alienate young voters like college students by taking away their ability to use college Photo IDs in the absence of any evidence they have been used fraudulently.”</span></p>

House Bill 1264 would </span><a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/01/18/election-security-bill-with-citizenship-credit-agency-data-provisions-moves-to-house-floor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require people who haven’t previously voted in an Indiana general election to present photo identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and address-verifying mail if they register to vote in person to establish residency. That doesn’t apply if the prospective voter submitted a driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number along with their voter application, and election officials successfully matched the information to state records. The legislation sets out a process for county voter registration offices to follow if applicants don’t comply with the new proof of residence requirement. The provision won’t apply to overseas voters and out-of-town members of the military, after a Wednesday committee amendment. The bill also creates new requirements for proof of citizenship that the state’s top election officials — designated National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) officials — must use to inform counties of non-eligible voters. It similarly sets out a process for counties to follow, which includes an appeals process. Indiana Clerks Association President Nicole Brown said bipartisan discussions between the organization’s members — county election officials — had left them at an “impasse” and therefore testified as neutral. “All 92 county clerks believe and support election security,” said Brown, the Monroe County clerk. But, she added, members had “significant concerns on both sides.”</span></p>

Lawmakers also eliminated the jungle primary system in favor of a closed-party primary. The change is set to go into effect in 2026 and affects federal elections and those for: The Louisiana Supreme Court; The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education; and The Public Service Commission. The Senate approved the bill 29-9, and the House voted 67-36. The bill also goes to Landry for approval. “In terms of closed primaries, it’s been a goal for many that gained traction under the leadership of Governor Landry, and now was the time to act.  With this session complete, all of our energy can now be directed towards the priorities that are important to our constituents,” Speaker of the House Phillip DeVillier said in a news release.</span></p>

The bill allows certified law enforcement officers or authorized security personnel to have firearms at polling places and prohibits anyone else from carrying a firearm, loaded or unloaded within 100 feet of any voting location or 50 feet of a postal collection box or a monitored secured container. Anyone who is found guilty to be unlawfully in possession of a firearm near a polling place will be charged with a petty misdemeanor. The bill passed the SRC on a party-line 7-to-4 vote with all four Republicans on the Committee voting against the bill.</span></p>

Eric Roberts (R-Oklahoma City) wants to </span><a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-lawmaker-aims-to-prevent-ranked-choice-voting-claiming-confusion-and-delays-eric-roberts-election-donald-trump-joe-biden-state-legislature-gerrymandering-conservative-republican"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlaw ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Oklahoma. The state currently does not have ranked-choice voting, but efforts have been pushed to change that. Roberts filed two pieces of legislation to ensure it never comes to the state. HB 3156 would ban the practice. HJR 1048 would introduce a legislative referendum that would allow voters to decide stipulations about how elections are conducted in the state to the Oklahoma Constitution. The HJR would ensure voters can only select one candidate for the same office. Roberts says it&#8217;s too confusing for voters, and would delay election results. &#8220;Ranked-choice voting makes voting more confusing and has delayed election results everywhere it has been tried,&#8221; Rep. Roberts said. &#8220;We need to preserve the simplicity and timeliness of our current elections, along with our current ease in doing hand recounts when needed.&#8221; Roberts pointed to State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax, who told a committee last year that the adoption of ranked-choice voting would mean the state would have to replace all of its current election machines.</span></p>

About 3,000 voters used the box located outside of the county courthouse in 2022. Republican Commissioner Robert Phillips said the ballot box raised questions about security. “Someone can walk up to it and put more than one ballot in,” Phillips said. “And in Pennsylvania you’re allowed one ballot per voter, and there is no way for us to properly monitor that.” The ballot box in Lebanon was locked after hours and had a security camera positioned on top. The only person to vote against removing it was Democrat Jo Ellen Litz. She said the drop box saves time for elections workers who must now accept early ballots individually at their office. She also said it helps sick people avoid coming into the office and is easier for people with disabilities to use. “Why did you tamper with something that is working?,” Litz said.  “Why would you increase the work for our staff who already are overworked? Why would you increase their risk of infectious disease? You know, why would you put people who are handicapped through a marathon to drop off their ballot. The list goes on. It just doesn’t make sense to me.” Litz speculated the lines to drop off ballots could be 45 minutes to several hours long. Lebanon County Elections Director Sean Drasher backed up her claim, saying people would be waiting 45 minutes in a line that would go past his office.</span></p>

Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, carried the secretary of state-supported</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24811"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the floor. The 30-day requirement passed last year in response to voter registrations by RV owners from other states who purchase a mailbox in South Dakota. Wheeler told senators the law won’t withstand legal scrutiny. He cited several U.S. Supreme Court cases, and pointed to a section of the federal Voting Rights Act specifically prohibiting durational residency requirements. South Dakota requires voters to register at least 15 days before an election. The 30-day rule was different, though. It required that voters attest, under penalty of perjury, that they’d lived in South Dakota for at least 30 days in the year leading up to an election. The office’s original version of SB 17 did not address enforcement, though. Instead, it would have required citizens to attest that they’d lived in South Dakota for 30 consecutive days immediately prior to registering.  After hearing the legal concerns about that bill, Wheeler said, the Secretary of State’s Office chose to support his amendment, which rewrote the bill to remove the 30-day requirement.  As amended, SB 17 passed 31-2. The bill now goes to a committee of the House of Representatives. This is the second time in modern history that lawmakers have passed and then had second thoughts about a 30-day residency requirement for voter registration. Twenty-one years ago, lawmakers passed a similar bill. The next year, on advice from then-Secretary of State Chris Nelson, who described the bill as unenforceable, legislators repealed it.</span></p>

Utah law currently says mail-in ballots are valid as long as they’re “clearly postmarked before Election Day” and show up before noon on the day of the official canvass of the vote that usually comes two weeks later. The sponsor of the bill,</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0214.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB214</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, said that makes Utah an “outlier.” He called for a “move from a complicated and difficult to explain system” to one that shifts the responsibility to voters “for making sure their vote gets in on time.” Thurston told the committee his bill would give Utahns more confidence in elections. But for more than an hour committee members heard largely critical testimony about the change, including its impact on rural as well as disabled Utahns who count on being able to mail in their ballots the Monday before an election. Before the committee voted to hold the bill rather than send it to the full House, it was amended to change the effective day from May 1 to Jan. 1, 2025, so the election already underway would not be affected.</span></p>

Tarra Simmons, D-Kitsap has introduced </span><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2030&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would effectively </span><a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/01/18/prisoners-would-get-to-vote-under-bill-backed-by-formerly-incarcerated-wa-lawmaker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow anyone incarcerated in a state prison to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or sit on a jury. It only bans prisoners from voting who are convicted of a crime punishable by death. In Washington, a 2018 court decision determined capital punishment was unconstitutional, and Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill last April that abolished the death penalty in state law. There are around 13,000 people in Washington’s prisons, although not all of them are citizens. If Washington enacts HB 2030, it would join only Maine, Vermont and the District of Columbia in allowing prisoners to vote. Simmons also said the legislation will help lawmakers see prisoners as constituents. She’s been pushing for the policy since she became a lawmaker in 2020.</span></p>

The House passed two election-related bills unanimously: House Bill 4428, requiring candidates to live in the state or local election district for the office they are seeking; and House Bill 4552, requiring that a candidate for office’s party affiliation is consistent with their voter registration. HB 4428 requires candidates for state, county, or local elected offices to reside in the state and district they are seeking election to. The provisions would not apply to circuit judges, family court judges, or prosecuting attorneys that are already allowed under State Code to reside outside their counties and/or districts. The bill lays out the definition of residence and what qualifies as proof of residence. HB 4552 requires the notarized certificate of candidate announcement form submitted to the Secretary of State’s Office for partisan elections to include the candidate’s political party affiliation on the date the certificate of announcement is submitted. Prior to accepting the certificate of announcement, state and local election officials would be required to electronically verify the candidate’s current party affiliation. The committee recommended House Bill 4205 for passage, giving the West Virginia legislature legal standing to bring actions against a governor, secretary of state, or other state officials who attempt to make unauthorized changes to state election laws and rules. It would open up the Legislature to participate in lawsuits that contest the legality or constitutionality of state election laws and regulations. </span></p>

The nonprofit Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative sued Secretary of State John Thurston and the state Board of Election Commissioners earlier this month, asking the state Supreme Court to certify two proposed constitutional amendments: one that would require all Arkansas elections to be conducted with hand-marked, hand-counted paper ballots and one that would limit absentee voting to people who can prove their inability to vote in person.Restore Election Integrity Arkansas, the ballot question committee supporting the measures, submitted both proposed amendments to Attorney General Tim Griffin in November. Griffin rejected both, citing a lengthy popular name, “partisan coloring language” and ambiguities. The group submitted</span><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/dec/28/proposed-amendments-requiring-paper-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revised proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December. Last week, Griffin</span><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2024/jan/11/arkansas-attorney-general-again-rejects-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the paper ballot measure, and he altered and certified the absentee voting measure. Thurston and the Board of Election Commissioners both declined to certify the proposed amendments as submitted, according to the lawsuit filed Jan. 9, the day before Griffin’s rulings. Certification of the measures would allow supporters to start collecting signatures from supporters. The group faces a July 5 deadline to collect signatures from 90,704 registered voters in order for the proposed amendments to appear on the November ballot. </span></p>

Bellows&#8217; appeal comes after a Maine Superior Court judge Michaela Murphy paused the decision to have Trump removed from the ballot to allow time for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a similar case out of Colorado this week. Murphy denied Trump’s request to stay the proceedings, but she sent the case back to the secretary of state with instructions to await the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court case before issuing a new ruling modifying or upholding her original decision. In a written filing, Trump&#8217;s lawyers called on the justices “to put a swift and decisive end” to efforts to kick him off the 2024 presidential ballot over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.= “Like many Americans, I welcome a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court in the Colorado case that provides guidance as to the important Fourteenth Amendment questions in this case,&#8221; Bellows said in a release issued Friday morning.  “In the interim, Maine law provides the opportunity to seek review from the Maine Supreme Judicial Court – which I requested today. I know both the constitutional and state authority questions are of grave concern to many,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;This appeal ensures that Maine’s highest court has the opportunity to weigh in now, before ballots are counted, promoting trust in our free, safe and secure elections.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the state  Supreme Court </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/maines-top-court-refuses-rule-supreme-court-trump/story?id=106658399"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed the appeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The court declined to hear the challenge because the Maine Superior Court&#8217;s decision was not a &#8220;final&#8221; judgment, just a deferment. &#8220;Because the appeal is not from a final judgment, we dismiss the appeal as interlocutory and not justiciable,&#8221; the seven-justice Court wrote in a 19-page decision. “Requiring a final judgment in this situation serves the interests of justice; enhances administrative and judicial efficiency; averts our issuance of what would likely be, at least in some part, an advisory opinion; and it allows for true and effective decision-making when the matter is ripe,&#8221; the decision reads.</span></p>

The request came after the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission appealed a</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2023/12/michigan-needs-to-redraw-13-house-senate-districts-orders-federal-judges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> December federal court ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 13 state legislative districts violated the Voting Rights Acts by diluting the representation of Black voters in Detroit. The commission and Benson had been sued by Detroit-area plaintiffs over the citizen-drawn districts. Tight timelines are at the center of Benson’s rationale for the request. “The secretary’s position is not that implementing new plans for August is impossible,” the brief filed before the nation’s top court says. “She is concerned about the uncertainty as to the scope of the changes that will be required and how well those changes can be implemented in the time allotted.” Under the court’s timeline, the new maps would be finalized a little more than three weeks before the April 23 candidate filing deadline, which according to Benson’s brief is “very little time.” The brief said not pausing the redistricting process for the election could harm an “orderly election process.”</span></p>

The outcome of the case will likely determine whether tens of thousands of people win back the right to vote. An immediate decision is not expected.

But the full 17-member circuit court</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-mississippi-felony-convictions-8092c8c832f7088f8bf7ecc97f37bfff"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vacated that ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weeks later and scheduled this week’s hearing.

Cohen ruled this week that </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-01-24/fox-news-countersuit-smartmatic-defamation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News’ counterclaim against Smartmatic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can go forward. The news channel is being sued by Smartmatic for $2.7 billion. The suit claims former President Trump’s lawyers falsely accused the company of manipulating vote counts in the 2020 presidential election, and that Fox News and three of its on-air hosts presented the disinformation on their programs. Fox News — which admitted it aired false statements in its coverage when it settled a similar suit from Dominion Voting Systems — has said the damages being sought by London-based Smartmatic are not reflective of the company’s value and aimed at chilling the conservative network’s free speech rights. Cohen also wrote that the settled defamation case filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News cannot be the basis of a malice claim because the trial did not go forward. Cohen previously rejected Fox News’ motion to dismiss the case. The company argued that even though Trump’s claims were false, they were newsworthy and therefore protected by the 1st Amendment.</span></p>

Schroeder found that the new rules would&#8217;ve violated voters&#8217; due process rights, in part by throwing out potentially legitimate ballots without giving voters a chance to fight that decision. The now-blocked changes to the law would&#8217;ve affected thousands of people who use same-day registration during early voting. That process lets people register to vote, or update their address, and then immediately cast a ballot. The main argument in the case boiled down to what should happen after people use same-day registration. Typically the state sends a postcard to the address provided by the same-day registrant. If the postcard is returned as undeliverable, the voter’s ballot is canceled. Democrats sued, saying there should be more efforts to contact voters, not just by mail, before canceling their ballots. People should also have a chance to dispute challenges to their ballot, and prove they&#8217;re legitimate voters, they said. They argued that the new rules would cause too many legitimate ballots to be thrown out. Schroeder agreed and gave lawmakers a choice: find a way to address those due process concerns or not enforce the new rules.</span></p>

Kyle Diamond, of Beach City, was taken into custody on Jan. 18. He is facing an election fraud charge. According to the sheriff’s office, the investigation began in late Oct. 2023. It was reported to the Chambers County Sheriff’s Office by County Clerk Heather Hawthorne, who suspected someone was tampering with the City Council election for Beach City. At the time there were multiple complainants and all suspected it to be a candidate in the City Council election. During the investigation, multiple Beach City residents came forward and said someone had placed what appeared to be a falsified official election document in their mailboxes. The sheriff’s office said the documents appeared to be intended to sway the residents of Beach City to not go vote on election day due to the election being canceled. This same document is what caused the task force investigation because weeks prior it had been emailed to multiple registered voters of Beach City. The sheriff’s office was able to identify Diamond as the suspect thanks to multiple homeowner’s security videos and other information. An evidentiary search warrant confirmed emails and other electronic evidence along with campaign signs of his opponents in his possession. An arrest warrant was requested and granted to take Diamond into custody on the election fraud charge.</span></p>

Despite their work to help voters participate in democracy, civic engagement groups have come under attack, undermining their critical work to expand access to democracy and violating their First Amendment rights. Our democracy works best when every voter can participate, and civic engagement groups empower voters to be part of the political process. Policies that limit their right to conduct outreach to voters actively harm voters, especially marginalized communities who have historically been excluded from the political process. Beyond just targeting voters, laws targeting the activities of civic engagement groups specifically take aim at the ability of nonpartisan, public interest organizations to help people navigate confusing systems — restricting and penalizing a core aspect of democracy. Campaign Legal Center has been working alongside clients and partners</span><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/cases-actions/defending-civic-engagement-groups"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in multiple states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fight back against these attacks. Panelists will discuss the latest attacks on nonpartisan civic engagement, how those attacks make it more difficult for civic engagement groups to conduct their work and for voters to access the ballot box, and, finally, touch on potential solutions to protect and strengthen civic engagement work. <strong>When:</strong> Jan. 26, 11am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

By encouraging more people to become poll workers in their communities, Help America Vote Day is addressing the critical shortage of poll workers, strengthening our republic, inspiring greater civic engagement and volunteerism, and helping to ensure election offices have the staff they need throughout 2024. Information on ways to register to vote and options to cast a ballot in a voter’s state is also critical as the primary season draws near. Help America Vote Day is a great way to bring attention to the basic election information for a community so voters are ready to cast their ballot. If you’d like to use Help America Vote Day as an opportunity to direct your community to your site as a trusted source of information on voter registration and voting, make sure to use the hashtag #HelpAmericaVote <strong>When:</strong> Jan. 30. <strong>Where:</strong> Everywhere </span></p>

In order to do so, they employ algorithms that send users down a rabbit hole that promotes the most inflammatory content, including mis/disinformation, hate speech, and extremist content. Online, people often find themselves pulled farther from the political center, and find it increasingly difficult to view less radical content. The result is a polarized electorate and an information environment poisoned with false information. Authoritarian regimes and domestic bad actors have seized upon this vulnerability, exploiting it to promote their view of the world or divide Americans. This phenomenon is not benign and has already changed the way we observe conflict between Israel and Hamas, and other sociopolitical contentions around the world. On February 2nd, join us for an event hosted by Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media to hear experts in national security, technology, and democracy discuss the effect of social media on domestic and foreign extremism, how the algorithms are designed to radicalize users, and what solutions are necessary to protect our democracy from extremism. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 2, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

How are election officials – from secretaries of state to election directors and local officials – preparing to face this cycle? What lessons from past cycles are changing how we conduct elections? And how can election officials build greater community trust and promote a fair, transparent election process? At the start of this critical year, join the Election Center to hear from a diverse roster of election officials on how they are preparing to face the 2024 elections and ensure a fair and accurate count. Election Center staff will present our newly detailed Standards of Conduct and outline how these long standing principles can be used today to build public trust in elections. Panelists will discuss how their past experiences, including harassment, threats, disinformation, and more, inform their approach to 2024. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 6, 8am-11am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</span></p>
