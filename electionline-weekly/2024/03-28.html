							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>United in Security: How Every State Protects Your Vote</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPC, Issue One and R Street detail common election security protections </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10965" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-28-at-11.03.10 AM-300x59.png" alt="" width="300" height="59" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-28-at-11.03.10 AM-300x59.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-28-at-11.03.10 AM-1024x201.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-28-at-11.03.10 AM-768x151.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-28-at-11.03.10 AM.png 1478w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This week, the Bipartisan Policy Center, Issue One, and the R Street Institute released “</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/united-in-security-state-vote-protections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United in Security: How Every State Protects Your Vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” an infographic outlining the protections in place to keep American elections safe, secure, and transparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials are often well prepared to discuss why elections are trustworthy in their county or state, but lack a clear and digestible resource for discussing why elections are trustworthy across the country,” said Will Adler, Associate Director of the Elections Project at the </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Policy Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We hope this can be a resource for communicating why all Americans can trust election outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protections fall into three categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States have transparent, accountable elections.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States confirm the accuracy of voting equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States ensure that only eligible votes are counted.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizations compiled facts about elections that, if voters knew them, might bolster their confidence in elections. The resource is also intended to be a reference for state and local election officials to discuss election security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From coast to coast, election officials are working to ensure that all votes are cast and counted accurately,” said Matt Germer, Director of the Governance Program at </span><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This high-level infographic covers many of the security practices in place—before, during and after Election Day—that should give us all more confidence in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This resource illustrates the robust checks and balances among states, along with the common transparency measures that strengthen the integrity of elections nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials work year round to ensure that our elections are safe and secure. While there may be some differences in how elections are run from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there are a number of shared practices that should give all of us confidence in how elections work,” said Gideon Cohn-Postar, Legislative Director for </span><a href="https://issueone.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Issue One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

							<h2>Overview of State Election Laws</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Profiles Offer Bird’s-Eye Views of Each State’s Election Laws</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCSL and U.S. Election Assistance Commission team up to create one-page policy overviews</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Katie King<br />
</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5304" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png" alt="" width="300" height="127" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />All states are looking for the same outcomes in election administration: accuracy, accessibility for all eligible voters and accountability. But states vary in the ways they achieve those goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, all states have ways to confirm voters get the right ballot. All states have absentee voting—though some ask voters to indicate why they need to vote absentee. All states have checks and balances to ensure ballots are counted accurately—but those post-voting options do differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it can be hard to keep even one state’s policies straight—let alone Washington, D.C., and 49 others—NCSL and the U.S. Election <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Assistance Commission created a one-page profile for each state outlining its election policies. The profiles are available</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/state-profiles-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and as printable PDFs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the more detailed</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/ncsl-election-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NCSL Election Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page gets into the nitty-gritty on each policy topic, the one-page profiles give a bird’s-eye view of election policies one state at a time. Created with policymakers in mind, the profiles outline each state’s policies and offer a glimpse of where that state stands nationally on particular policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each profile is broken into four sections: state information; voter registration policies; voting policies; and “other.” Below are more details on each section.</span></p>
<p><strong>State Information</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This section details the administrative structure in each state. In most states, such as Idaho and Minnesota, the secretary of state is the chief election official; in Utah and Hawaii, it’s the lieutenant governor. Other states have boards that oversee elections and designate the chief election official. The profiles also list which officials run elections locally, though they can hold different titles. In some states, one local official oversees elections; in others, the duties are split between two or more offices. Each profile links to the state’s election website so voters, lawmakers and others can get accurate, up-to-date information about their state’s elections.</span></p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for North Dakota, every state has voter registration. (North Dakota keeps a list of people who vote.) But how each state manages voter registration varies. Alabama and California are among the 42 states with</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/online-voter-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online voter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registration, and Georgia and Vermont are among the states that also have</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registration. (When voters interact with a qualifying state agency, such as the DMV, they are automatically registered to vote if they meet the qualifications.) Louisiana and New York allow</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preregistration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 16-year-olds; Oklahoma permits preregistration for 17.5-year-olds; and Pennsylvania requires eligible voters to be 18 before they can register to vote.</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-registration-deadlines"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voter registration deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-voter-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Day or same-day registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policies are included in this section.</span></p>
<p><strong>Voting</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Policies about voting itself vary widely by state. Missouri and Michigan</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require some form of identification to vote in person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while New Jersey and New Mexico do not if ID was presented at the time of registration. Nationwide,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/early-in-person-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting begins from 50 days to three days before Election Day in the 46 states that offer it. Minnesota and South Carolina do not use</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/vote-centers"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Election Day, while Arkansas and North Dakota do. Also included in this section are state policies on ballot return, including</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-10-ballot-collection-laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who can return a voted ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-9-ballot-drop-box-laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drop box permittance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-15-states-with-signature-cure-processes"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot cure processes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-16-when-absentee-mail-ballot-processing-and-counting-can-begin"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> timelines for processing ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-ballot-return-internet-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electronic ballot return</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Other</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This section showcases state audit policies and primary types. Almost all states use some form of preelection audit or logic and accuracy testing, and all but two states use some form of</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/post-election-audits"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> postelection audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As for</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/state-primary-election-types"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> primary types</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, policies range from open (any voter can participate in either party’s primary) to closed (only registered party members can vote in a party primary). In between, you can find top-two (California and Washington), top-four (Alaska), all-comers (Louisiana for some races) and nonpartisan (Nebraska) primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this project categorizes similar state policies, each state’s specific policies are more nuanced than what fits in a one-page snapshot. For more detailed information on each policy topic, refer to the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> EAC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/ncsl-election-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NCSL Election Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-page profiles hold an abundance of information on each state’s policies, and if there’s a key takeaway, it’s this: Election policy is not one size fits all. Talk with your local election officials about potential impacts of policies before making decisions about election legislation and policy.</span></p>

Stateline took a look at the more than 20 states that have worked to </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/03/22/fearing-political-violence-more-states-ban-firearms-at-polling-places/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ban guns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from in and around polling places. </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/25/doj-threats-harassment-election-workers/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzExMzM5MjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzEyNzIxNTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MTEzMzkyMDAsImp0aSI6IjI2YTEyZmY2LTAwNDgtNDZiYy05YmI1LTI3ZDhiM2M0MDAxYSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzAzLzI1L2Rvai10aHJlYXRzLWhhcmFzc21lbnQtZWxlY3Rpb24td29ya2Vycy8ifQ.M1caPv3MfXeRX8cZTzuB_fG0nnTYsbb469Ssz7lxXsU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justice Department officials </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘held a news conference this week saying that  reports of widespread threats against officials running the 2020 and 2022 elections have resulted in charges against roughly 20 people, with more than a half dozen receiving sentences between one and 3 1⁄2 years. Officials caution that it remains to be seen if the stiff sentences will serve as an effective deterrent to would-be-criminals in future election cycles. Officials explained that investigators have to assess whether each reported threat crosses the line from free speech to an actual violent or death threat. That includes determining why the person sent the threat and the effect that it had on the person who received it. They said that threats typically occur around the time of elections and vote counting and that <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9912" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ArtificialIntelligence-300x187.png" alt="" width="300" height="187" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ArtificialIntelligence-300x187.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ArtificialIntelligence-1024x640.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ArtificialIntelligence-768x480.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ArtificialIntelligence-1536x960.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ArtificialIntelligence.png 1588w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />election denialism is at the root of many of the cases. Election workers have left their jobs as a result of the threats they, their families and their colleagues have received, the officials said. Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes election-related legislation, is tracking more than 100 bills in 40 state legislatures introduced or passed this year that intend to </span><a href="https://statescoop.com/deepfakes-presidential-election-ai-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulate artificial intelligence’s potential to produce election disinformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Megan Bellamy, vice president of law and policy at Voting Rights Lab, said some of these laws aim to provide transparency around AI-generated content, while others seek to penalize those that use AI to intentionally mislead voters. “2024 is the first American presidential election year at the intersection of election-related myths and disinformation that have been on the rise and the rapid growth of AI-generated content,” Bellamy told StateScoop in a recent interview about Voting Rights Lab’s</span><a href="https://votingrightslab.org/2024/03/26/new-state-legislative-efforts-to-stem-the-tide-of-ai-generated-election-disinformation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislative analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was released this week. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/seven-hackers-associated-chinese-government-charged-computer-intrusions-targeting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seven hackers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">associated with the Chinese government were charged with computer intrusions targeting perceived critics of China and U.S. businesses and politicians. The defendants were part of the APT31 hacking group. “These allegations pull back the curtain on China’s vast illegal hacking operation that targeted sensitive data from U.S. elected and government officials, journalists and academics; valuable information from American companies; and political dissidents in America and abroad.  Their sinister scheme victimized thousands of people and entities across the world, and lasted for well over a decade,” stated Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. APT31 has a history of targeting politicians in the US and Europe. They have gone after political campaigns, parliamentarians, and other targets for insights into the landscape. “As </span><a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-were-tackling-evolving-online-threats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve seen in previous election cycles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, actors like APT31 turn to political organizations to find the geopolitical intelligence that they&#8217;re tasked with collecting. Politicians, parties, and elections organizations are rich sources of intelligence that offer collectors everything from rare geopolitical insights to enormous troves of data. These are all serious incidents, but this information, once stolen, is not necessarily destined to be used in active interference like previous hack and leak operations by Russian actors.”  &#8211; John Hultquist, Chief Analyst, Mandiant Intelligence &#8211; Google Cloud</span></p>

In total, 91 entries were received. Of the 91 entries, four designs were disqualified due to non-compliance.The remaining 87 designs were scored by a five-member preliminary judging panel that consisted of the County Clerk, one employee from the County Clerk’s office, and three Lincoln County poll workers. Each panelist scored the designs on a scale of 1-10. To facilitate a blind voting process, each entry was identified by a letter and number. Results were calculated and finalists were selected from the cumulative high scores of each age group: 4 designs, 6th-8th grade (hand-drawn); 3 designs, 6th-8th grade (digital); and 3 designs, 9th-12th grade (hand-drawn). The finalists’ designs were then put out to public vote online via SurveyMonkey for a two-week period. A total of 879 votes were cast by the public for the “I Voted” Sticker Design Contest.

The new stickers debuted in the recent presidential preference primary and will be used in this year’s upcoming primary and general elections. Supervisor of Elections Leah Valenti said there were 25 submissions from Charlotte and Lemon Bay high schools. Robbins’ showcases an alligator, and Bailey’s has palm fronds surrounding the words “I voted.” Valenti said the contest empowers local youth by “actively involving them in the voting and election process.” “We are not just shaping informed citizens, but cultivating the leaders of tomorrow,” Valenti said. She said it’s important to engage teens in voting programs. “At the award ceremony, I felt like a proud mom,” said Valenti, who gave the two winners and their teachers certificates. “The election workers were prideful as well. We told many voters about the stickers and how they came to be. We displayed a poster of all of the entries for voters to pick a winner.”</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> Lawmakers are considering legislation that would require probate judges to tally the ballots after every county and statewide general election in a </span><a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/alabama-lawmakers-could-require-post-election-audits"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-election audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis believes it&#8217;s unnecessary. He says on election day they know exactly how many ballots go to every precinct, how many ballots are cast at each voting machine from the machine&#8217;s automated counter and how many voters were processed at each precinct. &#8220;And all three of those numbers are supposed to match, and they do. And they always have,&#8221; said Davis. Rep. Debbie Woods is proposing legislation that would require probate judges to randomly select one precinct and one race that is not subject to a recount or contest and either manually tally the ballots or run them through a ballot counter not used during the election. A House committee this week discussed the legislation and Davis listened to the live stream. In 2022 legislation authorized a post-election audit pilot program in three counties.</span></p>

The bills are part of a Republican package of changes to how the state would conduct elections ahead of this year’s presidential race. These measures and others still need to pass final votes on the last day of this year’s legislative session March 28. State Sen. Max Burns said county election directors asked for flexibility to deploy fewer voting machines on election day to account for the high number of Georgians who cast early or absentee ballots. </span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/1207"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1207</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed along party lines, 33-20, with all Democrats opposed. The legislation also would require election workers to be U.S. citizens, allow candidates to check ballots for accuracy before they’re printed and guarantee access to poll watchers. The Senate also passed</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/974"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 974</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would put a watermark on all ballots, require audits of at least two statewide races each election and post ballot images online. That bill passed 47-6.</span></p>

The bill would require any person receiving payment to gather signatures for an initiative process to </span><a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/208/idaho-bill-disclose-paid-signature-gatherers-moves-governors-desk/277-c3ac0655-3eff-4b6a-bdda-3aa95eeb4727"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclose they are paid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This bill outlines a verbal notice and a visual badge on the petitioner&#8217;s clothing to denote their status as a paid worker. Rep. Ilana Rubel (D-Boise) was the only lawmaker to speak other than the floor sponsor Rep. Brandon Mitchell (R-Moscow). Mitchell pitched the bill as a transparency measure against out-of-state money influencing Idaho policy. &#8220;If we were so worried about transparency and voters knowing who&#8217;s paying for what, we don&#8217;t do this for any other political activity. I can spend a million dollars hiring people to knock every door in my district telling everybody that Ilana Rubel is the cat&#8217;s meow,&#8221; Rubel said. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t have to wear a pin or tell anybody that I&#8217;m paying them.&#8221; Rubel questioned the constitutionality of the bill; the Idaho State Supreme Court overturned a previous law to regulate the initiative process through Reclaim Idaho v. Denney (2021). The court regarded the initiative process to be a right of the people.</span></p>

The Senate Executive Nominations Committee voted 12-3 to send Diane Butler, an Ellicott City resident, to the full Senate. The floor vote could come later this week. The committee held Butler’s nomination for two weeks over concerns about hyper-partisanship and her views on the integrity of recent state elections. “I think the correspondence, just to me, seems in many ways, to be incongruent to some of the motivations that were actually expressed during the hearings,” said Senate Executive Nominations Vice Chair Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), one of three members of the panel who voted against Butler’s nomination. “I’m just not confident that her motivations previously to really press the county board of elections and some of her prior statements were solely intended to improve the process.”</span></p>

We believe that voting is a part of our democracy.&#8221; The bill would bar localities from taking actions that make it harder for persons of color to vote, such as closing a polling places or limiting early voting. Champion&#8217;s bill would allow citizens or interest groups to make a claim short of going to court, and then to pursue the court option if that doesn&#8217;t work. The Judiciary Committee passed the bill on a voice vote and sent it to the full Senate for consideration at a later date.</span></p>

Currently state law bars those with felony convictions from voting for two years after completion of their sentence, including parole. The bill, LB20, advanced through the first round of debate, would eliminate this waiting period. Nebraska is the only state that attaches an “arbitrary” waiting period before voting rights are restored after a person’s sentence is complete, Wayne said. LB20, which Wayne introduced last session, would simply do away with that “additional penalty,” he added. “At the end of the day, when you have completed your sentence – when you are done – you should be able to participate in our society fully and completely,” Wayne said. Chair of the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon, agreed. The bill advanced to a second round of debate with bipartisan support from lawmakers 34-3, with 2 present-not voting, and 10 excused-not voting.</span></p>

Those machines would need to have the capacity to accept the choices of the voter and print out a paper ballot filled in with those choices for the voter to then cast, the bill states. The bill would effectively “enable access to voting for individuals with disabilities during elections by giving them the same degree of privacy that is accorded to nondisabled voters,” a summary from the Secretary of State’s Office reads. Sponsored by Rep. Mark Paige, an Exeter Democrat, the bill creates a mandate for towns but does not explicitly state how they might meet that mandate or acquire the machines. But advocates say they envision two phases. First, the bill creates a pilot program where the Secretary of State’s Office is required to “provide” the machines to the towns for any elections between Jan. 1 and June 30 of 2025. Paige and other supporters say that would likely entail the Secretary of State’s Office sharing the machines it already has and allowing them to be programmed for local elections. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, Paige and other lawmakers say they will work to set aside money in the state budget next year to pay for cities and towns to acquire the machines themselves. Local officials would then use a vendor to program the machines – without the involvement of the Secretary of State’s Office. The bill received a unanimous recommendation from the House Election Law Committee and passed the full House on a voice vote last week; it heads next to the Senate.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_Status/billinfo.aspx?id=1118&amp;inflect=2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bill that would </span><a href="https://indepthnh.org/2024/03/27/lawmakers-disagree-over-high-schools-informing-students-about-voter-registration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bolster voter registration efforts among young people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by altering public and private school curricula. While the prime sponsor Rep. Mark Paige, D-Exeter, thinks it’s a fairly straightforward bipartisan, “common sense” bill; concerns have been raised by Republican lawmakers who oppose its passage. The bill itself would not force students to register to vote, but instead requires school districts and private schools to “develop programs to inform high school students about registering to vote.” This education would also include policies to promote student voter registration, such as “collaboration with the town or city clerk and the supervisor of the checklist to conduct voter registration at high schools.” However, completion of voter registration would not be a course requirement or graded assignment for students, according to the bill. The education program would focus on “informing students of state requirements for voter registration” and “providing access to and assistance with filing registration applications.” Paige, a former teacher, wrote this bill with the hope of bolstering the existing civics curriculum at high schools by turning education into action, or at the bare minimum, remove any barriers of confusion about voter registration.</span></p>

Sponsored by Rep. Stephen Kinsey (D-Philadelphia), House Bill 461 would allow victims to sue for punitive damages and attorney fees. The law would apply to defendants who are convicted of violating the Pennsylvania Election Code’s provisions against voter intimidation. The passed 14-12 in a party line vote, with Republicans in opposition, and now goes to the full House for consideration. Kinsey said during a Judiciary Committee meeting that voter intimidation has been a longstanding problem, as communities of color have faced intimidation since the 19th century and remains an issue today, with extremist groups</span><a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/oath-keepers-watched-maricopa-county-drop-boxes-despite-claims-to-the-contrary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posting watchers at drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Arizona last year.

Under the current</span><a href="https://www.house.state.pa.us/rules.cfm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House operating rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, discharge resolutions must receive signatures from 50 members – 25 signatures from the minority party and 25 signatures from the majority party – for the resolution to move forward. A discharge resolution must then receive a majority vote from members of the House for a bill to be considered.</span></p>

Currently, voters are not required to register with a party to vote in a primary election in Tennessee. Instead, they just need to ask for either a Republican or Democrat ballot at their polling location.</span><a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=HB1616&amp;GA=113"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB 1616</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would let voters choose an affiliation with a political party on voter registration applications. Voters would also be allowed to be designated as &#8220;unaffiliated&#8221; voters. County election commissions would then need to record voters&#8217; party affiliations, or unaffiliated designations, as part of voters&#8217; permanent registration records. The bill would also let qualified voters change their registration at practically any time election offices are open, except for up to 29 days before an election. The proposal could also bolster the earlier laws that required signs placed at polling locations telling voters they needed to be &#8220;bona fide&#8221; party members to vote in primary elections. Effectively, voters may need to be formally affiliated with a party to vote in primary elections or have an &#8220;unaffiliated&#8221; designation. Voters could also vote in any party&#8217;s primary election if it is the first primary they participate in after the bill goes into effect. After voting in that election, voter affiliations and designations would need to be added to their permanent record.</span></p>

Evers vetoed a Republican-authored bill that would have required him to call special elections if a state constitutional office becomes vacant before that officeholder&#8217;s term expires. Evers vetoed a bill that would have reduced the area between election observers and election workers from three to eight feet to no more than three feet. Violators of the provisions under the bill could face imprisonment for up to 90 days and a fine of up to $1,000. Under a bill Evers signed into law, closing even one polling location within 30 days of an election now requires the support of the clerk and a majority of the city council, town board or village board. Public notices are also now required for those closures, and a person would have to be stationed at the closed site to inform voters of the new site under the law. Under another new law, personal identifying information of election officials is now exempt from public records requests. The law, which takes effect in 2025, also gives election officials whistleblower protections if they report election fraud or irregularities. It also creates a new felony crime of battery to an election official. That penalty would apply if the victim is an election official, election registration official or county or municipal clerk acting in an official capacity. The law also makes changes to the campaign finance system, requiring local candidates to submit their reports to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission, rather than local clerks. Evers vetoed two bills that would have overhauled how residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities could cast ballots, and for voters who are determined to be incompetent. Evers also vetoed a bill that would require the state nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau to examine the administration of each general election.</span></p>

Russell pleaded guilty in late August 2023 to a federal charge of making an interstate threat against Hobbs, a Democrat who, as secretary of state, was Arizona’s chief elections officer in 2022 and now serves as the state’s governor. U.S. District Judge Steven Logan commended Russell for undergoing substance abuse treatment and other counseling since his arrest and getting his life in order, but concluded Russell must spend time in prison, saying he has traumatized people who work in the secretary of state’s office. The judge, who read Russell’s profanity-laden threats aloud in court, said Russell had accused the victim of being a terrorist, while he was threatening her life. He rejected Russell’s characterization of his actions as immature. “None of these people deserved it,” the judge said. Russell’s case is among the cases brought by the U.S. Justice Department’s Election Threats Task Force, which focuses on threats of violence against elected officials, workers and volunteers to ensure they can oversee elections free of harassment.</span></p>

Richer sued Lake — who ran for governor in 2022 and is now running for U.S. Senate — for defamation last year, alleging that Lake made defamatory allegations that he had assisted in rigging the gubernatorial election against Lake. Richer’s legal team is treating Lake’s filing, a motion for default judgment, as an admission of liability. “She has decided she cannot defend herself in this case despite continuously saying she has evidence,” said Ben Berwick, counsel at Protect Democracy, among the firms representing Richer in the lawsuit. Lake’s attorneys do not defend Lake’s claims about Richer in the filing, nor do they challenge any of Richer’s arguments about the facts. Instead, they ask the court for a quick hearing to decide damages.</span></p>

Bost and his Republican co-plaintiffs — who are represented by Judicial Watch — contend that the two-week receipt deadline for mail-in ballots burdens their right to vote by allowing “illegal ballots” to “dilute the value of timely ballots cast and received on or before Election Day.” District Court Judge John Kness originally tossed out the lawsuit in July 2023, but the Republican plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the 7th Circuit, where a three-judge panel will ultimately decide whether or not the lawsuit will move forward following this week’s oral argument. The members of the three-judge panel will not be known until oral argument commences. In his 2023 order, district court Kness acknowledged that although federal law sets a “national standard” for Election Day, “states retain significant discretion—frequently exercised—to prescribe the times, places, and manner of conducting elections” under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Kness added that the “[p]laintiffs’ votes…are not diluted by other valid, lawfully cast votes” as a result of the challenged deadline.</span></p>

And it does not impair the plaintiffs’ rights to vote or to stand for office under the First and/or Fourteenth Amendments.” The statute in question is a 2020 law requiring local election workers to count mail-in absentee ballots for up to five days after the election date. The Mississippi law currently permits election workers to count mail-in votes only if the ballots were postmarked by the election date. To support the Republican Party’s argument, Mississippi GOP Chairman Frank Bordeaux wrote in a signed declaration that the statute dilutes the weight of ballots cast on Election Day and harms conservative candidates running for office. U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola Jr. ordered all of the parties to file all responses to the pending motions by April 9 and file responses to the replies by April 16.</span></p>

The judges affirmed the ruling in a consolidated case brought by groups like the Montana Democratic Party, several Native American tribes and Montana Youth Action seeking to overturn the laws. Chief Justice Mike McGrath in a</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/montana-voting-laws-ruling.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63-page ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued this week called the Legislature’s pushback of the voter registration deadline from Election Day to noon the day before — while blocking paid absentee ballot collectors and using a Montana university student ID as a voter identification — facially unconstitutional. McGrath found that while the U.S. Constitution contains no explicit protection of the right to vote, the courts have held that the right “is a bulwark for other basic civil and political rights.” He said that eliminating Election Day registration interferes with the fundamental right to vote and disenfranchises more than 70,000 Montanans. “This is like arguing that because absentee voting was once not allowed, it would not interfere with the electorate’s right to vote to eliminate it today — even though three-quarters of voters in Montana now utilize it to vote,” McGrath wrote.  He affirmed that House Bill 530 takes away the only option to vote for many Native Americans living on reservations. Richie Melby, representing Montana&#8217;s secretary of state, called the majority opinion a result of &#8220;faulty constitutional analysis.&#8221; &#8220;The court&#8217;s result-driven approach to judicial activism in striking down common sense voting laws designed to be as highly acceptable and secure as possible defies constitutional norms and will inevitably stand on the wrong side of legal history,&#8221; Melby said.</span></p>

The legislation was ruled unconstitutional one month ago by the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department in New York. It had sought to allow an estimated 800,000 eligible non-citizens to cast ballots in city elections including those for mayor and City Council. But Local Law 11 of 2022 had been challenged by a coalition of right-leaning elected officials, including Staten Island Republicans Vito Fossella, Joe Borelli and Nicole Malliotakis. They argue the right to vote is sacred to U.S. citizens and the legislation is unconstitutional. Mayor Eric Adams’ administration had been defending the law and appealed a lower court’s ruling against it, but representatives did not immediately respond to questions Monday on whether its attorneys would appeal to the New York State Court of Appeals.</span></p>

The county legislature has made clear over the last few months its intention to challenge the new law, arguing it conflicts with the county&#8217;s charter. Twenty New York counties are chartered, meaning they have a locally drafted and approved laws outlining the structure and authority of county government. The law moves several local elections outside of New York City to even-numbered years, with the exception of some city or village elections, and races for county clerk, sheriff, district attorneys, local judges and others protected in the state Constitution. The state Legislature passed the legislation in June and Gov. Kathy Hochul signed it into law in December. Transitioning elections is scheduled to start in 2025. Advocates argue the change will boost voter turnout in local elections. They also say the state law includes language to supersede any county charter laws.  Opponents have also voiced concern with local issues getting overshadowed by races at the top of the ballot.</span></p>

Newburgh is the second municipality in the Hudson Valley to be sued under the 2022 law designed to prevent racial voter suppression and discrimination. The same law firm, Abrams Fensterman, LLP, sued the town of Mount Pleasant in Westchester County back in January for similar accusations of violating the state Voting Rights Act. A group of six town residents, three who are Black and three Hispanic, claims the current method for electing the four council seats prevents Black and Hispanic residents from electing their candidates of choice. According to the lawsuit, a quarter of the town is Black and another 15% is Hispanic but the residents claim every person ever elected to the town board has been white. They added the last time a person of color ran for a town board seat was in 2011.</span></p>

The 2-1 decision from the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals strikes down a lower court ruling and sets up a potential Supreme Court battle over Pennsylvania’s mail-ballots that began in 2020, and will almost certainly affect how the swing state’s ballots are handled in the upcoming presidential election. At issue is the materiality provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits officials from denying anyone from voting because of an error or omission “on any record or paper relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting,” unless it is material to the person’s qualification to vote. “Because the date decision is irrelevant to whether a vote is received timely, the blink response is to believe a voter’s failure to date a return envelope should not cause his ballot to be disqualified,” Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro wrote in the decision Wednesday. But the provision only applies when the state is determining who may vote, Ambro added, “and does not apply to rules, like the date requirement, that govern how a qualified voter must cast his ballot for it to be counted.” Ambro noted that the date requirement “serves little apparent purpose,” but since the state’s Supreme Court ruled that dating of envelopes was mandatory, “undated or misdated ballots are invalid under state law and must be set aside.” Pennsylvania redesigned its mail in ballots for this year. Circuit Judge Patty Shwartz  wrote in a dissenting opinion Wednesday that the ruling was a reminder to voters to carefully review all instructions. “If they do not, they risk having their otherwise valid votes discounted based on even the most inconsequential mistake,” Shwartz wrote. “One can only hope that election officials do not capitalize on the Majority’s narrow interpretation of the Materiality Provision by enacting unduly technical and immaterial post-registration paperwork requirements that could silence the voices of qualified voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Jennifer P. Wilson has</span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/court-dismisses-pa-freedom-caucus-lawsuit-challenging-automatic-voter-registration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dismissed a lawsuit by two dozen conservative state lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that claimed ballot access initiatives by President Joe Biden and Gov. Josh Shapiro usurped the state Legislature’s authority to direct federal elections in the commonwealth. Wilson’s one-page order grants motions by state and federal officials to dismiss the case. The order also denies a request by two dozen conservative lawmakers for a preliminary injunction to block the ballot access initiatives, including Shapiro’s executive order implementing automatic voter registration for driver’s license applicants. In a statement, Shapiro said automatic voter registration is safe, secure, efficient, and entirely within his administration’s authority. Shapiro said that in 2020, when he was attorney general, he defeated Donald Trump and “his conspiracy theorist allies” in court to defend Pennsylvania residents’ votes and access to the ballot box.</span></p>

Afterwards, a successful petition led to a new vote on the question in November 2021. In a 142-139 vote, the article was rejected and the school stayed open. Two Windham residents filed a lawsuit against the town and three voters in December 2021, alleging that the three people participated in the vote even though they were not residents of the town. However, Corbett wrote, &#8220;even if these three votes were set aside, the result of the public question would be the same: there would be 139 votes cast in favor of the article, and 139 votes cast against the article. As a result, the article would not have received &#8216;a majority of the votes . . . in favor of the proposition,&#8217; and so the article would not be approved, and the result of the public question would be the same: that the school should not be closed.&#8221; &#8220;The Town is pleased with the decision as it confirmed what the Town has been arguing throughout the matter,&#8221; Town Attorney Bob Fisher said Thursday in an email response to the Reformer. In a statement, Crystal Corriveau said she and fellow plaintiff Erin Kehoe do not agree with the court&#8217;s decision. Corriveau said the point raised in a motion for dismissal was denied in the Windham County court before the case was moved to Windsor County.</span></p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2024/03/26/al-schmidt-pennsylvania-secretary-of-state-trusting-elections-misinformation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Votebeat Live Discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This year, Pennsylvania voters will cast their ballots for president, members of Congress, top state offices such as attorney general and treasurer, and more. In 2020, the state was subjected to false claims of election fraud fueled by former President Donald Trump. The claims led to a flood of lawsuits, some of which went to the state’s Supreme Court and sowed distrust in Pennsylvania’s election system. Via Zoom, Al Schmidt, head of the Pennsylvania Department of State, will join Votebeat and SpotlightPA to discuss how his agency is working to create trust in our election system and combat misinformation. Schmidt will take audience questions. The event will also include a Q&amp;A with a University of Pittsburgh researcher on how to spot election misinformation. Our panelists will include: Carter Walker, Votebeat Pennsylvania reporter, Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA government reporter. Al Schmidt, secretary of the commonwealth, and Beth Schwanke, Pitt Disinformation Lab executive director. <strong>When:</strong> April 2, 6pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

Counting (and confirming the count) comes next—along with reporting results and, sometimes, recounts. Join us for the second installment of NCSL’s four-part webinar series on election administration to learn about what happens after voting is over. U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Donald Palmer will consider how all states address these tasks that ensure accurate and verifiable results. <strong>When:</strong> April 12, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>

They are spread by authoritarian state actors and malign non-state actors bent on undermining and damaging free and liberty-loving republics. Unfortunately, most solutions come internally from social media platforms or rest with governments to devise. A new grassroots strategy is needed: bottom-up rather than top-down. That is why R Street Institute and George Mason University are holding an Idea-thon to address the problem and find new solutions. Teams will form to attack misinformation and disinformation from four tracks: government, business/technology, nonprofit, and education. Winning teams will receive prizes. Examples of work products include new legislation and regulations, a business plan for a tech start-up, a mobile app, an academic course, or a new nonprofit. Be creative! Software developers are needed, but no computer science skills are necessary to participate. Just bring your best ideas for combating misinformation and disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> April 20. <strong>Where:</strong> Fairfax, Virginia</span></p>
