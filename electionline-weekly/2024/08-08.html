														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cuyahoga County, Ohio launches voter education series</strong><br />
<em>College interns play major role in program</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://boe.cuyahogacounty.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuyahoga County, Ohio Board of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CCBOE) recently initiated an </span><a href="https://boe.cuyahogacounty.gov/voters/election-integrity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Integrity Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a comprehensive 9-topic program <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11667 alignleft" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-08-at-11.34.00 AM-300x247.png" alt="" width="300" height="247" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-08-at-11.34.00 AM-300x247.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-08-at-11.34.00 AM-768x632.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-08-at-11.34.00 AM.png 892w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />designed to educate and engage the community on various aspects of the election process. This series aims to enhance transparency, build trust, and ensure a well-informed electorate by delving into the mechanisms that uphold the integrity of elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The BOE recognizes the danger this misinformation poses to the democratic process, so it wants to reassure the public that elections are safe, secure, fair, and worthy of participation,” explained Lily Scherer, one of two college interns who worked on the program. “The hope is that this program educates members of the public and alleviates their concerns about the electoral process. The BOE wants to remind people it is the most trustworthy source of information about voting and elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCBOE has had a “Rumor Control Central” page on its website for two years, which served to address several election “myths” that are commonly believed. This election integrity series in a way is just expanding upon this effort, except the CCBOE is now actively pushing this effort outwardly to the public through the media (both traditional and social), <img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11656" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE1-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE1-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE1.png 478w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" />community events, public events at the CCBOE, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is our response to the concerns that we have heard from voters,” </span><a href="https://youtu.be/LDVVfzDVKro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Anthony Perlatti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, director of the Board of Elections. “This campaign will reassure voters that our elections are transparent, fair and accurate.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPOlJKLkktk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other resource materials will provide information that will teach people exactly how the Board of Elections’ systems and procedures ensure the integrity of our voting systems.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Election Integrity topic will be released on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cuyahogaboe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and available on </span><a href="https://x.com/cuyahogaboe?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cuyahogaboe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CuyahogaCountyBOE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://boe.cuyahogacounty.gov/voters/election-integrity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Elections website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Election Integrity materials and videos will remain on the Board of Elections website and social media platforms through the November 5, 2024 Presidential General Election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Integrity topics:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1: Security Measures in the Voter Registration Process<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2: Vote-by-Mail Ballot Security<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3: Ballot Drop Box Security<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4: Secure Voting Equipment<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5: Security Measures for Creating and Counting Ballots which includes ballot hand count<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6: Physical and Information Technology Security<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7: Secure Early In-Person Voting<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8: Secure Polling Locations<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9: Election Day Security Measures </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE2-186x300.png" alt="" width="186" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE2-186x300.png 186w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE2.png 566w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />The release of each topic will be accompanied by videos elaborating on the importance and security implications of the topic. The videos will explain key messages in a digestible and engaging manner. In addition to the videos, the CCBOE will be releasing relevant flyers, infographics, and social media graphics related to the topics.  While the Board hopes to reach everyone with this program, they do have a target audience as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, we especially want to reach the groups most skeptical of the voting process and least likely to vote,” Sherer said. “This includes those who believe the results of the 2020 presidential election were fraudulent, voters 18-25, and voters over 65. We hope this series will reassure these voters about the validity of elections and the strength of our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, through the summer the CCBOE is holding  three major public events relating to the topics. There will be a sample hand-counting event, a panel discussion about election security with the directors of the Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton County Boards of Elections, and a warehouse walkthrough. The hand-<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11658" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE4-300x298.png" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE4-300x298.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE4-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE4.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />counting event will be in person, with the goal to prove the safety, efficiency, and efficacy of voting machines while highlighting the impossibility of a hand-counted election. The warehouse walkthrough will also be in person, but the panel will be pre-recorded and released on the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Peter James, CCBOE elections and compliance administrator, the Community Outreach Department has been a part of about 60 in-person events this summer. Either directly or indirectly, these events have served as another opportunity (outside of our social media reach and our website) to spread the word about the election integrity series. The feedback the Community Outreach Department has received from these events has been overwhelmingly positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The analytics on both our social media posts and YouTube videos have been higher than what we typically see, particularly during the summer,” James said. “In particular, a video interview with our Deputy Director Tony Kaloger about our Ballot Drop Box has seen nearly 1,000 views in the first five days it was published.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Scherer, a rising senior at George Washington University in Washington, DC, Athena Vadnal, a rising senior at Wesleyan University in Connecticut also worked on the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11657" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE3-149x300.png" alt="" width="149" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE3-149x300.png 149w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CCBOE3.png 458w" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" />“Working with the interns has been successful from both perspectives I believe,” said James. “From the board&#8217;s perspective, having two college students with design and video creation skills has allowed us to create content that we might otherwise not been able to do. More importantly, having interns dedicated exclusively to this project ensured it would get done, done well, and on time. There is simply too much preparation time needed ahead of the November election for regular staff to have created this series. From their standpoint, it provided them with experience working in an office setting while being able to create content (and generate references) that could be used for future employment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun side note, Vadnal’s father worked at the CCBOE during the summers of 1983 and 1984 as part of a summer intern program tasked with checking for outdated voter registrations and verifying signatures on absentee ballot requests. Everything had to be done by hand, all voter registration cards were on small sheets of paper and filed in a basement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James said working with the college interns this summer has been a huge advantage and he would highly recommend other elections office take advantage of this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The responsibilities for boards of elections has grown exponentially in recent years. While voter education measures like this Election Integrity Series may not necessarily fall under the duties of an elections office as defined by various state laws/statutes, it ultimately does fall on them in large part because there is a void, and that void needs to be filled,” Jame said. “ If not, it greatly increases the chances that misinformation can take hold. Projects like these are perfect for college interns. Creating videos for poll worker training is another project that we have used a college intern for in the past. There are research projects that would be well served with the help of college interns.”</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Managing Burnout and Stress </strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Care of Yourself and Your Team</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott O Konopasek<br />
</span><a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Carter Center</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we are, three months from the 2024 Presidential Election and it seems like every day there is a surprise that brings new scrutiny about how elections are run, and more pressure to reassure voters that you and your team are committed to running free and fair elections. All the while, time keeps slipping away, but the tasks you need to accomplish for a successful election remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6137" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-300x191.png" alt="" width="300" height="191" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-300x191.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-768x489.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />As we get closer to November, it’s quite likely that you will become a stranger at home, that you will eat poorly, and that your sleep won’t be restful. It’s not just you who feels the stress and pressure building for this election. The rest of the members of your team are feeling it. Your colleagues in other jurisdictions and states are feeling it too. It sometimes feels like the world is testing you in new ways to see when you will reach your breaking point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this sound familiar? This is the life of an election official in a Presidential Election year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in 1996 and up through 2020, I managed to survive seven Presidential Elections with varying degrees of physical and emotional bruises and scars. Along the way I learned two very important lessons: 1) you must take care of yourself, and 2) you must care for each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, right, ” you say. “I’m too busy. Working hard and long hours is the only way to get thing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">done. I don’t have time, ” you may be saying right about now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is you really don’t have a choice. A burned out, tired, beat down, mentally frazzled, and sick election administrator is no good to anyone. And it is definitely not helpful to building public trust and confidence in your work product — a free and fair election. In addition to all the external stressors, teams who work 20-hour days for weeks on end without a day off will break down at some point, individually and collectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing the connection between mental and physical health and healthy election institutions,<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/"> The Carter Center</a> has released the second edition of </span><a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/mental_health/mental-well-being-guide-for-election-officials.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taking Care of Yourself and Your Team”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an easy-to-use well-being reference with tips and resources tailored to election administrators and their teams. Understanding the tension between setting aside time for self-care and getting the job done, the guide has been organized for easy reference and access to helpful sources of advice and help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you will take some time to review it, to refer to it, and to widely share it with your teams. In the guide, The Carter Center acknowledges the valuable practical advice drawn from <a href="https://electionsgroup.com/">The Elections Group</a>’s recent publication </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/wellness-and-resilience/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wellness and Resilience in a Box.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Carter Center and the Elections Group are co-hosting a remote panel discussion on personal and team wellness on August 20th. </span><a href="https://emory.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwsfuCvpz8sE9YUkyxgFdUIPVREoxApQloP#/registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Register Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pace quickens, the temperature continues to rise, and passions are even more enflamed- remember: Overcoming adversity and achieving monumental accomplishments are team endeavors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t feel like you have time for self-care, take the time to care for your team members. When election teams care for each other, everyone gets the care they need to carry on.</span></p>

							<h2>2024 LEO Survey</h2>
														<p><strong>EVIC’s 2024 Local Election Official Survey is Live!!!</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2024 </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo_survey_project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Election Official (LEO) Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now live and beginning its fielding period this week through August 30 with data to be analyzed for a pre-Election Day sharing of EVIC&#8217;s findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11659" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LEOSurvey-300x207.png" alt="" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LEOSurvey-300x207.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LEOSurvey.png 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We are using this survey to lift up LEOs&#8217; voices in national, regional, and state conversations about election administration, integrity, and conduct. The survey provides LEOs with an important and timely opportunity to weigh in on issues of concern in the profession. We recognize this is a very busy time of year for LEOs and we know all are busy serving voters. We thank everyone for taking the time to participate and greatly appreciate LEOs and all stakeholders in the elections community for supporting this work.</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo_survey_project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Past EVIC LEO Survey efforts from 2018 &#8211; 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been effective in sharing the challenges of election administration and we hope this year to draw attention to the challenges and successes of the election administration community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 3,100 LEOs throughout all 50 States and the District of Columbia have been randomly selected to receive this year&#8217;s survey, so not all LEOs will receive it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey is arriving to LEOs electronically from this email address &#8211; leosurvey@pdx.edu &#8211; at </span><a href="https://www.pdx.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland State University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where our </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#research-director-paul-manson"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVIC Research Director Paul Manson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is based. </span></p>

The link sent to each LEO is unique to them and should not be shared. The link will connect to a secure online connection to protect LEO responses and privacy. Each individual survey link will begin with the following URL: </span><a href="https://portlandstate.qualtrics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://portlandstate.qualtrics.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey should take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete and all responses to this survey will be kept confidential. We do ask at the end if we may share some anonymized quotes from some survey questions, and respondents can ask that these remain fully confidential and not shared. We will also be following up with reminders and paper-based surveys sent to LEOs via the U.S. Postal Service.</span></p>

In addition to a keystone national toolkit, there are BOTH infographics and fact sheets for seven states (Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia). Additionally, as Issue One was preparing a response for the attempted assassination of the former president, they found guidance for election administrators and for specific demographic groups, but couldn&#8217;t find a good guide for people in communities to de-escalate and focus on elections.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 1 voters in </span><a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/very-light-turnout-reported-for-tennessees-local-and-state-august-primaries"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where turnout during both early voting and on primary Thursday was reported to be light statewide. Sullivan County Election Administrator Jason Booher and Hawkins County Election Administrator Crystal Rogers both reported </span><a href="https://www.timesnews.net/news/local-news/aug-1-a-slow-turnout-day-say-sullivan-hawkins-election-administrators/article_ca3aa9bc-506c-11ef-9ef3-8b9c3b17249d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">light turnout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and no real problems. &#8220;Historically, August turnout is low,&#8221; Alan Farley Rutherford County elections administrator said. &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2024/08/01/election-day-arrives-for-rutherford-county-murfreesboro-offices-and-primaries-for-tn-lawmaker-seats/74609253007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people are focusing on getting in a few vacation days </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">before school starts or their attention is focused on getting prepared on school starting. Presidential elections are our highest turnout elections. We will be north of 60% turnout in November.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, August 3 voters on </span><a href="https://www.kuam.com/story/51141328/guam-primary-sees-low-voter-turnout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://stthomassource.com/content/2024/08/03/low-voter-turnout-marks-saturdays-democratic-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Virgin Islands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit the polls for primaries. Both archipelagos note low voter turnout. “Yes, it was low voter turnout but the thing to also remember is that our voter registry has gone up to over 60,000,” said Guam Election Commission Executive Director Maria Pangelinan. Overall, 31.16% of voters showed up. “We try our best. Let us know how else to entice the voter to come in. Early voting is very efficient,” said Pangelinan. In USVI, turnout was low both on primary day and during early voting. Some attributed that to the issues surrounding this year’s primary. The primary faced significant challenges this year. In January, District Court Chief Judge Robert Molloy ruled eight sections of the V.I. Code governing primary elections unconstitutional. In a Senate hearing, Elections Supervisor Caroline Fawkes stated that “a normal primary election would be impossible without some change.” The Board of Elections scrambled and, in an emergency meeting at the end of May, worked out a plan to exclude intra-party offices from the ballot but keep the names of people running for public office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, it was a quiet day at the polls in </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/08/06/kansas-voters-participate-in-low-turnout-primary-based-on-a-sense-of-responsibility-duty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday with some voters telling the Kansas Reflector that they voted out of a sense of obligation. “I’m kind of disenchanted, but I do feel like it’s an obligation, but also a right, also a privilege. So, I do it,” voter Kathy McDowell said in Douglas County.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2024/08/07/august-primary-voting-turnout-storms-polling-place-outages/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power outages and humid ink </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">made headlines in <strong>Michigan</strong> where </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/more-than-1m-michiganders-have-cast-ballots-during-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than one million voters cast their ballots in advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Tuesday’s primary. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Tuesday night that she expected totals to be </span><a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/turnout-dips-throughout-michigan-amid-heavy-rains-early-voting-apathy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near 2 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would be less than a quarter of the state’s total registered voters. “At this point, most people are just ready for November,” Canton Township Clerk Michael Siegrist said. Severe weather most likely impacted turnout as well. At some voting locations in </span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2024/08/voters-shelter-in-polling-place-bathroom-during-michigan-tornado-warning-on-election-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Joseph County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters were asked to shelter in place during a tornado warning that hit the area Tuesday morning. Weather-related issues led to a minor disruption at polling places in </span><a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/polling-locations-royal-oak-warren-moved-after-weather-related-outages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">metro Detroit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after power outages led to the relocation of multiple precincts. Voters in </span><a href="https://www.abc12.com/news/local/some-flint-residents-upset-about-voting-precinct-changes/article_ad75dc9c-5473-11ef-8247-6fdc62e72ec8.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voiced concerns about several of the city&#8217;s voting precincts changing or moving as part of the redistricting process. </span><a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/thats-our-duty-to-vote-voters-hit-the-polls-in-livonia-city-clerk-reports-higher-than-normal-turnout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livonia City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Lori Miller told 7 News Detroit, &#8220;We’re having a great turnout here at the precincts, higher than normal and we had an en excellent turnout in our early voting site.&#8221; She said the rise in early voting has made in-person voting move quickly. &#8220;It does take the strain off the precincts, so there’s less lines, less waiting, but still a higher voter turnout,&#8221; said Miller. Law enforcement is investigating a possible incident of voter intimidation Tuesday in </span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2024/08/fire-department-dispute-may-have-prompted-up-north-voter-intimidation-incident.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crawford County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, officials said. A member of a state elections ground team conducting election check-ins around the state witnessed the incident in Beaver Creek Township in which people who were campaigning partly blocked an entrance to a polling location, said Angela Benander, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of State.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a quiet day in <strong>Missouri</strong> with only a few reported problems. </span><a href="https://www.ksmu.org/news/2024-08-06/turnout-has-been-light-so-far-for-the-primary-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Shane Schoeller says things have gone smoothly at the polls, but the turnout has been lighter than he expected.

A vendor glitch caused the delay of results being posted on the </span><a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/vendor-glitch-delayed-results-in-st-charles-county-tuesday-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Charles County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website. “It’s frustrating because we want to give that information to the voters as quickly as possible. We work with the voters obviously all day long to help voters cast their vote, but our day isn’t over until we have tallied that vote and given voters the knowledge of who won,” St. Charles County Director of Elections Kurt Bahr said. In </span><a href="https://www.fourstateshomepage.com/local-news/joplin-news/behind-the-scenes-in-joplin-on-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joplin County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election judges spoke with reporters about why they do what they do. “You know, looking at the ballot I get the feeling inside like this is cool, I’m glad we get to do this,” said Jerry Reinke, Jasper County Supervisor Judge. In the r</span><a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/06/denny-hoskins-barbara-phifer-selected-as-secretary-of-state-candidates/74695080007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ace for secretary of state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican Denny Hoskins will face Democrat Barbara Phifer in November.  </span></p>

In parts of </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/08/07/mail-delays-postpone-the-start-of-pre-election-day-voting-in-parts-of-rural-alaska/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural Alaska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early voting for the August 20 primary was delayed due to postal delays. Alaska has only a handful of true early voting sites that are set up like Election Day polling places. In smaller communities, the state distributes blank absentee ballots and allows voters to cast “absentee in person” votes that are then mailed through the normal absentee ballot process. In places where mail delivery is often slow, it’s frequently a faster way to vote before Election Day. But this year, some absentee ballot packages were delayed getting to their final destination. In Bethel, ballots didn’t arrive until Tuesday afternoon. In Utqiagvik and Kotzebue, they arrived Wednesday. Altogether, eight communities didn’t receive their packages until Monday, nine got them on Tuesday, and as of Wednesday afternoon, 14 communities were still waiting for their ballots, said Carol Beecher, the division director. In some cases, the delays were due to bad weather. In others, the person designated to pick up the mail from the airport wasn’t answering the phone. Hurricane Debby forced </span><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/briefs/first-day-of-early-voting-cancelled-in-some-florida-counties-due-to-hurricane-debby/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some Florida counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make adjustments to their early voting schedules. </span><a href="https://alachuachronicle.com/start-of-early-voting-postponed-to-august-6-due-to-storm-impacts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alachua County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delayed their start till Tuesday and </span><a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/politics/elections/start-of-early-voting-in-duval-county-pushed-back-amid-incoming-tropical-storm-debby-jacksonville-voting-2024-election/77-2cc42484-4fb8-4a92-8e84-a145a257e37d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duval County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until Wednesday.

The group flagged issues that emerged last month with the AI-powered Grok chatbot on X, formerly known as Twitter. Soon after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, Grok provided information to some users inaccurately stating that, “The ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election,” in nine states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas and Ohio, according to the letter. “This is false,” the letter says. “In all nine states the opposite is true: The ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.”  The letter urged Musk to “immediately implement changes” on the X platform. They want him to direct users to a </span><a href="https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nonpartisan website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Association of Secretaries of State where voters can look up reliable information about their registration status and polling-place locations.

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8881" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Colorado Ballot Measure</strong>: Colorado Voters First, an elections reform group, says it has submitted 213,000 signatures to the Colorado secretary of state’s office in support of a sweeping measure to </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/ranked-choice-voting-signatures-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abolish party primaries and adopt ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The submission makes it likely that</span><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2023-2024/310OriginalFinal.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Initiative 310</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will comfortably exceed the minimum threshold of 124,238 valid signatures to qualify for the November ballot once its petitions are verified by the secretary of state. The initiative proposes to replace Colorado’s partisan primary system with a single “all-candidate primary” for each state and federal office. The top four candidates would advance to a general election decided by ranked choice voting, also known as instant runoff voting. Under this method, voters would rank as many or as few of the four candidates as they wish, and candidates with the fewest first-place votes are eliminated until one candidate receives a majority. Local elections officials across the state have been cool towards the proposal, fretting over the feasibility of implementing the new system on the timeline envisioned by Thiry and his allies. With support from the Colorado County Clerks Association, a last-minute amendment to an elections bill passed at the end of the 2024 legislative session erected several significant obstacles that could delay the initiative’s implementation. But alongside top Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said upon signing the bill in May that state leaders will “take prompt and good faith actions to successfully implement the will of the voters” if the measure passes, promising the measure’s reforms would take effect “no later than the 2028 election cycle.”</span></p>

Board of Elections on Friday certified a ballot initiative that, if approved, would bring ranked-choice voting and semi-open primaries to the District. The board voted to place Initiative 83 on the ballot after finding supporters had gathered enough valid signatures to qualify. The initiative will jointly ask voters to open primary elections to registered independents — who can’t participate in them — and to change how votes are tallied through ranked-choice voting. That method allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference and is intended to ensure that the winner receives at least 50 percent of the vote. Board of Elections officials said that of more than 40,000 petition signatures the Make All Votes Count campaign submitted, 27,773 were found to be valid — beyond the minimum requirement of about 22,500. Signature reviewers rejected 4,802 signatures for use of Wite-Out that appeared to affect voter intent, and rejected thousands more for other issues such as not being from valid registered D.C. voters, officials said. Board of Elections Chairman Gary Thompson said he felt confident the process was transparent and the small army of petition reviewers scrutinized every petition signature with “painstaking care.” He repeated several times that the board was neutral about the initiative, adding at one point that he was undecided and looked forward to hearing the arguments for and against.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6180" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia Rulemaking</strong>: The </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/08/07/georgia-election-board-clears-county-officials-to-delay-vote-certification-with-information-demands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Election Board pushed through proposed election rules </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">August 6 that have sparked fierce debates over giving county officials greater authority to refuse to certify voter tallies. Currently, certification by local election boards is considered an administrative task that doesn’t allow members to delay as they investigate results provided to them by county officials. The new process could delay the certification of a Georgia election in a large county if a single board member called for an investigation into equipment or administration of the vote. This week’s election board meeting comes on the heels of a campaign rally in Atlanta where former President Donald Trump praised conservative Georgia election board members Rick Jeffares, Janice Johnston and Janelle King for their staunch support of new election policies in Georgia. That included the rule adopted Tuesday that allows local election boards members to exercise their discretion of “reasonable inquiry” to review documents and other election-related information prior to voting on certification. Under Georgia law, county election boards are required to vote on certifying election results within six days after Election Day. The Georgia Secretary of State is mandated by law to verify the statewide results for the upcoming presidential election by Nov. 22. The new rule allows local election board members to request insight from election supervisors and staff as well as access other election-related materials to base their decision to sign off on the vote count local officials provide, or refuse to certify the results. The new rule could lead to more legal challenges over a state law that still requires county boards to certify the results as part of their normal election duties. Several Republican Georgia county election officials declined to certify the results of recent elections, but their efforts were thwarted by boards controlled by Democrats.</span></p>

The Coalition for Ann Arbor’s Future announced, August 6, the city clerk’s office has certified the grassroots group has enough petition signatures to put both proposed city charter amendments to voters Nov. 5. One proposal would make mayor and City Council races nonpartisan, while the other seeks to establish public campaign financing for those races, using city taxpayer funds. City Clerk Jackie Beaudry confirmed she notified the group that both petitions met the requirement of having signatures from at least 5,705 registered city voters. One had 5,843 and the other had 5,868. She is forwarding the ballot language to the governor and attorney general for their review now, she said.</span></p>

The proposal would do away with the primary and instead place all candidates on the same ballot without party affiliation. The group Ypsi BIG gathered the signatures for the initiative. Organizer Em Hoepner says the change would increase participation. She says with only Democrats tending to file for office, the low-turnout primary becomes the de facto general election. Ypsilanti 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ward Councilman Patrick McLean strongly opposes eliminating the partisan primary. He says it would deprive voters of basic information regarding a candidate’s party affiliation and could lead to extremists getting elected with a small plurality of the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7069" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Albuquerque-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong>: Albuquqerque’s voting system, which requires a candidate to receive 50% of the vote to win, will remain in place. On August 5, Albuquerque City Council</span><a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/politics-government/albuquerque-city-council-fails-to-override-veto-on-voting-system-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rejected an override to Mayor Tim Keller’s veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a bill that would have allowed a plurality voting system and eliminated run-off elections. Councilors originally passed the measure that would have gone on the November ballot but the mayor vetoed it. It was a 5-4 vote which is one vote short to override a veto. The ballot measure would have let voters decide if the election for mayor and city council seats should be based on who receives the most votes or if there should be a minimum threshold.  Currently, to get elected, a candidate needs to receive at least 50% of the votes as well as receive more votes than other candidates to be considered the winner. City council considered changing that so that candidates could win if they received less than 50% of the votes, but still had more votes than any other candidate.</span></p>

The bills the governor signed will: Allow pre-registered voters, individuals who will be 18 years old by Election Day, to apply for an absentee or early mail voting ballot; Ensure New Yorkers are able to cure ballot defects within the required timeframes; Create a standard ordering criteria for candidates appearing on a ballot; Bring state election law into compliance with the requirements set under the federal Electoral Count Reform Act; Expand poll watcher eligibility to include most New York state attorneys; Make technical changes related to town elections; and Clarify administrative processes for preclearance coverage determinations under the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York “Our democracy is rooted in the sacrifices of those willing to fight for that idea greater than any one of us, and with this legislation, we are strengthening our efforts to protect it,” Hochul said in a statement. “Every New Yorker deserves the opportunity to have their voice heard, and these laws bring the ideals of self-governance closer to reality.”</span></p>

Brad Roae (R-Meadville) wants to make it easier for Pennsylvania residents to </span><a href="https://www.timesobserver.com/news/local-news/2024/08/new-bill-include-percentage-of-counties-reporting-on-election-night/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">follow election results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rose has introduced a co-sponsorship memorandum for legislation he is drafting that would require the Pennsylvania Department of State to restore information on Election Night that tells voters how many voting precincts have reported their data.  “The Department of State removed an election result transparency feature from their website about five years ago and I will soon introduce legislation to mandate its return,” Rose wrote in his memorandum. “The election returns portion of the Department of State website previously showed how many voting precincts there were and how many precincts had been counted. It also showed what percent of the precincts had reported. The Department of State still gets this information, but they removed it from their website so that citizens can no longer see it. My legislation would mandate that it be included again on their election return website.”</span></p>

Voters will now need to consider that proposal in November. When they go to the ballot, voters in Knoxville will be presented with two options: either implement district-limited voting or implement a citywide, at-large voting system with candidate residency requirements. The decision comes after Tennessee lawmakers passed a new law impacting Knoxville elections. The new state law was condemned by the Knoxville vice mayor and most members of the Knoxville City Council as an overreach of state power. Governor Bill Lee signed the law in May 2023 and it took effect on Jan. 1. Previously, when Knoxville voters headed to the polls during city primary elections, they were allowed to vote for candidates only in their district. During the city general elections, however, Knoxville voters could vote for candidates in every city council election, including districts outside the one they live in. The law aims to put a stop to that style of voting and instead requires the city to follow how most state municipalities choose leaders, mostly by implementing district-limited elections.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed itself August 1, allowing Arizonans again to </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/02/arizona-voter-registration-rules-reversed-in-latest-court-ruling/74642388007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register to vote in federal races without having to prove citizenship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s another swerve in the legal battle over a 2022 law that aims ultimately to reverse a portion of the National Voter Registration Act and require all Arizona voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. The order reopens a path for potential voters who just two weeks ago were barred from using the state voter registration form to sign up to vote unless they could produce proof of U.S. citizenship. It comes with two months left before the Oct. 7 registration deadline for the high-stakes presidential election. The order means people can again use the state-issued voter registration form even if they don&#8217;t produce proof of citizenship. Instead, they attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens, and are limited to voting in federal races only. In the first 10 days after the July 18 ruling that required the documentary proof, the Maricopa County Recorder&#8217;s Office said it had rejected 200 voter applications. Following the ruling, the Arizona Secretary of State&#8217;s Office clarified the impact of the ruling. &#8220;Election officials may not reject voter registration applications submitted without DPOC, regardless of which form is used,&#8221; communications director Aaron Thacker said. DPOC is shorthand for documentary proof of citizenship. Senate President Warren Petersen vowed to seek an emergency stay from the U.S. Supreme Court &#8220;to make sure only American citizens are voting in our elections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Jennifer Ryan-Touhill has ruled that Arizona’s rules aimed at preventing specific types of voter intimidation and harassment near polling places and drop boxes are </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2024/08/06/arizona-court-blocks-voter-intimidation-rules-outside-polling-places/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">too broad and violate free speech rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rules, some of which have been in place for years, prohibit anyone from following, photographing, videotaping, or yelling at voters outside drop boxes or polling places, along with other activities that Secretary of State Adrian Fontes had declared were intimidating. August 6’s  injunction from Ryan-Touhill temporarily prohibits Arizona officials from enforcing the rules, until the court can issue a final ruling in the matter. The ruling comes just two months before early voting begins for the presidential election, and as Republican groups pledge to watch over the polls. The Republican National Committee, for example, launched a “Protect the Vote” tour in June to recruit poll watchers, poll workers, and lawyers to “ensure it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.” Fontes’s office said in a statement Tuesday that it will appeal the order. “While we respect the court’s decision to halt certain speech restrictions, implementing a preliminary injunction for the general election would be too far-reaching,” the statement said.</span></p>

The U.S. Attorney’s Office sued the county last year, alleging that a seven-year probe into the county’s voting program found that disabled residents were prevented from voting in person as far back as 2016. Investigators who surveyed more than 100 county voting centers noted such architectural barriers as steep ramps, abrupt level changes at walkways and entrance doors, and lack of accessible parking. The impediments prevented people with mobility and vision disabilities from being able to safely access vote centers and cast their ballots in person, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court also alleged that the county’s curbside voting program was inaccessible, as certain polling centers lacked signage indicating that curbside voting was available or failed to provide sufficient means for a voter to contact an election worker for assistance with curbside voting. County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean C. Logan said in a statement that while no systemic deficiencies were identified in the probe, aging infrastructure and facilities were partly to blame for access issues. The county’s agreement with the federal government will spur a focus on “the intricacies of sidewalk slopes, public transit access, and clear paths of travel leading to voting areas,” he said. Under the settlement, the county will work with an independent accessibility expert on site selection policies and procedures to ensure that facilities, buildings, sites or locations chosen to serve as vote centers are ADA compliant or can be made more accessible during the voting period by employing temporary measures. The expert will provide biannual reports on the county’s progress, according to the agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Thomas Quinn, on behalf of Denver-based Salem Media, which hosts conservative talk radio shows, including Wake Up with Randy Corporon. asked the Colorado Court of Appeals on August 6 to reverse a lower court’s </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/conservative-radio-host-seeks-dismissal-of-election-fraud-defamation-case-before-colorado-court-of-appeals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denial of anti-SLAPP motions </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by a target of 2020 election fraud disinformation. “The plaintiff’s entire case is based on a theme of self-censorship,” Quinn argued. Following the 2020 election, Corporon interviewed Joseph Oltmann, a Castle Rock-based businessman who claimed he heard a man identified as “Eric from Dominion” say on a call that he was going to make sure Trump lost the 2020 election. Internet research led Oltmann to conclude the speaker was Eric Coomer, a director of product strategy and security at Dominion Voting Systems in Denver. The claim sparked and spread like wildfire after the 2020 election, when it was picked up by the OAN network then repeated by the Trump campaign — along with attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. Locally, attorney Randy Corporon repeated the claims as he interviewed Oltmann on his show. In addition to suing Corporon and Salem for defamation, Coomer filed two other suits seeking to hold accountable more than a dozen individuals and companies that collectively made him the villain in the narrative of baseless claims of election fraud. On June 9, 2023, a Denver judge declined Corporon’s anti-SLAPP special motion to dismiss the suit. Enacted in 2019, the anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation law seeks to block frivolous lawsuits to “safeguard the constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law.” Corporon and Salem both appealed.</span></p>

The complaint by two voter registration groups, the New Georgia Project and the A. Phillip Randolph Institute, alleges that the voter challenge law violates protections in federal law that set standards for canceling registrations. Under Georgia’s new law,</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/189"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 189</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, residents can ask county election boards to remove voter registrations if a voter registers in another state, claims a homestead exemption in a different jurisdiction or registers at a nonresidential address. “County boards have purged voters based on unvetted documentation and unreliable information provided by private citizens, such as screenshots of purported property records or social media posts,” plaintiffs allege in the suit filed July 31. The Republican-sponsored law further empowered conservative activists who have disputed over 100,000 voter registrations since 2021. County election boards have rejected most of those challenges. The lawsuit contends that the National Voter Registration Act only allows the cancellation of registrations of voters who have moved after mailed notification that their address needs to be confirmed, and then if they miss the next two general elections; or when a voter confirms in writing that they have moved.</span></p>

At trial, prosecutors proved Taylor manipulated Vietnamese parents into voting on behalf of family members, or otherwise voting illegally. In November, a federal jury convicted Taylor on 52 counts of voter fraud. In April, a federal judge sentenced Taylor to four-months in prison, and four months of home confinement. The Federal Bureau of Prisons website says Taylor is set to be released from a prison in Waseca, Minnesota, on August 25th. In his appeal, Taylor’s attorney says the court should reverse her conviction for insufficient evidence and order a judgment of acquittal on those charges. Or, Taylor’s attorney asks the court to reverse Taylor’s conviction and order a new trial on whatever charges survive the court’s review of the case. Taylor’s attorney insists the trial court denied Taylor’s requested jury instructions regarding good faith, whether she “knowingly” and “willfully” broke the law. Her attorney also says the government lacked sufficient evidence to support each conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. With regard to four of the voters at issue, Taylor’s attorney says the government failed to present evidence that she was involved in the criminal conduct at issue.</span></p>

The groups argued that the false representation provision put civic organizations at risk because they often provide information and assist with voter registration. They feared such activities could have been construed as representing their members as election officials. The League of Women Voters resumed voter registration efforts in 2022. But Loud Light, a civic group focused on young voters and other civic groups did not resume until the decision last month. This law, Senate substitute for House Bill 2183, was part of a national wave of voter suppression bills passed after the 2020 election. The suppression movement was evident in the most recent Kansas legislative session, too, with proposals such ase limiting advanced voting and adding further verification for mail-in ballots. Watson issued a temporary injunction that restrains and prohibits enforcing the false representation provision. A final decision will be made at trial, where the judge will look at the evidence.</span></p>

The court rejected a challenge from the conservative Minnesota Voters Alliance. A lower court judge had previously thrown out the group’s lawsuit after deciding it lacked the legal standing to sue and failed to prove that the Legislature overstepped its authority when it voted to expand voting rights for people who were formerly incarcerated for a felony. The high court agreed. Before the new law, felons had to complete their probation before they could regain their eligibility to vote. An estimated 55,000 people with felony records gained the right to vote as a result.  The timing of the decision is important because early voting for next week’s primary election is already underway. Voting for the Nov. 5 general election begins Sept. 20.</span></p>

Ashcroft said the executive order violates the United States Constitution. Ashcroft said Biden’s executive order undermined power at the state level and threatened the integrity of our elections. The President signed the executive order 3 years ago. The order called for websites, social media platforms, and other resources to expand access to information to register to vote. Ashcroft’s lawsuit argued the order represented federal overreach. Ashcroft said, “I do not lightly get involved in cases like these, but when the people in this state cannot be sure that their election will be run correctly, and when the federal government is trying to get involved in ways that might violate the right of the people of Missouri to have clean elections that they can trust, and it violates our Constitution, I have to act.”</span></p>

Russell denied the request for a preliminary injunction Friday, a spokesperson for the Nevada Attorney General’s Office confirmed to The Nevada Independent. The decision marks the third legal defeat for the Republican National Committee (RNC), Nevada Republican Party and Trump campaign in their efforts to challenge Nevada election laws before the 2024 election. The attorney general’s office did not offer any other details about the ruling. The suit, which challenges election procedures in Nevada, has not yet been dismissed. It hinges on April testimony from Mark Wlaschin, the deputy secretary of state for elections, who said during a public meeting that the office accepts and counts ballots received in the mail as many as three days after Election Day, even if it does not have a clear postmark.</span></p>

A five-judge Commonwealth Court panel heard about two hours of argument in a case that was filed in May, even though the date requirement has been upheld both by the state Supreme Court and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The case was brought by the Black Political Empowerment Project, Common Cause and allied advocacy groups against the secretary of state and the elections boards in Philadelphia and Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. They argued that enforcing the date requirement infringes upon voting rights and that none of the prior cases on the topic directly ruled whether it runs afoul of the state constitution’s Free and Equal Elections Clause.</span></p>

The ruling — which only applies to the states within the 5th Circuit: Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi — will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2021, the Republican-majority government of Galveston County, Texas redrew its political boundaries to eliminate the one district in which non-white voters represented a majority. A group of current and former officeholders sued, charging that violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bans racial gerrymandering. They were joined by multiple civil rights groups and the Biden administration, in a case that was consolidated as Petteway v. Galveston County. The county argued that neither Blacks nor Latinos alone constituted an outright majority anywhere in its boundaries and that Section 2 does not protect the rights of different racial or ethnic groups to form coalitions. On August 1, the U.S. 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circuit ruled 12-5 in favor of Galveston County, throwing out a precedent its own judges had set in 1988, Campos v. City of Baytown. &#8220;After reconsidering Campos en banc, this court holds that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not authorize separately protected minority groups to aggregate their populations for purposes of a vote dilution claim,&#8221; said Judge Edith H. Jones, writing for the majority. Leading the dissent, Judge Dana M. Douglas wrote, &#8220;Today, the majority finally dismantled the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act in this circuit, leaving four decades of en banc precedent flattened in its wake.&#8221;</span></p>

Republicans asked the judge to not enforce his ruling while their appeal is pending. But Mitchell rejected their arguments, saying putting his ruling on hold “would inflict significant harm on both the disability rights advocates and the public interest.” It will now be up to the state appeals court to decide whether to pause the ruling that opens up a new way for an unknown number of disabled voters to cast their ballots in swing state Wisconsin before the Nov. 5 election. Mitchell granted a temporary injunction on June 25 that allows clerks to email ballots to voters who self-certify that they can’t read or mark a paper ballot without help. The voters can then cast their ballots electronically at home using devices that help them read and write independently. The voters are still required to then print and mail the ballots back to the clerks or return them in person.</span></p>

Laramie County GOP Chairman Taft Love said this is the first time the county’s Republican Party has ever filed an elections code violation complaint against the county clerk, to his knowledge. In a news release, Love, who is a candidate for the open Senate District 6 seat this year, said that the test operated “in direct violation of state statute.” Love notified Laramie County Clerk Debra Lee at the time that the test was not in compliance with state statute. He said Lee was understanding of his concern and said she would call the company, Electronic Systems and Software (ES&amp;S), to print more ballots and rerun the test. On Tuesday, Love received an email from Lee, stating she had not heard back from the company, and it would be another week before she could get back to him. However, time was running out — Tuesday was the last day to run the test before the primary election. “To protect election integrity, we had to go ahead and file the complaint with the DA’s office, secretary of state, the attorney general (and) the county attorney,” Love said.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/primary-solution-conversation-nick-troiano"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Primary Solution: A Conversation with Nick Troiano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In his book, “The Primary Solution,” Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano identifies partisan primaries as one of the main drivers of political polarization and gridlock in the U.S. Because primaries are controlled at the state level, Troiano suggests that reforming the primary process presents a great opportunity to make substantive progress in pursuit of a more democratic and representative form of self-government. Unlike Electoral College reform or national voting rights legislation, ending partisan primaries does not require a constitutional amendment or an act of Congress. In fact, states like Alaska and California have already taken steps to eliminate partisan dominance of the primary process, by instituting reforms like top-two primaries and ranked choice voting. On August 22, 2024, from 2-3 p.m. ET, Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith will host author and Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano for a discussion on his book, “The Primary Solution: Rescuing Our Democracy from the Fringes.” <strong>When:</strong> August 22, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
