							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election 2024</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did election administration ballot measures fair?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this week’s post-Election Day 2024, we’ll take a look at the many elections administration ballot measures that were on the ballot this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in 18 states and the District of Columbia made choices on how elections are administered at the state and local level. With 25 different elections-related measures this was by far the most states and elections-related measures that voters have considered in more than a decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week, when states have had a chance to finish (or almost) their counting and certification processes, we’ll take a state-by-state look at the 2024 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ranked Choice Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked choice voting saw the most action this election cycle at the state and local level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most states considering it– </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_131,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_Proposition_1,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_3,_Top-Five_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_117,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_for_Federal_and_State_Elections_Measure_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – measures that would implement ranked choice failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_7,_Require_Citizenship_to_Vote_and_Prohibit_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters approved a ban on ranked choice voting. The ban on ranked choice was paired with the noncitizen ban in one ballot question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7077" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-300x163.png" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-300x163.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-1024x558.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-768x418.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Changing the status quo is never easy. Entrenched interests – including several state parties and an increasingly well-organized national opposition – pushed back hard on this year’s statewide ballot measures. But make no mistake: The future remains bright for ranked choice voting,” said Meredith Sumpter, president and CEO of</span><a href="https://fairvote.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FairVote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballots are still being counted in </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but currently the measure to repeal the state’s ranked choice voting system is winning. In the latest vote totals, yes votes outnumber no votes by more than 2,800 votes. That’s a margin of 1 percentage point. The Alaska Division of Elections is expected to release at least two more result updates: one on Nov. 15 and another on Nov. 20. The Nov. 12 update included roughly 38,000 new ballots, mostly absentee, early, and questioned ballots, plus votes from one Election Day precinct in rural Alaska that had not previously reported its tally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(November_2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the only “state” to approve ranked choice voting. Initiative 83 was overwhelmingly approved by District voters 72% to 27%. The changes are not automatic, however. Because Initiative 83 has a fiscal impact, the D.C. Council must appropriate funds before it can go into effect. Additionally, as with all D.C. laws, whether approved by the council or the people, I-83 could be hamstrung by interference from home rule opponents in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in </span><a href="https://www.oakpark.com/2024/11/06/oak-park-ranked-choice-voting-approved/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oak Park, Illinois</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved a measure to allow ranked choice to be used in local elections. Now that the referendum has passed, RCV will be used starting in April 2027. It will be used for village trustees and village president, but not the village clerk. According to results from the Cook County Clerk’s Office, of the 32 precincts in Oak Park and 39,728 registered local voters, 20,684 residents voted “Yes” on the binding referendum. Only 5,436 residents voted against it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in </span><a href="https://www.bloomingtonmn.gov/cl/news/bloomington-voters-reaffirm-ranked-choice-voting-municipal-elections-2024-11-06"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomington, Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted to retain the use of ranked choice voting. Unofficial results indicate that 51.29% of residents voted “no,” meaning ranked-choice voting will continue to be used to elect the mayor and city council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Noncitizen Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in eight states– </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_HJR_5,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Iowa_Amendment_1,_Require_Citizenship_to_Vote_in_Elections_and_Allow_17-Year-Olds_to_Vote_in_Primaries_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kentucky_Constitutional_Amendment_1,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_7,_Require_Citizenship_to_Vote_and_Prohibit_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oklahoma_State_Question_834,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oklahoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/South_Carolina_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Wisconsin_Citizenship_Voting_Requirement_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">–overwhelmingly approved measures <img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-8148" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="182" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" />that would ban noncitizens from voting, something that was already illegal at the state and federal level. The measures were approved by at least 62% of the voters in all the states, with some approval percentages being much higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-11/santa-ana-orange-county-california-noncitizen-voting-measure-dd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Ana, California </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted down measure DD which would have allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections. “This is kind of in line with trends we’ve been seeing in both polling and elections of the Latino community getting more conservative on issues of immigration,” Jon Gould, Dean of the School of Social Ecology at UC Irvine told The Los Angeles Times. It may also reflect how naturalized voters view citizenship. “Nationally, there’s this growing sense that citizenship matters. It’s a process that needs to be respected,” Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant with expertise in Latino voting trends told The Times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Absentee Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in Connecticut approved a ballot measure to allow for </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Connecticut_No-Excuse_Absentee_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something that 36 other states and the District of Columbia </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already allow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The measure was approved 57.89% to 42.11%. Passage of the amendment doesn’t automatically mean Connecticut will allow people to vote by mail without needing an excuse, but it gives state lawmakers the ability to enact laws allowing more widespread mail-in voting, Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told The Associated Press. State Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Democrat who co-chairs the General Assembly’s Government Administration and Elections Committee, had </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/absentee-ballots-no-excuse-connecticut-voting-52f8b4e280ae6183a0be80d10803f13c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pitched the amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an opportunity to “free our state from the shackles of a long history of overly restrictive voting laws.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voter ID</strong><br />
</span><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11979" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-2.26.38 PM-300x173.png" alt="" width="300" height="173" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-2.26.38 PM-300x173.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-2.26.38 PM-1024x591.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-2.26.38 PM-768x443.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-2.26.38 PM.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_7,_Require_Voter_Identification_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the only state to put a voter ID measure on the ballot this year. A “yes” cote for Question 7, the Voter Identification Initiative would amend  the constitution to require that Nevada residents present a form of photo identification to verify their identity while voting in person, or to verify their identity using the last four digits of their drivers license or social security number when voting by mail. The measure was overwhelmingly approved 73.23% to 26.77%. Nevada voters will </span><a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/11/05/nevadans-back-photo-id-requirement-for-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to approve Question 7 again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2026 General Election before the photo ID requirement goes into effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Primary/Voting System</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/election/arizona-voters-decide-abortion-immigration-ballot-measures-among-others-2024-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there were two four primary-related ballot measures for voters to contemplate this year.  </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_133,_Require_Partisan_Primaries_and_Prohibit_Primaries_Where_Candidates_Compete_Regardless_of_Party_Affiliation_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 133</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have required partisan primary elections for partisan offices and prohibit primary elections where all candidates, regardless of political party affiliation, run in the same primary election, such as top-two, top-four, and top-five primaries and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_140,_Single_Primary_for_All_Candidates_and_Possible_RCV_General_Election_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 140</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have required primaries in which candidates, regardless of partisan affiliation, appear on a single ballot and a certain number advance to the general election, and require general election candidates to receive a majority of votes. Prop. 133 failed 42% to 57 % and Prop. 140 failed 41% to 58%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.ktvh.com/news/montanas-election-reform-ballot-measures-explained"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two citizens-lead initiatives to reform the state’s voting system failed.  </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Montana_CI-127,_Majority_Vote_Required_to_Win_Elections_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C1-127</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which failed 39% to 60%, would have required that candidates for the following offices must receive a majority of votes (instead of just a plurality) to win the election, as specified by law: governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor, attorney general, superintendent of public instruction, state legislature, and Congress. The results for </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Montana_CI-126,_Top-Four_Primary_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CI-126</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were much closer. The initiative would have created a top-four primary system for elections for governor, lieutenant governor, state executives, state legislators, and congressional offices, in which all candidates would run in one primary and the top-four vote getters would advance to the general election regardless of party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 66% of the voters voting no, </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Constitutional_Amendment_H,_Top-Two_Primary_Elections_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> failed to approve Constitutional Amendment H which would have implemented a top-two primary system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Worker Safety</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Illinois_Penalties_for_Candidate_Interference_with_Election_Worker%27s_Duties_Advisory_Question_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters were faced with a non-binding referendum asking whether candidates should face penalties if they try to interfere with election workers doing their job. The non-binding referendum asks voters: “Should any candidate appearing on the Illinois ballot for federal, State or local office be subject to civil penalties if the candidate interferes or attempts to interfere with an election worker’s official duties?” The referendum does not state what constitutes interference with an election worker’s official duties. It also does not specify specific civil penalties. Since it’s non-binding, Illinois law will not change regardless of how people vote. State lawmakers can, however, use the result as a guide for how to proceed and potentially pass legislation creating new civil penalties for interfering with an election worker doing their job. Illinois law currently makes it a Class 4 felony to tamper or interfere with voting machines. It’s a Class A misdemeanor to refuse to comply with a lawful order from an election authority. That law applies to anyone, not just candidates. The referendum was approved 88.83% to 11.27%.  Although the results </span><a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/election-workers-illinois-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t lead to any specific action one way or another</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dick Simpson, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago says ballot  questions are often included to pressure state or local lawmakers to act on measures that may be “bottled up” or aren’t at the top of the political agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Miscellaneous Measures</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arizona:</strong> </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_134,_Signature_Distribution_Requirement_for_Initiatives_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 134</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: would have created a signature distribution requirement for citizen-initiated ballot measures based on state legislative <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />districts and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_136,_Legal_Challenges_to_Constitutionality_of_Initiatives_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 136</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: would have provided for challenges to an initiative measure or constitutional amendment after the filing of the measure with the secretary of state. Prop. 134 failed 41% to 58% and Prop. 136 failed 38% to 61%. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ann Arbor, Michigan:</strong> Two citizen-initiated proposals aiming to significantly </span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2024/11/ann-arbor-voters-reject-election-reform-proposals-by-over-2-to-1-margin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reform the way Ann Arbor elects its mayor and City Council </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">went before voters last week and lost by a 2 to 1 margin. With all precincts fully counted, Prop C to make city elections nonpartisan had 16,330 yes votes to 42,929 no votes, 72% against it. Prop D, which called for introducing public financing of mayor and council campaigns, had 17,731 yes votes and 41,000 no votes, 70% against it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>St. Paul, Minnesota</strong>: Voters in one of the twins voted to </span><a href="https://www.twincities.com/2024/11/06/st-paul-voters-approve-ballot-measure-moving-elections-to-even-numbered-years-reject-child-care-subsidy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move local election dates to even years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nearly 61% of voters approved a ballot question that will align those municipal elections with presidential and statewide races. St. Paul has historically voted on these local offices in odd-numbered years. As a result, members of the current city council, who were elected last November, won’t face voters again until 2028, giving them a five-year term in office. The winner of next year’s mayoral race on the other hand, will serve only three years before also facing re-election in 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Dakota</strong>: By a 43% to 56% margin, voters in North Dakota voted down </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/North_Dakota_Constitutional_Measure_2,_Single-Subject_Requirement_for_Initiatives_and_Require_Constitutional_Initiatives_to_be_Passed_Twice_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional Measure 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which would have established a single-subject rule for initiatives (both statutory and constitutional), as determined by the secretary of state; increased the signature requirement for constitutional amendment initiatives from 4% of the resident population to 5% of the resident population of the state; and required proposed constitutional initiatives that have qualified for the ballot to be placed on the next primary election ballot, and, if approved, be placed on the next general election ballot, where it must be approved again to become effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> In Ohio, Issue 1, which would have established a </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_Issue_1,_Establish_the_Citizens_Redistricting_Commission_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC), a 15-member non-politician commission responsible for adopting state legislative and congressional redistricting plans failed 49% to 54%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oakridge, Oregon</strong>: Voters in Oakridge voted down a switch to the </span><a href="https://www.klcc.org/politics-government/2024-11-07/oakridge-voters-reject-star-voting-proposal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STAR voting system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In initial returns, 54% of voters opposed the proposal. If the measure had passed, the city would have tested STAR Voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff) for three city elections, becoming the first municipality in the world to do so. Under the system, the public would rate multiple candidates on a scale of zero to five stars, rather than choosing just one. The two highest score-earners would then advance to an automatic run-off, where all ballots would be recounted, and the finalist preferred by more people would win.</span></p>

In Orange County, bomb detection dogs were used to search the entire building, and no explosives were found. “The Orange County Registrar of Voters is committed to ensuring equal access to the election process, protecting the integrity of votes, and maintaining a transparent, accurate and fair election system,” Registrar of Voters Bob Page said in a statement. “We are working diligently to address this incident and keep all staff and members of the public who visit our office safe.” In </span><a href="https://www.foxbaltimore.com/news/local/the-fbi-is-investigating-overseas-bomb-threats-to-local-boards-of-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the counties who received bomb threats include Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Baltimore Co., Calvert, Charles, Dorchester, </span><a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/continuing_coverage/election_coverage/frederick-county-board-of-elections-office-evacuated-after-bomb-threat-on-friday/article_d9c66e94-6c6a-5566-a0b9-3e234ec1e1d2.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frederick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Harford, Montgomery, Queen Anne&#8217;s, Somerset, Washington, Wicomico, and Worcester. The threats came in as many boards were wrapping up counting for the day on November 8 and did not result in any disruptions or delays, Maryland Election Administrator Jared DeMarinis said. “It appears that they (the threats) originated from overseas, and we are working with the FBI and our federal partners on that as well,” he said. “These threats failed in their mission,” said DeMarinis. “We made it safe and secure, and we’re going to continue to make it safe and secure — not only for the voters but also for the election judges, as well.” And in </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/election-offices-minnesota-bomb-threats/601179895"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Steve Simon said that election offices in over half of the counties in the state&#8211;i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ncluding </span><a href="https://www.cnhinews.com/minnesota/article_82387afe-a202-5dfc-b7d1-0d680681ae60.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Earth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.republicaneagle.com/news/goodhue-county-election-staff-receives-bomb-threat/article_7f903894-a1fe-11ef-a0a0-3348f7a6deca.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodhue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counties&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have received bomb threats. The threats were received by email and have been reported to the secretary of state&#8217;s office by county, state and federal partners. &#8220;Threats of violence against election workers, aimed at disrupting our democracy, are absolutely unacceptable,&#8221; Simon said. &#8220;Although Election Day is over, election officials across the state are continuing their work to verify that the election was free, fair, accurate, and secure. Over the next few weeks, counties will be canvassing the election, certifying election results, and conducting post-election reviews.&#8221; Simon says his office is coordinating with local, state and federal law enforcement to ensure those responsible for the threats are held accountable.</span></p>

Authorities believe a male suspect that may have metalworking and welding experience was behind three ballot drop box fires in Portland and Vancouver, Washington including one that damaged hundreds of ballots in Vancouver. They have described him as a white man, aged 30 to 40, who is balding or has very short hair. The FBI specifically asked for help identifying the suspect’s car. Surveillance cameras captured images of a dark-colored, early 2003 to 2004 Volvo S-60 sedan, but at the time of the two most recent ballot box fires on Oct. 28 in Portland and Vancouver, it had a fraudulent temporary Washington license plate on the rear and no front plate, the bureau said. William Brooks, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Portland field office, said multiple local law enforcement agencies were providing resources, such as investigators, analysts and bomb technicians, to help the investigation. “Voters in both Oregon and Washington deserve answers in this case,” Brooks said. “Their votes and their voices matter, and we can’t allow one person’s violent actions to infringe on their rights.”</span></p>

For 2020 election deniers, they claim the  outcome vindicates their debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On the far left, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/09/nx-s1-5184405/election-2024-fraud-claims"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new claims have arisen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 20 million missing voters, which the 2020 deniers are using to bolster their claims as well. &#8220;Most people just don&#8217;t really understand how election administration and the tabulation of election results actually works in this country,&#8221; said Kathy Boockvar, who oversaw elections in 2020 in Pennsylvania as its secretary of the commonwealth. &#8220;And that of course leads, unfortunately, to susceptibility to conspiracy theories and false information.&#8221; Some social media users have stirred things up by claiming that vote counts were manipulated through Starlink. “It is not possible that Starlink was used to hack or change the outcome of the US presidential election,” David Becker, founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-election-starlink-musk-steal-trump-38757341656d4f44243076d6356cb68b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in an to the Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This, quite simply, did not happen, and could not happen, thanks to the security measures we have in place, and these conspiracy theories echo other disinformation we’ve heard over the past several years.”</span></p>

The state removed the passwords on Oct. 24, after an election vendor discovered it. The public first became aware through an announcement by the Colorado GOP.  A spokesman for the Denver District Attorney’s office would not provide Colorado Public Radio more information about the ongoing investigation beyond confirming it is underway. According to CPR it&#8217;s not the only prosecutor’s office with its eye on the data breach. The El Paso County District Attorney’s office said in a press <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-12101" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BostonFlag-300x253.png" alt="" width="254" height="214" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BostonFlag-300x253.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BostonFlag-768x648.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BostonFlag.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px" />release Friday that it started looking into the situation after receiving two affidavits alleging violations of a state law. </span><a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2024-11-06/boston-elections-department-under-state-investigation-for-ballot-shortages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Bill Galvin announced he is launching an investigation into the city of Boston’s election administration. Galvin, said the ballot shortages in Boston caused “unreasonable and unnecessary delays” in a letter directed to Eneida Tavares, the chair of the commission. He said workers at the precincts contacted his office after they were “unable to contact” the commission’s own election line. “This is unacceptable and contravenes the most fundamental principles of our democratic process,” Galvin writes in the letter. “As election officials and individual voters in my own office attempted to reach out to the Boston Election Department and other Boston officials during the day yesterday, they were not answering the phone,” Galvin said at a State House press conference. “They were not responding to their own employees or reaching out to them. They were not responding to us, nor were they responding to individual citizens. This is unacceptable conduct, and it will not be tolerated.” The Boson mayor’s press office provided a statement from Tavares that called any delays in voting “completely unacceptable.” “The City has begun a full audit into the delays from ballot shortages at polling locations during yesterday’s election, and will work closely with the Secretary of State’s office to support the state’s investigation so that the findings can deliver needed improvements to our voting system,” Tavares wrote.</span></p>

Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, has pre-filed a bill that would </span><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2024/11/alabama-lawmaker-moves-to-establish-early-voting-centers-how-would-they-work.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow registered voters to vote prior to election day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This bill would require each county to provide at least one early voting center to be open during the week immediately preceding election day, according to its text. It specifies that the centers cannot allow people to vote less than four days or more than six days during the one-week period immediately preceding election day. On weekdays and Saturdays, the centers would be open from 9am to 5pm and on Sundays, they would be open from 1pm to 5pm If the governing body of a county opts to establish more than one early voting center, the bill says officials will have the sole authority to configure the centers’ boundaries. County officials will also control what days the centers are open, provided they allow people to vote between four and six days prior to election day. “I think we need to see what other states are doing,” said Rep. Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, a former General Fund chairman in the Alabama House, advocating for a study or an analysis of how much early voting costs elsewhere.</span></p>

Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak This spring, a major elections reform bill died on the last day of the legislative session. The same thing happened with another elections reform bill two years ago. “One of the things I’ve heard about is election reform,” said Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and a member of the coalition. “There’s just a recognition that we have a number of things that need to be fixed,” he said, mentioning signature verification on absentee ballots, witness signatures on those ballots, and adding the ability for voters to “cure,” or fix, errors that would otherwise disqualify their votes. “I think making it easier for people to vote — it’s not a Democratic or Republican issue,” he said.</span></p>

The organizers of a referendum say they’ve gathered enough signatures to get the question before voters in a November 2025 referendum. “We’re looking forward to passing this popular initiative next year,” said Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner on the effort. He said supporters have collected more than 165,000 signatures, including over 125,000 on Election Day alone, and will submit them to the Maine Department of the Secretary of State for review and certification. </span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/06/10/maine-republicans-to-collect-signatures-at-polls-for-voter-id-repeal-of-national-popular-vote-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require people to present a photo ID at the polls or when requesting an absentee ballot, unless they have a religious exemption to being photographed. Voters without a photo ID could cast a provisional ballot, which would be counted if they produce a photo ID within four days of the election. It would also require the secretary of state to provide free state nondriver IDs to people who need them. Enacting a statewide voter ID requirement has been proposed repeatedly by Republicans in the Maine Legislature in recent years, but has been blocked by Democrats, who have criticized the costs of such a program and warned that the new requirement would create long lines at the polls and effectively discourage voting.</span></p>

Penelope Tsernoglou, D-East Lansing, introduced four election-related bills: </span><a href="https://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/billanalysis/House/pdf/2023-HLA-6052-0F3A4486.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 6052</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow clerks to use on-demand ballot printing for same-day registration voters in a clerk’s office or in election day voting centers. It would also allow on-demand ballot printing for ballots printed in a language other than English so that clerks could avoid having to pre-print large numbers of non-English ballots. </span><a href="https://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/billanalysis/House/pdf/2023-HLA-6053-08396122.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 6053</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would adjust the deadline for most election-related Michigan lawsuits from 28 days before Election Day to 45 days beforehand. The rationale behind this, Tsernoglou said, is to prevent needless administrative disruptions to the election process when absentee ballots have already been sent out. The bill still allows for lawsuits to be filed during this timeframe, but only when there is a compelling reason and with a higher burden of proof placed on the filer. </span><a href="https://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/billanalysis/House/pdf/2023-HLA-6054-534BA194.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 6054 and 6055</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> propose multiple amendments to election administrative procedures and early voting provisions, including requiring clerks to notify the Michigan Bureau of Elections of early voting site decisions at least 50 days before the site opens for polling. The bills would also outline the procedures for early voting agreements and withdrawals among municipalities and counties, clarify rules for absentee ballot processing, require county clerks to conduct unofficial counts for early unofficial returns, and amend sentencing guidelines provisions in the state’s criminal law procedure, among other changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun owners would be</span><a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-poised-restrict-guns-election-sites-under-democratic-bills"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned from openly carrying their firearms to Michigan election locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under bills headed to the desk of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for likely signature. House Democrats gave final passage to the legislation Wednesday in a series of 56-53 party-line votes, approving changes made by the state Senate in February. Democrats have attempted to ban guns at polling locations since at least 2020, when Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson tried to do so on her own. She was sued by gun rights groups who argued she was violating their Second Amendment rights. Under</span><a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2023-HB-4127"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved this week, a person could not bring a firearm in or within 100 feet of a voting location while polls are open on Election Day, unless they carried their weapon concealed and had a permit to do so.  The same rules would apply to early voting locations, as well as absentee ballot drop boxes, for the 40 days prior to an election. During that 40-day window, a person could not bring their gun into, or within 100 feet of, a city or township clerk’s office or their satellite locations. Violations could result in a $100 fine, up to 90 days in jail, or both. House lawmakers signed off on several provisions the state Senate had added to the bills in February, including allowing gun owners to keep their weapons in their cars or have their weapons on hand if visiting someone living within 100 feet of a drop box or polling location.  Off-duty police officers would also be included in the list of individuals allowed to carry a firearm in the vicinity of election activity. </span></p>

The Legislative Service Commission hasn’t yet analyzed the 149-page bill, but Gavarone said she has distributed it to Ohio’s 88 county election directors. Its provisions include: Citizenship checks during voter registration and change of address; Prohibiting ballot drop boxes; Requiring petition circulators to identify themselves via badge as paid operatives; and Prescribing attestation forms for those dropping off others’ ballots. Gavarone was noncommittal when asked if she expects the legislation to pass during the lame duck session. At year’s end, any legislation not yet signed into law must restart the entire legislative process as new lawmakers take over.</span></p>

His certification marks an early step in a long and cumbersome citizen-led constitutional amendment process. It comes after the Ohio Supreme Court unanimously swatted down his previous rejection of the amendment on the grounds that its title – “Ohio Voters Bill of Rights” – was misleading. The court ruled he had no authority to analyze the title, only the subject matter of the proposed amendment itself. Now the proposal goes to the Ohio Ballot Board – a state body controlled by Republicans – which must determine whether the proposal is limited only to one subject, as required by law. With the board’s approval, the organizers can begin gathering the roughly 413,000 signatures needed to place the matter on a statewide ballot for a simple majority vote. The voter bill of rights would have declared that voting is a “fundamental right” in Ohio, which triggers heightened judicial scrutiny of any laws that might infringe on that right. It also would enshrine voting hours, early voting, automatic voter registration via the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, online voter registration, same-day voter registration, loosened identification requirements to vote, allowances for more drop boxes and early voting locations, a requirement that election mail to come with prepaid postage, and others.</span></p>

The proposal comes in response to a 2023 policy change implemented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that requires people with felony convictions to proactively apply to regain their voting rights upon release from prison and is not automatically restoring rights for any group of offenders — a shift from Virginia’s three previous governors. Bennett-Parker told reporters that her amendment proposes automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals who have been released from incarceration, which she said would foster “a more just and bare” society. The committee backed HJ2 with a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>

The court said Sunday that election officials in eight of the state’s 15 counties reported that all voters with “inconsistent signatures” had been properly notified and given an opportunity to respond. Arizona law calls for people who vote by mail to receive notice of problems such as a ballot signature that doesn’t match one on file and get a “reasonable” chance to correct it in a process known as “curing.” “The Court has no information to establish in fact that any such individuals did not have the benefit of ‘reasonable efforts’ to cure their ballots,” wrote Justice Bill Montgomery, who served as duty judge for the seven-member court. He noted that no responding county requested a time extension. “In short, there is no evidence of disenfranchisement before the Court,” the court order said. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Campaign Legal Center on Saturday named registrars in a petition asking for an emergency court order to extend the original 5 p.m. MST Sunday deadline by up to four days. Maricopa is the state’s most populous county and includes Phoenix. The groups said that as of Friday evening, more than 250,000 mail-in ballots had not yet been verified by signature, with the bulk of those in Maricopa County . They argued that tens of thousands of Arizona voters could be disenfranchised.</span></p>

Evanston voters initially approved the referendum in the 2022 midterm election, becoming the first city in Illinois to adopt RCV. Nonprofit Reform for Illinois with retired attorney David Melton initially filed the action against the County Clerk Cedric Giles in July. According to the motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs alleged that Evanston’s home rule municipality authority authorized the implementation of ranked choice voting. City spokesperson Cynthia Vargas told The Daily that the city is reviewing the court’s ruling and is eyeing potential legal action to defend the city’s home rule authority. </span></p>

The appeals court determined that the key legal issue in the case was “the level of scrutiny that should be employed” when examining freedom of speech and the Kansas statute. The district court had previously agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that “strict scrutiny” should apply, meaning that the state would need to show that the “least restrictive means” were applied to further their interests. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that the statute is a content-based regulation, but the court found it should be subject to intermediate scrutiny since it is neutral in purpose or justification. This lower level of scrutiny only requires the government to show that its means were “substantially related” to their interests. The appeals court ultimately rejected the plaintiffs’ freedom of association claim but remitted the freedom of speech claim back to the district court, despite the defendants’ argument that free speech was not engaged. The court found the prefilled applications to be speech under the First Amendment in part because of the fact they have words on a page written by VPC, which indicates a strong presumption that free speech is engaged.</span></p>

The Michigan Secretary of State&#8217;s Office and the Washtenaw County Prosecutor&#8217;s Office announced on Oct. 30 that a student who wasn&#8217;t a U.S. citizen had cast a ballot at an early voting site in Ann Arbor. The announcement came six days before Election Day and drew the attention of national political figures, as there was no way for local election officials to prevent Gao&#8217;s ballot from being counted after it was entered into a tabulator. Michigan authorities didn&#8217;t identify Gao as the individual who allegedly cast the ballot until he was arraigned in the 15th District Court in Ann Arbor. Gao is facing felony charges of perjury — making a false statement on an affidavit for the purpose of securing voter registration — and of being an unauthorized elector who attempted to vote. The standard penalty for perjury in Michigan, the most serious of the two allegations, is up to 15 years in prison.</span></p>

The request follows an Oct. 25 ruling from a trio of Trump-appointed 5th Circuit judges who unanimously endorsed the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) argument that Mississippi’s five-day post-election ballot receipt deadline effectively “extended” Election Day in violation of federal law.  A lower federal court had previously rejected the RNC’s legal bid, concluding that the state’s deadline — which was enacted in 2020 with bipartisan support — comports with federal election law and the U.S. Constitution. Although the 5th Circuit panel’s October ruling struck down the mail-in ballot receipt statute, it did not immediately require Mississippi to stop counting late received mail-in ballots for the 2024 election. Instead, the appellate judges sent the case back down to the district court for further proceedings, which have not yet commenced.  In a petition filed Friday, two advocacy groups — Vet Voice Foundation and the Mississippi Alliance for Retired Americans — argued that the entire bench of active 5th Circuit judges should rehear the case and ultimately affirm the district court’s rejection of the RNC’s lawsuit.  The groups underscored the importance of post-election ballot receipt deadlines in protecting overseas and military voters from disenfranchisement, while also noting that the practice of counting late-arriving ballots postmarked on or before Election Day is commonplace across the country.</span></p>

Last year, Chattah, representing four plaintiffs, sued Governor Joe Lombardo (R) and Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar (D) challenging the legality of Senate Bill 406 known as the Election Worker Protection Bill. In October 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Cristina D. Silva dismissed Chattah’s  lawsuit based on standing, but provided the plaintiff’s opportunity to amend the complaint. The plaintiffs maintain that an “election official”, cited in Chapter 293 of the law, is broad, undefined and relies on “absurd” subjective complaints of threats and intimidation which would result in a Class E felony of the accused. Furthermore, they allege that the law may conflict with the current Nevada law that provides the general public, poll watchers, and volunteers to observe polling places and ballot locations, such as tabulation areas and warehouses. The ACLJ agrees and contends that key terms in the bill are undefined and “impose vague and overbroad criminal penalties that threaten to undermine the ability of Nevadans to freely participate in the electoral process as poll workers, poll watchers, and engaged citizens.” In her temporary ruling, Silva cited that the plaintiffs do not have standing as they failed to allege a threat of “imminent, credible harm” and have failed to demonstrate “that there exists a credible threat of prosecution.” “A plaintiff’s subjective and irrational fear of prosecution is not enough to confer standing,” Silva wrote. The ACLJ disagrees and argues that the plaintiffs have standing, arguing that “when First Amendment rights are threatened, these individuals have standing to protect their constitutional rights.”</span></p>

The state law, in a similar fashion, mandates that local governments or school districts with a record of discrimination in New York must gain approval from state officials in order to pass certain voting policies. The court, in their decision, said the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits a state from depriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Since federal statute is supreme to any state law, the court ruled to strike down the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act in its entirety. &#8220;When New York enacted the strongest voting rights law in the country, we knew there would be challenges. I disagree with the court&#8217;s legal reasoning and expect this decision will be overturned on appeal,” state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, chair of the state Senate Committee on Elections who authored the legislation, said in a statement.</span></p>

Seals Jr. ruled this week that the town of Atlantic Beach will hold a </span><a href="https://www.wbtw.com/news/grand-strand/atlantic-beach/judges-order-upholds-atlantic-beach-election-commissions-decision-to-hold-new-mayoral-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special election to elect a new mayor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and resolve a yearlong dispute over whether John David or Josephine Isom will be the town’s next leader. Seals issued the ruling on Tuesday affirming the Municipal Election Commission’s decision in April to invalidate the results of the November 2023 election. “In sum, the Court having determined that sufficient factual evidence exists justifying the MEC’s Decision to invalidate the mayoral election and finding no error of law that would justify disturbance of the MEC’s ruling, the Decision of the Atlantic Beach Municipal Election Commission is AFFIRMED,” Seals wrote in his ruling. Recently appointed interim Town Manager William Booker told News13 that no date has been set for a new election. He said town leaders are talking with the South Carolina Election Commission to work out the details. </span></p>

On Nov. 4 in Cameron County’s 197th state District Court, visiting Judge Michael Garcia handed down the ruling voiding the election following two weeks of early voting, citing a violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act. “The city disagrees with the judge’s decision to void the election and plans on taking any and all action necessary to fully protect the rights of its citizens to vote and the legitimate outcome of the votes cast by the citizens of San Benito,” city officials said in a news release. On Wednesday, City Commissioner Tom Goodman claimed Garcia’s action meddled with the Democratic process. “The citizens’ right to vote should not be determined by a judge,” he said in an interview. “That would interfere with the Democratic process. The people have voted. Why not accept their answer?”</span></p>

The court’s decision, issued on Nov. 8 and leading to the dismissal on Nov. 12, underscores the limitations of authority for government officials acting independently within their roles. Fawkes initiated the lawsuit after disqualifying Smith’s candidacy in June, citing failure to meet residency requirements due to dual voter registration in New York and the Virgin Islands. However, the Board of Elections overruled this disqualification on Sept. 4, following a legal opinion from Attorney General Gordon Rhea, who asserted that eligibility criteria for delegate to Congress fall under federal jurisdiction rather than local law. The court found that Fawkes, as a government employee, lacked the authority to sue independently without explicit statutory authorization or the enforcement backing of the attorney general. Ross Edwards stated, “a lawsuit by the Supervisor of Elections against the Board, both in their official capacities, is a suit by the Government against the Government.” Additionally, the court determined that Fawkes could not proceed as a taxpayer plaintiff, as she failed to demonstrate an injury to a substantial right. The ruling also emphasized that she had no statutory authority to retain private counsel for this matter.</span></p>

Jeff Disibbio became the Democratic state senate nominee for West Virginia’s 6th District in August after the primary winner, Randy Fowler, did not file required campaign finance reports and was disqualified. According to the lawsuit, during West Virginia’s early voting period Oct. 23-28, Fowler was still listed as the candidate on the ballot in Mingo County — leading to 678 voters casting incorrect ballots.  The error was discovered Oct. 28 by the ballot printing vendor and the county issued corrected ballots for the rest of the early voting period and Election Day. The lawsuit alleges that Mingo County Clerk Larry Croaff never told voters who might have been impacted by the error, but told local press that voters could vote again with a provisional ballot. West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner (R) later clarified that this solution wouldn’t work, since in-person voting is anonymous in the state and therefore there’s no way to identify affected ballots and replace them with new, corrected ballots. Because of the error, the plaintiff alleges that Croaff’s mistake is part of a pattern of disenfranchising Democratic voters in Mingo County. The lawsuit asks the court to order Mingo County to hold a special election for constituents to cast their vote for the sixth state Senate district.</span></p>
