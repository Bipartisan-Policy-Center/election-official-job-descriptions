														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Federal Work Study funds eligible for variety of elections-related activities</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coalition of organizations create toolkit to help</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Work Study funding for community service has always been permitted for use with community groups and local governmental agencies, but until recently there wasn’t much guidance as to whether this was also true for voter engagement work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-11053" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/USDeptofEd.png" alt="" width="380" height="84" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/USDeptofEd.png 886w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/USDeptofEd-300x66.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/USDeptofEd-768x170.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" />Two years ago, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) issued a </span><a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/dear-colleague-letters/2022-04-21/requirements-distribution-voter-registration-forms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dear Colleague” letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reminding institutions of higher education of their obligation under the Higher Education Act to “make a good faith effort” to distribute voter registration forms to their students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also stated that “If a student is employed directly by a postsecondary institution, the institution may compensate a student for Federal Work-Study employment involving voter registration activities that take place on or off-campus.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an additional </span><a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/dear-colleague-letters/2024-02-26/use-federal-work-study-funds-voter-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dear Colleague” letter issued in February of 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Department clarified that higher education institutions can partner with local or state elections offices to place FWS student workers in positions that support nonpartisan and non-political activities such as broad-based get-out-the-vote activities, voter registration, providing voter assistance at a polling place or through a voter hotline, or serving as a poll worker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter said, in part: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; [The] Department is today clarifying that FWS funds may be used for employment by a Federal, State, local, or Tribal public agency for civic engagement work that is not associated with a particular interest or group, consistent with 34 CFR § 675.22(b)(5). This work can include supporting broad-based get-out-the-vote activities, voter registration, providing voter assistance at a polling place or through a voter hotline, or serving as a poll worker. We believe this reading is supported by the language of 34 CFR § 675.22(b)(5) and adheres to the meaning of the regulation when read as a whole, namely promoting student employment in the public interest while ensuring that such work is neither associated with any faction in election for public or party office, nor constitutes political activity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-11056" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SLSV2.png" alt="" width="219" height="208" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SLSV2.png 422w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SLSV2-300x284.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" />“This is an extremely important clarification, because we strongly encourage partnerships between higher education institutions and local election offices for many reasons,” said Zoe Williamson, associate digital communications director with the </span><a href="https://slsvcoalition.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students Learn Students Vote Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Local election offices are often understaffed and have a vital – and nonpartisan – job every election cycle. We also know that less than 5% of election workers are ages 18-25, and young people can add creativity and capacity to these offices while gaining work experience that offers students a unique opportunity to build their leadership skills, learn more about the community, and further their research and academic goals. At the same time student election workers can help forge stronger working relationships between nonpartisan on-campus voter engagement efforts and local election offices.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Coalition Creates Toolkit</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of student voting organizations – SLSV Coalition, </span><a href="https://www.campusvoteproject.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Vote Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://allinchallenge.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All IN Campus Democracy Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – worked together to </span><a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/MV-eyYLU206OT5ayoZqn3w2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a toolkit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  to pull together a resource that could help guide campus personnel through the entire FWS process in order to take advantage of the federal guidance in time for the 2024 elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-11054" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AllIN-300x277.png" alt="" width="136" height="126" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AllIN-300x277.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AllIN.png 332w" sizes="(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px" />According SLSV’s Williamson, the resource covers a lot of ground, to ensure campuses have everything they need to successfully establish a voter registration FWS position or integrate voter registration into existing FWS positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We pulled together information on the FWS program itself, what the typical FWS process looks like, how institutions can classify voter registration work as <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-11055" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CampusVote-300x263.png" alt="" width="200" height="175" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CampusVote-300x263.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CampusVote.png 384w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />part of their community service requirement which in turn allows it to be 100% federally funded, what obstacles institutions may encounter while establishing the positions and how to address them, guidance on how to use the funding successfully once it’s approved and procured, and examples of institutions doing so successfully in the past,” Williamson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted that it was a lot of work in a relatively short period of time, but it was necessary to expedite since the coalition recommends institutions begin this process no later than May in order to have positions established when students return to campus in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By utilizing FWS funding to support local election offices, higher education institutions can strengthen our democracy, add support to a workforce that needs it, and start building a generation of election workers who can ensure continued trust in our nation’s elections,” Williamson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Opposition to Department’s Clarification</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone agrees that the funds can be used for the activities as defined by the Dept. of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican attorneys general from 14 states </span><a href="https://ago.wv.gov/Documents/Correspondence%20re%20Work%20Study%20Guidance.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed onto a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> penned by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita disagreeing with the DOE’s assertion the funds can be used. Their letter asserts that the federal funds may not be used for partisan activities claiming that voter outreach, registration and even poll workers are inherently partisan activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your ‘Dear Colleague’ letter … says that colleges and universities may use Federal tax dollars to subsidize “broad-based get-out-the-vote activities, voter registration, …voter assistance …, or servi[ce] as a poll worker.” These activities are political—at least in the non-partisan sense—and are often the most valuable political activities in which a party or candidate can engage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter from the attorneys general compares the use of federal work study funds to  private funding offered to elections officials in 2020 and the impact they believe it had on the election results. Since 2020, 28 states have enacted legislation limiting or regulating the u</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/prohibiting-private-funding-of-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">se of private funds for elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In other words, laudable activities like encouraging voter turnout and registering voters have to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">happen somewhere, and that somewhere decides elections. Your guidance effectively licenses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">colleges and universities to subsidize this activity—and potentially swing elections by choosing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where to direct these funds—with taxpayer money. That approach violates limitations imposed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by law,” the letter states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Levitt, Professor of Law, Gerald T. McLaughlin Fellow at </span><a href="https://www.lls.edu/faculty/justinlevitt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loyola Law School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said he does not understand the objection presented by the AGs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students who are working for public agencies and helping with voter registration or helping at polling places – already working in nonpartisan fashion, because they’re working for public agencies – can get paid by the agencies they’re working for.  This notice just clarifies that Federal work-study funds can be used to help,” Levitt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levitt said he agrees with the Dept. of Education on their legal analysis and that it seems to him that the best way to square the statutory instruction that the funds can be used in ways that “increase civic participation” with the regulatory instruction that it can’t involve any “partisan or nonpartisan political activity” is to understand that the prohibited “nonpartisan political activity” is activity on behalf of a particular nonpartisan candidate (like a local municipal candidate) or ballot measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Dept. of Education regulations aren’t under the Hatch Act, he said that’s very consistent with the Hatch Act, which defines “partisan political activity” as activity directed toward the success or failure of a party, candidate for partisan office, or partisan political group, and a nonpartisan election as an election for nonpartisan candidates or a ballot issue.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Put those together, and nonpartisan political activity would be activity directed toward the success or failure of a candidate for nonpartisan office or a nonpartisan ballot issue,” Levitt said. “ED very clearly fenced out that activity.  In contrast, nonpartisan voter registration and the like seems like exactly the sort of activity designed to increase civic participation that Congress said is just fine for work-study.”</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CISA, FBI, and ODNI release guidance for securing election infrastructure </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product discusses popular tactics used in foreign malign influence operations, provides recent examples, and recommends potential mitigations for election infrastructure stakeholders. While many of these tactics are not new, recent advances in generative artificial <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png" alt="" width="207" height="197" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px" />intelligence (AI) technology have made it much easier and cheaper to generate and spread convincing foreign malign influence content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The elections process is the golden thread of American democracy, which is why our foreign adversaries deliberately target our elections infrastructure with their influence operations. Defending our democratic process is the responsibility of all of us,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley.  “CISA is committed to doing its part to ensure these officials – and the American public – don’t have to fight this battle alone.  We will continue to work with the election community to ensure they have the tools and information they need to run safe and secure elections in 2024 and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The FBI and its partners work diligently every day to disrupt foreign malign influence operations targeting our democratic institutions,” said Acting Assistant Director Joseph Rothrock of the FBI&#8217;s Counterintelligence Division. “We are putting out this guide because our strategy in <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5994" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ODNI-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />combatting this threat starts with awareness and collaboration. We will continue to relentlessly pursue bad actors looking to disrupt our election infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Foreign actors continue to pursue efforts aimed at sowing discord among the American people, with the ultimate goal of eroding confidence in our democratic institutions,” said ODNI Foreign Malign Influence Center Director Jessica Brandt. “The normalization of influence activities, combined with the rise of new technologies, increasingly presents a whole-of-society challenge for the Intelligence Community to address alongside the broader U.S. Government, industry, and civil society.”</span></p>

The updates are streamed daily on Facebook and PACast. “The Pennsylvania Department of State is committed to transparency in our electoral process, and these daily updates are part of that effort,” Schmidt said. “The more Pennsylvanians understand about all the work that goes into safeguarding our elections, the more confident they can feel in the process.” One focus of the updates has been voting by mail. With nearly 900,000 Pennsylvanians requesting a mail ballot and with ever-changing rules and procedures, Schmidt used one of his daily check-ins to show</span><a href="https://www.tribdem.com/news/pa-election-chief-gives-lesson-in-properly-casting-mail-ballots/article_8e93de00-b344-5f3f-805a-1e9ff80332d3.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how to properly fill out a mail ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help voters avoid mistakes that may cause their ballot to be rejected.

He says that speaking to this group is important. “Its important to have all voters but if you look at the voters registration participation numbers the worse voters turnout is ages 18 to 29. So we really want to help these students learn how to flex their civic muscle. Get them registered to vote. Help them to understand what it takes to register to vote,” said Hargett. The Dudley Award is in honor of Anne Dallas Dudley who was a woman’s suffrage and voting activist. To receive the Dudley award, schools must meet a certain registered voter threshold. For a gold award, 100% of students age 18 or older must be registered to vote.

The award goes to any school district registering a high number of eligible students to vote ahead of the June primaries in Iowa. Pate tells KMA News that Fremont-Mills was one of the schools that well surpassed the required percentage. “There’s hundreds of school districts across the state and when you look at this, we’re recognizing roughly 40 high schools in the entire state that have achieved this,” said Pate. “What they’ve done is they’ve registered over 90% of the eligible students to vote and this is the first step of course getting them registered and then they’ll hopefully be stepping up in the June primaries and in the fall elections.” This year, Pate says Fremont-Mills registered 100% of eligible senior students, with this being the second time they have received the award. Pate adds that getting eligible high school seniors registered to vote can also impact their family members and peers.</span></p>

Sedgwick County Election Commissioner Laura Rainwater said more than 300,000 stickers will be printed and available for the primary election on Aug. 6 and the general election on Nov. 5. Salazar was among 127 students from 12 different schools in the county who entered the contest. The county said it hopes to hold the contest annually.</span></p>

During our story searches we always see incredible headlines about the elections in India. Given the size of the electorate, there isn’t a single date when everyone will vote. Instead, polling will unfold over seven phases around the country, beginning on April 19 and ending on June 1. All the votes from the country’s 28 states and eight union territories will be counted and results released on June 4. From the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote forests of India’s central states, votes are cast electronically across more than 1 million polling stations. Some 15 million election workers will be deployed, traveling via road, boat, camel, train and helicopter to reach every Indian voter. At 15,256 feet (4,650 meters), Tashigang, a village in the far northern state of Himachal Pradesh on the border with China, was the world’s highest polling station when its residents voted in 2022 state government elections.</span></p>

Other key findings include: Turnout of voters with disabilities has increased since HAVA was adopted and Accessibility of polling places has improved significantly over the last 20 years.  The researchers used qualitative data from six focus groups of 44 voters with disabilities to examine their perspectives on their voting experiences, and how their experiences have changed over time. The report also presents quantitative data from national surveys on voter turnout and accessibility to provide context for exploring the focus group discussions. “Ensuring accessibility for voters with disabilities and protecting the right to casting a private and independent ballot has been a priority for the agency since it was established,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “As this report demonstrates, in the 22 years since the passage of HAVA, significant progress has been made to improve accessibility for voters with disabilities. The EAC will continue to support state and local election officials as they  work to improve accessibility of the voting process in the 2024 elections and beyond.”  </span></p>

Katie Hobbs (D) has </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/katie-hobbs-vetoed-a-trio-of-republican-election-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed several election bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On April 10, Hobbs vetoed bills passed by the GOP-controlled legislature that would ban those convicted of ballot abuse from holding elected office and prevent county recorders from providing voter registration cards to most of those whose mailing addresses are outside of the state.  She also vetoed a bill that would have required political parties that opt to conduct their own presidential primary election instead of participating in the publicly administered one to provide accommodations to allow disabled voters and overseas military personnel to participate. Hobbs also described the bill to limit mailing of voter registration cards, House Bill 2404, as unnecessary, writing in her veto letter that state law and the Elections Procedure Manual, which carries the force of law, “already outline the process when a voter provides a new residential address that is located outside the state.”</span></p>

Much of that would tie into a policy provision that would let cities, counties and school districts use ranked choice voting for local offices within the political subdivision. With a supplemental spending target of $500,000 in fiscal year 2025,</span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/bills/billnum.asp?Billnumber=HF4411&amp;ls_year=93&amp;session_year=2023&amp;session_number=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HF4411</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/comm/docs/4G2g8O8N6U2_Zf0ugSNyGg.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would provide $209,000 for ranked choice voting purposes. Approved by the House Elections Finance and Policy Committee on a split-voice vote, the bill’s next stop is the House Ways and Means Committee. The secretary of state’s office would also receive an additional $127,000 for the voting operations, technology, and election resources account that assists local governments with certain election-related expenses. Other financial provisions would transfer $144,000 from the General Fund to the Voting Rights Act cost sharing account in the special revenue fund — money that could be used by local governments if the “</span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/SessionDaily/Story/18132"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” becomes law — and $20,000 from the General Fund would go to the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board to standardize local election reporting requirements created in the bill. The latter comes from</span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/bills/billnum.asp?Billnumber=HF3645&amp;ls_year=93&amp;session_year=2023&amp;session_number=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HF3645</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep.

The bill, introduced for years by Omaha state Sen. Justin Wayne, passed by a wide margin in the last year of Wayne&#8217;s second term. He is barred by term limits from running this year for a third term. Currently, a person who has been convicted of a felony must wait two years after completing all the terms of their conviction before regaining voting rights. Wayne&#8217;s measure eliminates that waiting period, established in 2005 by the Legislature. Prior to the waiting period, a person convicted of a felony lost their right to vote indefinitely. The passage of the bill “means everything for the thousands of people who have not been full participants in society,&#8221; said TJ King, a Lincoln, Nebraska-based outreach specialist with the Nebraska AIDS Project who was unable to vote in the 2022 general election after coming off probation for drug and theft convictions three months earlier. King said the bill&#8217;s passage is the final layer in his ability to be civically engaged and “have a full voice and complete connection to the community.&#8221; Republican Gov. Jim Pillen&#8217;s office did not immediately respond to messages by The Associated Press asking whether he would sign the bill into law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jersey City, New Jersey</strong>: With a 7-0 vote the city council approved a measure to implement </span><a href="https://jcitytimes.com/city-council-gives-a-thumbs-up-to-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before the new law can take effect, however, the state legislature will have to pass bills known as S1622/A4042 to authorize municipalities’ use of RVC (ranked choice voting). And then, the city would have to ask voters in a binding referendum “to be held at the first general election in November following the enactment of state legislation,” whether they wanted to amend the city’s charter to accommodate the proposed method for helping decide elections. As described by the newly-passed city ordinance, RCV “is a simple upgrade to the way Jersey City voters currently vote.  RCV enables voters to rank candidates in the order of preference and ensures that winners of any election have the support of – and are accountable to – a majority of voters.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3852" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ohio</strong>: State Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, has introduced a bill that would make it </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/04/17/ohio-house-bill-would-streamline-voter-registration-for-in-state-movers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easier to transfer registrations between counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by encouraging voters to list their previous address when they register. In a committee hearing to introduce his bill, Click described it as “a common sense piece of legislation designed to streamline the integrity of Ohio’s voter rolls through a citizen-initiated process.” Right now, if an Ohio resident moves to another county and updates their voter registration, they’re supposed to fill out a separate form to cancel their previous registration. The thing is that almost never happens. By extending the voter registration form to include past addresses, Click’s measure allows voters to kill two birds with one stone and get the ball rolling immediately on updating voter files. “Although the voter registration rolls are periodically reviewed for the purpose of flagging duplicate, inactive or deceased voters,” Click said, “HB 457 will streamline the process, saving time and money while improving accuracy.” In his testimony, Click noted he got input on the legislation from the Ohio Secretary of State’s office and the Ohio Association of Election Officials. In a statement, Nazek Hapasha from the League of Women Voters of Ohio noted “although we have not yet been in discussion with elections officials about HB 457, the proposed legislation appears to offer a common sense update to our voter registration system that helps local boards of elections streamline voter registration processes, and saves time and money.”</span></p>

At the hearing, Sen. Alana DiMario (D-North Kingstown,​ Narragansett, New Shoreham), who sponsored the bill, said that the amendment “would allow the voters of Rhode Island to decide if it is time to remove the outdated — and longest in the country — 30-day in advance voter registration deadline from the state constitution.” Opponents of the bill testified citing concerns related to residency requirements, credibility and voter apathy. Secretary of State Gregg Amore (D) said at the hearing that same-day voter registration would improve voting accessibility and civic engagement. He also noted that people who become naturalized citizens late in the year might miss the registration deadline, which could exclude a large population from exercising their newly attained rights.  Amore also noted that same-day voter registration has already been implemented for presidential elections. “An average of 6000 voters in the last two presidential elections cast a same day vote when they registered … and the process worked,” he said.</span></p>

Glen Youngkin (R) </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked bills </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">meant to continue the adoption of ranked choice voting, expand legal protections for voting rights and modify data practices to avoid canceling the registrations of eligible voters. The governor also vetoed a measure that would have expanded the state’s existing ban on guns at polling places and nixed a bill that would have added photo identification cards issued by nursing homes and other state-licensed medical facilities to Virginia’s list of acceptable IDs for voting. Youngkin vetoed a relatively minor</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB26"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill that would</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have required election officials to accept identification cards issued by state-licensed private medical facilities such as nursing homes. “Expanding this list presents additional complexities for poll workers in discerning which forms of identification are acceptable,” Youngkin’s veto said. Youngkin also vetoed Democratic bills that would have restored Virginia’s participation in ERIC, a multi-state voter data sharing program that has been abandoned by many red states after coming under fire from conservative activists. In his veto statement on the ERIC bill, Youngkin said there were valid concerns about how the organization was being run. “I have been explicitly clear about my affirmation of the legitimacy of our elections,” the governor’s veto said. “My focus is safeguarding Virginians’ private information and continuously improving an efficient, cost-effective voter registration system.”</span></p>

According to The Washington Post, the terms of the settlement, including any compensation involved, were not announced. “Smartmatic has resolved its litigation against OANN through a confidential settlement,” Smartmatic’s lead attorney, J. Erik Connolly, said in a written statement. Charles L. Babcock, an attorney representing OANN, confirmed the case was settled but provided no further details. The case against OANN, filed in November 2021, was part of a slew of lawsuits aimed at right-leaning television networks that aired unproven or disproven allegations of voting fraud by attorneys associated with Donald Trump. Smartmatic, headquartered in Florida, also sued Fox News Channel — for $2.7 billion — and Newsmax; both of those cases are ongoing, according to court dockets. The voting company’s suit noted that its involvement in the 2020 election was extremely limited, with its technology only being used in Los Angeles County. Pro-Trump advisers and media figures had suggested Smartmatic meddled in the election nationwide. “OANN knew its assertions about Smartmatic were not true,” the lawsuit said. “OANN had seen no evidence to support the assertions. But OANN chose to spread disinformation.” OANN, owned by Herring Networks, had denied that Smartmatic’s allegations had any merit, and countered that its on-air personalities were merely covering a newsworthy election.</span></p>

Eric Coomer was Dominion’s director of product strategy and security. He sued for defamation after he found himself at the center of right-wing conspiracies, alleging that he personally rigged the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden. He was forced into hiding after receiving death threats. On Dec. 22, 2020, Coomer sued the Trump campaign, several campaign surrogates, and pro-Trump media outlets. On April 10 the court ruled Coomer’s case could move forward because he established a reasonable likelihood of success on his claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Trump supporters tried to dismiss the case under Colorado’s anti-SLAPP statute (strategic lawsuit against public participation). “Under that statute, we do not decide whether Coomer will prevail on his claims. Nor do we determine who is telling the truth about what occurred. Instead, the sole question we must answer is whether Coomer has done enough to pursue his claims further,” wrote Judge Karl Schock in his 117-page opinion. The court concluded that Coomer presented sufficient evidence to show those statements “were false and that defendants made them with actual malice.”</span></p>

Ross granted a directed verdict in court, finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the voting rights of naturalized citizens are violated when they have to show papers or get a new state ID before they can vote. The quick ruling brings an abrupt end to a lawsuit that has been pending since 2018 over state laws that prevent new citizens from casting ballots until they show that they’re eligible. Attorneys for Georgia said in court this week that citizenship checks are needed to prevent the possibility of illegal voting. During this week’s trial, witnesses included three voters who said they had to jump through hoops before they were allowed to vote. But the defense showed that all of those voters were eventually able to vote after they overcame hurdles to registering with county election officials who didn’t properly process citizenship paperwork. Ross, an appointee of President Barack Obama, found that Georgia’s elections are open to all citizens and that the state has an interest in ensuring that only citizens are allowed to vote.</span></p>

Giuliani later asked Howell to override the verdict and order a new trial.</span></p>

It also added methods for a person to prove their identity including an Idaho’s driver’s license or identification card — which previously only the number was required —  a passport or other federal identification card, a tribal identification card or a state license to carry a concealed weapon. Lastly, House Bill 340 set provisions for the state to provide no-fee identification cards that can be used to register to vote for adults who have not possessed a driver’s license within the last six months. According to court documents, the Idaho Supreme Court upheld the district court’s decision because the Idaho Constitution permits the Legislature to enact additional “qualifications, limitations and conditions” on the right of suffrage. The court found that the laws do not discriminate against a specific group of people, and they are related to the government’s interest in preserving election integrity. The Secretary of State’s office in a press release Thursday afternoon said it is pleased with the court’s decision.  “Voters can have confidence in Idaho’s elections as they head to the polls,” Secretary Phil McGrane said in the press release. “Our office looks forward to collaborating with the League of Women Voters and Babe Vote to encourage more Idahoans to register and actively participate in the upcoming May 21 primary and Nov. 5 general elections.”</span></p>

The original main defendant in the case is William Porter, a Guilford County Republican official who — along with others — used flawed data to target voters with official election protests on behalf of former Republican Governor Pat McCrory. Those protests claimed the voters had committed fraud, sowing doubt about the results of an election which McCrory lost. In the end, hundreds of voters were targeted. The plaintiffs claim that Porter and others defamed them, interfered with their right to vote and subjected them to national media attention and public embarrassment. The defendants argue their participation in the fraud-reporting process grants them absolute privilege and immunity from libel charges. Craig Schauer, lawyer for the defendants, argued that because the defendants were participating in official judicial proceedings in the form of election protests, they&#8217;re shielded by governmental privilege and can&#8217;t be held liable.The state appeals court only partially agreed with these arguments in 2021.</span></p>

Enacted in 2018, the Washington Voting Rights Act (WVRA) is a state law modeled after certain aspects of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 that was established to ensure minority groups have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and protects them from discrimination in voting. In June 2023, the Washington Supreme Court unanimously upheld the WVRA, rejecting an appeal from a Franklin County GOP precinct commissioner, James Gimenez, who argued that the law violates the Washington State and U.S. Constitutions by making race the “predominant factor” in redistricting. In November 2023, Gimenez appealed the Washington Supreme Court’s decision upholding the WVRA to the U.S. Supreme Court. In his petition to the nation’s highest court, Gimenez urged the justices to consider whether the WVRA violates the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, arguing that the law unconstitutionally requires “local governments to change their election systems based on race alone.”  With the U.S. Supreme Court declining to take up Gimenez’s appeal today, the WVRA will remain in effect.</span></p>

The lawsuit argues that every voter in Wisconsin has the right to a secret ballot, however a law against voting electronically denies some voters with disabilities that right because they need an assistant to help read and fill out a traditional paper ballot. The suit was brought by Disability Rights Wisconsin and the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin as well as four voters with disabilities — two who are blind, one who has cerebral palsy and one with spinal muscular atrophy. On several occasions, the WEC has acknowledged that blind and low vision voters have no way of casting an absentee ballot independently under the current system. The lawsuit states because of the failure to correct this, Wisconsin’s voting statutes force voters with disabilities to “relinquish” their constitutional right to a secret ballot in order to exercise their right to vote. “Because these voters can vote absentee only by using a paper ballot, they must select an assistant to read and mark their ballot for them,” the lawsuit, filed in Dane County Circuit Court, states. “Doing so forces voters with disabilities to surrender their independence and privacy, share their vote, and trust that their ballot was marked accurately — a surrender of the constitutional right to a secret ballot not demanded of voters without disabilities.”</span></p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/events/the-misinformation-and-disinformation-idea-thon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Misinformation and Disinformation Idea-thon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Help Solve a Major Societal Problem—Bring Your Ideas to Fight Misinformation and Disinformation Misinformation and disinformation pose a significant threat to democracy. They are spread by authoritarian state actors and malign non-state actors bent on undermining and damaging free and liberty-loving republics. Unfortunately, most solutions come internally from social media platforms or rest with governments to devise. A new grassroots strategy is needed: bottom-up rather than top-down. That is why R Street Institute and George Mason University are holding an Idea-thon to address the problem and find new solutions. Teams will form to attack misinformation and disinformation from four tracks: government, business/technology, nonprofit, and education. Winning teams will receive prizes. Examples of work products include new legislation and regulations, a business plan for a tech start-up, a mobile app, an academic course, or a new nonprofit. Be creative! Software developers are needed, but no computer science skills are necessary to participate. Just bring your best ideas for combating misinformation and disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> April 20. <strong>Where:</strong> Fairfax, Virginia</span></p>
<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/6117127635248/WN_Oj-zRuYRQUadOT1qjc7hzg#/registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administering Elections in 2024: Lessons from Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) and the Committee of Seventy are co-hosting a webinar on the progress being made in Pennsylvania&#8217;s election administration and the Committee of Seventy&#8217;s priorities for future reforms. Pennsylvania is in many ways a bellwether for the country as a whole, so the discussion will include issues facing election administrators across the nation. CEIR is a nonpartisan nonprofit that works with election officials at the state and local level from around the country and from both sides of the aisle. The Committee of Seventy is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that has promoted, supported and facilitated government ethics and election integrity for more than a century. Speakers David Becker, Executive Director of CEIR, and Lauren Cristella, President and CEO of the Committee of Seventy, will also answer questions from the audience. <strong>When:</strong> April 23, 12pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/elections-in-the-age-of-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections in the Age of AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The 2024 election cycle is coinciding with the wide and growing accessibility of sophisticated AI technology, creating an inflection point that will test the resilience of democratic structures and tech companies’ ability to scale AI tools safely and responsibly. Current media coverage of AI’s impact on elections tends to reside in the extreme. Headlines depict apocalyptic hypotheticals in which AI will threaten election security, flood the zone with inaccurate election information, and sway the will of voters. Yet, just one and a half years since ChatGPT was first released to the public and with just over six months before the presidential election, we must be realistic about the probable threats and appropriate responses—as well as opportunities—that AI presents for the U.S. election ecosystem. Join us for an expert discussion to better understand what the widespread availability of AI might mean for voters, campaigns, and election officials this year. <strong>When:</strong> April 24 8pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online and Washington, DC. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/events-calendar/2024/Portland-2024-Draft-Agenda.pdf?v=240219"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center Special Workshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Election Center will hold a Special Workshop in Portland, Oregon with a focus on state trainings, certifications and conferences. Covered topics will include AI and election management, training new employees,  working with interns, volunteers and law students, executive staffing and working with the Legislature. There will also be presentations by the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission and CISA. The workshops will kick off with a tour of the Multnomah County elections office. Additionally several CERA classes will be held in conjunction with the workshop. <strong>When:</strong> April 24-28. <strong>Where:</strong> Portland, Oregon.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/high-cost-public-service"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The High Cost of Public Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Threats are part of the disturbing new reality of American politics. While abuse directed at federal officeholders grabs the headlines, a</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/intimidation-state-and-local-officeholders"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new Brennan Center report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals that intimidation aimed at state and local officials is distressingly common: 43 percent of state legislators, for example, have experienced threats within the past three years.  In addition to menacing public servants and their families, these threats have serious repercussions for representative democracy. Officeholders report being less willing to work on contentious issues like reproductive rights and gun control and more reluctant to continue serving. Additionally, intimidation is often targeted at groups already underrepresented in government, such as women and people of color. Panelists Gowri Ramachandran, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, Florida State Rep. Anna Eskamani, and former Nevada State Assemblymember Tom Roberts will be joined by moderator Deirdre Walsh of NPR. New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who herself has experienced threats of violence, will also deliver remarks. <strong>Where:</strong> April 30, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/disinformation-elections-democracy-how-journalists-can-spot-and-disarm-current-tactics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinformation, Elections &amp; Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  Election Day 2024 will be one of the most consequential in U.S. history, and disinformation campaigns loom large in influencing millions of Americans on what’s really at stake when they head to polls this fall. Journalists across the country must be prepared with the skills to pre- and debunk conspiracy theories, misinformation, and more — well before Nov. 5.

In the final part of NCSL’s spring webinar series, U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Christy McCormick will delve into state policies that can increase voter confidence. Perfecting processes and procedures comes first: clarifying all policies before the first vote is cast; cleaning voter lists; adopting strong chain-of-custody procedures for ballots and equipment; updating emergency plans; using pre- and post-election audits; and more.
