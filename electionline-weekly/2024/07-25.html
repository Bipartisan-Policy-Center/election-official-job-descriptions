							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Caltech 2024 Election Integrity Project<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election security collab between researchers and election officials to combat misinformation</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Michael Alvarez, PhD<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flintridge Foundation Professor of Political and Computational Social Science, Caltech<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-Director, Caltech Linde Center for Science, Society, and Policy<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-Director, Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe but it’s been over two decades since the </span><a href="https://www.vote.caltech.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was founded. During that time, we have seen the dramatic evolution and growth of academic research about election administration and technology. In the immediate aftermath of the 2000 presidential election, the founders of this project scoured the research literature and found that there was not a great deal of work we could draw upon to guide the project’s initial efforts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11601" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-25-at-11.25.48 AM-300x240.png" alt="" width="300" height="240" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-25-at-11.25.48 AM-300x240.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-25-at-11.25.48 AM-1024x819.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-25-at-11.25.48 AM-768x615.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-25-at-11.25.48 AM.png 1432w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />But that has now changed considerably, with important new work appearing weekly in peer-reviewed journals, with academic conferences devoted to advancing the study of election science, and with scholars throughout the United States and other nations devoting considerable time to studying many aspects of the election process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even better, much of this research is very applied, intended to help improve election administration and technology. Academic researchers are talking about their work at workshops and conferences of election officials, helping to disseminate the results of our work to those who can use it to make important changes to how elections are conducted. We continue to see the development of direct collaborations and partnerships between academic researchers and election officials, which are generating important synergies for both those conducting elections and for those who study elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further these direct collaborations and partnerships, Caltech recently received a research grant from the </span><a href="https://haynesfoundation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haynes Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our research through the </span><a href="https://giving.caltech.edu/news/ronald-and-maxine-linde-support-center-for-science-society-and-policy#:~:text=Established%20in%202023%20within%20the,and%20governments%20around%20the%20world"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linde Center for Science, Society, and Policy at Caltech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This grant is focused on developing new and deepening existing partnerships between academic researchers and election officials, in particular with respect to providing research-based factual material to help mitigate or prevent the spread of election misinformation. The grant continues similar partnerships that Caltech has built, especially in Southern California, since 2018. We’ve named this effort </span><a href="https://www.protectingtheelection.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Caltech 2024 Election Integrity Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important example of our work work cites a common election security rumor about the voter list maintenance. To quote an election security rumor from the </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</span></a> <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/rumor-vs-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Security Rumor vs. Reality area of its site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Election officials don’t clean the voter rolls.” Election officials and those who closely study election administration know that this is not true, as many steps are taken by election officials before, during, and after elections to make sure that the voter rolls contain accurate, timely, and complete information about all registered voters in their jurisdiction.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to help stop these rumors is for local election officials to work directly with researchers to provide access to the voter registration databases, so that academic researchers can independently and transparently conduct detailed quantitative examinations of the accuracy and completeness of the data in those files.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ace8a6b45776eba2e40cbee/t/5cfef2301f430f000166b830/1560212017012/2018_OC_Haynes_Final_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnerships were conducted by Caltech in 2018 and 2020, in association with the Registrar of Voters’ Offices in California’s Orange County and Los Angeles County.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The process was straightforward. The local election officials provided daily “snapshots” of their voter registration data. The Caltech team built algorithms that scanned each snapshot for potential duplicate records, and which compared daily snapshots to past daily snapshots to look for evidence of <img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />anomalous record changes. Detailed reporting dashboards provided crucial information for the local election officials, allowing them to take action to further examine potential duplicate records and also to be aware of situations where there might be anomalous record changes (either in the form of records added or dropped, or in the form of changes to the records themselves).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than providing actionable information for the election officials concerned, what is valuable about such a partnership? Obviously, during the preparation period for a presidential election, few jurisdictions have the personnel, resources, or computational facilities that could be used for these types of detailed studies. But equally important, these reports provide independent confirmation that the voter file in a jurisdiction is as accurate, complete, and timely as possible.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can help when certain inquiries arise about rumors like this. For example, if a local newspaper calls the election official asking about voter file maintenance, the election official will have the intelligence on hand to respond in detail to the questions. And, the reporters can be referred to the academic partner for their independent evaluation. If candidates running in the jurisdiction make these same inquiries, again, they can also be referred to the academic partner.  This may not totally prevent the spread of such rumors, but it can help to mitigate their origin and spread.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently initiating these same voter file reports for a number of Southern California counties, and we welcome inquiries from other jurisdictions which might find them useful in 2024 or 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6599" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />However, an exciting new dimension of our research project in 2024 might provide even further support to election officials to help them deal with election misinformation and rumors when they arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, there has been considerable research seeking to understand how to talk to those who might be misinformed, or who might be concerned about a particular rumor they have heard. More intriguingly, there has also been considerable research that has sought to determine how to “pre-bunk” or “inoculate” people so that they are better able to spot rumors  and misinformation, and thus to not be as susceptible to misinformation in the first place.  (Interested readers might want to pick up a copy of </span><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262545051/how-to-talk-to-a-science-denier/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee McIntyre’s “How to Talk to a Science Denier: Conversations with Flat Earthers, Climate Deniers, and Others Who Defy Reason”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393881448"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sander van der Linden’s “Foolproof”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more about this research).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research group is currently working to understand how to use these techniques, along with fact-based, scientific research, to better respond to misinformed statements about election administration and technology, and to possibly “pre-bunk” some of this misinformation and rumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Inoculation against election misinformation is especially useful because there are countless variations of false information that people might encounter. Debunking is naturally reactive, and it’s not possible to fact check each and every election rumor people encounter. Pre-bunking presents a way to be proactive,” said Mitchell Linegar, a Caltech elections researcher who is working closely with me and the rest of our team on this important effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We plan to provide election officials with best practices in the very near future about how to talk about election rumors and misinformation, and how to frame responses about misinformation and rumor to their stakeholders and communities.

Carter attempted to reassure the directors that the system’s Office of Inspector General will publish an election mail report next week containing “encouraging” performance numbers for this year so far. “The data that we’re seeing showing improvements in the right direction,” Carter told a conference of the National Association of State Election Directors. “And I think the OIG report is especially complimentary of how we’re handling the election now.” But, according to the Associated Press,  state election directors stressed to Carter that they’re still worried that too many ballots won’t be delivered in time to be counted in November. They based their fears on past problems and a disruptive consolidation of postal facilities across the country that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has put on hold until after the elections. Bryan Caskey, the elections director for Kansas asked Carter to consider a hypothetical jurisdiction that has a 95% on-time rate for mail deliveries, which he said is better than what almost all states are getting. “That still means that in the state that sends out 100,000 ballots, that’s 5,000 pissed-off, angry voters that are mad about the mail service,” Caskey said, adding, “Actual elections are being determined by these delays, and I just want to make sure that you’re hearing why we’re so upset.” “It’s totally understandable,” Carter said. “The frustration is understandable.” Meanwhile, a group of 19 U.S. Senators are</span><a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/special-reports/postal-problems/warnock-senators-request-postmaster-generals-2024-election-plans/85-bfa0ecda-e15d-40ae-835b-a8383fc1dc79"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still awaiting a response from a June 24 letter </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">they sent to DeJoy. The letter focused on USPS&#8217;s Mail Process Facility Reviews (MPFR), an effort that began last summer to consolidate the postal network around Regional Processing and Distribution Centers. The rollout is part of the 10-year &#8216;Delivering for America&#8217; plan, which aims to save money and improve service nationwide.

Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin in a ruling last Friday found instances in which the signature-gathering process was not properly carried out and disqualified those booklets. She ordered elections officials to remove the disqualified signatures and booklets and to determine if the measure still had sufficient signatures. Alaska Department of Law attorneys in court documents July 23 said the Division of Elections had completed that work and found the measure “remains qualified” for the ballot. In </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/move-ranked-choice-voting-could-cost-least-25m-40m-idahos-top-election-official-says%C2%A0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, implementing the ranked-choice voting component of the open primaries ballot initiative that will be up for a vote in Idaho’s Nov. 5 general election could cost the state at least $25 million to $40 million if the state needs to replace its vote tabulation systems, Secretary of State Phil McGrane wrote in a letter to lawmakers earlier this month. McGrane wrote that the state may need to replace its vote tabulation systems because the two vote tabulation system vendors that are certified for use in Idaho are not currently capable of tabulating the results of a ranked-choice voting ballot. In </span><a href="https://www.koin.com/news/portland/multnomah-county-ranked-choice-voting-for-local-elections-07232024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multnomah County, Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Elections Division is gearing up to transition to ranked-choice voting. The new system is rolling out for the City of Portland elections this November and for county-wide elections in 2026. Multnomah County gave an update on July 23  on where they’re at with the transition. officials said they’re testing and implementing the voting software and will conduct a large-scale testing event next week. Though the City of Portland’s local elections will be the first to implement the ranked-choice system locally, Multnomah County Elections is in charge of issuing and counting those ballots to citizens. It’s the first time ranked-choice voting will be used in Oregon, though it’s already being used in Alaska, Maine and about 50 other local jurisdictions around the country. An extensive voter education campaign is also underway to get people familiar with the new ballot design and how to cast your vote. </span></p>

This week, it was announced that Coastal Carolina’s distinctive, “Surf Turf” teal field will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/coastal-carolina-election-commission-logo-field-3b7d2c039487c6416f19e2a9b8c51c98"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feature the logo for the South Carolina State Election Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this season. The school and the organization that administers elections in the state announced July 22 that the group’s logo will be displayed on the field at Brooks Stadium. Coastal Carolina said it’s the first FBS program to secure branding for its football field that does not involve naming rights. The agreement is for one year. Financial terms were not disclosed. State Election Commission executive director Howie Knapp called it a “fantastic” opportunity to remind South Carolina residents of the importance of voting. It “gives us another opportunity to remind voters about another important voting season while they enjoy watching the Chanticleers play,” he said in a statement. Chance Miller, the school’s vice president for intercollegiate athletics, said the collaboration shows the importance of partnering with state agencies and businesses for support — and helping further “state agency missions and initiatives.”</span></p>

It also explains how staff reach out to voters if there are any issues with their ballots. Hobbs said this new campaign is live across all media platforms. </span></p>

Following an invitation from the United States Mission to the OSCE to observe the 5 November 2024 general elections, and in accordance with its mandate, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) undertook a Needs Assessment Mission (NAM) from 13 to 17 May. The NAM included Ulvi Akhundlu, Deputy Head of the ODIHR Election Department, and Hamadziripi Munyikwa, ODIHR Election Adviser. The ODIHR NAM was joined by Stéphanie Koltchanov, Head of Elections of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. The mission assessed the pre-election environment and the preparations for the elections. Based on this assessment, the NAM recommends whether to deploy an ODIHR election-related activity for the forthcoming elections and, if so, what type of activity best meets the identified needs.  All ODIHR NAM interlocutors expressed confidence in election administrators’ integrity and their capacity to fulfill their roles, including on election day, despite the presence of rhetoric denigrating their integrity. Many ODIHR NAM interlocutors also emphasized the widespread presence of political party and non-partisan observers as contributing to transparency on election day. Notwithstanding the volume of changes to state election laws, most issues identified in previous reports remain unaddressed and only some ODIHR recommendations have been implemented. Most ODIHR NAM interlocutors saw value in a potential ODIHR observation activity for these elections recognising that an external assessment may contribute to further improvements to the electoral process by informing the ongoing debates about legislative changes at federal and state levels. They also noted the importance of international observation given the highly polarized environment and the discourse sowing distrust in the integrity of elections. The ODIHR NAM recommends specific attention be paid to the legal framework and its stability, the conduct of the electoral campaign, particularly in media and social networks, the effectiveness of campaign finance regulations, as well as voter rights, registration and identification. On this basis, the ODIHR NAM recommends the deployment of a Limited Election Observation Mission (LEOM) to observe the 5 November general elections. In addition to a core team of analysts, the mission recommends the secondment of 100 long-term observers from OSCE participating States to follow the electoral process countrywide. In line with the ODIHR’s standard methodology, the LEOM would contain a media monitoring element.</span></p>

In 2022, analysis by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology found that only 25% of election websites used the .gov domain. As the 2024 election approaches, BPC finds that there has been an uptick in adoption: now, 31% of election websites are on .gov. BPC analyzed a dataset maintained by the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) consisting of websites and contact information for all local election offices across the country. We found the following changes since 2022: Of approximately 7,000 unique local election websites, the share using the .gov domain increased from 25% to 31%. (We should note that this grouping overrepresents states like Wisconsin and Michigan that administer elections at the sub-county level, such as by town.); Adoption by the approximately 3,000 websites associated with counties and county equivalents increased from 31% to 39%; and Among the 20 most populous counties according to the 2020 Census enumeration—together home to over 60 million Americans—usage of the .gov domain increased from 42% to 53%. This shift is due to two of those counties—Tarrant County, TX, and Santa Clara County, CA—adopting .gov. (This analysis considers the 19 unique websites belonging to these 20 counties; Brooklyn, NY, and Queens, NY, both use vote.nyc)</span></p>

							<h2>Rulemaking and Legislation Updates</h2>

The Board of State Canvassers, which oversees parts of the election process, advanced that proposed rule change and others to the final step of the rulemaking process July 19. Now it’ll be up to a panel of lawmakers to decide whether to accept the new rules once the Bureau of Elections prepares all the materials for it. Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater said the changes are a way to stop people from misusing the recount process. “The purpose of the recount is to recount the ballots. It’s not to look into other issues that are really in the purview of law enforcement or the courts,” Brater said. The proposed administrative rule changes reflect a new state law that was signed earlier this month. That law is expected to go into effect next year. Brater said going through the administrative rulemaking process could allow the changes to take effect in time for the November general election Outside of the recount process, the Board of State Canvassers approved some proposed changes to its meeting procedures. One of the biggest changes would require anyone who comes before the board to submit materials, like briefs, at least 48 hours ahead of time. Brater said it would help cut back on people bringing information before the board at the last minute. Those proposed changes are now at an early stage in the rulemaking process. They’ll go through public comment and review by the panel of lawmakers before they can become final.</span></p>

The vote comes after city officials, including Mayor Quinton Lucas, said they were concerned about an increase in reports of problems at polling sites in recent elections. &#8220;The purpose of this ordinance is to regulate and punish acts of aggression, violence, threats of violence, interference, or intimidation, or acts of disorderly conduct that disrupt or interfere with the conducting of an election or an election worker in the discharge of an election worker’s official duties,&#8221; the ordinance states. Democratic director of the Kansas City Board of Elections Laurie Ealom said the passage of the ordinance was a huge exhale for her. “I’ve been on this bandwagon, literally, since 2020,&#8221; Ealom said. That was the year she was threatened while working with voters during an election. “I felt extremely violated, ‘cause I was just doing my job,&#8221; Ealom said. &#8220;I was extremely unprepared.&#8221; Council member Melissa Patterson Hazley co-sponsored the ordinance. Patterson Hazley has volunteered at every election over the last decade. “I have seen more angst here in recent years than I have in the past,&#8221; she said. Ealom said she hopes the ordinance will bring awareness to the new protections and that it&#8217;s a preventative measure the city has taken.</span></p>

Keep Our Republic says it is a non-partisan organization &#8220;dedicated to protecting a republic of laws and strengthening the checks and balances of our democratic electoral system.&#8221;  The organization wrote a creed which is included with the legislation. It states that Americans would &#8220;rededicate&#8221; themselves to &#8220;let every eligible voter vote&#8230;every vote be counted&#8230;let the electoral count stand.&#8221; Commissioner John Brown said the resolution was not productive. &#8220;A resolution like this is, to me, kind of like fluff,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think we need to keep restating over and over and over again around elections.&#8221; The measure failed by a 3-6 vote.</span></p>

The suit, filed in  Montgomery Circuit Court, is seeking to clarify that the new law cannot block people from voting in the November election. The lawsuit argued House Bill 100, which has a Oct. 1 effective date, cannot be used in the upcoming election, because the Alabama Constitution prohibits new election laws from taking effect within six months of the general election. Without clarity, they argued, it is setting up a confusing situation for voters and registrars over who can and cannot vote in November. The new law adds that a conviction for attempting, soliciting or conspiracy to commit one of the more than 40 existing crimes of moral turpitude, would also be considered a disqualifying crime. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two men, convicted of crimes years ago, who could lose their right to vote under the expanded list. Secretary of State Wes Allen’s office declined to answer questions about the effective date, citing the ongoing litigation. The head of the Legislative Services Agency, which advises lawmakers and helps draft legislation, told The Associated Press that they had advised it “would not impact who could vote in November” because of the constitutional requirement but would impact future elections. Allen’s office declined to comment on the litigation or the impact of the new law.</span></p>

The decision by Rankin comes in a lawsuit brought by three voters that seeks to disqualify the repeal measure from the ballot. Rankin previously ruled the Division of Elections acted within its authority when it earlier this year allowed sponsors of the measure to fix errors with petition booklets after they were turned in and found the agency had complied with deadlines. Her new ruling focused on challenges to the sponsors’ signature-collecting methods that were the subject of a recent trial. Rankin set a Wednesday deadline for the division to remove the signatures and booklets she found should be disqualified and for the division to determine if the measure still has sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot. Rankin wrote there was no evidence of a “pervasive pattern of intentional, knowing, and orchestrated misconduct to warrant” the petition totally be thrown out. But she said she found instances in which the signature-gathering process was not properly carried out, and she disqualified those booklets.</span></p>

In the same order, the three-judge panel also said those using that federal form still can cast their ballots by mail. What the judges decided, however, is that anyone who tries to register to vote using a state form is required at the same time to provide documented proof of citizenship. More to the point, if they do not, the application must now be rejected. That overturns what had been occurring. House Speaker Ben Toma (R-Peoria) acknowledged the limited nature of the victory. &#8220;But it&#8217;s still a win,&#8221; he told Capitol Media Services. None of this precludes Toma and others from pursuing an appeal of last year&#8217;s order by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton about the ability of those using the federal form to cast a ballot in the presidential race. A hearing is being scheduled on that for September. And that means there still could be a decision before the Nov. 5 election. But unless Bolton&#8217;s ruling is overturned, it means that the more than 35,000 Arizonans who have signed up using that federal form will get a say in the upcoming election. Their views could have an impact: Joe Biden won Arizona over Donald Trump in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes.</span></p>

State lawmakers are in charge of crafting and approving the descriptions of each ballot proposal included in that pamphlet. And backers of the Make Elections Fair Act say that lawmakers violated Arizona law by greenlighting a summary of the act that could turn voters away. On July 8, a legislative panel made up of eight Republicans and six Democrats OK’d a summary of the Make Elections Fair Arizona Act that, in its first paragraph, highlighted its use of ranked choice voting.  The proposition “would amend the Arizona Constitution to: 1. Allow for the use of voter rankings at all elections held in this state to determine which candidate received the highest number of legal votes,” reads the</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/alispdfs/Council/2024BallotMeasures/staff%20draft%20analysis%20Proposition%20__%20(I-14-2024).pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> description</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> written by the legislative council and approved by lawmakers. “It’s unsurprising that none of the 14 legislators on the Council agreed to adopt our proposed changes to clarify their analysis and describe the most important elements of the initiative first,” she said, in an emailed statement announcing the lawsuit’s filing in Maricopa County Superior Court on Wednesday. “As the beneficiaries of the current electoral process we are proposing to change, the Council each have an inherent conflict of interest.”</span></p>

Earlier this month, lawyers representing the state and the county filed their response to a lawsuit alleging that the </span><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2024/07/22/orange-county-and-state-say-digital-poll-books-are-legal-in-response-to-lawsuit-that-challenges-them/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital voter records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are connected to the internet, are a part of the voting system and thus in violation of California law. The lawyers argued the lawsuit has no grounds and asked an Orange County Superior Court judge to dismiss it. Three registered Republican voters in Orange County — Michelle Morgan, Raul Ortiz and Stefan Bean — filed the lawsuit in March against OC Registrar of Voters Bob Page, the OC Board of Supervisors, Secretary of State Shirley Weber and Gov. Gavin Newsom, alleging that the California Voter’s Choice Act goes against the state election code. The core of the lawsuit’s argument is that</span><a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/regulations/current-regulations/poll-books"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electronic poll books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, accessible to every vote center in real time to verify voter eligibility and whether someone has already voted, are connected to the internet. The lawsuit alleges this violates a</span><a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-19205/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state election code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that says “no part of the voting system shall be connected to the internet at any time” and “no part of the voting system shall electronically receive or transmit election data through an exterior communication network” or “receive or transmit wireless communications or wireless data transfers.”</span></p>

Peters faces criminal charges for giving a security company unauthorized access to voting machines during a system update in 2021.  In an attempt to avert her July 29 trial, Peters filed an emergency application with the justices, claiming federal elections protections give her immunity from the state’s prosecution.  “An injunction stopping the state trial while this court considers this case is necessary to preserve the status quo and prevent an irreparable injury to the institutional interests of the federal government and to Ms. Peters’ right not to be subjected to state trial for executing her duty under federal law,” Peters wrote in her application.  Peters said prosecutors’ charges relate to her duty to preserve election records as Colorado’s chief election official. She argued her actions reflected official responsibilities under federal law, giving her immunity under the 14th Amendment. On July 22, the U.S. Supreme Court</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/tina-peters-supreme-court/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned down the request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Charlotte Sweeney ruled in favor of defendants in a case involving three Colorado election conspiracy theorists who’d been </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/07/18/judge-tosses-out-voter-intimidation-lawsuit-colorado/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused by a coalition of voting rights groups of violating civil rights laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by conducting “voter verification” canvassing in the summer of 2021. Sweeney said that the plaintiffs had failed to present credible evidence of voter intimidation. “The court finds that there is simply insufficient evidence to proceed any further in this matter,” Sweeney said. Ashe Epp, Shawn Smith and Holly Kasun, through their work with the group U.S. Election Integrity Plan, were accused of voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Enforcement Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado in 2022 by attorneys with the liberal nonprofit Free Speech For People, on behalf of the Colorado NAACP, the League of Women Voters of Colorado and Mi Familia Vota. Plaintiffs sought to tie USEIP’s activity to “our nation’s troubling history of voter intimidation and disenfranchisement.” Their witnesses included Chris Beall, Colorado’s deputy secretary of state, and Beth Hendrix, director of the League of Women Voters of Colorado, both of whom testified that the campaign raised concerns and relayed secondhand reports of voters feeling intimidated by canvassers. The judge’s findings came in response to a motion from the defense for an early end to the trial, after the plaintiffs acknowledged on Wednesday that they had no further evidence to present on the issue of intimidation.</span></p>

American Oversight claims that the Republican board members orchestrated the illegal meeting in order to advance proposed rules that would dramatically increase the number of partisan poll watchers permitted at tabulation centers and impose unnecessary burdens on election workers. Also named as defendants in the lawsuit are the board’s two other members, Chairman John Fervier and Sara Tindall Ghazal, the lone appointee of the state Democratic Party. Both members did not attend the July 12 meeting after expressing concerns about its legitimacy. Georgia law requires the State Election Board to provide at least one week’s notice to hold regular meetings, emergency meetings should be announced 24 hours in advance except in limited circumstances. American Oversight claims that notice of the July 12 election board meeting was not publicized in the customary methods of posting online to the board’s website and emailed to its subscriber list.</span></p>

Labrador’s lawsuit alleges the initiative — which has enough signatures to be on the Nov. 5 election ballot, according to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office —  was deceptively pitched as an open primary initiative and violates the Idaho Constitution’s requirement that laws address a single subject. Labrador’s lawsuit asks the Idaho Supreme Court to, in effect, block the initiative from the November ballot by either blocking Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane from including the ballot title on November ballots, or ordering McGrane to invalidate signatures in support of the initiative. The Idaho Secretary of State must submit the ballot title to county election officials by Sept. 7, according to the lawsuit. “We feel that the Supreme Court will look at this very seriously, and we’re hoping that they agree,” Labrador told reporters. Idahoans for Open Primaries campaign spokesperson Luke Mayville, in an interview with the Sun, called the lawsuit a “political stunt” and said he was confident the court would dismiss it.</span></p>

A majority of judges on the 5th Circuit wrote that the Supreme Court in 1974 reaffirmed constitutional law allowing states to disenfranchise felons. “Do the hard work of persuading your fellow citizens that the law should change,” the majority wrote. Nineteen judges of the appeals court heard arguments in January, months after vacating a ruling issued last August by a three-judge panel of the same court. The panel had said Mississippi’s ban on voting after certain crimes violates the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In the ruling, dissenting judges wrote that the majority stretched the previous Supreme Court ruling “beyond all recognition.” The dissenting judges wrote that Mississippi’s practice of disenfranchising people who have completed their sentences is cruel and unusual.</span></p>

The decision updates a timeline from the judges, who issued a ruling July 2 that found problems with districts in three parts of the state — a ruling that will require multiple House and Senate districts to be reconfigured. The judges originally said they wanted new districts set before the regular legislative session begins in January. Their decision means Mississippi will not hold special legislative elections this November on the same day as the presidential election. It also means current legislators are likely to serve half of the four-year term in districts where the judges found that Black voters’ voices are diminished. The judges wrote that waiting until 2025 avoids an “exceedingly compressed schedule” for legislators to draw new districts, for those districts to receive court approval, for parties to hold primaries and for candidates to campaign. Attorneys for the state Board of Election Commissioners argued that redrawing districts in time for this November’s election is impossible because of tight deadlines to prepare ballots. Attorneys for the NAACP, who sued the state, argued it’s important to redraw districts quickly because having special elections next year would create burdens for election administrators and cause confusion for voters.</span></p>

A judge said Tuesday that Montana’s Secretary of State wrongly changed election rules to reject inactive voter signatures from three ballot initiatives after the signatures had been turned into counties and after some of the signatures had been verified. The judge gave county election offices until July 24 to tally signatures of inactive voters that had been rejected. All the initiatives are expected to qualify even without the rejected signatures. In granting a restraining order that blocked the change, state District Judge Michael Menahan said participation in government was a “fundamental right” that he was duty-bound to uphold. He scheduled a July 26 hearing on a permanent injunction against the state.

Dever has dismissed a lawsuit challenging a law requiring North Carolinians to r</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/federal-judge-dismisses-legal-challenge-to-north-carolinas-30-day-residency-requirement-for-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eside in the state for at least 30 days prior to an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which they seek to vote. Dever concluded in an</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-07-19-Order-granting-legislative-defendants-motion-to-dismiss.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “North Carolina’s 30-day durational residency requirement poses only a modest burden on voting rights” and does not unconstitutionally burden the right to vote. Dever additionally held that the rule does not violate the VRA.  In a</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-2023-10-02-complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed last October, the North Carolina Alliance for Retired Americans argued that the state’s so-called “durational residency requirement” flouts a provision of the VRA that expressly prohibits states from imposing such rules.  The VRA permits states to impose a 30-day pre-election registration cutoff for presidential elections in order to ensure accurate voter lists and limit registration to bona fide residents — but as the suit averred, registration requirements are distinct from residency requirements.  The lawsuit further reasoned that North Carolina’s 30-day durational residency requirement is longer than the state’s registration deadline, which allows eligible voters to register up until the Saturday before Election Day using the state’s same-day registration process. Consequently, individuals who do not satisfy the 30-day residency requirement cannot take advantage of this same-day registration opportunity and are thus disenfranchised, according to the lawsuit.  In the motion to dismiss from GOP state legislators, Dever held that the portion of the VRA at issue in the case “does not prohibit or abolish durational residency requirement” in all elections. Rather — as the ruling states — the VRA solely prohibits residency requirements from interfering with citizens’ ability to vote in presidential elections, which North Carolinians who are new residents of the state may still do. “A state violates Section 202 only if its durational residency requirement bars a citizen from voting for president,” the order reads. Dever also agreed with GOP state lawmakers who averred that the requirement is necessary to preventing voter “fraud.”</span></p>

In what was a debate over which rules of grammar to follow in reading a law, the state&#8217;s highest court reversed the rulings of the Canton-based 5th District Court of Appeals in July 2023 and Stark County Common Pleas Judge Taryn Heath in October 2022. The lower courts had ruled that the &#8220;premature disclosure&#8221; clause did not apply to behind closed-doors discussions about the purchase of property for public purposes. The case now goes back to Heath&#8217;s court for a new trial applying the Supreme Court&#8217;s interpretation of the state open meetings law. The 7-0 ruling was a victory for Washington D.C.-based Look Ahead America, an organization founded by former campaign staffers of former President Donald Trump. The group and Jackson Township resident Merry Lynne Rinni filed the lawsuit in May 2021 against the Stark County Board of Elections. The group alleged that the board&#8217;s four closed-door sessions to discuss the purchase of property for public purposes from December 2020 to March 2021 violated Ohio&#8217;s Open Meetings Act. Look Ahead America said the board members discussed the matter without any indication that &#8220;premature disclosure&#8221; of what they discussed would give a private party an unfair advantage.</span></p>

The case is one of three before the court involving the race in the 117th Legislative District as incumbent state Rep. Mike Cabell (R-Luzerne) and challenger Jaime Walsh, who has already declared victory, fight to mop up any uncounted votes.  At issue in the appeal granted July 24 is whether two provisional ballots – one submitted lacking a signature and the other cast by a voter who recently moved to another county – should be counted. The Supreme Court has not announced whether it will hear appeals by Walsh in a dispute over six mail-in ballots, and by Cabell, who wants the county board of elections to tally 22 write-in votes for state representative in the district. Walsh, who claimed victory earlier this month, holds a five-vote lead over incumbent Cabell, according to unofficial Luzerne County election results. Only the write-in votes could change the outcome of the race, though a lawyer for Walsh said the likelihood of that is slim. Walsh contends the Commonwealth Court incorrectly reversed decisions by the Luzerne County elections board and a panel of Luzerne County judges that found one of the provisional ballots should be counted and one should not.  The elections board and county judges found, in accordance with guidance from state election officials, that a provisional ballot submitted without one of two required signatures should be counted because the voter’s intent was clear. A Commonwealth Court panel ruled 2-1 that the ballot should not be counted, citing a statutory requirement that both an affidavit and the ballot’s outer envelope be signed by the voter.</span></p>

Having carefully considered the papers and arguments of counsel, the Court respectfully DENIES the Motion,” a filing in the Third Judicial Court states. Lyman and his campaign had filed official notice requesting election returns, including cast vote records (CVR), tabulator information, ballot images, tabulator tapes, and back up project databases, for all 29 Utah counties. The filing denying Lyman’s motion states that he and his campaign sought “an unredacted list of signors to the Signature Packets with their accompanying personal identifying information, including name, date of signature, address, age or birthdate, voter identification number, and whether the signature was verified,” as well as “a sufficient opportunity to inspect the unredacted Signature Packets, so they may evaluate and, if necessary, challenge the signatures gathered by these competing campaigns before the July 22, 2024, statewide canvassing deadline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge David Nuffer</span><a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/07/19/colby-jenkins-utah-lawsuit-late-postmarked-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied a request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Utah 2nd Congressional District candidate Colby Jenkins to delay the state election certification and reprocess some ballots. But the judge also said the state’s reliance on U.S. Postal Service postmarks appears to be problematic. Jenkins filed a lawsuit in United States District Court on Wednesday alleging that Utah election officials violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by unfairly rejecting some ballots that were mailed before the deadline but received a late postmark from the U.S. Postal Service. Nuffer ruled that Jenkins did not provide sufficient evidence that rejected ballots had been mailed on time or that state officials showed disparate treatment of voters under state code. Judge Nuffer rejected Jenkins’ request to halt Monday’s state election certification and his request to process rejected ballots affected by USPS postmarking delays.</span></p>

Watson surrendered to state police July 24, 2024 after indictments were handed down by a Montgomery County grand jury. At the direction of the Office of the Virginia Attorney General, state police say they initiated the investigation in March 2024 into an allegation of election fraud. July 23, 2024, the grand jury handed up three felony counts of election fraud and one felony count of illegally voting in an election against Watson. The United States Postal Inspection Service assisted the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation. A statement from Watson’s attorneys, Fishwick &amp; Associates PLC, says, “Liam Watson has served the citizens of Montgomery County in various roles for a number of years and was most recently elected in 2023 in a write in campaign by the citizens of Blacksburg for a seat on the Blacksburg Town Council. He is 24 years old, with a heart for public service, and has worked diligently for the citizens who elected him. We look forward to appearing in Court.”</span></p>

The Insurrection Act has virtually no limits on when and how this power can be used, making it a loaded weapon in the hands of any leader, Democrat or Republican, who is tempted to abuse it. Without urgent reforms, the law is a threat to civil liberties — and American democracy. Join The Brennan Center  for a live virtual event moderated by Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center Liberty &amp; National Security Program, featuring lawyer and writer Hawa Allan, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, and Brennan Center counsel Joseph Nunn. The panel will shed light on a president’s alarming powers under the Insurrection Act and examine possible solutions to prevent the law’s misuse. Speakers: Hawa Allan, Author, Insurrection: Rebellion, Civil Rights, and the Paradoxical State of Black Citizenship; Jack Goldsmith, Learned Hand Professor of Law, Harvard Law School; Joseph Nunn, Counsel, Brennan Center Liberty &amp; National Security Program; and Moderator: Elizabeth Goitein, Senior Director, Brennan Center Liberty &amp; National Security Program. <strong>When:</strong> July 25, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
