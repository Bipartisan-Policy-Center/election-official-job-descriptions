							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New design resources to empower poll workers on Election Day</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">These resources are for anyone writing or updating their jurisdiction’s poll worker manuals.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the </span><a href="http://civicdesign.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Civic Design</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-10908" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-6-264x300.png" alt="" width="248" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-6-264x300.png 264w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-6.png 621w" sizes="(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px" />Poll workers are on the frontlines of elections. Manuals support poll workers in following the procedures they learn during training. They are essential to ensure an election runs smoothly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three new non-partisan generic resources are publicly available on the </span><a href="https://electionexcellence.org/resources/pocket-voter-guide-template/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence  Resource Library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and make it easy for any election jurisdiction to create manuals that are well-designed and easy to navigate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great manuals save time on election day by empowering poll workers with the answers they need rather than needing to call the office. These resources aim to help election offices create great manuals that answer questions and empower election workers to feel confident while doing their jobs. </span></p>
<p><strong>What’s in the toolkit<br />
</strong>The Poll Worker Manual Toolkit has three resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The best practice guide</strong>: For election offices that already have a manual but are just looking to update it. This guide is made for election officials at every level of design and technology who are using any software or editing program, whether it&#8217;s Microsoft Word, InDesign, or Canva.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A Word template</strong>: A template election offices can start using right away, for those starting from scratch.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How-to-use Word guide</strong>: For election offices using the Word template, this companion guide is the place to start for election offices looking for instructions on how to use and make the most of Word.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Top design tips </strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small design changes can have a big impact. The best practice guide covers topics like how to create a useful table of contents, best practices for images that support rather than supplement text and how to organize text so that it’s easier to read and understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The<strong> table of contents</strong> is usually the first place people turn to when they open up a manual. Font size, bold, and indents are all design elements that show hierarchy and make the table of contents easier to skim. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_10907" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10907" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-10907" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-02-12-at-5.32.57-PM-1069x604-1-1024x579.png" alt="" width="640" height="362" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-02-12-at-5.32.57-PM-1069x604-1-1024x579.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-02-12-at-5.32.57-PM-1069x604-1-300x170.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-02-12-at-5.32.57-PM-1069x604-1-768x434.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-02-12-at-5.32.57-PM-1069x604-1.png 1069w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10907" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image: An example of a table of contents page that&#8217;s organized and easy to follow (you can download a template of this TOC).</em></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Images</strong> play a large role in communicating concepts, and they can make or break instructions in a manual. Illustrations are preferable to photos because they more clearly highlight the point you’re making. The best practice guide includes tips on choosing images that support instructions well </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A massive <strong>block of text</strong> can easily deter someone from reading the content. To design text so that it’s easy to read:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use bullet points and write short sentences</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use headings to break long text into manageable chunks </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit each page to one topic </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use numbers for steps and bullets for lists that are not step-by-step procedures</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use icons to call out important information and warnings</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best practice guide discusses these tips and others in depth, with examples and visuals to help you easily apply them.</span></p>
<p><strong>First reactions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poll Worker Manual Toolkit has received a positive response from election offices so far. Pete Duncan, from Macoupin County, Illinois, shared that making the changes recommended in our guide was a quick process. He was able to complete 75% of the changes within two days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The manual was fantastic; I would have been lost without it. I’m the most basic Word user in the history of Word users. Whatever the default font is what I used. There was a whole bunch of stuff in the guide I’d never thought of.,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete Duncan, from Macoupin County, Illinois</span></p>

In four Gwinnett County precincts, election workers forgot to bring voter cards, but election officials were able to manually load ballots on voting machines. In Charlton County, two precincts opened late because poll workers didn’t bring the keys. In Columbia County, a ballot configuration error in a special election for the state House affected 130 voters, but election workers used backup procedures so that voting wasn’t interrupted. In </span><a href="https://www.wabe.org/website-warning-of-cyberattack-in-georgias-largest-county-removed-after-it-confused-some-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fulton County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a warning on the countywide website about a January cyberattack caused some disinformation to spread on social media on Tuesday despite the fact that it had nothing to do with the election. Fulton County removed the warning banner from its website, including the elections page, after the concerns raised on social media. Secretary of State’s Chief Operating Officer Gabe Sterling gave a briefing Tuesday evening stating that voting went smoothly across Georgia. “Zero lines all day, no real issues on the ground. Everything seems to be working very smoothly. The</span><a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/georgias-secretary-state-says-voting-went-smoothly-across-state-tuesday/525IKBH2JNBFHKJ7HG4A5T6UEQ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counties have had a good day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Sterling. It was relatively smooth sailing in </span><a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/picture-gallery/news/2024/03/12/ms-voters-hit-polls-to-cast-ballots-in-primary-elections/72935151007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. Following ballot shortage issues during 2023 elections, officials in </span><a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/12/mississippi-primary-election-polls-ballot/72930321007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinds County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were more concerned about a voter shortage. &#8220;The last thing we&#8217;re worried about is a ballot shortage. What troubles me the most is the lack of turnout, that is disappointing,&#8221; Jacqueline Amos, Chair of the Hinds County Democratic Party Executive Committee said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m honestly pretty confident that this coming November is going to be different than last November as far as ballot issues.&#8221; Poll workers throughout the Magnolia State lamented to the media about low turnout, but seemed optimistic about November. “It’s poorly,” Beatrice Jackson, poll manager at the Democratic table, said of the turnout. “It’s always slow in the primaries. The next one will be much better.” In </span><a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/voters-navigate-primary-election-hurdles-express-gratitude-for-seattle-workers-ballot-drop-off-president-voting-envelope-dropbox-vote-general-presidential-primaries-super-tuesday-king-county-mistakes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s King County, election workers spoke with the media about fixing ballot mistakes like missing signatures. One mistake that couldn’t be fixed is when an election worker discovered a mammogram reminder inside a ballot envelope instead of a ballot. Halei Watkins, communications director for King County Elections said that there is a lot of commentary, good and bad, included with returned ballots. The county posts the positive notes on a board for all ot see. One note read, “Thanks elections workers for all you do.” A post-it read, “Thank you election workers.” Another voter also wrote “Thank you elections workers,” on their safety envelope. And someone sent in a hand-drawn “I voted” sticker.</span></p>

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), who also chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he is concerned that intelligence agencies have indicated that “we are potentially less protected as we go into 2024 in terms of the security of our elections than we were during 2020.” “That’s a pretty stunning fact,” Warner said. Among those testifying were Alabama Secretary of State </span><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/alabama-secretary-of-state-wes-allen-testifies-before-u-s-senate-on-election-integrity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wes Allen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Michigan Secretary of State </span><a href="https://www.sooleader.com/local-news/secretaty-of-state-testifies-about-election-misinformation-through-ai-8437167"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jocelyn Benson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Douglas County, Nebraska Election Commissioner </span><a href="https://www.civicnebraska.org/20240312-kruse-2024-preparation-us-senate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Kruse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/03/12/senators-warn-of-threats-to-24-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isaac Cramer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the executive director of the Charleston County Board Of Voter Registration and Elections. During his testimony, Kruse expressed gratitude for a positive relationship between the Douglas County Election Commission and local media to assist in disseminating accurate and timely information to voters, especially with the implementation of voter ID in 2024. “It is my privilege to serve the voters of Douglas County and an honor to be here representing the 93 county election officials in Nebraska who work diligently to conduct accurate elections,” Kruse said in conclusion of his testimony. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia) asked Benson how threats to election workers impact their work. “Not only does it cause us to fear going to work… it takes us away from the actual work of administering elections every time we need to issue protections or think about our own safety,” Benson said. Cramer said as Charleston County prepares for the 2024 election, his office’s main concerns are protecting election workers, the security of polling places and the assurance of reliable federal funding. He said that during the June 2022 primaries, “our polling places became battlegrounds for disruptive elements seeking to undermine the electoral process.”Allen focused portions of his testimony on the steps Alabama has taken to ensure election integrity in the Yellowhammer State. “We have enacted legislation in Alabama that makes it illegal for any voting tabulator to be connected to the internet,” he said. “Alabama state law requires the use of paper ballots in all elections. Each of our voters must verify their identity with photo identification at his or her polling place”</span></p>

This year, it’s the April 8 total solar eclipse. How, you may wonder, is there synergy there? Well, it turns out </span><a href="https://www.yourerie.com/news/pennsylvania-news/erie-county/erie-county-considers-extending-voter-registration-deadline-due-to-eclipse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 8 which is the day of the eclipse is also the voter registration deadline in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Erie County is in the path of totality. According to a press release from County Clerk Karen Chillcott, the county is expected to be heavily impacted by visitors wishing to view this once in a lifetime event, and the local population could see itself double in the days leading up to the eclipse. This spike in population could affect the ability of Erie County citizens and Erie County employees to get to the Courthouse safely on April 8. “Also in consideration was the Erie County Sheriff’s Office. If the Erie County Courthouse were to remain open to the public, the Sheriff’s Office would be at the Courthouse rather than being out in the community, on a day when emergency services will already be strained due to the event,” Chillcot said. The county commission <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Resolution-for-Eclipse-AS-AMENDED.pdf">voted to extend the voter registration deadline</a> to April 9. “The decision to extend the deadline was not taken lightly, and agencies such as the Pennsylvania Department of State, the Governor’s Office, PEMA, and others were consulted prior to making the decision. Ahead of the meeting tonight, Erie County Council received a <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-12-24-BOE-Res-FS-Extending-the-Deadline-to-Register-to-Vote-AMENDED.pdf">Resolution from the Board of Elections</a> as well as a Court Order signed by the Honorable Judge Mead of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas,” Chillcot said. The county is encouraging residents to register in-person by April 5 or go online to register.  Should anyone come to the courthouse on April 8 to register to vote, there will be a sign at the front of the Courthouse with directions on how to register: A QR Code will be provided for those who wish to register to vote online; A folder with applications and pens will be located at the front of the courthouse, with an option to drop the application into the secure ballot box; If any application has an issue or has any missing information, someone from the Voter Registration Office will contact the applicant to resolve those issues; The Voter Registration Office will reopen to the public on April 9 to receive applications; and Any application received by April 9, 2024 will be considered valid and timely</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lessons from the Past</strong>: An electionline reader forwarded us this really interesting article about how </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/ancient-rome-successfully-fought-against-voter-intimidation-a-political-story-told-on-a-coin-that-resonates-today-222967"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient Rome successfully fought against voter intimidation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It might seem odd that something from Ancient Rome could be relevant in today’s elections, but as David Hollader, a professor of history at Iowa State University wrote for The Conversation, “as voting access evolves in the U.S., the political importance of this centuries-old coin seems more compelling. It turns out that efforts to regulate voting access go way back.” In his article, Hollander writes about encountering a silver denarius, a Roman coin first minted over 2,000 years ago that depicted figures walking across a narrow bridge and dropping something into a box.Hollander notes that the coin in particular is hardly the most attractive Roman coin, but it is vital evidence for the early stages of a political struggle that culminated in Caesar’s assassination and the fall of the Roman Republic. In 139 BCE a law was passed requiring written ballots which made it more difficult for elites to influence voting.

Kenneth began his career with the office as a senior information system analyst in 2004. He worked in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) section. According to Dean Logan, registrar-recorder/county clerk, Kenneth’s hard work, expertise and leadership in the GIS field were recognized nationwide. Kenneth eventually led the election systems division and information technology department responsible for GIS, ballot management and election systems. When the county took steps toward replacing its voting system in 2009, Kenneth was involved. “I am proud to say that Kenneth was there from the very beginning, undaunted by the challenge and willing to shoulder a tremendous load,” Logan said. “The success of the [VSAP] would be impossible without his leadership. Kenneth’s memory and legacy carry on with every voter we serve.” In addition to work for Los Angeles County, Kenneth also worked with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Technical Guidelines Development Committee and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

<p><a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/BOM24087%20-%20VRAA%20118th%20final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VRAAA)was recently reintroduced to the Senate. The reintroduction was brought on by Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia), Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York), and 48 of their Senate Democratic colleagues. This is a summary of some of the key provisions in the VRAA: The VRAA modernizes the formula for determining which states and localities have a pattern of discrimination and are thus subject to preclearance. The bill thereby imposes preclearance on states with “15 or more voting rights violations” in the last 25 years, or 10 such violations, if “at least one of which was committed by the State itself.” It also requires preclearance for localities with three of more violations in the last 25 years. The VRAA would require preclearance for any election law or procedure, in any state or locality, relating to the following “covered practices”: Changes to add seats elected at-large in states or localities with sufficiently large minority populations; Changes to political subdivision boundaries that reduce minority representation in states or localities with sufficiently large minority populations; Changes through redistricting impacting states or localities with sufficiently large minority communities that experienced a significant growth in population; Changes in documentation or qualifications to vote (i.e. voter ID laws); Changes reducing multilingual voting materials or altering the manner in which such materials are provided or distributed; Changes that reduce, consolidate, or relocate polling locations or reduce voting opportunities; Changes to the maintenance process for voter registration lists that adds a new basis for removal from the list in jurisdictions with sufficiently large minority populations. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. While still on the books, this section has been eroded over time, most recently through the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2021 decision in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee. The VRAA sets out to strengthen this provision. Notably, it standardizes the “totality of the circumstances” analysis used to evaluate potential violations by codifying the nine Senate Factors, derived from the Senate report accompanying the 1982 amendments to the VRA, that were adopted by the Supreme Court in Thornburg v. Gingles. The VRAA expands Section 2 to bar the enactment of any voting law that has the purpose or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of voters of color to participate in the electoral process or elect their preferred candidates. The VRAA would impose new notice and disclosure requirements on states for: (1) changes to voting rules or procedures that are adopted within 180 days of an election for federal office; (2) polling place resources; and (3) redistricting, reapportionment, and other changes in voting districts involving federal, state, and local elections. Compliance with these transparency provisions would be voluntary for smaller jurisdictions. This Act would also incorporate the Election Worker and Polling Place Protection Act, which expands and clarifies protections for election workers, polling places, and other election infrastructure against threats, harassment, and violence. Damages or threats to property in violation of the statute are punishable by a fine, up to six months imprisonment, or both, and serious injury against persons are punishable by fine, up to one year imprisonment, or both.</span></p>

Representatives voted 75 to 28 to pass the bill. The Senate previously passed the bill Feb. 13 with a vote of 27 to 8. &#8220;Ballot harvesting is a practice in which groups or individuals seek to profit off of the absentee voting process by knowingly ordering, requesting, collecting, pre-filing, obtaining or delivering an absentee ballot application or absentee ballot other than his or her own absentee ballot application or absentee ballot,&#8221; Sen. Garlan Gudger said in a statement. &#8220;SB1 will help strengthen Alabama&#8217;s absentee voting process while protecting voters who are disabled and protecting our overseas military voters. SB1 will make it illegal to pay or receive payment to assist voters in completing an absentee ballot application or absentee ballot.&#8221; Although the bill must be concurred by the Senate before it can receive Gov. Kay Ivey&#8217;s signature and become law, Ivey has already voiced support for the bill.</span></p>

Spearheaded by the top Republican in the Democrat-majority chamber, Minority Leader Rose Pugliese of Colorado Springs, and Rep. Ryan Armagost of Berthoud, the effort has the backing of 17 of the 19 House Republicans. “Since being elected, the Secretary of State has used her position as a platform for her partisan political ideology and has proven herself unfit for this elected position,” the group of Republicans wrote in a letter to Speaker Julie McCluskie (D-Dillon) about Secretary Jena Griswold. The letter indicates that Pugliese and Armagost submitted an impeachment resolution Feb. 8, and it requests that McCluskie bring the resolution to the House floor for consideration. “This resolution is an unwarranted waste of time, and I’m disappointed to see House Republicans bow to the most extreme fringes of their party simply because the Secretary of State did her job,” McCluskie said in a statement. “Donald Trump is the problem, not the secretary. But instead of dealing with MAGA extremists in their ranks, they’re defending Trump, and attacking his opponents.”</span></p>

State Sen. Mae Flexer and State Rep. Matt Blumenthal, two Democrats who co-chair the legislature’s Government Administrations and Elections (GAE) Committee, are pushing for legislation to protect election workers—a category that includes poll workers, Registrars of Voters, Town Clerks, and many state officials.

State Sen. Rob Sampson, the ranking Republican on the GAE Committee, said he agrees with the concept of the bill but opposes sections he believes infringe on certain individual rights. Sampson and his fellow Republicans are backing a separate bill (</span><a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cga.ct.gov%2F2024%2FTOB%2FS%2FPDF%2F2024SB-00390-R00-SB.PDF&amp;data=05%7C02%7CKristina.Russo%40wtnh.com%7C7ef97d4700ab44db64e808dc43a14109%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C0%7C0%7C638459607159858643%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=YLLdrnw98DZ0J0IW5O8qmNe0lhIZ%2FXBCXiIb2rbWMhE%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 390</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) which seeks to impose a mandatory minimum prison sentence on those found guilty of certain elections-related felonies. Republicans point to widespread allegations and video evidence of absentee ballot misconduct in the city of Bridgeport. They argue that current laws on the books make it so that those who are caught engaging in ballot misconduct are not punished harshly enough in their view.</span></p>

Sponsored by Rep. Mike Kingsley, R-Lewiston, House Bill 667 would make several changes to absentee voting.  Under the bill, a voter would only be able to request an absentee ballot if they were unable to vote in-person on Election Day or on all the other early voting days if the voter “anticipated being out of the jurisdiction on such days” or the voter “has an illness or another disability that would prevent the elector from voting in person on such days.” Currently, Idaho voters can request an absentee ballot for any reason. House Bill 667 would also prohibit political parties and other organizations from mailing absentee ballot request forms to voters. Under the bill, only a voter could request that an absentee ballot form be mailed to them. The bill would also block political parties and other organizations from filling out absentee ballot forms for a voter. A proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate. That means it would have taken 47 votes to pass the House. Instead, the Idaho House voted 42-27 in favor of the bill – falling short of the necessary two-thirds vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that sought to </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/03/11/proposed-constitutional-amendment-to-block-ranked-choice-voting-fails-in-idaho-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">block ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> failed in the House this week and won’t appear on the ballot in November. Pushed by Rep. Vito Barbieri, R-Dalton Gardens,</span><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/HJR004/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Joint Resolution 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included the following proposed language to add to the Idaho Constitution: “PERSON WITH HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES ELECTED. In all partisan primary elections and general elections, and for the election of judges, there shall be one round of voting, and the person having the highest number of votes for an office shall be deemed to have won such election.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbieri told legislators his amendment was specifically targeting ranked-choice voting. A ranked choice voting system is one of the provisions of the separate open primary ballot initiative that Idahoans for Open Primaries are hoping to qualify for the November general election. Under the proposed ranked choice voting system in the open primary initiative, the top four candidates from a primary election would advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. In the general election, voters would vote for their favorite candidate, and then have the opportunity to rank the remaining three candidates in order of preference on the same ballot. The candidate with the fewest votes would be eliminated, and their votes would instead be transferred to the second choice of candidate on a voter’s ballot. That process would continue until there are two candidates left and the candidate with the most votes would be elected the winner.  </span></p>

People flagged by that comparison would have to show proof of citizenship to their county election officials within 30 days in order to be able to vote. Immigration attorneys say that proof is difficult and sometimes impossible to obtain within 30 days. And the BMV data is often out-of-date. The citizenship provision won’t take effect until July of 2025. </span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1264/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HEA 1264</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also allows the state to buy people’s credit information, to compare it to voter data and flag potential mismatches. Similarly, the state will search the voter list for people whose addresses appear to be nonresidential. County election officials must then further investigate to ensure people are appropriately registered where they live. Supporters said the legislation will help further strengthen Indiana&#8217;s election system.</span></p>

She also would like to see a special division of election integrity created inside her office. Part of the plan would also ensure that no one would be allowed to assist with more than 1 absentee ballot unless that person is a family member of the voter who’s at least 18 years old. The Secretary also wants to see a uniform way for election supervisors to tabulate ballots for every parish in the state.</span></p>

Wes Moore, would make threatening an election official a misdemeanor punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of up to $2,500. A similar measure is pending in the House. The bill would prohibit someone from knowingly and willfully making a threat to harm an election official or an immediate family member of an election official, because of the official’s role in administering the election process. Harm would include serious injury or serious emotional distress, under the bill. Threats would include spoken ones, as well as threats made in any written form.</span></p>

The bill lists a wide variety of state or federal election fraud, illegal influence or voter threat convictions that would disqualify a person from serving on the Michigan State Board of Canvassers or county canvassing boards that confirm vote tallies. That function has become the target of efforts to reverse election results. “Individuals who have shown a willingness to violate Michigan election law have no business overseeing our state elections, let alone certifying results,” said bill sponsor Rep. Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield).  “Period. End of story.” The crimes include offering bribes for votes, intimidation or obstructing voters, absentee ballot fraud, illegally breaking open a ballot lock or seal, and altering a ballot. Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay) said lifetime bans for misdemeanor or felony election violations would be tougher than the 20-year ban in the Michigan Constitution on a felon holding an elected or appointed office.</span></p>

The bill will now move on to the Senate, where it will also require a two-thirds vote to pass before possibly going to the governor&#8217;s desk for final consideration. If passed, prior felony conviction holders would be forgiven if they committed bad check writing or felony shoplifting, to name a few. Other crimes such as murder, arson and embezzlement would not be covered under the bill. &#8220;If this bill passes, there are people who are ineligible to vote right now who will be able to vote automatically without filing anything in a court, without having other legislation passed,&#8221; Rep. Elliot Burch, R-Lucedale, who presented the bill said. &#8220;I believe it is a way for people who are unable to vote right now, but have done their time and are productive members of society to have the opportunity to vote.&#8221; Burch also offered an amendment to the bill that received almost no backlash. That amendment took perjury and bribery, which were originally crimes violators could be forgiven for, off of the restoration list. It also prohibited sexual battery and human trafficking from being eligible for restoration, though those are not currently on the disenfranchising list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate passed bipartisan legislation that would allow </span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2024/03/13/mississippi-early-voting-legislature-absentee-legislature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no-excuse early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Mississippi for 15 days before Election Day, including the Saturday before.  Eight Republicans in the 52-member, GOP majority chamber voted against</span><a href="https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2024/pdf/history/SB/SB2580.xml"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 2580</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The measure now heads to the House. Senate Elections Chairman Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, said during debate over the bill that the measure adds security to elections because it requires voters to cast a ballot in person at their county circuit clerk’s office.  “I think this is a bill that number one our constituents are asking for,” England, a Republican from Vancleave, said. “This issue has been discussed with constituents and we’re one of only three states that don’t do this currently. This is, in my opinion, … a step in the right direction.”  Mississippi allows in-person absentee voting before elections, but voters must meet criteria, such as being over 65 or disabled, or provide one of a handful of valid “excuses,” such as being out of town for work on election day and follow a long list of rules and procedures.</span></p>

Seven cameras would be placed at six drop box locations: Springfield, Gretna Ace Hardware, Bellevue Public Library, Sarpy County Building (two drop box locations), Sarpy County Courthouse and La Vista Police Department. The county plans to install the cameras April 1. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s that important that people know that our elections are safe, secure and their vote matters,&#8221; Commissioner Don Kelly said. Kelly hopes the cameras accomplish two things: deter anyone from doing anything illegal to compromise elections and make sure voters know the county is taking all steps possible to &#8220;make sure the integrity and security of our elections is upheld.&#8221; County Administrator Bonnie Moore reassures the community that this decision didn&#8217;t come about because there was an incident that forced the county to install the cameras. &#8220;This is just Sarpy County being proactive,&#8221; Moore said. Both Moore and Kelly praise the county&#8217;s Election Commissioner, Emily Ethington, for her work in getting the item on the agenda and, hopefully, bringing the cameras to ballot drop box locations. The cost of the cameras will come out to $50,560. The money is in the county&#8217;s budget.</span></p>

Both bills are meant to make voting easier and would be optional, left to the discretion of bipartisan election offices in each county. But they are the latest flashpoints in an ongoing clash over voting methods between Democrats who control both legislative chambers and Republicans, who fought the earlier reforms and oppose the two pending proposals. Neither bill is new. The Senate has passed them both several years in a row, most recently in January, but they remain in limbo because the Assembly hasn&#8217;t taken them up. One bill would allow counties to set up one or more &#8220;secure receptacles&#8221; where voters could deposit their absentee ballots instead of mailing them. In a Senate floor debate in January, Republicans cast doubts about the security of ballot boxes, questioning where they would be placed and whether they would be supervised or monitored with surveillance cameras. They raised the prospect of wrongdoers casting multiple ballots or taking votes from the boxes. Another bill approved would allow counties to open one or more &#8220;portable&#8221; voting stations for at least three days during the early-voting period, when fewer voting sites typically are open than on election days. Sites must be chosen to draw as many voters as possible, based on population density, travel time, public transportation routes and other factors, the bill states. Those added polling sites might be mobile − housed in a van, for instance − or situated in familiar places such as a library, depending on what county officials choose. Both are awaiting action in the Assembly Election Law Committee. </span></p>

Youngkin’s administration removed Virginia from ERIC last year, citing concerns about how the data is shared. “The financial burden of rejoining ERIC includes membership fees, which have increased more than 115% since 2022, and participation expenses. ERIC’s mandatory Eligible but Unregistered mailing will cost the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is superfluous considering Virginia’s Department of Motor Vehicles’ automatic registration policies and sameday registration for voting,” said Youngkin in his veto statement regarding SB 606. “Since leaving ERIC, Virginia established data-sharing agreements with numerous states incurring no additional costs. Additionally, the Department of Elections has increased its data sources by collaborating with forty-one states to obtain driver’s license surrender data, while ERIC only provides data sharing with twenty-five states.”</span></p>

Most of these measures died early in the session after failing to meet the two-thirds threshold required to be introduced during a budget session. The dead committee bills aimed to address voter residency requirements, election worker intimidation, campaign finance reporting and the use of private funds to conduct elections.  One of the most consequential measures that the committee sponsored was a durational residency bill that would have required voters to attest that they have been a “bona fide” resident of Wyoming for at least 30 days before an election in which they vote.  Lawmakers introduced the measure, and it passed the House Corporations Committee on an 8-1 vote. But the bill ultimately missed the deadline to be considered in the House Committee of the Whole. Another committee-sponsored bill that would have barred the use of private funds to conduct elections, with an exception for special districts, likewise failed to make the deadline to be considered in the House Committee of the Whole. The Corporations Committee also brought a bill that would have created a misdemeanor offense for election intimidation, which is currently only punishable by a felony. The panel also sponsored a measure clarifying residency requirements for state legislature candidates and another that would have required any group of two or more people to report campaign finances if they pool or jointly expend funds totaling more than $1,000 for campaign activity.  All of these measures failed introduction on the first day of the session. </span></p>

The Alaska Public Offices Commission ruled in January that Alaskans for Honest Elections, a group of repeal supporters, illegally sent campaign money through an organization registered as a church in Washington state. APOC commissioners fined the group more than $94,000 and ordered they make regular public disclosures. The pro-repeal side appealed APOC’s decision to state courts in February, and under the normal course of events, a judge would rule sometime next year. But last week, attorneys representing Alaskans For Better Elections, an anti-repeal group, asked Judge Laura Hartz to speed up the case and issue a verdict during the campaign season. Attorney Scott Kendall, representing Alaskans for Better Elections, said it’s important to his client that the pro-repeal side be required to post accurate information about the source of its money. The Alaska Division of Elections is expected to formally certify a ballot measure this month that would repeal the state’s open primary election and its ranked choice general election, which were created by a 2020 ballot measure. Certification would clear the way for a repeal measure to appear on the November general election ballot. </span></p>

McAfee quashed six counts in the indictment, including three against Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. But the judge left in place other counts — including 10 facing Trump — and said prosecutors could seek a new indictment to try to reinstate the ones he dismissed. It’s the first time charges in any of Trump&#8217;s four criminal cases have been dismissed, with the judge saying prosecutors failed to provide enough detail about the alleged crime. The challenged counts charge the defendants with soliciting public officers to violate their oaths. One count stems from a phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, in which Trump urged Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes.” McAfee said the counts did not allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of the violations. “The lack of detail concerning an essential legal element is, in the undersigned’s opinion, fatal,” McAfee wrote. “They do not give the Defendants enough information to prepare their defenses intelligently.”</span></p>

DeGravelles ruled that Landry and former Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin are responsible for part of the legal costs incurred by Chief Justice John Weimer and three sheriffs who joined him to block the attorney general’s move to delay a November 2022 election in which Weimer was seeking reelection. Ultimately, tax dollars will cover the court-ordered payment.  Landry and Ardoin, both Republicans, were defendants in a lawsuit the Louisiana NAACP brought against the state in 2019 to add a second majority-Black seat to the state Supreme Court’s seven districts. Two years ago, Landry effectively switched sides and joined the NAACP in asking the court to pause the election in which Weimer, an independent, would run unopposed. DeGravelles removed the stay order a magistrate judge had put in place in time for Weimer to qualify for his race. DeGravelles’ order requires Landry and Ardoin, who’s now the governor’s director of intergovernmental relations, to pay more than $36,000 in opposition attorneys’ fees. Lawyers for Weimer and the sheriffs had sought closer to $60,000, but the judge ruled a lack of itemized billing from attorneys didn’t provide enough specifics to determine a payout.</span></p>

The lawsuit, filed by Maryland Election Integrity LLC and Missouri-based United Sovereign Americans, is the first of many suits United Sovereign Americans is planning nationwide, according to a spokesperson. The 34-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland listed various claims, including that the elections board failed to keep accurate voter rolls, used voting machines with error rates beyond the legal threshold and denied the plaintiff’s requests for election reports through Maryland’s public information laws. In their filing, the plaintiffs asked the court to keep the state board of elections from certifying elections until their claims have been satisfied, among a long list of other requests. Maryland Election Integrity LLC is represented by Ed Hartman III. The lawsuit describes his clients’ organization, which was established in January 2024, as “Maryland voters and interested citizens with standing.” A Sovereign Americans spokesperson said Kate Sullivan was leading the Maryland group’s lawsuit.</span></p>

Their lawsuit claims Flint election commissioners in August and November of 2022 ignored GOP applicants in order to stack the city’s cadre of election watchers with more Democrats than Republicans. But the appeals court didn’t rule specifically on those claims and focused its decision on legal standing. The court held that the state and national parties were too far removed to show a direct connection to the case and hinted the plaintiffs might have had better luck if the lawsuit had been filed by the Genesee County Republican Party. “A closer question, and one not raised on appeal, is whether plaintiffs would have organizational standing based upon the rights and interests of the Republican chair for Genesee County. Because the issue has not been raised, we decline to consider it,” said the unanimous opinion. Flint City Clerk Davina Donahue, who sits on the city’s elections commission, told Michigan Public she thinks the appeals court got it right. “Michigan elections are run at the local level so we’re glad that the Court of Appeals recognized that this is a local issue,” she said. Donahue also said she is confident in how the city handled the August and November 2022 elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican National Committee filed a federal lawsuit pressing an earlier demand that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson take steps to </span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/13/rnc-sues-jocelyn-benson-claiming-inflated-voter-rolls/72957826007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purge voter rolls </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of what it previously described as suspiciously — and in many counties, impossibly — high numbers of registered voters. Claiming that 53 of Michigan&#8217;s 83 counties — including Macomb, Oakland and Wayne — have more active registered voters than they do residents over the age of 18, the lawsuit, which was also filed on behalf of two state residents, asked for a judge to find Benson&#8217;s office in violation of federal law and order it to &#8220;develop and implement reasonable and effective registration list-maintenance programs.&#8221; Benson&#8217;s office, which saw a similar lawsuit brought in 2021 by the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) over the purging of dead voters from registration rolls dismissed this month, denounced the new lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Jeffery S. Matis </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/03/08/court-issues-warrant-for-attorney-stefanie-lambert-junttila-after-failing-to-comply-with-court-orders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a bench warrant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Attorney Stefanie Lambert Junttila, granting a request from the prosecution after she repeatedly failed to provide fingerprints and a DNA sample as required by law. Lambert Junttila did not appear at the show cause hearing and will have 24 hours to turn herself in, with prosecutor Tim Maat requesting that the warrant not be executed until 5 p.m. Friday in line with a previous agreement he had made with Lambert Junttila, where she asked that Maat not send officers to her home to arrest her. Lambert Junttila is one of three individuals indicted as part of a probe into alleged tampering with voting tabulators following the 2020 election where President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump. Attorney and former Republican attorney general nominee Matthew DePerno and former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) were also indicted.  The court had issued multiple orders for Lambert Junttila to have her fingerprints and a DNA sample taken, as is required by law. Matis noted the initial order requesting fingerprints and DNA sampling was issued on Aug. 4, 2023, with a deadline of Aug. 10, 2023.</span></p>

In their brief submitted March 6, they argue that Lynn DeRoche, former county elections employee, provided incorrect information to Merchant and Charla Merja, clerk of the Fort Shaw Irrigation District. They argue that state law changed in 2019 to eliminate the requirement that those who co-own property in the district must designate the person who will vote on behalf of those acres. They argue that DeRoche provided a sample letter from previous elections that included language indicating those designations were required.</span></p>

In a unanimous decision, the judges wrote that the changes infringe on the governor’s constitutional duties. In 2023, Republicans passed a law changing state elections administration. The legislation passed along party lines and over Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto. Cooper sued. The law stripped the governor of all appointments to the Board of Elections. As it is now, governors appoint all five members of the board from a list of recommended candidates submitted by the state’s two major political parties. Three come from the governor’s party and two from the other party. The law would increase the board membership to eight, with four members appointed by Republican legislative leaders and four by Democratic legislative leaders. If the board was unable to elect its chairman or choose an executive director, Republican leaders would select them.  The law also reduces county boards of election from five members to four. Legislators would choose all four members, with Republican legislative leaders picking two and Democratic legislative leaders selecting two. Two of the judges are Republicans and one is a Democrat. Republican legislative leaders have announced their </span><a href="https://www.wral.com/story/appeal-coming-from-north-carolina-republicans-in-elections-boards-litigation/21327315/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to appeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Biggs denied a “summary judgment” motion filed 2 1/2 years ago for members of the State Board of Elections, which is implementing the 2018 ID law enacted by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. After legal delays in state and federal courts, the photo ID requirement under that law began with municipal elections last fall and the March 5 primaries. Biggs wrote she was denying the board&#8217;s motion in part because “genuine disputes&#8221; over the facts in the case are present, and otherwise the legal parties “dispute the inferences which may reasonably be drawn from key undisputed facts.”</span></p>

The court ruled in July 2022 that absentee drop boxes may be used only in election offices and no one other than the voter can return a ballot in person. The justices issued an order saying they would review the ban on drop boxes but won’t reconsider any other parts of the case. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in dissent that there’s no reason to revisit the decision and the liberal majority is signaling that they intended to declare drop boxes legal in a “shameless effort to readjust the balance of political power in Wisconsin.” “Overturning (the ruling), a mere two years after its issuance, is nothing but a partisan maneuver designed to give the majority’s preferred political party an electoral advantage,” Bradley wrote. “This is not neutral judging.”</span></p>

What are lawmakers and election administrators thinking about now to prepare? Find out in this four-part series, hosted  by the National Conference of State Legislatures in partnership with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We’ll focus on the elections workforce; counting and recounts and more post-voting work; the voters’ perspectives and voter confidence. The election doesn’t end when the polls close. Counting (and confirming the count) comes next—along with reporting results and, sometimes, recounts. Join us for the second installment of NCSL’s four-part webinar series on election administration to learn about what happens after voting is over. U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Donald Palmer will consider how all states address these tasks that ensure accurate and verifiable results. <strong>When:</strong> April 12, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>

Unfortunately, most solutions come internally from social media platforms or rest with governments to devise. A new grassroots strategy is needed: bottom-up rather than top-down. That is why R Street Institute and George Mason University are holding an Idea-thon to address the problem and find new solutions. Teams will form to attack misinformation and disinformation from four tracks: government, business/technology, nonprofit, and education. Winning teams will receive prizes. Examples of work products include new legislation and regulations, a business plan for a tech start-up, a mobile app, an academic course, or a new nonprofit. Be creative! Software developers are needed, but no computer science skills are necessary to participate. Just bring your best ideas for combating misinformation and disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> April 20. <strong>Where:</strong> Fairfax, Virginia</span></p>
