							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Covering Elections and Voting in 2024</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Pam Fessler, Communications Advisor, The Elections Group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10807" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-300x174.png" alt="" width="300" height="174" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-300x174.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-1024x595.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-768x446.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-1536x892.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7.png 1549w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The media’s job of informing Americans about elections is more important than ever. Confusion over how elections work has undermined public confidence in the  process and allowed disinformation to take hold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the news media is facing its own crisis, with dozens of outlets shutting down over the past year and other news organizations letting hundreds of employees go. There will likely be fewer reporters covering voting and elections in 2024 than in past election cycles, and those who do will likely have less experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with </span><a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/?utm_source=ElectionLine&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=April2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I produced </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/covering-elections-and-voting-in-2024/?utm_source=ElectionLine&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=April2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I hope will help as reporters try to navigate this crucial beat. Covering Elections and Voting in 2024 offers reporting tips, story ideas, links to resources and basic information about how the voting process works. Our target audience is local reporters covering elections for the first time, but those with more experience might find it useful as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be hosting a webinar with The Elections Group at </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/event/covering-elections-and-voting-in-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noon EDT on April 25</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to discuss the guide and share more ideas on how to improve coverage of voting and elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a lifelong journalist, I know reporters cherish their independence. They don’t want someone outside their field — especially those they’re covering — telling them how to do their jobs. This is why The Elections Group had me write this guide. I covered voting for 20 years as a correspondent for National Public Radio and know how confusing this beat can be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7147" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PamFessler1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="266" />I also know that the election process is fascinating and important – and most parties involved want nothing more than a well-informed electorate. However, they don’t always know how to work together to achieve that goal. As the guide notes: “Many election administrators are not used to working with the media. As confusing as the voting process might seem to you, the reporting process is confusing to them. Help them help you. Let them know what you need, and when and in what form you need it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the guide should be useful for election officials and others who work with the media. It describes the types of information reporters might seek and ideas on how to make such information more readily available. This is a follow-on to </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resources/?utm_source=ElectionLine&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=April2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other resources The Elections Group has produced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help election officials communicate more effectively.</span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/commsdesk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guide offers reporters basic facts about elections, some of which might seem obvious to the election community, but not to the rest of the world:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections are run differently in every state, and sometimes in every county within a state.   </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections are run by people. They’re not perfect. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many experts and resources available to help you. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guide also includes Ten Tips for Covering Voting, such as “Get to know your local election officials, now”; “Find out what keeps officials up at night”; and “Beware of words and labels, and how they’re used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide a step-by-step description of the voting process and story angles reporters might want to pursue, such as the implications of where polling places are located or how voter rolls are maintained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise reporters to get up to speed on local voting rules as quickly as they can and to learn the process firsthand so they can better inform the public and more easily identify misinformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also encourage them to press local officials to be open and transparent. And suggest that reporters talk to all parties involved, even those pushing dis- or misinformation, to better understand what’s happening with elections today.  </span></p>

							<h2>New Report on Election Official Turnover Rates</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Official Turnover Rates from 2000-2024<br />
</strong><em>Report finds turnover has increased from 2020, but LEOs are well-prepared for 2024</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshua Ferrer, Daniel M. Thompson, Rachel Orey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A growing chorus of government officials, media, and election observers are concerned that high turnover among election administrators might undermine smooth election operations and lead to lower confidence in the electoral process. Until now, however, we have not had sufficient understanding of just how high turnover rates are and how they have changed over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To answer these questions, the Bipartisan Policy Center partnered with Joshua Ferrer and Daniel M. Thompson of the University of California, Los Angeles, on a</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/election-official-turnover-rates-from-2000-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that explores election official turnover from 2000-2024. Our analysis draws on an original dataset of 18,644 local chief election officials across 6,290 jurisdictions in all 50 states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings from the report include:</span></p>
<p><strong> Election official turnover has been increasing steadily since 2000, with a slight uptick since 2020.<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the turnover rate has not increased smoothly in every cycle, the broad pattern is of rising turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the increase in turnover is not as dramatic as may be feared based on previous news headlines and recent reports. We find that turnover has grown from 28% in 2004 to 39% in 2022, a 38% increase. Although significant, the upward trend is slow. Most election officials continue to serve for more than four years and are prepared to successfully administer the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Turnover isn&#8217;t just a localized or temporary problem, it has roots in both long-standing and contemporary challenges.</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Turnover has increased over time, across geographic regions, across counties and municipalities, and in small and large jurisdictions for both elected and appointed election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has also increased in politically competitive and uncompetitive areas, in conservative and liberal jurisdictions, and across most individual states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election officials are well-prepared to administer the 2024 presidential election.</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While turnover was higher in 2022 than at any point over the past two decades, there are several counter-balancing factors that cement election officials’ readiness for 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">65% of local election officials have experience running a presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurisdictions that do have new officials will find that they’re often highly experienced: new election officials also have an average of eight years previous experience running elections, and that figure jumps to 11 years in large jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even where new officials might not have ample experience, training is there to fill the gaps. Forty-three states currently have statewide training available to election administrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing turnover is not confined to one geographic region or due to a state or region-specific cause, but rather is happening across all parts of the country. This calls for a unified, nationwide response that focuses on addressing both the chronic and emerging roots of turnover to build a resilient workforce in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The methodology, content, and recommendations of this report have been informed by BPC’s </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/ewac/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Workforce Advisory Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Force on Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

According to the report, across the country, residents and businesses have been reporting widespread slowdowns in mail and package delivery. The delays have become so persistent that members of Congress have gotten involved, urging the Postal Service to drastically correct course and raising concern about what impact the disruptions could have on mail-in ballots in the upcoming election. The delays appear to largely stem from a new system the Postal Service began rolling out last fall that will eventually funnel all the nation’s letters and packages through a consolidated network of 60 regional distribution centers — similar to the airlines’ hub-and-spoke model. The change is part of a wider $40 billion, 10-year</span><a href="https://about.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/delivering-for-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overhaul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the network that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has said will reduce costs, improve reliability and make the Postal Service more competitive. But in some instances, the plan has done the opposite, according to the Office of the Inspector General for the Postal Service, members of Congress and Postal Service advocacy groups. Mail delays have become so prevalent in Richmond, which implemented one of the first regional distribution centers in October, that Richmond General Registrar Keith Balmer told residents in February not to send their ballots for the March presidential primary by mail and to instead use one of three drop boxes in the city or to vote in person at an early voting location or a polling site on Election Day. For the upcoming election, Balmer said he will be strongly urging voters to use drop boxes. “I understand that these issues extend beyond mere inconvenience; they represent a fundamental threat to our democracy,” Balmer said in a</span><a href="https://twitter.com/RVA_Votes/status/1762149536686854625/photo/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post on Feb. 26. For the November election, the Postal Service said in a statement that it will “employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling and delivery of all Election Mail, including ballots.” During the November 2022 midterm elections, 98.96% of ballots sent by voters to election officials were delivered within three days, 99.82% were delivered within five days, and 99.93% were delivered within seven days, according to the Postal Service.</span></p>

Included in the lengthy breakdowns are people&#8217;s names, birthdates, complete street addresses and whether they voted or didn&#8217;t vote. The websites containing the information are affiliated with Lake Forest-based Local Government Information Services. The self-described &#8220;media watchdog&#8221; sites, like the company&#8217;s 11 print publications, operate under a variety of names depending on their location. The outlets are part of a network the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University has connected to businessman Brian Timpone, according to</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/27/republican-campaigns-local-news-lumen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Illinois State Board of Elections said publication of the information may have violated state election codes, but did not cite specific codes. No one responded to a request for comment from Local Government Information Services. The state board of elections has been receiving calls about the listings since they were published, Illinois State Board of Elections public information officer Matt Dietrich said. The state agency said it does not know how Local Government Information Services acquired the information, which appears to be a blend of 2016 and 2020 voter data. The information is available for purchase and non-commercial use by registered political committees.</span></p>

The 155-year-old museum, known for its has stepped up to serve as a polling station after locals pushed back on the use of a nearby school as a voting site. The museum will serve as a polling place from June 15 to June 23 during the early-voting period in state and congressional primary elections. The museum’s Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation will host the voting station, said Daniel Slippen, the museum’s vice president of government and corporate relations. In February, three local lawmakers wrote to the museum asking it to consider serving as a polling site, citing concerns that the nearby public school complex was ill-suited to the task. Since 2022, the school building’s cafeteria has hosted early voting, forcing students to relocate lunchtime to the hallways, according to the letter. The museum’s president, Sean Decatur, offered thanks to the three lawmakers for bringing the issue to the museum’s attention. In a statement, Decatur highlighted the museum’s past work as a public resource, including as a COVID vaccination site, and added that the museum is “excited about the opportunity” to help its neighbors “exercise their fundamental democratic right.”</span></p>

The stickers will be given out at the July 30 primary election and the Nov. 5 general election. “We received so many incredible submissions and much like our county’s elections, the top contestants were neck and neck,” Richer said. “That’s why I’ve decided that we will use both the first and second place designs giving us four new stickers for our upcoming elections.” Lauren Kneuss from Gilbert created the winning adult design, entitled “For a Brighter Tomorrow,” which earned more than 1,000 votes. Sarah Hurwitz from Phoenix designed “Gila Monster Voter,” the adult runner-up with nearly 700 votes. Brophy Prep student Jacob Petrine, 17, won the youth contest with his “Vote in the Desert&#8221; design, boasting more than 1,300 votes while Mesa Public Schools student Manuela Alvarez Sanchez, 14, was close behind with over 1,200 votes. Both students will receive pizza parties for their class. “I look forward to honoring our winners and am grateful to all who participated in the process,” Richer said.</span></p>

She was 73. &#8220;Her loss is devastating, because all the new people coming into politics just don&#8217;t have what she had. She was honest. She was straight. She didn&#8217;t have two stories. You could look her in the eye, and she had empathy for you,&#8221; said Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas. Yarbrough was serving her second term as Cook County clerk after first being elected to the position in 2018. She was known for her leadership in the West Side Proviso Township and previously served as a state representative for 11 years. Yarbrough&#8217;s family issued a statement, saying, in part, &#8220;so many of us stand on her shoulders and are actively walking pathways that she forged. As a public servant, she had the courage to stand in support of issues that were not always popular, but she knew them to be right.&#8221; As her colleagues cope with the loss, they told ABC7 it is no surprise that she continued to serve until she passed away. &#8220;It was her vision. It was her dream. It was what she always wanted to do. They say, &#8216;You die at work.&#8217; She died at work. She died doing what she wanted to do,&#8221; Pappas said. The functions of the clerk&#8217;s office are continuing, according to spokesperson Sally Daly, who said last week that Chief Deputy Clerk Cedric Giles is in charge of operations. &#8220;We have lost one of the brightest lights in the public service arena in Cook County and the State of Illinois and we will never be quite the same,&#8221; Giles said in a statement on Sunday. &#8220;Clerk Yarbrough brought a unique spirit, energy, and compassion to her role in public service, and she used those gifts to bring out the best in all of us. She will be missed beyond measure.&#8221; Yarbrough was a native of Washington, D.C. Her family came to Maywood in the early 1960s. She studied business management at Chicago State University and received her master’s in Inner City Studies from Northeastern Illinois University. Yarbrough leaves behind her husband and six children.</span></p>

If a felony is committed against an election official, which is motivated by an individual’s role as an election office, then they would be disqualified from voting. “I feel strongly that anyone who harms or attempts to harm election workers – the very individuals who facilitate the voting process – should be stripped of their right to vote the same as individuals who are convicted of the 48 felonies listed in the Felony Voter Disqualification Act,” said state Rep. Adline Clark, D-Mobile, the bill’s sponsor. That list in Alabama is called felonies involving “moral turpitude,” and include some of the most serious crimes of murder, rape, kidnapping, sexual abuse and torture, human trafficking, terrorism, child sex abuse, among other things. Clarke said the reason she is pitching the legislation is out of concern of safety and welfare of election officials. She and others are unaware of any election official in Alabama being harmed or threatened, adding that “I hope that will never happen.”</span></p>

The Assembly Elections Committee passed</span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2642"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assembly Bill 2642</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — written by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) Called the PEACE Act, it now heads to that chamber’s Judiciary Committee. A member of the Elections Committee, Berman said his bill would add civil protections for voters and poll workers. “This bill is a continuation of California’s pro-democracy efforts,” Berman said. Current law restricts firearms at polling sites. Berman’s bill would give people the ability to sue and seek damages if they’re threatened. Some Republicans on the Elections Committee raised transparency concerns over the bill. Assemblymember Tom Lackey, a Palmdale Republican, said he supports the idea of protections for elections workers. However, he argued that a democracy encourages transparency. He worried that a government worker might sue over someone filing a public records request.</span></p>

Two conservative house members</span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024A/bills/2024a_hr1006_01.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six articles of impeachment on April 4, claiming Griswold committed malfeasance in office and accusing her of failing to remain neutral on whether former president Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection and should be therefore barred from the state’s primary ballot. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to make a legitimate argument against this resolution that is wholly illegitimate. In fact, your own witness called it &#8216;ga-ga-wocka-wocka,’” said House Judiciary Committee vice chair Jennifer Bacon at the close of the six hour hearing. “But I&#8217;m going to try to make sense of what I have heard,” the Democrat who represents Denver continued. “There is a claim against Secretary of State Jena Griswold that she tried to take Trump off the ballot, but these claims are wholly made in fantasy. It is political theater. I will remind you again that SOS Griswold did not remove Trump from the ballot. In fact, members of the Republican Party did.” Four Republican and two independent voters </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/republican-voters-file-suit-to-keep-trump-off-colorados-primary-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colorado’s secretary of state in the District Court of Denver County in September 2023, angling to keep Donald Trump’s name off the primary ballot. The voters claimed Trump&#8217;s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election — culminating in his Jan. 6 speech — disqualify him from holding office under the Fourteenth Amendment. While the former president joined as an intervening party, the voters named Secretary of State Jena Griswold as a defendant on their lawsuit. Throughout the process, however, Griswold did not take a public stance on whether Trump should appear on the ballot, and instead committed to following the court’s orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5354" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Delaware</strong>: Lawmakers are working on legislation to </span><a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2024-04-08/bill-requiring-delaware-polling-locations-to-be-ada-compliant-awaits-full-house-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make sure all polling locations are ADA compliant </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">ahead of November’s general election. According to a report from the Community Legal Aid Society released last May, after assessing just over half of Delaware’s polling locations, 30% lacked accessible parking spaces. Additionally, the study found between three and 18% of polling places had problems with inaccessible routes from parking areas or inaccessible building entrances, non-compliant ramps, thresholds, doorways and door handles. State Rep. Bill Carson (D-Smyrna) is championing legislation to address these concerns. The legislation requires the Department of Elections (DOE) to make any necessary changes to ensure all polling locations are ADA compliant and allows anyone to file an administrative complaint with the department if they notice shortfalls. The bill cleared the House Administration Committee in March, and Carson hopes it will be heard in the House by the end of April, giving DOE ample time to make changes before November’s general election. The bill does provide certain exceptions for states of emergency or for circumstances in which no accessible polling place in a particular area is available. In these cases, the Election Commissioner would be required to provide the impacted voters with an alternative accessible polling place or other means for casting a ballot upon advance request.</span></p>

Andy Beshear </span><a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/04/05/beshear-vetoes-bill-outlawing-ranked-choice-voting-in-kentucky-but-thats-not-why/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that received a late addition to outlaw ranked-choice voting in Kentucky. However, Beshear singled out another provision in</span><a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/24rs/hb44.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 44</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the reason for the veto. That provision requires the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to annually furnish “lifetime Kentucky death records” to help the State Board of Elections clean up voter registration rolls. In his veto message, Beshear said “lifetime death records is not a real term used or understood by the Department of Vital Statistics, so such records cannot be supplied. Instead, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services already provides the State Board of Elections with monthly death records. Therefore, House Bill 44 is not necessary, as the existing policy already provides more information than the legislation.” The bill also requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to send a list of people who were excused from jury duty because they’re not U.S. citizens to the attorney general, the United States attorney of the appropriate jurisdiction and the State Board of Elections. The bill instructs the elections board to remove anyone on the list from the voter rolls within five days. Another provision prohibits the state from entering into any agreements that would require it to make efforts to register people to vote. The Senate adopted a committee substitute of the House bill that would outlaw ranked-choice voting, and the House concurred. However, several lawmakers objected that it was too early for Kentucky to ban ranked-choice voting.</span></p>

Under the bill, conviction for making such threats is punishable by up to three years in jail and/or a maximum fine of $2,500. The new law takes effect June 1.</span></p>

Steve Simasko, District 1 commissioner for the county board, said officials originally received a proposed resolution addressing concerns from the St. Clair County Republican Party, dated December of last year. But he said he’d found some of the nine-page document’s rhetoric too &#8220;verbose&#8221; and “incorrect from a legal standpoint.” So, instead, Simasko, who introduced the resolution, said a shorter one was drafted, just over two pages, encapsulating some of the broader election-related concerns — its statements describing support for existing local decentralized management of elections and transparency, as well as referencing an alleged erosion of public confidence with the use of some electronic voting methods. The original GOP resolution got much more detailed, referencing specific technologies and legal challenges in an outline of state and federal election concerns. Ultimately, the county board passed Simasko’s draft 6-1 with Commissioner Lisa Beedon, the body’s only Democrat, dissenting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3833" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Minnesota</strong>: Only five cities have </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/ranked-choice-voting-bill-in-minnesota/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their local elections, but some state lawmakers want to give more communities that option. But only cities with charters can authorize ranked choice voting through ordinance or by voter referendum, which is only 1% of the cities in Minnesota, said DFL Secretary of State Steve Simon. Minneapolis, St. Paul, St. Louis Park, Bloomington and Minnetonka vote this way for their local officials. A bill that advanced in a House committee Tuesday would give more the greenlight to implement ranked choice voting.  Supporters say this gives voters more of a say in who their elected leaders are and forces candidates to appeal to a broader set of the electorate in order to win. Last fall there was an effort in Minnetonka to repeal ranked choice voting only two years after a majority of voters approved it; that measure failed. The legislation at the capitol would also set statewide standards for ranked choice voting, so cities don&#8217;t diverge in how they implement it. Christina Scipioni, the city clerk in Bloomington, said all five cities with ranked choice voting in Minnesota have differences in how they administer elections. Ranked choice voting only applies to local races, not state, federal or presidential contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6131" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MS-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Mississippi</strong>: This year, again, lawmakers spent months debating bills that would have brought back </span><a href="https://boltsmag.org/mississippi-keeps-door-shut-on-ballot-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ballot initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the effort faltered for good last week.  A legislative deadline passed on April 2 that confirmed that all these bills are dead for the year. David Parker, a Republican senator who chairs a key committee, had indicated two weeks ago that the chamber was done considering the issue in 2024. As a result, Mississippi will spend at least one additional year with no initiatives, despite the state constitution’s promise that residents shall have a right to direct democracy. “We desperately need a citizen-driven process to put something on the ballot,” Charles Taylor, head of the Mississippi NAACP said. “Citizens being able to have the ability to exercise their rights, being able to impact law when possible, is crucial.” This year, Mississippi’s two legislative chambers each passed a bill to bring back initiatives. The House approved Concurrent Resolution 11 in January; it died in a Senate committee on Tuesday, which was the deadline for a bill originating in one chamber to get out of a committee in the other. The Senate, meanwhile, approved Senate Bill 2770 in March; a procedural motion killed it within days.</span></p>

Under the bill, that work could be done within three weeks of the elections. The bill would not allow those clerks to count the ballots or see voters’ choices. And the pre-processing dates would need to be posted for the public at least five days in advance.  Sponsored by Sen. Donna Soucy, a Manchester Democrat, the bill is meant to help alleviate an often-hectic environment for New Hampshire poll workers.  When voters cast absentee ballots, they do so with two envelopes. The outer envelope, known as the mailing envelope, contains another envelope known as  the affidavit envelope. That envelope contains the ballot. Absentee voters fill out an affidavit on the outside of the affidavit envelope. Under current law, election workers are not allowed to open the outer envelope until Election Day, meaning they are not allowed to review the voters’ affidavits ahead of time. That can create a backlog on voting day, and prevents town officials from alerting absentee voters ahead of time if there is an issue with their affidavit.</span></p>

Doug Steinhardt (R-District 23) has introduced legislation that would </span><a href="https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/10/senantor-dough-steinhardt-vote/73264359007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">give voters an extra hour to go to the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Steinhardt has proposed that polling places for the primary and general elections be open until 9 p.m., an hour later than the current 8 p.m. closing time. The polls would still open at 6 a.m. “This legislation would provide voters with additional time to cast their ballots on election day and during early voting periods, resulting in more convenience and flexibility for evening voters,” Steinhardt said. “The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and this legislation would help ensure that all voters can make their voices heard in our elections.”  The law would also add an hour to school board elections with minimum voting hours from 4 to 9 p.m. School boards would also have the option of opening polls at 6 a.m. The legislation would also extend the closing times for early voting sites by one hour for the primary and general elections. Designated early voting locations would be open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Municipal clerks’ offices would also be open an additional hour on Election Day to assist voters from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. In addition to polling hours, the bill would extend the time for which minors between 16 and 18 years of age, serving as poll workers, would be required to stop working. The current law states that these individuals are permitted to serve until 9 p.m., which would be extended one hour to 10 p.m. The bill has been referred to the Senate&#8217;s State Government, Wagering, Tourism &amp; Historic Preservation Committee.</span></p>

The proposed legislation, which has yet to be assigned to a committee, also focuses on security of individual voting machines and would require the state’s board of voting system examiners to contain a person with cybersecurity expertise and credentials.

It would also monitor software supply chain integrity, develop security practices and look at voting system developments. Also, the legislation would increase resources for county boards of election to improve voter list maintenance and require the state auditor to conduct a yearly statewide audit of the voter registration database and three randomly selected counties.</span></p>

The effort by Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson and Republican Sen. Paul Bailey to untangle the two rights has cleared early hurdles but several remain in the annual session’s expected final weeks. The proposal seeks to undo restrictions established in July, when election officials interpreted a state Supreme Court ruling as requiring people convicted of felonies to get their full citizenship rights restored by a judge, or show they were pardoned, before they can apply for reinstated voting rights. In January, the elections office confirmed that voting rights restoration would also require getting back gun rights. Since July, officials have approved 12 applications to restore voting rights and denied 135, according to the secretary of state’s office. In the seven months before, about 200 people were approved and 120 denied. The bill would allow a judge to restore someone’s right to vote separate from other rights, including those regarding guns, serving on a jury, holding public office and certain fiduciary powers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, a split House committee voted 8-6 to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-voting-rights-gun-rights-f8b2104bdce087e6d935b640aaf6f5e2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">send the bill to a summer study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before next year’s legislative session, effectively spiking it for 2024, barring some unusual move.</span></p>

The new law also provides criminal penalties to this act ranging from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class C felony for receiving payment for assisting in the distribution, filling out, delivering and ordering of absentee ballots applications. Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bill into law March 20, after supporting all actions to ban ballot harvesting during the State of the State address in February. The lawsuit was filed by Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, Greater Birmingham Ministries, League of Women Voters of Alabama and Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program. “SB1 is part of a concerning trend of anti-voter state legislatures restricting equal access to the ballot for voters with disabilities. These laws specifically target the individuals and organizations that voters with disabilities depend on to access, complete, and cast an absentee ballot. The League of Women Voters is actively challenging these laws and is committed to fighting voter suppression nationwide,&#8221; said Celina Stewart, chief counsel at the League of Women Voters of the United States. The organizations are arguing that the law harms those who need assistance with their absentee ballot applications, especially voters with disabilities and voters who are Black, elderly, incarcerated and of low-literacy. Allen&#8217;s office said he is unable to comment at this time since the matter is a pending federal court litigation in the Northern District of Alabama. “I am dedicated to ensuring fair, secure and transparent elections,&#8221; Allen said in a previous statement. &#8220;SB1 provides Alabama voters with strong protection against activists who profit from the absentee elections process. I stand firm in my support of SB1 because now, under Alabama law, Alabama votes are not for sale.”</span></p>

In a split decision, the three-judge panel noted that Hamadeh&#8217;s own attorney admitted to a judge that the evidence presented at his trial was insufficient to actually get a ruling that he had outpolled Democrat Kris Mayes. Appellate Judge David Gass, writing for the majority, acknowledged that Hamadeh later came back and claimed to have &#8220;newly discovered evidence&#8221; that should entitle him to a new trial. But Gass said that Hamadeh never really explained how any of this would have affected the final outcome to show that he lost to Mayes by 280 votes. The appellate court also said that Mohave County Superior Court Judge Lee Jantzen did not err in rejecting various requests by Hamadeh for information from Maricopa County, including a list of people who cast provisional ballots but whose votes were not counted. Here, too, Gass said Hamadeh failed either to act promptly or to show that any of this was relevant.</span></p>

A Pulaski County circuit judge dismissed AVII and Reynolds’ amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief last year.  The appellants argued that because voters can’t read barcodes on printed ballots and the voting machine tabulator only scans the barcodes, voters cannot verify their vote selections as required by Arkansas law. State law requires that voting machines permit voters to independently verify their ballots. Voters also must have the opportunity to change the ballot or correct an error before the ballot is cast. </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AR-Supreme-Court-Voting-Machine-Ruling.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing for the majority,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Associate Justice Courtney Rae Hudson pointed to testimony from Daniel Shults, former director of the State Board of Election Commissioners, that described how voters can review and change their votes on the machine prior to printing their ballot as justices’ reason for affirming the circuit court’s ruling.  “The voter-verification requirement in § 7-5-504 for the ‘voting machine’ is accomplished because the statute is not specific as to which device or step in the process that the ballot review must occur, as long as the voter has the opportunity,” according to the ruling.</span></p>

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were several individuals with visual impairments who normally vote either by mail with assistance or at in-person voting locations using accessible voting machines. Disability Rights Advocates, along with the plaintiffs, allege that California’s Vote-By-Mail program discriminates against blind individuals because it requires them to rely on an assistant to return their ballots, compromising the privacy and independence of their votes—a hallmark of voting in the United States. “The ability to vote independently should be a guaranteed right for all voters,” said Christopher Gray, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “However, because California fails to employ a fully accessible system of voting, this is not a guarantee for blind voters and others with print disabilities like me who must forgo their independence and privacy when engaging in a fundamental part of the democratic process—voting.” Although certain voters with print disabilities who have access to the required technology may receive, read, and mark their ballots independently using their county’s remote accessible vote-by-mail (“RAVBM”) system, there currently is no option in California for them to privately and independently return their ballots. Some of the plaintiffs have had to miss out on the benefits of the Vote-by-Mail Program and instead have voted at an in-person voting location. Despite the additional burdens of needing to take time off work or paying for transportation, the lawsuit says that is currently the only voting method that allows them to vote privately and independently. To comply with the lawsuit, plaintiffs are asking California to provide voters with print disabilities with an accessible electronic method for returning their vote-by-mail ballots (“e-return”). Fortunately, California already has a system in place for that method: ballot return by fax. Fax-based ballot returns are already available to certain California military and overseas voters.</span></p>

A federal trial began this week that will determine whether those obstacles violate the voting rights of immigrants who have already gone through the long process to become U.S. citizens. Defenders of Georgia’s registration laws say verification requirements are necessary to prevent noncitizen voting. Without verification, noncitizens could attempt to vote illegally, an attorney for the state said. An attorney for the state, Bryan Jacoutot, said election officials have an obligation to ensure that only citizens vote. The voter registration process requires extra steps for new U.S. citizens because federal immigration agencies don’t inform election officials when a resident earns citizenship. New citizens must either provide naturalization documents with their voter registration application, send papers to election offices, show citizenship information when they vote or present proof within three days of an election. They can also pay $32 to update their driver’s licenses to reflect that they have become U.S. citizens and then re-register to vote. There were roughly 4,000 Georgia voter registrations labeled as “pending” because of citizenship verification as of January, according to state records. </span></p>

McAffee ruled that the First Amendment doesn’t protect speech that is part of a crime – and that a jury must decide whether it was in Trump’s case. “The allegations that the Defendants’ speech or conduct was carried out with criminal intent are something only a jury can resolve,” McAfee wrote. Trump’s lawyer, Steve Sadow, had argued the charges should be dismissed because Trump was speaking about politics as president. Sadow argued that even if Trump made false statements as alleged in the indictment, he must be protected for a robust political debate.</span></p>

Last fall, a group of 11 Michigan lawmakers led by Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Allen, sued Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and state election officials, arguing that Proposal 3 of 2018 and Proposal 2 of 2022 should be invalidated because only the Legislature should be able to regulate the times, places and manner of federal elections. The two ballot initiatives brought no-reason absentee voting, in-person early voting and other election changes to Michigan, and both were supported by a wide majority of voters.  Attorneys for Whitmer, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Elections Director Jonathan Brater moved to dismiss the case, noting that the Legislature has already codified in state law nearly all of the constitutional changes outlined in both ballot proposals. Beckering agreed, finding the GOP lawmakers lacked standing for the court to move forward in considering the suit.  As individual lawmakers, they failed to prove any specific injury to themselves that would warrant a federal court taking up the case, Beckering ruled in a</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BxxKDi34XNz0ijhcA-Ll1N-4r6f2-B2d/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13–page opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  &#8220;Plaintiffs’ asserted injury — the deprivation of the power to cast a binding vote — is neither concrete nor particularized because it is shared by every single member of the Michigan Legislature,&#8221; Beckering wrote.</span></p>

Silva ruled Monday that the plaintiffs failed to allege a credible threat of prosecution and ruled that an injury cannot be hypothetical. Four Nevada residents filed a federal lawsuit in June 2023 against the Election Worker Protection Act, which makes it a crime for any person to threaten, intimidate, coerce or use any act of violence against an election official with the intent to interfere in an election. Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar had spearheaded the legislation, Senate Bill 406, during the 2023 legislative session and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed into law in May. The residents, who say they have worked as poll workers, argued that the new law is overbroad and vague and violates the First and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Silva dismissed the lawsuit in October 2023, finding that the plaintiffs failed to allege a threat of “imminent, credible harm” sufficient to grant standing, but gave the plaintiffs the opportunity to file an amended complaint, which they did in November. On April 8, Silva ruled that the plaintiffs again failed to allege a credible threat of prosecution. She found that they failed to demonstrate a basis to suggest enforcement is likely and that past prosecution has occurred. Because she had already given the plaintiffs a chance to amend the complaint and did not produce “serviceable” allegations, she dismissed the complaint without the opportunity to amend.</span></p>

The withdrawals came after a federal appeals court on April 3 said it would not block the lower court’s order. The appeal will still move forward because one party is still challenging the order: the Camden County Democratic Committee. “The right to association and have that association clearly identified on the ballot is equally important to both the candidates and the political parties,” said the committee’s attorney, Bill Tambussi. A spokesperson for Rep. Andy Kim (D-03) — who is leading the federal challenge to the county line — declined to comment. In a letter filed with the appeals court Thursday, attorneys for Kim said they would not oppose the clerks’ motions to withdraw from the appeal.

The</span><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ELN/8-308"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rule in question</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that “a write-in ballot cast in a party primary for a candidate not enrolled in such party shall be void and not counted.” In addition to raising concerns of constitutionality, the plaintiffs claim that this rule could allow party leaders to manipulate the way votes are counted by, for example, booting a candidate out of the party prior to a primary. In this instance, the plaintiffs claim that voters wouldn’t be able to cast votes for the now-partyless candidate — doing so would void their ballot. But a lower court denied the plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction, finding that candidates like Frentzel have ample opportunities to get on any party’s ballot, despite the provision. Additionally, it found that the potential burdens are justified by the state’s interest in preventing party raiding, a practice in which blocs of voters swap between parties to manipulate election outcomes. On April 4, the plaintiffs asked a panel of Second Circuit judges to revive their suit, claiming that the law denies them a number of constitutional rights.</span></p>

Wohl and Burkman were found liable last March of orchestrating a robocall campaign that reached about 5,500 predominantly Black New Yorkers in the summer of 2020. Targeted voters received automated calls — purportedly from a “civil rights organization” founded by Wohl and Burkman called “Project 1599” — that sought to dissuade them from mail-in voting. The messages included false warnings that mail-in voting would cause their personal information to be given to police departments and credit card companies. Under a settlement agreement, Wohl and Burkman must pay a $1 million judgment to the New York attorney general’s office, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and the individual plaintiffs who were harmed by their scheme. All three groups together filed a lawsuit against Wohl and Burkman in 2021.</span></p>

The plaintiffs, led by the NAACP, </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2024/04/10/aclu-appeal-naacp-undated-mail-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are appealing a March 27 ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and are seeking an opinion from the full court. A favorable outcome for the NAACP could prevent thousands of mail ballots from going uncounted this November, but it would not happen in time for the April 23 primary, the plaintiffs’ lawyers said. The panel’s 2-1 ruling found that a Pennsylvania law requiring mail voters to handwrite a date on the return envelope did not violate a provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that’s meant to protect voters from being disenfranchised. Marian Schneider, senior voting rights policy counsel at the ACLU of Pennsylvania, which is representing the plaintiffs, said the appeals court panel got the case wrong by narrowly interpreting the federal statute at issue as applying only to the voter registration process. “It cannot be that Congress meant for it to apply only to registration,” she said “Because the absurdity of that result is that you have people apply to register, but then after you register them, you can disenfranchise them for some immaterial errors.”</span></p>

During the one-hour hearing, Hoffman challenged South Dakota Canvassing’s lawyer, Steve Haugaard, to convince him why the latest lawsuit shouldn’t be dismissed based on res judicata – the legal doctrine that something can’t be re-litigated once it’s been judged on its merits. The loss on procedural grounds prevented Haugaard and South Dakota Canvassing Group from presenting evidence or witnesses about why the records they are seeking can be released under South Dakota public record laws. The first lawsuit, which was an appeal of an Office of Hearing Examiner decision, was dismissed in June. While that legal challenge was ongoing, South Dakota Canvassing Group made another request for voting machine records. </span></p>

In that ruling, Chief District Judge Robert Molloy declared some local election laws unconstitutional. The January ruling from Molloy voided eight provisions of the Virgin Islands Code, Title 18. Those sections were challenged by lawyers representing the Republican National Committee and members of the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Title 18 governs the way elections are carried out in the territory. Elections Supervisor Caroline Fawkes, head of the Election Systems of the Virgin Islands, and the Virgin Islands Board of Elections were the named defendants in the case. In the opinion issued prior to his judgment, Molloy cited claims by Republicans that portions of  Title 18 violated their First Amendment right to free association. “Plaintiffs claim that the said statutes impermissibly infringe their right to association by allowing Defendants control of matters concerning internal party operations,” the judge said. In the judgment that followed, Molloy declared Title 18, Sections 232, 303 (a) – (c ); a portion of Section 304, Section 305, 306 (a), 307, and 342 unconstitutional. The board approved a motion to ask Attorney General Ian Clement to challenge Molloy’s ruling. To do so, Clement would bring the case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</span></p>

What are lawmakers and election administrators thinking about now to prepare? Find out in this four-part series, hosted  by the National Conference of State Legislatures in partnership with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We’ll focus on the elections workforce; counting and recounts and more post-voting work; the voters’ perspectives and voter confidence. The election doesn’t end when the polls close. Counting (and confirming the count) comes next—along with reporting results and, sometimes, recounts. Join us for the second installment of NCSL’s four-part webinar series on election administration to learn about what happens after voting is over. U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Donald Palmer will consider how all states address these tasks that ensure accurate and verifiable results. <strong>When:</strong> April 12, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Assistance Commission Annual Board Meetings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) will hold two annual board meetings at the Fontaine Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri. The Standards Board will hold its annual meeting on April 17 and 18. The Board of Advisors will hold its annual meeting on April 18 and 19. The boards will join for combined panels on the morning of the 18th. During the Standards Board Annual Meeting, members will discuss communications, lessons from the presidential primaries, the impact of artificial intelligence on elections and mitigation tactics, and preparing for the general election. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. As part of the Board of Advisors Annual Meeting, members will learn about EAC agency developments, ethical standards for election administration, discuss elections administration in 2024, and more. The Board of Advisors is a 35-member board composed of representatives from various EAC stakeholder associations, federal government agencies, and Congress.  These meetings will not be live streamed but are open for the public to join in person. Media and members of the public interested in attending in person can register on the Standards Board Annual Meeting</span><a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.vTI5DAfbsaYguWqsNUNBttFHHXEmY-2BDCJG70n92MsD-2BR2f9uLICIxaSOs3yqjtNOgrWF6eGc9vrX-2BWKCjuZVUk-2Bv8TjnXlXQ-2FazxKXaTHC8QvNHVrirj4vK9IRNFOQ0yWL-2Bm0K7XK37dYF0agne7Fb0kcEyl9q3nDUG2e0-2FVtIU-3DAVV5_C6Knsj52BCpW11NxpmMJaBKdTkM0OBFhz03xpM9h4HYR6nlGHZrI5ACZOmmT-2BaqHmreuJ-2FlsFW8KbKLKE7LrO46k6m2Lj5uepkGDGgSI0UohJgq-2FuG1JiDXq0O4N98GMohQbB5OLCf45RXenpqHF60PEGb2XcWBy9g6Y-2BcmdvZ5FpxQ4VHBrrNSFNDa6N983YNJksPAZsRZc4-2BaeRbFxc-2BAMe-2BQBOiSut7yCQeYs4PzbX4KNmVw9fJ9LIYAWk-2Br8tGZQ6BbTboh9m5gqjIYVBI8q8OlvhY2azOhYLK54IEQrPBUo3Rcwey0bamsECDUtj3M1MQ6TGUKp3srUZQbPJyYgdj0bRbkPKBLCPuX6Sl-2FTnh-2B6ZDhbkEgECUin-2FsLb"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registration page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and on the Board of Advisors Annual Meeting</span><a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.vTI5DAfbsaYguWqsNUNBttFHHXEmY-2BDCJG70n92MsD-2FoAvPxo1p4ExrMqK-2BFZxYGrPkvJ5q3UZHCYHqBD4HLCRPSO3w1EDB7YTZE-2BsGYKrWPcQ5LykpYYSwl7KHh298Z5FPJTcjOqtECLb-2F-2B-2FvfKHQ-3D-3DIRzZ_C6Knsj52BCpW11NxpmMJaBKdTkM0OBFhz03xpM9h4HYR6nlGHZrI5ACZOmmT-2BaqHmreuJ-2FlsFW8KbKLKE7LrO46k6m2Lj5uepkGDGgSI0UohJgq-2FuG1JiDXq0O4N98GMohQbB5OLCf45RXenpqHF60PEGb2XcWBy9g6Y-2BcmdvZ5FpxQ4VHBrrNSFNDa6N983YNJksPAZsRZc4-2BaeRbFxc-2BAMe-2BQBOiSut7yCQeYs4PxSBgo5pookTz-2FlaSH0noe-2BUJ2Ip0D7GDnpMQFzNPM8WCckTeNv5LwcWQofs-2FpaYLBjpX-2BuVC-2FblFVpT1360RTpcPiXXDnpnpMPmUZTNrvwXA4Mn6bT036Piuts-2Fn7DS6uqFmSCyWDR6k5CaSKHVaYz"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registration page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <strong>When:</strong> April 17-19. <strong>Where:</strong> Kansas City, Missouri</span></p>

They are spread by authoritarian state actors and malign non-state actors bent on undermining and damaging free and liberty-loving republics. Unfortunately, most solutions come internally from social media platforms or rest with governments to devise. A new grassroots strategy is needed: bottom-up rather than top-down. That is why R Street Institute and George Mason University are holding an Idea-thon to address the problem and find new solutions. Teams will form to attack misinformation and disinformation from four tracks: government, business/technology, nonprofit, and education. Winning teams will receive prizes. Examples of work products include new legislation and regulations, a business plan for a tech start-up, a mobile app, an academic course, or a new nonprofit. Be creative! Software developers are needed, but no computer science skills are necessary to participate. Just bring your best ideas for combating misinformation and disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> April 20. <strong>Where:</strong> Fairfax, Virginia</span></p>

While abuse directed at federal officeholders grabs the headlines, a</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/intimidation-state-and-local-officeholders"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new Brennan Center report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals that intimidation aimed at state and local officials is distressingly common: 43 percent of state legislators, for example, have experienced threats within the past three years.  In addition to menacing public servants and their families, these threats have serious repercussions for representative democracy. Officeholders report being less willing to work on contentious issues like reproductive rights and gun control and more reluctant to continue serving. Additionally, intimidation is often targeted at groups already underrepresented in government, such as women and people of color. Panelists Gowri Ramachandran, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, Florida State Rep. Anna Eskamani, and former Nevada State Assemblymember Tom Roberts will be joined by moderator Deirdre Walsh of NPR. New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who herself has experienced threats of violence, will also deliver remarks. <strong>Where:</strong> April 30, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
