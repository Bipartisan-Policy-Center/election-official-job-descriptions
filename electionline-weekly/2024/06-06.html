							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Harnessing Fire</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing election officials for AI</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Noah Praetz, President, The Elections Group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology began with stones used as hammers and knives 3 million years ago; then – 1 million years ago – the power of fire was harnessed; and since, change has rapidly sped through the explosions of the Industrial Revolution and on toward the current blistering pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11415" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Election-Administrators_Page_01-232x300.png" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Election-Administrators_Page_01-232x300.png 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Election-Administrators_Page_01-791x1024.png 791w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Election-Administrators_Page_01-768x994.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Election-Administrators_Page_01-1187x1536.png 1187w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Election-Administrators_Page_01-1583x2048.png 1583w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />Today, we look forward to a new frontier of inconceivable innovation as we’re trying to understand artificial intelligence (AI). Every technology has been used to solve problems – and create new ones. AI is no different. Organizations that can harness it to solve problems will reap great efficiency gains. However, they must also be aware of new problems and prepare to manage those risks, like our ancestors did when first they played with fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so with AI we move down two tracks: one of exploration, and one of caution.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prudently, we embrace the cautious track first, as we are regularly and rightfully advised to prepare for the problematic uses of AI. In “</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-election-officials-can-identify-prepare-and-respond-ai-threats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Election Officials Can Identify, Prepare for, and Respond to AI Threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a report The Elections Group co-authored with the Brennan Center for Justice and the Institute for the Future, readers dive into risk management while exploring a variety of scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether prophetic or timely clickbait, everything we advise about AI in the report supports election security best practices, useful to us all even if AI worries flame out like a firework dud. Recommendations include understanding what AI can do; preparing for rapid response communications; adopting cyber and physical security best practices; building and strengthening relationships with media; and preparing legal support networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploration – the second track – is much more exciting, and it’s important that malicious actors are not the only ones testing and using AI tools. The efficiency gains will one day be enormous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/?post_type=resource&amp;p=1497&amp;preview=true&amp;utm_source=electionline+june+6+2024&amp;utm_medium=online+newsletter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative Artificial Intelligence for Election Administrators: An Introduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” offers resources to help election officials understand how large language models and image generators work and evaluate whether and how they can support the day-to-day work of running elections. The Elections Group partnered with civic technologist Kathryn Peters to produce this report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10807" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-300x174.png" alt="" width="300" height="174" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-300x174.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-1024x595.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-768x446.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7-1536x892.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TEG-Logo-Green-7.png 1549w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The guide notes that “good implementations of technology share two important features: most importantly, they solve real problems for the people who use them.“ The guide also provides context on how governments are deploying AI, demonstrations and test uses in elections, and a framework for imagining and prioritizing what needs AI might address in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the guide aims to empower election administrators to make informed decisions about using AI to enhance their operations while maintaining the integrity and security of the process they’re entrusted with administering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s preparing for new threats or testing new solutions and timesavers, these reports provide the starting points for election officials to approach artificial intelligence proactively. Good luck to us all as we cautiously explore this new frontier.</span></p>

The Elections Group is eager to be thought partners with election officials in this new, exciting and sometimes scary space.</span></p>

							<h2>2024 Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9073" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Voters in Iowa, the District of Columbia, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota head to the polls, drop boxes and mailboxes this week to complete their 2024 primary voting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The District of Columbia conducted its first election where </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/03/dc-election-workers-noncitizen-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noncitizens had the right to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in local races. While there were no reports of issues on Tuesday, prior to the election, election workers fielded angry calls and emails for more than a month from people who oppose allowing noncitizen residents to vote in local elections. Monica Evans, the executive director of the D.C. Board of Elections told The Washington Post that employees were encouraged to cover up any D.C. Board of Elections paraphernalia they may be wearing or holding while outside the office in case someone who opposes noncitizen voting directs their opinion toward a staffer. D.C. police spokesman Tom Lynch said in a statement before the election that officers would be near polling locations “ensuring safety for voters.” Other than the news about the noncitizens it was a relatively smooth day in DC, although there was one report of a </span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/elections/dc-primary-voter-says-ballot-box-closed-early/65-3d18ccbd-2619-4307-8856-d9bf4f6d8767"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop box being locked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 minutes before polls closed at 8pm. An election worker was on site and accepted the ballots from the people, about five, that showed up to drop their ballots. Evans thanked all the excellent election workers and volunteers for their hard work but told WUSA9 it was the first time the election worker was assigned to that particular position. &#8220;He got a little ahead of himself, moved quickly and arrived as directed at 7:45, but locked the ballot box,&#8221; Evans explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a good look and we take full responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2024/06/04/its-disheartening-its-costly-election-officials-expecting-lower-turnout-2024-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went to the polls (or mailboxes) this week and there were no reports of any issues, even following recent extreme weather. Turnout did seem to be down however. “It’s way, way down,” Travis Wiepert, Johnson County auditor, said. “It’s disheartening, and it’s costly,” Weipert said. “We have to pay our poll workers to be there all day, and we have to take all the equipment out there, all the ballots for nobody to show up.” Poll workers in the </span><a href="https://ktvo.com/news/local/se-iowa-poll-workers-encourage-more-folks-to-take-on-the-civic-duty"><span style="font-weight: 400;">City of Outtuma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took primary day as an opportunity to recruit for November. Kathy Wilson, who has been a poll worker off and on for the past ten years, explained the current need for more workers. “Well, I just think it&#8217;s a good civic duty,&#8221; said Wilson. &#8220;You know, and they do need, They do need help. I think over the years, they&#8217;ve had many people that, did it year after year after year. And many people have retired and gotten older and they just needed some new faces and needed help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a quiet day in </span><a href="https://flatheadbeacon.com/2024/06/04/voters-head-to-the-polls-for-montana-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Early Tuesday morning, election officials reported a slow trickle of voters arriving to cast ballots.  “It’s a little slower than we thought it would be,” Grant Mounteer, chief election judge for precinct 22, told the Beacon at First Baptist Church in Whitefish.  Mounteer thinks turnout for the primary may be low due to a lack of ballot initiatives and high-profile federal races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In one county in New Jersey there were no reports of problems on Tuesday, but during early voting a few issues arose. A coding glitch meant that some voters got incorrect ballots in </span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/local/ess-coding-glitch-gives-wrong-ballots-to-some-cape-may-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cape May County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  “There was an issue with the voting machines as far as what came up on the screen,” said Deputy Attorney General Karen Catanese.  “There was a coding issue, and so instead of Wildwood Crest coming up, Wildwood came up.  As soon as that was realized, the board took action and called ES&amp;S.  They worked it out, figured out what the issue was, and it was resolved within the next day.” Also, in </span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/local/1803-mail-in-ballots-in-atlantic-county-were-opened-four-weeks-ago/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantic County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a judge will decide on June 7 what to do with more than 1,800 mail ballots that were opened too soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://ladailypost.com/new-mexico-secretary-toulouse-oliver-remarks-on-successful-2024-primary-election-provides-information-on-election-results-and-canvass-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was business as usual this week. “Another successful New Mexico Primary Election is in the books and I appreciate every voter who took the time to cast their ballot and make their voice heard,” Secretary Toulouse Maggie Toulous Oliver said. “I want to thank all the county clerks and their staff, the poll workers, our vendors, and our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners for their professionalism in helping to ensure the smooth conduct of this election.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest news out of </span><a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/briefs/voters-reject-tabulator-ban-hand-counting-elections-counties-south-dakota/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday was that voters in three counties voted against petitions that would have moved the counties to hand counts. The votes were in Gregory, Haakon and Tripp counties. The unofficial election results from the Secretary of State’s Office: Gregory County, 587 votes (54%) against the petition and 509 (46%) in favor; Haakon County, 276 (61%) against the petition and 177 (39%) in favor; and Tripp County, 734 (57%) against the petition and 553 (43%) in favor. Nearly 40% of registered voters turned out for the Gregory County primary election. Auditor Julie Bartling is confident the results reflect how all voters across the county would have voted. “They listened to the pros and cons, and I believe this vote shows they still have confidence in the tabulators and the work we do here in the auditor’s office,” Bartling said Tuesday night. “We’re a small county and we know each other. You just want people to have a sense they can Also in South Dakota, precinct boards in </span><a href="https://www.thedakotascout.com/p/165-absentee-ballots-cast-in-minnehaha"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnehaha County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were split on whether absentee ballots associated with mail forwarding services should have been counted during South Dakota’s primary election. Precinct boards at two Sioux Falls polling places received formal challenges to absentee ballots cast in their jurisdictions on the grounds that those voters do not meet voter registration requirements.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5938" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WYWelcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WYWelcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WYWelcome-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WYWelcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Drop Boxes</strong>: This week, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray sent a letter to county clerks </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/gray-urges-wyoming-to-ditch-ballot-drop-boxes-clerks-say-theyre-safe-legal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging local election officials to ditch drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead of absentee voting beginning next month, going as far to say that drop boxes are illegal under state statute.  “I do not believe drop boxes represent a safe, secure, or statutory basis for absentee voting,” Gray wrote in a Wednesday</span><a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SoS_Letter_re_Drop_Boxes_Executed.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to county clerks. “For this reason, they should not be used in the 2024 Election and beyond.” While Gray’s letter may be strongly worded, it likely amounts to just that since it’s up to county clerks to decide whether to use drop boxes. The County Clerks’ Association of Wyoming reiterated that discretion in response to Gray’s letter.  “We hold that the use of ballot drop boxes as a method of ballot delivery is safe, secure and statutorily authorized,” the association</span><a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CCAW-Drop-Box-response.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its response. Wyoming’s election code specifies that absentee ballots shall be “mailed or delivered to the clerk,” but Gray interprets that differently than his predecessor.  “The plain language of the statute, which strikes a balance between allowing voters to conveniently cast their votes and maintaining the security and integrity of the early voting process, does not authorize delivery of an absentee ballot to inanimate object, such as an unstaffed ballot drop box,” Gray wrote in his letter. In some instances, however, the election code leaves decisions up to locally elected officials, the clerks’ association said in its response, pointing to electronic pollbooks, election equipment, vote centers, precinct boundaries and absentee ballot processing. Drop boxes are another example, according to the association.  “The voices of our constituents as a whole help guide our decisions on this, and many other, important election administration decisions,” the association wrote. “Our great state offers a myriad of differences from one corner to the next and for that reason a blanket solution does not always serve those distinct populations in the most practical manner.”</span></p>

Before the Act was approved by Congress on June 2, 1924, a patchwork of statutes and treaties already offered about two-thirds of Native Americans citizenship, sometimes in exchange for land allotments that fractured reservations, gestures of assimilation, military service and even the renunciation of tribal traditions. The one-sentence Indian Citizenship Act swept away those requirements in an attempt to grant citizenship to all Native Americans. However, citizenship did not mean a right to vote for all Native Americans. While passing the Act, Congress deferred to state governments qualifications on who qualified to vote. Legal access to the ballot was denied under existing state constitutional provisions and</span><a href="https://www.slchistory.org/2022/01/utah-was-one-of-last-states-to-fully.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 1948 in Arizona and New Mexico — and until 1957 on reservations in Utah. One hundred years later, some states like </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/native-americans-voting-rights-ed175f6bbdc1b3a078bd675be8ac0b04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which approved the Native American Voting Rights Act in 2023, are still working to better enfranchise Indigenous voters. In </span><a href="https://www.kpax.com/indiancountry/aclu-montana-holds-event-for-100-year-anniversary-of-indian-citizen-act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the anniversary of the Act’s passage, the ACLU of Montana held a gathering in Missoula that featured a screening of the documentary Indigenous Voting Rights in Montana, highlighting the struggles and efforts to make voting easier for native communities. Executive Director Akila Deernose says this event was not a celebration of the anniversary but a celebration of voting. “Their ability to keep fighting for the right to vote and securing the right to vote is really important,” Deernose said. &#8220;Especially this year as an election year where the power to shape the future we all want to see full of equity and democracy for all that’s the power that the vote has so we want to recognize that and celebrate it.”</span></p>

The interns will advise localities about where they can shore up electronic defenses. “Seek to understand, then be understood,” said Susan Beals, Virginia’s elections commissioner, referring to the importance of listening to other people’s ideas and feelings before providing input. The funding for the internship program comes from the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity program, a National Security Agency initiative. Potential problems with voting might come in the form of breaches of voter rolls or computerized balloting systems, or from other hacks to sensitive information.  Students, in that regard, can make a big difference, Beals said. They are not perceived as the state hovering over local efforts. The students are there to learn. In exchange, they share with the local officials what they know about the latest cybersecurity practices.  She advised students to keep their cool in what may be an intense work setting. Leave political leanings at home and remember that most problems during elections are simply human errors, she said.  She noted that she makes a point to visit local registrars’ offices before each election, but that the internship program has been a good return on investment as a supplemental effort. In all, it takes about 20,000 people to conduct an election in Virginia, she said. The program also has paid off for students. For example, one of the interns who participated last year was hired full-time by the election locality where she interned. Localities voluntarily participate, with several having returned again this year. Professor Jack Davidson, director of UVA’s Cyber Defense Program of Study, has worked with faculty from across the Commonwealth to provide the Virginia Cyber Navigator program to computer science undergraduates and voting communities for all three years of the grant. “Students will be drawing on this experience for years to come,” Davidson said.</span></p>

Additionally, the bill would provide just $20 million in funding for the Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency responsible for managing the grants and testing and certifying voting machine standards. That figure is $114 million less than requested levels for fiscal year 2025 and $7.7 million less than what it received in 2024. On June 5, lawmakers advanced the measure in a party-line vote of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee of the full House Appropriations Committee. During a markup of the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill, ranking subcommittee member Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the appropriations process was not done in a bipartisan manner and expressed his belief that “this bill is going nowhere” in its current form, as Democrats intend to block it with their control of the Senate and White House. Despite the proposed cuts, an official at the EAC told CyberScoop that agency officials aren’t panicking, given that the measure is almost certain to be blocked by congressional Democrats. </span></p>

The main purpose of HB100, by Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, was to provide enhanced penalties for crimes committed against poll workers and other election officials. The bill came in response to the rise in threats to poll workers and election officials since the 2020 presidential election. In addition to the enhanced penalties, HB100 defined crimes against election officials as crimes of moral turpitude, a designation that means those convicted are disqualified from voting in Alabama. “Individuals who commit one of the crimes of moral turpitude listed in the Felony Voter Disqualification Act will lose their right to vote,” Clarke said in a statement. “It stands to reason that if someone commits a serious crime against an election official, thereby interfering with the election process, that person ought to lose their own voting rights.” But before passing the bill, lawmakers amended it to define six more felonies as crimes of moral turpitude, plus four categories of felonies for “inchoate” crimes, such as attempted crimes and conspiracies. Rep. Jim Hill, R-Moody, proposed the amendment to add to the list of moral turpitude crimes. Hill said the office of Secretary of State Wes Allen asked him to sponsor the amendment, and he supported the idea. Clarke did not oppose Hill’s amendment on the House floor. The House approved the amendment without a dissenting vote and then approved the bill 95-0. The Senate approved it 31-0 and Gov. Kay Ivey signed it into law. The law will take effect Nov. 6, one day after the general election, according to the secretary of state’s office. That’s because of a constitutional amendment Alabama voters approved in 2022 that says laws affecting elections cannot change within six months of an election.</span></p>

That’s because of a last-minute amendment added to a broad bipartisan election bill awaiting Gov. Jared Polis’ signature. The provisions would create a major barrier to a proposal to alter Colorado’s primaries so candidates of all parties run against each other, with the top four vote-getters advancing to a ranked choice general election.  Now, proponents of the election overhaul, who were unaware of the big hurdles created by</span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-210"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 210</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until they were contacted this week by The Colorado Sun, are demanding that Polis veto the legislation. County clerks and opponents of the voting changes are demanding that he sign it.  Amid the growing pressure campaign, the governor won’t say whether he will sign or veto the measure, which would require ranked-choice voting to be tested in 12 municipalities before it could be used statewide. He has until June 7 to decide. “The governor is reviewing the final version of the bill,” said Shelby Wieman, a spokesperson for Polis.</span></p>

Louisiana is the fifth state to ban RCV in 2024 and 10th to do so overall. All 10 states to ban RCV have done so with a Republican controlled legislature.  The new law states: “A ranked-choice voting or instant runoff voting method shall not be used in determining the election or nomination of any candidate to any local, state, or federal elective office in this state.” The legislation makes an exception for military and overseas voters who use ranked ballots for general elections in which there may be a runoff. B 101 passed the House of Representatives 73-23 on May 15, with all Republicans voting for passage and all but three Democrats voting against. It then passed the Senate 29-8 on May 20 with all Republicans voting to pass the bill and all but one Democrat voting against.  Landry signed the bill into law on May 28 and the new law took effect immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Legislature abandoned its attempt to repeal a 2021 law that has made the </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/05/election-deniers-stop-repeal-of-louisianas-burdensome-voting-machines-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task of buying voting machines </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">overly burdensome. </span><a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=247049"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 856</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, died just one step shy of final passage during the closing days of the 2024 legislative session after Johnson ended conference committee negotiations. The proposal would have repealed parts of a 2021 law that added multiple layers of bureaucracy to the Louisiana Department of State’s process to purchase new voting systems. The most significant parts of the bill were created through a late-stage amendment adopted on the Senate floor last week. In an interview with the Louisiana Illuminator, Johnson said he decided to sideline the bill after some constituents and other lawmakers expressed concerns with the “process” used to amend the bill into its final version. Johnson’s legislation began as a simple one-page bill to add a short clause to an existing statute, making the secretary of state responsible for all “voting system maintenance and repair.” That version of the bill sailed through both chambers without opposition. It was at a May 8 Senate &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee hearing when lawmakers hinted at the possibility of an amendment. Had the bill become law, the process of buying voting machines would still be subject to oversight from the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget. The vetting and solicitation process would have still included the public input through the Voting System Commission and the Voting System Proposal Evaluation Committee. Also, the bill would have retained requirements that vendors disclose their investors, including any foreign sources of financial support, Watson said.  “It is unfortunate that some groups were dishonest in their opposition to much-needed reforms to current law,” Joel Watson, spokesman for Secretary of State Mary Landry said..  Although he sidelined the bill, Johnson said he still supports the changes it proposed and intends to work on the issue again next year.</span></p>

It’s called the </span><a href="https://www.weny.com/story/50871292/a-bill-to-enhance-voter-registration-makes-progress-in-albany"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced Automatic Voter Registration</span></a> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S8752/amendment/A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The legislation would provide for automatic voter registration for people applying for certain Department of Motor Vehicles documentation and Medicaid enrollees. Voters would be given the opportunity to decline or opt out of the registration, but the default would keep eligible voters in order to maximize voting access and participation. Some Republican lawmakers expressed concerns about the legislation. “ “To mandate it and require that person be registered to vote, maybe they don’t want to be registered to vote. To make it mandatory rather than optional, I have a concern with,” said Sen. Tom O’Mara (R-Big Flats). While some Democrats said improving the automatic voter registration system is a way to improve voter participation in the state. The bill passed the Senate late on June 5 and now heads to the Assembly. </span></p>

Each of the bills, sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairwoman Dawn Euer and Rep. June S. Speakman on behalf of Secretary of State Gregg M. Amore, now goes to the other chamber for consideration. The legislation (</span><a href="http://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText24/HouseText24/H7664A.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024-H 7664A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText24/SenateText24/S3058.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024-S 3058</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) would codify a clear process for local boards of canvassers to immediately notify the State Board of Elections if there is a specific pattern of forgery or fraud involving signatures on a local, state or federal candidate’s nomination papers. The legislation is a response to nomination papers submitted in the 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> congressional district race last summer that included purported signatures of numerous deceased individuals. A paid signature gatherer hired by a contractor has been charged in the case. Under the legislation, the Board of Elections would issue a written determination of whether there is an instance of forgery and whether a candidate would qualify on the ballot regardless of forgery allegations. This legislation would take effect in 2025. The Board of Elections — which already carried out a similar process when forgery was suspected on nomination papers for presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy — is in the process of creating rules and regulations on this issue to ensure there is a process in place for this summer’s signature period. Still, codifying it into state law would provide clarity, permanence and provide the public with confidence in the election system.</span></p>

The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks an injunction to compel Fontes to follow existing state procedures to ensure there are no dead or out-of-state individuals on the state&#8217;s voter rolls. It also requests an injunction to design &#8220;reasonable and effective&#8221; procedures to ensure the voter list complies with the federal National Voter Registration Act. Fontes&#8217; office declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The lawsuit was filed by Scot Mussi, president of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club; Gina Swoboda, the chair of the Republican Party of Arizona; and Steve Gaynor, a voter and an unsuccessful candidate for the GOP nomination for Arizona secretary of state in 2018. The complaint revolves around repeated admissions from the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office in reports to legislative leaders that the process for cleaning up the voter lists is &#8220;in development.&#8221; That lack of a clear process, the lawsuit charges, has allowed as many as 35,000 deceased Arizonans to remain on the rolls, based on an analysis the plaintiffs did that covered two years&#8217; worth of data ending in late November 2022.</span></p>

Petitioners asked the Arkansas Supreme Court to independently certify the legal sufficiency of the measures’ ballot titles and popular names and order them placed on the November 2024 ballot. They also asked the state’s high court to declare unconstitutional two laws — one that requires the attorney general to approve proposed ballot measures and one that requires petitioners to gather signatures from 50 counties instead of 15, as specified in the Arkansas Constitution. The latter law is being challenged in court separately by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas. </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds_v._Thurston.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing for the majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Associate Justice Rhonda Wood said the constitution gives the state Supreme Court original jurisdiction over sufficiency of ballot titles, so the question is not whether the court has original jurisdiction, but rather when it can be exercised.  “While we have ‘original’ jurisdiction, we exercise that jurisdiction only after the Secretary of State has made a sufficiency determination,” Wood wrote. “As a result, we cannot act under this jurisdiction until the Secretary of State has acted.” With regard to ruling on the constitutionality of the two state laws, Wood said the lawsuit was a request for declaratory relief, which falls outside the court’s original jurisdiction. “While we recognize it would be helpful to have a determination of the constitutionality of both these statutes on the front end, that process could have occurred by filing a declaratory-judgment action in the circuit court,” Wood wrote. “… circuit courts have original jurisdiction over declaratory-judgment actions, and we have appellate jurisdiction. Our jurisdiction derives from the Arkansas Constitution, and it grants this court limited original jurisdiction. We cannot expand it.”</span></p>

In its latest findings, the grand jury said elections officials did not violate state election codes when they told observers last fall that they did not have the ability nor the authority to challenge ballot signatures. “The investigation found that the elections officials adhered to the requirements of the relevant sections of the California Elections Code. This code allows observers to view the verification process, with limitations,” the grand jury stated in part in a report released this week.

The ballot language the council approved is: “Shall the city of Santa Ana city charter be amended to allow, by the November 2028 general municipal election, noncitizen city residents, including those who are taxpayers and parents, to vote in all city of Santa Ana municipal elections?” In a lawsuit filed with the county’s Superior Court, James V. Lacy, a local attorney, along with the United States Justice Foundation, the California Public Policy Foundation and Pasquale Talarico, a Santa Ana resident, argue that adding the wording “including those who are taxpayers and parents” could influence the outcome of the election. Knill agreed and ordered Santa Ana City Clerk Jennifer Hall and OC Registrar or Voters Bob Page to grant the relief sought by petitioners or appear before court on June 16 to make the case for not doing so.</span></p>

This means that Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who had planned to move forward on the case, may have to wait until it is sent back to him. The appeals court is considering whether to remove Willis and her office from the case because of her romance with the outside attorney she hired as a Trump special prosecutor. The court is also weighing an appeal by the DA’s office which wants to reinstate six of the criminal counts in the racketeering indictment which McAfee dismissed. The appeals court, if it agrees to hold oral arguments, has indicated it will do so some time in the fall, and it must issue its decision by mid-March. Because none of the defendants had requested a stay, this means the appeals court decided on its own to issue the stay, leading some observers to speculate the court may ultimately reverse McAfee’s decision and disqualify Willis and her office.</span></p>

According to the court filing, Buff brought the suit against the county pursuant to “The Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act.” Buff alleges she was “constructively discharged, as defined by Montana Code Annotated 39-2-903 (1) by the county on March 24, 2023.”  The code states that “constructive discharge” means the voluntary termination of employment by an employee because of a situation created by an act or omission of the employer which an objective, reasonable person would find so intolerable that voluntary termination is the only reasonable alternative. She also alleges that acts and omissions by the county were “malicious.” Buff is seeking compensation for lost wages and other benefits as well as punitive damages. Buff was one of three county employees who submitted letters of resignation on March 24, 2023. Former county Clerk and Recorder Robin Benson and Buff’s assistant, Amanda Eckart, also submitted their letters that day. Benson and Eckart are not part of the suit. Eckart works in the Clerk of District Court office. In Buff’s suit, she contends the county subjected her to acts and omissions which she found so intolerable that, “voluntary termination of her employment was the only reasonable alternative.” The suit also alleged that the acts and omissions by the county were material violations of express provisions of its own written personnel policy. Benson, in her resignation letter, wrote that, “There is zero respect or even common courtesy from commissioners to county election employees or myself. My job has never been political, both on the clerk and recorder side and especially elections. Now, politics is being shoved down my throat and I refuse to comply with someone else’s world view.”</span></p>

It seeks to stop USPS from moving ahead with its plan until it&#8217;s submitted to the Postal Regulatory Commission so that Washoe County can oppose it. The commission is an independent body that oversees USPS operations. “Northern Nevada voters, many of whom rely on the Postal Service to deliver their ballots, have the power to determine outcomes of statewide elections,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit mentions that Catherine Cortez Masto beat Adam Laxalt by just 8,000 votes, with more than 160,000 mail-in ballots cast in counties whose mail is handled at Reno’s Vassar Street USPS facility. “A different outcome in Nevada’s Senate race would have impacted the function of the entire U.S. Senate,” the court filing states. “If Northern Nevada’s mail ballots had been processed in Sacramento instead of Reno, there is a substantial likelihood that mail ballots would have been delayed and thus not counted.” The lawsuit lists weather delays on Interstate 80 over Donner Pass that could’ve delayed ballots if they had to go to Sacramento for processing before coming back to Nevada, as called for in the USPS’ “Delivering for America” restructuring plan.</span></p>

The</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24728702/2fl8l0-nevada_1717427366.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced this week and filed in Carson City District Court by lawyers also representing the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Nevada GOP, hinges on April testimony from Mark Wlaschin, the deputy secretary of state for elections, who said the office accepts and counts ballots received in the mail up to three days after Election Day, even if it does not have a clear postmark. State law requires all mail ballots to be postmarked by Election Day in order to be counted, but allows for mail ballots that have a postmark with a date that “cannot be determined” and received within the three days following Election Day to be counted. The suit alleges that the state is too broadly interpreting this law by also counting received mail ballots that are not postmarked at all. “It is therefore possible, if not probable, that mail ballots deposited in the mail after election day could arrive at mail-ballot processing facilities within the three-day deadline, and under Deputy Secretary Wlaschin’s erroneous legal interpretation, those untimely ballots would be counted if they do not bear a postmark,” the lawsuit states. The suit requests that a judge order the state to not count any ballots that lack a postmark received after Election Day. An RNC press release also said “we have discovered that Nevada election officials routinely count non-postmarked mail ballots received after Election Day,” but again did not provide any examples. A spokesperson for the secretary of state’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit, but provided a</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24733377/2024-015-indeterminate-postmark-vfinal.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the office sent to local election officials last week about the interpretation of that state law. </span></p>

The federal court challenge has to do with ballot access for people with disabilities. State lawmakers placed strict limits on who can return an absentee ballot as part of a 2022 law that requires Ohioans present a photo I.D. to vote. The attorneys general from Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C. signed on to the amicus brief challenging Ohio’s law. The provisions make it a felony for anyone other than a postal worker or a specific list of relatives to return or possess another person’s absentee ballot. “Every eligible voter who wants to vote should be able to do so — full stop,” D.C.’s Attorney General Brian Schwalb wrote in a press release. “Ohio’s law violates this fundamental democratic principle by creating unnecessary obstacles that will make it harder for millions of people to cast a ballot — and disproportionately harms voters with disabilities,” he added. “This law does nothing to improve election security and instead is simply un-democratic and un-American.” The brief is quick to acknowledge Ohio isn’t alone in restricting third party ballot assistance. A handful don’t allow any outside help at all, and most states, like Ohio, place limits on who can return a person’s ballot. But the AGs argue Ohio is an outlier because it doesn’t provide flexibility for people who face legitimate barriers in accessing the ballot box.</span></p>

Linhardt that two voters are not entitled to a forensic audit of the November 2020 presidential election in the county. The panel in a decision issued this week also addressed the issue of when election boards must report suspicious voter circumstances to the district attorney. Linhardt last July found there is no provision in the state Election Code compelling the board of elections through an independent third party to conduct the audit requested by Richard Houser and Catherine Burns.He further found the two did not strictly adhere to the statutory requirements for contesting an election after the results are certified. Lacking, according to Linhardt, was a petition of at least 100 electors who voted in the election and a verification affidavit signed by at least five of them. The Commonwealth Court panel adopted Linhardt’s opinion on the audit but did address the reporting of suspicious voter circumstances that he did not.</span></p>

With easy access to generative artificial intelligence (AI) at their disposal – and zero accountability for social media platforms hosting and promoting deepfake content – these rogue actors are ready to flood the information environment and make it exponentially harder for the average voter to determine fact from fiction. Election officials across the country are bearing the brunt of this toxic information environment, having to expand their responsibilities into correcting false information and monitoring threats of physical violence. Instead of helping local election officials, social media companies have actively reduced the capacity of these frontline democracy workers to flag mis-, dis-, and malinformation on their platforms. A pending Supreme Court decision will also determine how and if the government requesting such content to be taken down violates the First Amendment. This event will feature election officials and technology experts to discuss how the information landscape has changed over the past few election cycles, the challenges facing local election officials, and what social media companies can voluntarily do in the short and long term to slow the spread of false narratives. <strong>When:</strong> June 7, 12pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5GOkxmocQt2oK4t-o7HNnw#/registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Official Media Training 101</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Election officials throughout the country have been required to publicly communicate more and more, frequently via the media. How can election officials best seize these opportunities to counter misinformation, proactively inform the public, and build trust with voters? Join the Election Official Legal Defense Network and the communications specialists at CGCN to learn how to handle and maximize media opportunities. CGCN has played a role in many EOLDN success stories, helping election offices across the country build up their resources for the coming year.

What are lawmakers and election administrators thinking about now to prepare? Find out in this four-part series, hosted  by the National Conference of State Legislatures in partnership with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We’ll focus on the elections workforce; counting and recounts and more post-voting work; the voters’ perspectives and voter confidence.  Voter confidence is top of mind for elections stakeholders this cycle. In the final part of NCSL’s spring webinar series, U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Christy McCormick will delve into state policies that can increase voter confidence. Perfecting processes and procedures comes first: clarifying all policies before the first vote is cast; cleaning voter lists; adopting strong chain-of-custody procedures for ballots and equipment; updating emergency plans; using pre- and post-election audits; and more. The next job is to ensure all that good technical work is transparent and communicated well to voters and the public. <strong>When:</strong> June 14, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/american-democracy-is-under-threat-how-do-we-protect-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American democracy is under threat. How do we protect it?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In the past decade, liberal democracies around the world have been attacked from within, and the United States is no exception.

On June 17, join Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution for a webinar about democratic decline in the United States.

The Voters: A Conversation with Joshua Douglas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In recent decades, we have witnessed an alarming trend at our nation’s highest court. From headline-grabbing cases like Bush v. Gore and Citizens United to lesser-known but still impactful cases like Crawford v. Marion County Elections Board, the Supreme Court of the United States has significantly changed American elections. &#8220;The Court v. The Voters: The Troubling Story of How the Supreme Court Has Undermined Voting Rights&#8221; examines each of these cases in turn and explains how each decision impacted our democracy and the voting rights of everyday Americans. In plain, accessible language, “The Court v. The Voters” uses real human stories to allow readers to understand the real and present danger of an activist court that consistently undermines those it is meant to serve — while highlighting solutions that will empower readers to plot a course for change. In conversation with Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith, professor and author Joshua A. Douglas will take his knowledge of election law to lead attendees behind the scenes of the most significant cases in the history of voting rights in America. Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky J. David Rosenberg College of Law. He is the author of “Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting,” which provides hope and inspiration for a positive path forward on voting rights. <strong>When:</strong> June 25, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>
