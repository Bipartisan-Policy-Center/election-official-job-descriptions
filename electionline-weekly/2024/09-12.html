<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-11816" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-201x300.jpeg" alt="" width="146" height="218" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-201x300.jpeg 201w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-687x1024.jpeg 687w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-768x1144.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-1031x1536.jpeg 1031w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-1375x2048.jpeg 1375w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ConfProgram-scaled.jpeg 1718w" sizes="(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px" />With less than two months to go till the November 2024 election, more than 500 state and local elections officials were joined by other elections-adjacent attendees for the National Association of Election Officials’ (The Election Center) 39th Annual Conference in Detroit, Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing on a successful change of format which debuted in 2023, day one of the conference was dedicated to updates from the executive team and attendees heard from representatives of every one of the breakout sessions held on Tuesday. The “speed-dating” approach provided all attendees exposure to content that they physically could participate in given the simultaneous tracts of programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the break-out sessions there were tracks on Security &amp; Technology, Communications &amp; Research, Studies, Reports &amp; Policy, Management, Training &amp; Logistics, and Connections, Associations &amp; Open Session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the plenary sessions and workshops, there were dozens of vendors in the exhibit hall, the</span><a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stanford University D. School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presented a poster exhibit in the main conference area, awards were presented, CERA graduation held, a worldwide movie premier, a tour of local elections offices and there may have been a bit of fun too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keynote Speakers</strong><br />
</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11793" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11793" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11793" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JocelynBenson-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JocelynBenson-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JocelynBenson-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JocelynBenson-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JocelynBenson-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JocelynBenson-2048x1537.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11793" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to hearing from all the break-out speakers, on Monday, those in attendance were treated to several keynote speakers including </span><a href="https://detroitmi.gov/government/city-clerk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit City Clerk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Janice Winfrey, </span><a href="https://www.waynecounty.com/elected/clerk/home.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne County, Michigan Clerk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cathy Garrett and </span><a href="https://dsvsesvc.sos.state.mi.us/TAP/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Secretary of State</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jocelyn Benson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her remarks, Garrett noted that “This has been a treat to be amongst you. It’s like one big therapy session because we all feel each other&#8217;s pain.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her remarks, Benson, who </span><a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/politics/elections/michigan-secretary-state-jocelyn-benson-testifies-election-security-washington-dc/69-faf3a1a4-6687-49d6-91e8-6f87355860a6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before Congress later in the week, compared the current situation elections officials are facing as a storm. “We are on the precipice of a great moment,” Benson said. “We must find courage and strength in the moment to walk through the storm together.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CISA Director </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen Easterly also addressed the attendees on Monday. With the coming anniversary of </span>September 11 on many people’s minds and the threats elections workers and officials are facing daily Easterly spoke about the critical work officials are continuing to do in the face of adversity.</p>
<div id="attachment_11792" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11792" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11792" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JennEasterly-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JennEasterly-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JennEasterly-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JennEasterly-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JennEasterly-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JennEasterly-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11792" class="wp-caption-text"><em>CISA Director Jen Easterly.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You all know we are facing the most complex threat environment yet for an election cycle. You all know how much hard work goes into ensuring the security and integrity of our democratic process. And knowing ALL of that, you chose to be part of this sacred mission. You chose to be part of this distinguished community entrusted to protect the most critically important part of our democracy, our elections process,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And while this is a tall order, this community has, without fail, delivered safe and secure elections for the American people since the start of this republic. You have faced all sorts of Election Day and voting period criceses from natural disasters to global pandemics. But as weeks like this one remind us, our nation has also held elections in the face of more nebulous or existential threats to our democracy. Time and again we have prevailed, regardless of context and circumstance. The result of your good work and the work done by the election officials who came before you is that this country’s secure and resilient elections have become the truest indicator that our democracy is strong and thriving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easterly also stressed that with the continuing threats to our elections that elections officials are not alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also know that you are not expected to take on these burdens alone. You are NOT alone in this fight. Defending our democratic process is a top priority at every level of government from the federal to the state to the local,” Easterly said. Noting that there were federal officials from many different agencies on hand to talk about the threats elections officials are facing and how they can help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, 121 people graduated from the CERA program. It’s the largest class yet and more than 50 of them were on hand to receive their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">certificates and be </span>recognized for all their hard work. As each graduate came up to receive their certificate, some of their thoughts about the program and their achievement were displayed. While each graduate had their own reasons for getting a CERA certificate, many of them talked about how taking the CERA courses not only increased their knowledge, but also brought them in contact with so many other elections officials who are experiencing the same things. “The CERA program is like the bar in Cheers. Everyone is welcoming. You get excited when you see someone you know. You pick up good bits of information,” said Fred DeCaro, registrar of voters for the Town of Greenwich, Connecticut. Nobody ever gets tired of talking about the topic. And you look forward to the next time  you can all get together and do it again!”</p>

The Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) released a report “</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/expansion-voter-registration-methods/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Expansion of Innovative Voter Registration Methods, 2000-2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” These <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9826" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />include online voter registration (OVR), same-day voter registration (SDR), and automatic voter registration (AVR). With the support of lawmakers and governors from both parties, 46 states and Washington, D.C., will have at least one of these in 2024—a big jump from just seven states in 2000. Fifteen states will have two, and 14 states plus Washington, D.C., will have all three.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some registration requirements come from the federal level and apply to all states. The Help America Vote Act of 2002, for example, set rules for verifying a voter’s identity, like requiring a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number. But states can choose which, if any, of the three innovative methods of voter registration to adopt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These additional registration methods make it easier for people to register or update their registration. In states with OVR, AVR, and SDR, people can register online, automatically while getting a driver’s license, or at the polling place. AVR keeps records current by updating them automatically, and SDR allows people who missed the registration deadline or whose records were incorrect or removed accidentally to still vote.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Options like online voter registration, same day registration, and automatic voter registration lead to more accurate and complete voter lists,” says David Becker, Founder and Executive Director of CEIR.  “Offering multiple methods to register to vote makes it easier to prepare for elections and reduces problems on Election Day, which leads to a smoother voting experience.”</span></p>

These checklists are tools to quickly review existing practices and take steps to enhance physical and cyber resilience in preparation for election day.    &#8220;Election officials around the country are unwavering in their commitment to enhance the cyber and physical security of election infrastructure to meet an evolving threat environment. As election officials and their teams enter into final preparations for November, these checklists help highlight some of the most common threat vectors, security practices, and resilience measures for consideration,&#8221; said CISA Senior Advisor, Cait Conley.  These checklists provide a series of questions to guide preparation for potential cyber and physical security incidents that may impact election infrastructure. They help election officials identify areas to potentially enhance physical security, operational resilience, and cybersecurity at election infrastructure facilities and take action to implement low- or no-cost options in the short term.  For more information, please click</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/physical-security-checklist-election-offices-and-election-infrastructure-cybersecurity-readiness-and"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and check out</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/protect2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> #Protect2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the latest information regarding election security. </span></p>

They also noted that properly addressed election mail was being returned to them as undeliverable, a problem that could automatically send voters to inactive status through no fault of their own, potentially creating chaos when those voters show up to cast a ballot. The officials also said that repeated outreach to the Postal Service to resolve the issues had failed and that the widespread nature of the problems made it clear these were “not one-off mistakes or a problem with specific facilities. Instead, it demonstrates a pervasive lack of understanding and enforcement of USPS policies among its employees.” “We implore you to take immediate and tangible corrective action to address the ongoing performance issues with USPS election mail service,” they added. “Failure to do so will risk limiting voter participation and trust in the election process.” The Postal Service reiterated assurances that it’s well positioned to swiftly deliver election mail despite being in the midst of a network modernization that has caused some delivery hiccups. Mail is currently being delivered in 2.7 days on average, officials said, but the Postal Service is still urging voters not to procrastinate.</span></p>

But Democratic secretaries of state in battleground states told committee members they are more concerned about the detailed threats they and their election workers are experiencing resulting from election misinformation. Three Democratic secretaries of state, Adrian Fontes of Arizona, Jocelyn Benson of Michigan and Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico, said that people who are not citizens voting in federal elections do not constitute a problem, despite the GOP push for legislation barring the act. “There’s no evidence that noncitizens are voting and if they were, it would be easy to prove, since voting records are public. And despite numerous organizations spending a lot of money to try to convince people that noncitizens are voting, none of these groups have actually been able to provide any evidence of it,” Benson said. The three Republican secretaries of state at the hearing, Frank LaRose of Ohio, Cord Byrd of Florida and Mac Warner of West Virginia, argued that federal legislation requiring proof of citizenship to register is necessary to prevent people who are not citizens from voting and to secure elections. Research has found that noncitizen voting rarely happens.  “The fact is it’s rare, but we keep it rare by enforcing the law,” LaRose said of such voting. “It is my duty to carry that out. Unfortunately, that duty is not as easy to carry out as it should be.” Legislators also discussed threats to election workers, funding and a three-year-old executive order on voter registration efforts. </span></p>

Cherokee County Manager Randy Wiggins says because this is not optional, it will likely trigger a budget amendment for commissioners to debate soon.

I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing this bus out on the street.&#8221; The RI Department of State&#8217;s 2024 advertising campaign includes radio, digital, print, and bus ads, all focused on the importance of getting elections information from trusted sources, like state and local elections officials.

Such allegations are dangerous because they erode trust in our election system and could sow doubt in the results. Navigating this issue may prove difficult because of conflicting media coverage, the complex intersection of various laws, and deliberate disinformation campaigns. For this reason, the National Task Force on Election Crises has put together a brief explainer for you, so that you and the people who rely on you for information will have the tools necessary to rebut these allegations and understand why it would not be possible for noncitizens to engage in widespread voter fraud. You can read the full paper</span><a href="https://electiontaskforce.org/rebutting-allegations-of-widespread-voter-fraud-by-noncitizens/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messaging Points:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">False claims of widespread noncitizen voting are designed to sow distrust in our elections and to potentially serve as pretext to undermine or challenge the rightful results.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under federal law, only eligible American citizens can register to vote and cast ballots in federal elections. These laws include the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of noncitizens who have been proven to have registered to vote in federal elections in the United States is miniscule—and the number of noncitizens who have attempted to vote is an even smaller fraction of that number.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extreme rarity of these events demonstrates how the system, with these measures and procedures, is functioning well to protect the integrity of our elections in this regard, and indicates that widespread noncitizen voting is not occurring.</span></li>

The legislation to continue government funding when the new budget year begins on Oct. 1 includes a requirement that people registering to vote must provide proof of citizenship. Johnson, R-La., signaled that he was not backing off linking the two main components of the bill. “No vote today because we’re in the consensus building business here in Congress. With small majorities, that’s what you do,” Johnson told reporters. “We’re having thoughtful conversations, family conversations within the Republican conference and I believe we’ll get there.” Congress needs to pass a stopgap spending bill before Oct. 1 to avoid a federal shutdown just weeks before the election. The measure had been teed up for a vote on Wednesday afternoon, but Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed and enough Republicans had voiced opposition to raise serious doubts about whether the measure would pass. The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July. Republicans believe there is value in revisiting the issue and making Democrats in competitive swing districts vote again. Democrats are calling on Johnson to “stop wasting time” on a bill that will not become law and to work with them on a short-term spending measure that has support from both parties. At the end of the day, they say no spending bill can pass without bipartisan support and buy-in from a Democratic-led Senate and White House. “Speaker Johnson, scrap your plan. Don’t just delay the vote. Find a better one that can pass in a bipartisan way,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in response to Johnson’s announcement. But Johnson wasn’t giving up on his proposal yet, saying House leadership would work on building support over the weekend. He said that ensuring that only U.S. citizens vote in federal elections is “the most pressing issue right now and we’re going to get this job done.”</span></p>

Advocates say SB 299, which is now before Gov. Gavin Newsom, would especially impact young people and predominantly Black, Latino and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. “We recognize that voter registration is a key barrier for our communities to exercise our constitutional rights to vote,” said Sydney Fang, the policy director at Asian, Americans and Pacific Islanders for Civic Empowerment (AAPI Force). “And we know that democracy only works when all eligible citizens have access to the ballot.” The bill aims to reduce that percentage through technology, allowing the agency to check whether a person is eligible to be registered. If their information clears the system and demonstrates they’re an eligible voter, they’d automatically be put on the voter rolls. The bill gives the California Secretary of State authority on the selection and implementation of the technology. Newsom will have until the end of September to sign the bill. If signed, it could go into effect as early as 2030.</span></p>

That includes mayoral and city council races, proposed sales tax increases on the ballot and municipal bond measures. Local immigrant rights advocates like Carlos Perea argue that keeping non-citizens from voting takes tax-paying residents out of the political process. “We knew the residents were demanding political representation because we realized that, if we wanted to truly change how City Hall runs, we needed to change who’s allowed to vote,” he said. “This is an issue that will change the game in the city.”    But opponents have argued that implementing the measure would cost the cash-strapped city upwards of $10 million. They also say that voting, at all levels of government, should remain a right of citizenship and if non-citizens want a bigger voice in civic affairs, they should work to become naturalized.</span></p>

Chris Sununu has days to decide the fate of a bill that would require </span><a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2024/09/11/sununu-has-until-friday-to-sign-or-veto-new-hampshire-voter-id-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proof of voter identification with no exceptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in future New Hampshire elections, after the legislation arrived at his desk September 9. Opponents of the bill are attempting to persuade him to veto it. </span><a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1198&amp;txtFormat=html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1569</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed the Legislature in May, would require voters to produce a photo ID on Election Day or be barred from voting. It would eliminate the current law that allows people who show up to vote without photo ID to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity under penalty of perjury.  And it would require that people voting in New Hampshire for the first time produce documentary evidence of their U.S. citizenship through a passport, birth certificate, or other document in order to register to vote. The bill will not affect the Nov. 5 general election if Sununu signs it this week. It is written to take effect 60 days after his signature.  Sununu has been skeptical of signing the bill, stating that he is not interested in making further changes to state election laws when asked about HB 1569. But voting rights and disability rights groups are now urging Sununu to veto the bill entirely this week.</span></p>

Earlier this year, Oakridge’s City Council voted 5 to 1 to place a STAR Voting measure on the ballot. The system would allow voters to rate multiple candidates on a scale of zero to five stars, rather than choosing just one. The two highest score-earners would then advance to an automatic run-off. All ballots would be recounted, and the finalist preferred by more people would win. If the Oakridge measure passes, the city would try out the system for three elections. Afterwards, voters could adopt STAR Voting permanently, or drop it. City Administrator James Cleavenger said Oakridge currently has no primary, and there&#8217;s frequently more than two candidates in a race, which leads to vote-splitting. He said STAR Voting could help address this problem.</span></p>

For the ordinance to pass, a public hearing and majority council approval would be necessary at a future meeting. Bryn Smith sent her colleagues the revision, saying in her email she “made some changes upon reflection and Mr. Chairman’s comments in the press.” Council Chairman John Lombardo and county District Attorney Sam Sanguedolce both criticized the original proposal due to mandates it placed on the county District Attorney’s Office. It lists prohibited actions related to interference, intimidation, retaliation and harassment. Under the interference listing, for example, it states no person shall obstruct, hinder or otherwise interfere with an election official in the performance of their duties. “This includes physical, electronic or psychological barriers that impede election officials’ ability to conduct elections,” it said. The other prohibitions: Intimidation: It is unlawful to threaten, coerce, or attempt to influence an election official through fear, including the use of force, threats of force, or disclosing personal information of election officials online (doxxing). Retaliation: Retaliating against an election official for performing their duties, such as by threatening job security, personal safety, or publicly maligning their character, is prohibited. Harassment: Persistent actions, including verbal or physical conduct designed to disturb or upset an election official, are unlawful. This includes the use of derogatory or threatening language aimed at election officials through any medium. The proposal asserts these prohibitions are “in alignment” with the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, the state Election Code and applicable federal laws. The ordinance would apply to actions committed within the county and harassment or intimidation acts that originate from outside the county, it said. “This ensures that perpetrators cannot evade responsibility due to physical location, emphasizing that protections cover both digital and physical threats,” it said. The ordinance mandates the election bureau to immediately document any applicable incidents. Finally, the proposal imposes a maximum $1,000 fine or up to 90 days in the county jail if a fine is not paid by an offender found guilty. It makes violations subject to summary enforcement proceedings.</span></p>

After two years of work and multiple rounds of public comment, the rule will now be sent to Gov. Tony Evers who can decide to send it to a legislative committee for final approval.  While this is the first permanent rule approved by the commission since the agency’s creation in 2016, the rule won’t be in effect for the election in November.  The administrative rule guides how election observers are allowed to act in a polling place, where they are allowed to stand and how close to certain activities they’re allowed to be. The rule also lays out how observers can challenge certain activities they witness; when and how election officials can remove observers from the polling place; and what members of the news media are allowed to do, including taking pictures or video inside polling places.  The rule was approved 5-1. Republican commissioner Robert Spindell cast the only no vote after a number of speakers during the meeting’s public comment period objected to some of the rule’s provisions and questioned if it would be approved by the Republicans who control the Legislature’s Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR).</span></p>

Fulton County election board member Julie Adams filed a lawsuit in May asking a judge to declare that the county election board members’ duties “are discretionary, not ministerial, in nature”. At issue is a Georgia law that says the county officials “shall” certify results after engaging in a process to make sure they are accurate. McBurney dismissed Adams’s lawsuit, saying that she had failed to name the correct party as a defendant. Under Georgia law, the principle of sovereign immunity protects state and local governments from being sued unless they agree to it. But voters in 2020 approved an amendment to the state constitution to provide a limited waiver for claims where a party is asking a judge to make a declaration on the meaning of a law. That is what Adams was trying to do when she filed her suit against the board she sits on and the county elections director. But McBurney noted in his ruling that the requirements very plainly state that any such complaint must be brought against the state or local government.</span></p>

Miller has denied Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s latest legal challenge to a ballot issue that seeks to end the state’s closed party primary elections and </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/09/05/idaho-judge-dismisses-ags-challenge-to-open-primaries-ballot-initiative/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create ranked-choice voting in the general election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Miller dismissed Labrador’s motion for summary judgment seeking to have the signatures on the ballot initiative declared invalid.  “The evidence the Attorney General submits actually negates the idea that the defendants perpetrated false statements to thousands of persons who actually signed the petition,” Miller wrote in Thursday’s ruling. Labrador had alleged that volunteer signature gatherers supporting the Idahoans for Open Primaries coalition misled the public and fraudulently obtained the signatures used to qualify the ballot initiative for the election.  But in a ruling issued less than 24 hours after the two sides were in Ada County District Court , Miller wrote that Labrador’s “principal argument is not well taken for numerous reasons.” “First, the record is devoid of any evidence that the required ballot titles were not included on the initiative shown to voters or that the short title was not on every initiative signature page,” Miller wrote. “As pointed out by defendants’ counsel at oral argument, the short title was in large font on the bottom of every page of signature sheets.” In a statement released Thursday, Labrador expressed disappointment with the ruling, disagreed with the judge and reiterated his objections to the initiative. “At least, our legal challenge has raised awareness about the true nature of the initiative,” Labrador wrote in a statement released by a spokesman. “It is now up to Idaho voters to decide whether they want to replace Idaho’s primary system with a top-four primary system and fundamentally alter Idaho’s orderly general elections with an expensive ranked choice voting system that has resulted in confusion, delays and widespread voting errors in other states.” </span></p>

The case centers around Linn County Auditor Joel Miller’s accusation that the Iowa Secretary of State </span><a href="https://dailyiowan.com/2024/09/06/iowa-supreme-courts-hears-first-case-of-the-year-on-ui-campus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to revamp Iowa’s voter registration systems prior to the 2020 presidential election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2018, the state’s deputy commissioner of elections notified Iowa counties of their goal to spend roughly $8 million updating Iowa’s voter registration system.  After a year, in July 2019, Miller filed a public records request with Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate. Miller said more than $1 million of that funding should have been spent in fiscal year 2019, and he asked for copies of all correspondence regarding the issue between Pate’s office, public officials, and vendors. When Pate’s office did not issue a response within 10 days, which is the requirement for public record requests under Iowa law, Miller filed a complaint with the Iowa Voter Registration Commission where he alleged Pate did not take action to overhaul the system. In his complaint, Miller argued this failure left Iowa’s voting system vulnerable to hackers.  Pate filed a motion requesting the commission dismiss Miller’s complaint, and the commission decided in a 2-1 vote to dismiss Miller’s complaint without a hearing.  Miller appealed to the Polk County District Court who also denied his petition. He appealed once again, which elevated the lawsuit to the Iowa Supreme Court. During oral argument, Miller’s attorney James Larew said Miller repeatedly sought information regarding his concern about voter registration in Iowa, to which he received no response. Larew also said if there are violations in the future, they will be difficult to prove without information.</span></p>

Having reached a satisfactory outcome, the ACLU will voluntarily drop its suit against the canvasser, the organization said. “This is a clear recognition there is no legal defense if you are sued for these things,” said Phil Mayor, senior attorney for the ACLU of Michigan. “This is establishing the principle that if you refuse to certify, you will be held responsible.” The lawsuit stemmed from comments the canvasser, 73-year-old Robert Froman, was reported to have made to The Detroit News last month. Froman, a Republican, said that he believed the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, and that if the 2024 election went the same way, he would not certify, the News reported. Trump lost Michigan to now-President Joe Biden by about 150,000 votes.</span></p>

The filing makes clear Jacobsen is pursuing a version of the “independent state legislature” theory that the high court mostly already dismissed in June 2023. In that case, it rejected claims from North Carolina Republicans who argued the state’s Supreme Court wrongfully struck down the Republicans’ congressional redistricting map, which the North Carolina Supreme Court found to be an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. “State courts cannot ‘read state law in such a manner as to circumvent federal constitutional provisions,’ and ‘arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections,’” Jacobsen’s filing with the court says. “But that’s what happened here.” Jacobsen, represented by the Montana Attorney General’s Office and private Virginia-based law firm Consovoy McCarthy, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari – a request for the Supreme Court to consider the case – on Aug. 26 after receiving an extension from the court earlier this year to file her petition. The initial application for an extension of time to file a writ request contained similar arguments as the petition filed in late August. </span></p>

The three-member panel ruled that nothing in state law prevented Republican-controlled Butler County from counting two voters’ provisional ballots in the April 23 primary election, even if state law is ambiguous. A provisional ballot is typically cast at a polling place on Election Day and is separated from regular ballots in cases when elections workers need more time to determine a voter’s eligibility to vote. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by two Butler County voters who received an automatic email before the primary election telling them that their mail-in ballots had been rejected because they hadn’t put them in a blank “secrecy” envelope that is supposed to go inside the ballot return envelope. Contesting the lawsuit was Butler County as well as the state and national Republican parties. Their lawyers had argued that nothing in state law allows a voter to cast a provisional ballot in place of a rejected mail-in ballot. They have three days to appeal to the state Supreme Court.</span></p>

The Tennessee State Election Commission had required people with prior felony convictions to restore their gun ownership rights before their voting rights. Since many felony charges bar people from owning a gun, the rule disqualified people who would’ve otherwise been eligible to vote again. Both the state and the petitioners cited State v. Jackson, a Tennessee State Supreme Court case which determined a person may regain full citizenship rights without regaining the right to own a firearm. In her ruling, Nashville Criminal Court Judge Angelita Dalton found that while the petitioners may not be able to regain their rights to own a gun, they should have their full citizenship rights restored. “This Court finds that (the petitioner’s) permanent prohibition on possessing firearms does not render her ineligible from having her full rights of citizenship restored,” one of the four orders said. “While the Court acknowledges that Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-1307(b)(1)(B) requires that the lifetime firearms prohibition remain in place, the Court also understands that the Tennessee Supreme Court’s holding in State v. Johnson does not require that (the petitioner’s) gun rights be restored before she may have her full rights of citizenship restored.”</span></p>

Paxton’s lawsuit follows a decision by the Travis County commissioners to hire Civic Government Solutions to contact non-registered county residents and encourage them to register. Travis County includes Austin. “We just thought it was nice thing to do,” Ann Howard, a Travis County commissioner, said at The Texas Tribune Festival shortly after news of the lawsuit was made public. Paxton, in a statement, called the decision illegal. “Travis County has blatantly violated Texas law by paying partisan actors to conduct unlawful identification efforts to track down people who are not registered to vote,” Paxton said. “Programs like this invite fraud and reduce public trust in our elections. We will stop them and any other county considering such programs.” A spokesperson for the county said the commissioners stood by their decision. “Travis County is committed to encouraging voter participation and we are proud of our outreach efforts that achieve higher voter registration numbers,” said spokesperson Hector Nieto. “We remain steadfast in our responsibility to uphold the integrity of the voter registration process while ensuring that every eligible person has the opportunity to exercise their right to vote. It is disappointing that any statewide elected official would prefer to sow distrust and discourage participation in the electoral process.”</span></p>

The state GOP alleges that King County Elections Director Julie Wise did not ensure that voter information transmitted over the app had adequate privacy and security protections because the tool is operated by a private company. The party claims Republican Sue Kuehl Pederson would have defeated Democrat Dave Upthegrove in the primary race if the app hadn’t been used. The party wants the votes that were “cured” through the app to be invalidated. The lawsuit comes one day after state officials certified the results of a hand recount in the race that was prompted by an historically close margin. As the results remained too close to call last month, the Pederson and Upthegrove campaigns worked to help voters cure their ballots before the initial results were certified. Those initial results showed Upthegrove won the second slot on the November ballot by just 51 votes over Pederson. The hand recount showed Pederson narrowly losing to Democrat Dave Upthegrove by 49 votes. The lawsuit was filed in Snohomish County Superior Court.</span></p>

Such vans — a single van, actually — were used just once, in Racine in a primary election in 2022. It allowed voters to cast absentee ballots in the two weeks leading up to the election. Racine, the Democratic National Committee and others say nothing in state law prohibits the use of voting vans. Whatever the court decides will not affect the November election, as a ruling isn’t expected until later and no towns or cities asked to use alternative voting locations for this election before the deadline to do so passed. But the ruling will determine whether mobile voting sites can be used in future elections. Much of the oral argument focused on whether the Racine County voter who brought the lawsuit was “aggrieved” under state law and allowed to sue. If the court rules that he didn’t have standing, it could make it more difficult to bring future lawsuits challenging election laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also heard testimony in a  case focusing on whether guardianship records provided to the Wisconsin Elections Commission </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsin-supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-2-election-related-lawsuits"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when a person has been deemed incompetent to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be public record.  The case was filed by the Wisconsin Voter Alliance, which alleges there are people who have been found incompetent by a court who are still voting in elections. The group was founded by Ron Heuer, who was part of former Conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman’s widely criticized 2020 review of the presidential election in the state.  Alliance attorney Eric Kardaal started his arguments before the court by citing statistics from Dane County. Liberal Justice Jill Karofsky stopped Kardaal and said the case is limited to Walworth County because that was the focus of the group’s suit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m afraid what you are trying to do is to introduce the fear that there is some sort of illegitimacy going on in the election in the state of Wisconsin, and that concerns me deeply,” Karofsky said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But the bulk of the discussion before the court focused on two conflicting orders from Wisconsin appeals courts based in Madison and Waukesha.</span></p>

The charges originated from an incident on Aug. 6, when Hayden-Ali entered the Laramie County Governmental Complex, allegedly disrupting an election site and tearing up election materials. As of June 29, 2023, Hayden-Ali has been trespassed from the courthouse until 2033. This means he cannot legally be in the courthouse unless he is there for official business, due to several previous incidents of disruptive and threatening behavior. On the day of the incident, Laramie County Sheriff’s Deputy Ramon Colvert responded to a call from a local coffee shop employee. Upon arriving on the scene, Ramon was able to confirm that Hayden-Ali was in the building and had been asked to leave by election officials, whom he ignored. He had been walking through the building, tapping his staff with each step he took. According to court documents, the situation escalated when Hayden-Ali proceeded into the voting area, even though he was asked to leave. He eventually left the voting area, tearing up printed election materials he had picked up and throwing the remnants on the floor. During the incident in the atrium, at least one voter told elections worker Charles Simineo that they were concerned about the safety of election officials, according to the affidavit of arrest.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://street.applytojob.com/apply/ViYizN8azN/Fellow-Governance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fellow, Governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R Street Institute–The R Street Institute—a free-market think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C., and with regional offices across the country—seeks a dynamic fellow to bolster our work on election policy. If you are the right fit, you will report to the director of the Governance program. If you want to join a mission-driven organization and work toward pragmatic policy solutions, this may be the opportunity you need! Your typical day at R Street may include conducting research on how rethinking the structure of elections can create better alignment between politicians and their constituents or drafting an op-ed on the need to ensure safe and secure voting sites. It may also include meeting with legislators, election officials, and other stakeholders to improve public trust in elections or presenting your insights on strengthening ballot security on a radio show or at a national conference. This role will serve within the Governance program, which seeks to define how a limited, effective government can minimize burdens, promote human flourishing, and encourage opportunity for all. With this lens, R Street’s electoral reform work has looked for ways to eliminate needless red tape in elections, ensure all voters can participate in taxpayer-funded elections, realign electoral incentives to promote a healthier political culture, and promote policies that create elections worthy of public trust. All the while, we recognize that keeping states in control of their own elections—an idea at the very heart of our federalist system—will create more public buy-in and allow for greater flexibility and innovation. Our study of electoral reform may touch on a wide variety of issues and will be informed by the framework we have supported in the past. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply, </span><a href="https://street.applytojob.com/apply/ViYizN8azN/Fellow-Governance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
