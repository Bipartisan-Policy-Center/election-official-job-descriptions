							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New research shows voters are confident about election systems in their states</strong><br />
<em>Verified Voting&#8217;s research covered <span style="font-weight: 400;">voter confidence, election audits and the perspectives of election officials</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, </span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Voting</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoKRuC3p3qI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research findings on voter confidence, election audits and the perspectives of election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11358" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVVoters-300x168.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVVoters-300x168.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVVoters-1024x575.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVVoters-768x431.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVVoters-1536x862.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVVoters-2048x1150.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Earlier this year, Verified Voting worked with </span><a href="https://www.lakeresearch.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake Research Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort  to assess voter confidence ahead of the 2024 elections in different parts of the election system, focusing on election audits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, they hoped to provide research-backed messaging recommendations that election officials and others can use to increase trust with the electorate and explore the perspectives of election officials surrounding audits and voter education so they can be supported in their work in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process was three-fold and included eight focus groups of likely voters in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, &amp; Wisconsin (two groups per state by party ID), a 19-minute, 800 sample survey among likely 2024 general election voters nationwide (conducted March 4-7) and a qualitative board of 25 local election officials (including 16 who fully completed the board) over a two-week period in mid-March</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news, voters are confident in the voting systems in their own states. Roughly three quarters of voters think the system of voting and elections works well and are confident in the accuracy of the election results in their states, including four in ten who believe it works very well. In fact, democracy/voting rights was a middle-tier issue for most demographic groups other  than for white older women.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters are confident about the election systems in their own states, but have little to no knowledge about how they work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election audits can be positioned as a proven way to affirm and ensure election outcomes—which increases confidence</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon learning about risk-limiting audits (RLAs), voters are supportive of the concept across political ideologies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters respond affirmatively to simple, positive language about election processes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials, anticipating continued mis- and disinformation about elections, want voters to turn to them for information and there is room for outside organizations to collaborate with—and provide resources for — election officials.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11359" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVTrust-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVTrust-300x167.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVTrust-1024x571.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVTrust-768x429.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVTrust-1536x857.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVTrust-2048x1143.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One particular note of good news from the survey is that voters seem to overwhelmingly trust poll workers. As states and localities work to recruit poll workers for the remaining primaries and November this could be an important and useful piece of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a less positive note, those surveyed don’t seem to have a whole lot of trust in local and national media. With trust in local election officials, but not necessarily in local media, this provides a bit of a quagmire for overworked and often cash-strapped elections officials for how exactly to get the word out to voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Risk Limiting Audits</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the research focused on <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/risk-limiting-audits">risk limiting audits</a> (RLAs) and how RLAs might help improve voter confidence in elections and what types of messaging can be used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11357" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVRLA-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVRLA-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVRLA-1024x585.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVRLA-768x438.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VVRLA.png 1524w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The research found that the voters in focus groups have never heard of “risk-limiting audits” but become strongly supportive after receiving a definition of what an RLA is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing Verified Voting’s definition of Risk-Limiting Audits, which concisely describes the process and explains how RLAs can verify and increase confidence in election results, over six in ten voters want RLAs in their state, including four in ten who want them strongly. Just about one in seven voters do not want RLAs, and one quarter of voters still have questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants also gave near-universally positive feedback on a Verified Voting </span><a href="https://youtu.be/DlstGHazHPM?si=7Jb6KxxmfGWPvrus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explaining RLAs. They felt the video is simple, informative, and clear. The animations are easy to follow and help voters focus in on what the video is explaining. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as the “Clearies,” the awards program celebrates the hard work of election offices across the country for programs that took place in 2023. Winning jurisdictions range from counties with 25,000 registered voters to states with over 7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in the middle of a busy election year, but 2023 was an opportunity for election officials to implement new programs and test their effectiveness before the increased turnout of the presidential election. We hope these winning programs inspire election officials to replicate them in their jurisdiction, and we want to recognize all the winners and those who applied across the country,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, Vice Chair Donald Palmer, Commissioner Thomas Hicks, and Commissioner Christy McCormick in a joint statement. “With the rise of artificial intelligence and the increased need for reliable election information, we are pleased to introduce the Distinguished Voter Education and Communications Initiatives award category for small and large jurisdictions. Effective and innovative communications is critical, and we hope the winners in this new category can provide useful best practices for 2024 and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clearies play an essential role in fulfilling the EAC’s mission to serve as a clearinghouse for election administration information under the </span><a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.vTI5DAfbsaYguWqsNUNBtofPV-2BtbJ8JZKtK9HXBd70SuKQBSFwWS3LYWQQdXwrLLLVZOpURg7bExcEKZMKNuDBJ5YMXgRVDsFTp83aPga8Q-3DmbWr_C6Knsj52BCpW11NxpmMJaBKdTkM0OBFhz03xpM9h4HYR6nlGHZrI5ACZOmmT-2BaqHmreuJ-2FlsFW8KbKLKE7LrO46k6m2Lj5uepkGDGgSI0UohJgq-2FuG1JiDXq0O4N98GMQWnCTenqLGaPXXK0reREGDhW9zv3EJ37gOhVpBdAqZ-2FiZy79pUPnkbv82SZUUcU1oo0r2sq6jp4Fy5eJKpMLPkkP0544GriRaz22FPXWWXkHkioErx1I5HF5jbRu34364kPpkE4WkkPwfkndUlpXhdq2LZN3Z6S1Gdazo8G3KSjXOjUO13BZQSXRX3heyshoQtoVtiWtFkYvv-2F7fwbuor8x5rhQYeoczyuWTBYiyxRizXOo9Y-2F2WY-2Bb-2BNqW3PHmHU0XhCHnqc4HReNtMk3PiTg-3D-3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help America Vote Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

For some Texans this </span><a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/voting/2024/05/29/488997/harris-county-voter-turnout-election-fatigue-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marked the fith time they had gone to the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since November 2023. With only 50,000 voters showing up for the most recent election Harris County Clerk Tenisha Hudspeth expressed concerns about voter fatigue. &#8220;In terms of why there is such a low percentage of voters, there could be various reasons why. Next month there will be six elections Harris County has conducted, six elections since last November, back-to-back-to-back-to-back,&#8221; said Hudspeth. &#8220;November, December, March primary, May 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> special, now the runoff, and then another runoff in June.&#8221; Hudspeth said she would be interested in hearing conversations about minimizing the days of elections and what’s on the ballot at the same time. In addition to voter fatigue, some voters were impacted by severe weather. </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/28/texas-elections-voter-turnout-storms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe storms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knocked out power in at least 76 polling places in Dallas, Kaufman, Ellis and Tarrant counties. Nicholas Solorzano, a communications manager at the Dallas County Elections Department, told the Texas Tribune tornado sirens wailed early Tuesday morning. Many election and poll workers, including himself, were caught in the brunt of this morning’s storm around 5 a.m. heading into work. </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/28/texas-elections-voter-turnout-storms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dallas County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had planned to open 281 polling locations at 7 a.m. Tuesday, but Solorzano said that the storm created widespread outages impacting polling locations across the county. When thunderstorms rolled through the Houston area Tuesday afternoon, </span><a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2024/05/28/at-least-a-dozen-harris-county-voting-centers-lose-power-during-primary-runoff-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Judge Lina Hidalgo said more than 10 voting centers lost power during the primary runoff elections.

I don&#8217;t know why,” Hancock said. Hancock said the day went smoothly, which she attributed to poll workers. “We have a lot of really seasoned judges that really know what they’re doing and just being sure they’re in key locations to get up and going plus we have staff members from my team that go out and we touch base with every location before we start,” Hancock said.</span></p>

Julie Adams, a Republican who joined the</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/republican-member-of-fulton-elections-board-wont-certify-primary-results/IDYT7CZVMZAJXHDAADS7G6JNT4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fulton County, Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Registration &amp; Elections in February has refused to certify the May 21 primary election and instead sued the county’s board of elections and elections director claiming she’s prevented from performing her board duties. Adams wants access to “essential election materials and processes” and a ruling that her duties – including certification of election results – are discretionary, not mandatory. Adams said she voted against the certification of results in the March 12 presidential preference primary because her requests for data were stymied by the board chair and county elections director. Adams said they continue to refuse to give her access to key information from the more recent primary, and so she is “unable to fulfill her oath of office.” The board certified the May 21 election results during a special meeting on Tuesday; Adams abstained. Before the vote, Adams said the county “must correct the way we do our elections.” In </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/05/26/nessel-benson-remind-county-canvassing-boards-about-their-duty-to-certify-election-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel were forced to issue a reminder to county canvassing boards of their obligation to certify election results. The reminder came after a delay by the Delta County Board of Canvassers to certify the county’s May 7 recall election after the two Republican members  cited, without evidence, irregularities in the vote totals. Following a letter from State Elections Director Jonathan Brater, the two dissenting members relented and voted to certify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7569" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Costs-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Costs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Costs.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Hand Counts:</strong> This week, the South Dakota state Board of Elections did not approve petitions from activists who want to </span><a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/briefs/activists-fail-to-convince-board-of-elections-to-move-toward-hand-counting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the state toward hand-counting ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the South Dakota Searchlight, a Republican state Senate candidate, Rick Weible, petitioned the board for declaratory rulings. The petitions asked the board to take several actions, including deeming certain election tabulating software non-compliant with state law and de-certifying its use. The board did not grant the requests. Board member Scott McGregor told the Searchlight afterward that Weible and his supporters routinely attend board meetings to pursue their agenda. “It’s all about going back to hand-counting our elections,” McGregor said. He added that Weible and others in attendance are misguided: The appointed board serves an administrative function and does not make law. “They need to talk to the Legislature,” McGregor said. Meanwhile, voters in three counties– Gregory, Haakon and Tripp–will see a ballot measure during the June 4 primary asking if they should ban the use of tabulator machines in future local elections. If the measures pass, the auditor’s offices in each county would have to hand-count ballots in the Nov. 5 general election and thereafter. </span></p>

Researchers used OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 to process the dataset, extracting information on compensation and determining which jobs belong to chief election officials.”We look forward to seeing what researchers are able to glean from this dataset,” wrote William T. Adler. “In particular, we invite researchers adept at natural language processing to analyze the text in these job descriptions. Are there any trends in which responsibilities are commonly listed over the years? Are certain responsibilities associated with higher pay? Are some responsibilities more common to smaller jurisdictions?” The decentralization of election administration in the U.S. makes it challenging to fully understand the election workforce. “We know little about how election officials are recruited, what qualities they are recruited for, and how compensation varies across the field.” Adler wrote. “We hope that this dataset is a useful resource for researchers aiming to better understand these critical questions.”</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: For the second time in as many years, the U.S. House voted on a bipartisan basis to block D.C. from allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections in the nation’s capital. Fifty-two Democrats joined Republicans in the vote — an uptick from the 42 who voted to strike down the D.C. law last year — and the bill passed by a vote of 262 to 143, just days before D.C.&#8217;s June 4 primary election. “I find it inconceivable that the Washington city council would intentionally dilute the voting power of their constituents,” said Rep. August Pfluger (R-Tex.), the bill’s sponsor. By D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton’s count, the noncitizen bill is one of 22 pieces of legislation Republicans have introduced this Congress to change D.C. election laws. The vote mirrored last year’s attempt to block noncitizen voting, when the House passed a resolution blocking D.C.’s Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022. But that resolution didn’t go anywhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, suggesting that this bill likely won’t either. On Tuesday, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) attempted to seek unanimous consent on the Senate floor to pass his legislation blocking noncitizen voting in D.C., but the effort failed because of an objection from Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), dimming chances for further success. “My view is the elected representatives [of D.C.] have the right and responsibility to pass laws that go with being a self-governing city council,” Welch said.</span></p>

House Elections Committee member Jay DeBoyer, a Republican from St. Clair County’s Clay Township had an exchange with one of the bill’s authors, Democratic state Senator Stephanie Chang of Detroit. “Removal of the ability of the Board of Canvassers to do an investigation,” DeJoyer said. “Why do we want to remove that right?” “In our conversations with Republican and Democratic county clerks, it became very clear that they don’t investigate and that they’re not trained to investigate. And they’re not doing their job. I trust our county clerk to know best how this should be handled,” Chang said. That, according to the legislation, is to refer any suspicion of election irregularities to prosecutors. Both bills passed the House Elections Committee on party line votes of six to two, Democrats in favor, Republicans against.</span></p>

During public comment a representative for the nonprofit Secure Democracy USA advocated the committee advance a draft bill allowing Montana citizens to register to vote online, which they say can be done via a secure portal. Democrats on the committee say this is a simple change that could increase participation in elections. “The world is online. And when I speak to young people at the door, they are shocked that they can’t register online. Because everything is online. We’ve heard it’s secure, we’ve heard they do it in 42 states,” said State Rep. Ed Stafman (D-Bozeman). Stafman made a motion to advance a bill draft to provide for online voter registration but withdrew it after other committee members, including State Sen. Janet Ellis (D-Helena), said they’d like to learn more before advancing any proposals. One Republican legislator expressed concern about security, saying they are staunchly against it. The committee will seek more information on the matter, including from the Secretary of State’s office, prior to their next meeting in July. At that time, the Committee will also continue discussing whether and how to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in elections.</span></p>

Chris Sununu could soon be facing a decision on whether to make a big change to voting procedures in a presidential election year. House Bill 1569 would require anyone who shows up to register to vote on Election Day to provide proof of citizenship through documents such as a birth certificate or a passport. Currently, New Hampshire uses an affidavit ballot for people who show up at the polls without ID. That system, signed into law just two years ago, allows for the affidavit ballot to be subtracted from the final tally of votes if the voter does not return with proof of identification within seven days. Some local election officials are balking at the bill&#8217;s implementation date, which would come before this year&#8217;s state primary. &#8220;The filing period for those elections is less than two weeks away,&#8221; said Nashua City Clerk Dan Healey. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the time for drastic election law changes, and I see some trouble implementing this.&#8221; The office of Secretary of State David Scanlan told News 9 that he&#8217;s not weighing in on the legislation. When and if Scanlan does take a position, it could be very influential with Sununu, who has said previously he&#8217;s not looking to make major changes to election law. &#8220;Secretary of State Scanlan and I work very, very well together,&#8221; Sununu said. &#8220;They&#8217;re the real experts in this, and if there&#8217;s a need – I don&#8217;t want to say I&#8217;ll completely defer to them, but I really lean on their expertise in this area.&#8221;</span></p>

Phil Baruth, the Senate President Pro Tem, echoed Casey&#8217;s statement and said the ban at polling sites will help protect key aspects of democracy. &#8220;We were looking at other places where democracy is vulnerable and some of those places are attacks on election workers, canvassing boards, but also just normal polling places,&#8221; Baruth said.</span></p>

The Division of Elections followed an “established interpretation” of the law, Assistant Attorney General Thomas Flynn told Rankin. Rankin heard arguments this week in Anchorage in a lawsuit filed by three voters that alleges the division has no authority to allow sponsors to fix errors in a filed initiative petition on a rolling or piecemeal basis and asking her to disqualify the measure from the November ballot. Rankin did not immediately rule. The two sides disagree on the interpretation of provisions of state law and regulation dealing with petition reviews. Attorneys for the state in court records said the division found problems with more than 60 petition booklets — most involving a person whose notary commission had expired — and began notifying the initiative sponsors of the problems on Jan. 18, six days after the petition was turned in. The sponsors began returning corrected booklets on Feb. 12, and returned 62 corrected booklets before the division completed its signature count on March 8, Flynn and fellow attorney Lael Harrison wrote. No additional signatures were gathered during that time, they said. “To say that what the division did is contrary to the regulation is not right,” Flynn said this week. But attorneys for the plaintiffs have countered that there is no law or regulation allowing the division to give select booklets back to the sponsors for fixes while the division’s verification process for the remaining booklets is underway. </span></p>

Republicans in Legislative District 29 voted to add James Taylor to the ballot to replace Rep. Austin Smith (R-Wittman), who withdrew from the race. State law allows local political parties to replace withdrawn candidates but it says they must do so before the county prints ballots. Rosa Aguilar, an attorney for Maricopa County, told Sinclair that the county started the printing process on May 13, days before LD29 Republicans attempted to submit Taylor’s nomination to the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office. “The county then began the ballot-printing process and actually began printing the ballots in order to prove them on May 16,” Aguilar said. Aguilar said that if the county is forced to add Taylor to the ballot now, it would negate 15 days of ballot preparations, which could result in errors on ballots and missed deadlines. “And so there would be great harm in pausing that process in terms of the state and federal deadlines for mailing the ballots to early voters and active military and overseas voters,” she said. June 15 is the last day for the county to mail ballots to overseas and military voters. But Rep. Alexander Kolodin (R-Scottsdale), an attorney representing the Maricopa County Republican Committee, accused Maricopa County of political gamesmanship. Kolodin asked Sinclair to stop Maricopa County’s ballot-printing process until she can hold a hearing to consider the request to place Taylor on the ballot. Aguilar objected to that request, saying the county is on a tight deadline to print ballots in time for the election. Sinclair disagreed, saying the temporary restraining order was necessary until she can make a final decision about whether to order the county to place Taylor’s name on the ballot. She scheduled a hearing to consider all evidence in the case for Wednesday morning.</span></p>

Baker said the lawsuit filed against the winner in the election, Allen Long, and the county registrar of voters, was vague and not timely. The lawsuit &#8220;clearly does not spell out sufficient grounds for an election contest,&#8221; Baker said. He also said the lawsuit was left to languish without the person who filed the suit not taking prompt action to move the case forward. He further added that defendants in the lawsuit were not given timely notice of the lawsuit against them. &#8220;I think there was a lack of diligence in getting the parties served in this election contest,&#8221; Baker said. Laura Hobbs, who came in second in the primary election, sued Long and retired Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen, claiming election fraud. Hobbs has long been a critic of local elections. She has been a regular speaker at Board of Supervisors meetings, bringing with her graphs that she says show elections irregularities.</span></p>

All seven justices voted to uphold a District Court ruling that determined the initiative did not contain an unfunded mandate and that the initiative’s description of effect was sufficient.  In December, with the help of Democratic-linked attorneys, Nevada voter Jennifer Fleischmann with Make the Road Nevada filed a complaint aiming to block the initiative, arguing that the initiative was vague, would require an unfunded government expenditure and that each of the forms of ID that Gibbs lists in the petition would generally require the payment of a fee to a government entity. Justices found that her argument is a substantive challenge, which the court cannot consider at the pre-election stage, leaving the door open to litigation after the election, if it passes. They also determined the description of the initiative’s effect is legally sufficient. “Indeed, the description of effect addresses the primary objective of the Initiative and its intended effects — an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to require voters to present valid identification when voting in person at the polls,” the justices determined.</span></p>

In a</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24699527/usps-filed-complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed this week in the U.S. District Court of Nevada, the Washoe County’s District Attorney’s Office said that parts of the Postal Service’s 10-year plan to transform its operations — which includes the Reno to Sacramento move — violate federal law because the agency did not seek an advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the agency. Such opinions are required when a Postal Service proposal would “affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis.” Prosecutors specifically argued that the Postal Service must receive an advisory opinion on the aspect of the 10-year plan that calls for nationwide changes to processing facilities — including those in Tallahassee and Portland — because it would “create a mail delay across the United States.” The lawsuit seeks to halt any further action until the agency seeks an advisory opinion from the commission.  The lawsuit, which Washoe County commissioners approved filing, is the latest effort by the chorus of state and federal politicians to delay or stop the move — including members of Nevada’s congressional delegation, the Washoe County Commission, secretary of state’s office and governor — over its potential effects on the region’s economy and mail ballots.</span></p>

The charges, which were first reported by CNN, were filed in Rockingham County, Belknap County, Grafton County and Merrimack County, where 13 different New Hampshire residents received versions of the call in January. In conjunction with the New Hampshire indictment, the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed fining Kramer $6 million for spoofing the phone number of a former state Democratic party official as part of the scheme. That official, Kathy Sullivan, headed up a super PAC that was running a write-in campaign for Biden, and residents who received the robocall warning them not to vote were directed to her number for more information.</span></p>

The plaintiffs, four voters who were accused of committing voter fraud, will not be allowed to sue those attorneys for libel, the court decided. The plaintiffs claimed that they were defamed and subjected to national media attention and public embarrassment after Gov. Pat McCrory’s camp encouraged a local voter to file an election protest saying they had either voted in multiple states or were prohibited from voting by felony status.  A lower court initially ruled that while the voter who submitted the election protests was shielded from liability, defendants who provided information but did not file the reports themselves could be sued, because they were not actively participating in a “quasi-judicial election protest proceeding.”  In his</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/supreme-court-ruling-Bouvier-Porter.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chief Justice Paul Newby said that absolute privilege “broadly protects” individuals involved in an election protest from defamation claims, and the participation requirement established by the state appeals court was baseless.  “The public has an interest in judicial and quasi-judicial bodies arriving at the truth in matters brought before them and in the ‘due administration of justice.’ … To that end, the absolute privilege must apply broadly to anyone involved in any aspect of an election protest, even if they did not actually ‘participate’ as a party, counsel, witness or the like at a subsequent proceeding,” Newby wrote, describing the attorney defendants as “inextricably intertwined” in the process of filing the election protests.  The broad application of absolute privilege protection is “critical,” Newby said, in fast-paced proceedings like election protests, where the Board of Elections is trying to rapidly report all votes on a timeline that “does not lend itself to exhaustive discovery and absolute precision.”</span></p>

The motion for summary judgment came in a lawsuit filed in December under the Americans with Disabilities Act by the League of Women Voters of Ohio and voter Jennifer Kucera, who was born with a form of muscular dystrophy, against Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU of Ohio, American Civil Liberties Union and law firm of Covington &amp; Burling. The filing in the U.S. District Court in Cleveland argues that the law prohibits all but a short list of qualifying family members from helping those with disabilities deliver their ballots, excluding potential helpers such as professional caregivers, roommates, in-laws and grandchildren. The law, which went into effect in April 2023, makes it a felony for anyone who isn’t an election official or mail carrier to possess or return the absentee ballot of a voter with a disability, unless the person assisting them falls within a prescribed list of close relatives. Republicans who advanced the law argued that its provisions were designed to protect election integrity and restore voter confidence at a time of great doubt. Voting rights advocates say many voters with disabilities are unable to travel to their polling place and many are unable to access their mailbox or ballot dropbox.</span></p>

Filed against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt and the boards of elections in Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, the groups argue that rejecting mail-in ballots for miswritten or blank dates violates the Pennsylvania Constitution, which mandates free and equal elections. “Our state constitution is clear: every vote matters in Pennsylvania,” Ben Geffen, senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, said in a news release. “Procedures that needlessly block even a single eligible voter from exercising that most fundamental right are suspect. This pointless handwritten date requirement — which every year causes thousands of eligible voters’ ballots to be rejected for harmless clerical errors — cannot continue in Pennsylvania.” State and county officials have sought to limit mail-in ballot rejections since 2020, when mail-in voter turnout first skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. “In the years of litigation over this issue, it has become irrefutably clear that the handwritten date serves no function in the administration of Pennsylvania’s election,” said Ellen Lyon, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State. “As a result, the Department has consistently argued in court that voters should not be disenfranchised for failing to write or incorrectly writing a date that serves no function.” Under the law, though, the department’s hands remain tied, Lyon added. “Given existing court rulings and pending any further legal developments, our guidance on undated and incorrectly dated ballots remains unchanged: all voters must sign and date their declaration envelope in order to have their vote counted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centre County Judge Julia Rater has </span><a href="https://wjactv.com/news/local/judge-dismisses-legal-challenge-improperly-dated-mail-in-ballots-centre-county-election-lawsuit-court-pennsylvania-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed a challenge </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on whether close to 100 mail-in ballots, from last month’s primary election, should be counted as valid votes. Rater has ruled the appeal not to count the ballots was filed too late. The group challenging the 95 ballots claimed they weren&#8217;t valid due to problems with how they were dated, or not dated, and that didn&#8217;t follow the state&#8217;s guidelines for mail-in ballots. Initially, the ballots were flagged for possible problems during the primary election count on April 23rd, but Centre County&#8217;s election board eventually decided to include them in the final vote count, which sparked the legal challenge.</span></p>

A</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1353201/dl"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consent agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island on Thursday responds to  allegations that Pawtucket election officials failed to give assistance in Spanish to voters with limited English proficiency. City officials dispute the allegations. Under the federal Voting Rights Act, bilingual ballots are required in any voting jurisdiction where residents with limited English proficiency account for more than 5% of the voting population. As of January 2024, the DOJ said Pawtucket had 45,254 total active registered voters, of whom 9,961 — 22% — had Spanish surnames. Federal officials had also alleged that Pawtucket election officials refused to allow voters who were qualified to cast a provisional ballot to do so, adding that workers were not trained over these requirements. “The right to vote is the right on which all others depend,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island Zachary Cunha said in a statement. “This office will remain vigilant in enforcing our civil rights laws to ensure that illegal barriers to access do not keep Americans from casting their ballots.” The DOJ alerted the city about its investigation in February, said Rhode Island Board of Elections spokesperson Chris Hunter. Federal officials previously monitored Pawtucket’s elections during the 2023 special primary and general elections to make sure the state follows the Voting Rights Act.</span></p>

The Supreme Court&#8217;s 6-3 decision, split along ideological lines, could have significant implications for future redistricting efforts nationwide. The conservative majority determined that civil rights groups did not provide enough evidence to prove that race was a primary factor in the redrawing of South Carolina’s congressional map. The case revolved around the Charleston-area district represented by Republican Nancy Mace. Civil rights groups argued that more than 30,000 Black voters were removed from this district, making it harder for Democrats to compete and easier for Republicans to win. The decision comes months after a lower court ruled that lawmakers violated the Constitution by discriminating against Black voters.  The Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling affirms the argument made by Republican state officials, who say that their goal was solely to bolster Republican strength in the district.  Brenda Murphy, president of the South Carolina NAACP, reacted to the decision, expressing disappointment. &#8220;Today, the Supreme Court has failed the American people,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;Voting rights have taken another gut punch, and the future of democracy in South Carolina is dangling by a thread.&#8221;</span></p>
