														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The US Isn’t the Only Nation Going to the Polls</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-six other countries hold elections this year</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Wendy Underhill<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The November election is a great big deal: We call it a “presidential” election, but there will also be races for 33 U.S. Senate seats, all 435 U.S. House seats, 5,793 state legislative seats along with thousands of other offices and ballot questions.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_11746" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11746" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11746" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.15.25 AM-300x230.png" alt="" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.15.25 AM-300x230.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.15.25 AM-1024x785.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.15.25 AM-768x589.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.15.25 AM-1536x1178.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.15.25 AM.png 1706w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11746" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Dogs at polling stations in England  [The Guardian.}</em></p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the U.S. is by no means the only country with big-deal elections this year. Seventy-six other countries hold national elections in 2024, according to the</span><a href="https://electionguide.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> International Foundation for Electoral Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many have made headlines already: Taiwan in January, France in June and the United Kingdom in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do these elections compare with those in the U.S.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s much the same across the globe. All countries have mechanisms for identifying who can vote and processes to ensure votes are accurately counted and reported, and they’re doing what they can to protect elections from cyberattacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, much varies internationally in terms of how ballots are cast, how many people participate, who’s in charge and much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How People Vote</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is an outlier among nations in offering</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two-thirds of the states. Globally, the norm is in-person voting. Over time, an increasing number of U.S. voters have cast absentee, or mail, ballots, including</span><a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/HowWeVotedIn2022.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a third of all voters in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (</span><a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/tools/special-voting-arrangements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International IDEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), just 17% of other nations offer what it calls “postal voting.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_11750" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11750" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11750" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.27.17 AM-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.27.17 AM-300x167.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.27.17 AM-1024x569.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.27.17 AM-768x427.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.27.17 AM.png 1246w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11750" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Voting in Mexico in June. [Yahir Ceballos/Reuters]</em></p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">More nations—35%—offer early in-person voting. (In the U.S.,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early in-person voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available in 46 states.) “Early in-person voting maintains most of the strengths of in-person voting on Election Day,” says Oliver Joseph, an adviser at International IDEA. “Early voters cast their ballot in a controlled environment, mitigating potential or perceived issues with protecting voters’ freedom of choice and secret ballot.” In many cases, voters in other countries have just one day to vote and just one location to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some countries—India, notably—elections take place on a rolling schedule over many weeks as election officials move the voting operation from region to region. Although the election itself lasts for up to eight weeks, the voting window is brief: Voters must cast their ballots while the operation is in town or forfeit their democratic right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the U.S. is simply unusual in providing so many options for voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Who Runs Elections<br />
</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A core attribute of U.S. elections is that they are decentralized—each state sets its own rules on how its elections are run, and in most states the actual work of running elections is done through local jurisdictions. Nationwide, about 8,000 local entities run elections.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_11745" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11745" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-11745" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.20.21 AM-300x202.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.20.21 AM-300x202.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.20.21 AM-1024x688.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.20.21 AM-768x516.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-11.20.21 AM.png 1488w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11745" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Rwanda National Electoral Commission (NEC) in Kigali [Luis Tato/AFP]</em></p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most countries have a centralized </span><a href="http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/em/ema/ema07"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electoral management body</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or EMB, that has some role in establishing consistent electoral processes. EMBs are not all the same: an independent entity oversees elections in 64% of 204 countries, a government agency does the job in 21%, and responsibility is shared in 13%, according to</span><a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/question-region?question_id=9388&amp;countries=all&amp;database_theme=308"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IDEA’s Electoral Management Design database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Two percent of nations do not hold national elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “independent” EMBs may be accountable to a legislature or other entity in some way. In some countries, the EMB may be a commission comprising individuals from multiple political parties; this is common in Central and Eastern Europe. In Australia, Canada and many other countries, election administration is in the hands of nonpartisan professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the U.S. system is unusual. Two-thirds of states rely on partisan elected officials—often the secretary of state or lieutenant governor—to oversee elections. The rest use a bipartisan state board of some kind for this work. (For more, see this</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NCSL brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter who manages an election at the top, what matters to voters is a smooth, easy process at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voter Turnout</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter turnout has been relatively high in recent years when compared with the last two to three decades. In 2020, nationwide turnout was 66% of the eligible population, according to</span><a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/national-turnout-rates-graph/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the University of Florida Election Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the highest of any election since 1900. In 2022, turnout was over</span></p>

[Rimon Rimon/AFP]</em></p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">45%, reasonably high for a midterm election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent rise in turnout at home, these numbers are relatively low compared with those in many European nations. Iceland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden all saw greater than 70% turnout of their voting-age population in their most recent national parliamentary elections, according to International IDEA’s</span><a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout-database"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voter Turnout database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The turnout gap may relate to a country’s political culture, excitement over candidates or even the weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 27 countries, turnout is particularly high because voting is required. In Australia, for instance, turnout regularly</span><a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/country?country=14&amp;database_theme=293"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hovers around 90%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. compulsory voting, aka universal voting, sounds radical, but there are proponents—read all about it in the book “</span><a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/100-democracy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Case for Universal Voting,” by E.J. Dionne Jr. and Miles Rapoport. They</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/lift-every-voice-the-urgency-of-universal-civic-duty-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make the case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that voting is a civic responsibility no less important than jury duty. Universal voting bills have been introduced in Washington and Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one thing that’s certain here, there and everywhere: Deciding not to vote is a choice that affects the outcome of elections just as voting itself does.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More US-Global Comparisons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter registration is compulsory in some form in more than half of countries globally, according to the</span><a href="https://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDTable?view=country&amp;question=VR008"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ACE Project’s Electoral Knowledge Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is an outlier in having so much of our governmental structure selected directly by the voters. We elect people to serve in our governing bodies including Congress, legislatures and county, municipal, school and special districts. We also directly elect people to carry out administrative functions, such as state-level constitutional officers and local treasurers, sheriffs, coroners and more. In many countries, the ballot is simply for the candidate or party of your choice, and the party then decides who fills specific rolls.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Direct democracy,” by which voters cast ballots for or against specific policy choices, is more common here than elsewhere. Nationwide, 26 states have citizen initiatives, and many local jurisdictions allow citizens to put their ideas on ballots, too. Internationally, these measures are referred to as referendums. In 2022, the most recent year in which federal or statewide elections were held, 141 statewide ballot measures were decided in 38 states, according to</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/statewide-ballot-measures-database"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NCSL research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number of local measures was far higher.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States use varying forms of voter identification to ensure that only eligible people can vote. Voter registration is the starting point for that, and two-thirds of the states ask for identification at the polls as well. Around the globe, where in-person Election Day voting is standard, dying a finger or thumb with ink to indicate a person has voted is a common approach to preventing double voting. So is using a state-issued identity card that serves for much more than just voting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By far, most U.S. elections are “winner take all,” where the candidate with the most votes wins—even if that person’s share of the vote is under 50%. Some states and local jurisdictions do use other systems that require getting a majority of votes to win: A handful of states use runoffs for primary elections, and use of ranked choice voting, while rare, has increased over the last decade. Internationally, two-round elections, or runoffs, are rarely used for electing legislatures but are not uncommon for electing presidents, particularly in countries with constitutional or cultural links to France (former French colonies), IDEA’s Joseph says. “Ranked choice voting is also used in Australia for the lower House of Representatives, in Papua New Guinea and previously in Fiji. It was used for city mayors in England, too, until 2022, when the national government reverted to a plurality, first-past-the-post system.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When elections are held varies. In many countries, the government can “call” an election at any point within a prescribed window; the elections are conducted weeks later. That means there is no set calendar. (It also means campaigns are short!) The U.S. has an ironclad schedule for federal and state elections. Americans vote on the same day every two years for federal offices (president, U.S. Senate and U.S. House). When state races are held is equally clear: Most are held with federal elections, but four states use the odd-numbered years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When local elections happen depends on the state. Historically, local jurisdictions could decide when they wanted to run their elections. Over time, many states have defined specific dates, and a small but growing number of states require that local elections be on the same day as state elections. (See</span><a href="https://www.sightline.org/2024/06/10/when-do-cities-hold-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Sightline Institute.) The term internationally is “synchronized elections.” Some countries allow them; others prohibit them. “Those that outlaw them fear that national sentiment may influence voter choice on local issues,” Joseph says. “On the other side, synchronized elections are much cheaper. Sweden holds national and subnational elections all on the same day every four years, with the exception of European parliamentary elections.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One common thread across all nations is the need for people to do the on-the-ground work. Poll workers check voter eligibility, hand out ballots, set up polling locations—the list goes on. In the U.S., just about anyone can serve; around the globe, teachers are often tapped. Aug. 1, 2024, is</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/poll-worker-resources-election-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National Poll Worker Recruitment Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington sent a letter this month to Elon Musk complaining that the platform’s AI chatbot, Grok, produced false information about state ballot deadlines shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race. The secretaries of state requested that the chatbot instead direct users who ask election-related questions to CanIVote.org, a voting information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of State. Before listing responses to election-related questions, the chatbot now says, “For accurate and up-to-date information about the 2024 U.S. Elections, please visit Vote.gov.” Grok is available only to subscribers of the premium versions of X. But the five secretaries of state who signed the letter said election misinformation from Grok has been shared across multiple social media platforms, reaching millions of people. Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said. The platform did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

The </span><a href="https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/elections/lehigh-county-officials-warn-of-voter-registration-text-scam"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lehigh County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Elections and others have  warned voters to beware of scammers impersonating county election officials through text messages. County officials said they learned that local voters are being targeted through &#8220;smishing&#8221; attacks. Smishing is a technique in which bad actors try to extract someone&#8217;s personal data by texting them a malicious link. In this case, the victims are told in a text that something is wrong with their voter registration. The text instructs them to follow a link to update their registration information. “This is yet another attempt to sow confusion, distrust and misinformation in our election process and disenfranchise duly registered voters,” </span><a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/doylestown/sections/elections/articles/bucks-county-election-officials-say-rogue-groups-calling-residents-to-spread-voter-disinformation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bucks County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Elections Chairman and Commissioner Bob Harvie said in a statement. “The Bucks County Board of Elections condemns this fraudulent activity in the strongest possible terms and has referred these messages to the District Attorney.” Sean Drasher, who is the director of elections and voter registration in </span><a href="https://www.wgal.com/article/south-central-pennsylvania-voters-question-text-message-about-registration-status/61960563"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lebanon County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said his office has heard from dozens of people about this text message. While there are some legitimate organizations that try to get voters registered, he said voters should not have to figure which ones are legit through text messages. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t rely on third parties because it&#8217;s just too hard for us to say what&#8217;s safe, what isn&#8217;t safe, what&#8217;s accurate or isn&#8217;t accurate. I know what is accurate, and that&#8217;s vote.pa.gov.

Following the 2020 General Election, Wu was deeply impacted by the false accusations of voting and election fraud that sought to undermine voting rights. She experienced an epiphany after the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. She felt called to apply her experiences and knowledge to play a more direct role in empowering historically excluded communities to realize their political power and potential. “Most Americans don’t know what it took to run elections securely, transparently accessibly, and with integrity in the midst of a pandemic. Many of the challenges we saw in 2020 continue to exist today. That’s why I decided to write this too,” Wu said.

CSSE’s pocket-sized guides contain key provisions of each state’s laws that help equip law enforcement officers with the information they need to protect election officials and voters from violence, threats and intimidation.  The Committee began producing these quick reference guides in 2022 in response to a growing culture of intimidation against election officials. CSSE’s inaugural Chair Neal Kelley had used similar pocket guides to quickly and accurately determine his legal responsibilities during traffic stops while working as a police officer in Southern California. Kelley went on to serve as Registrar of Voters for Orange County from 2005 to 2022 and recognized an urgent need for comparable resources to help law enforcement officers uphold and enforce election laws. “In law enforcement, you never want to be in a tense situation without adequate preparation,” says CSSE member Justin Smith, the former sheriff of Larimer County, Colo. “Our partners in the field have been extremely receptive to these guides because they recognize the need to better understand and plan for security challenges on and around Election Day.”</span></p>

In a time of heightened concern about our democracy, understanding public sentiment on elections, voting, and political violence is crucial. Over the past year, from June 2023 to June 2024, States United’s Research and Analytics team conducted five national surveys to assess these attitudes. Despite deep polarization and widespread misinformation about elections, the results are promising. Polling indicates that a solid foundation of support for the traditions, norms, and institutions of democracy persists among Americans.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some highlights:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are worried about the overall quality of American democracy today, but they still hold pro-democracy views.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election denial is not an effective campaign strategy.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans have high levels of trust in a variety of methods for voting and for counting votes.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition of people opposed to political violence is broad and crosses party lines. The widespread opposition to the use of political violence suggests that there is an opportunity to counter violent threats, harassment, and rhetoric. </span></li>

Jeff Landry announced this week. Landry signed an</span><a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/ExecutiveOrders/2024/JML-Executive-Order-136.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring that notice August 26. The order also instructs the state Office of Motor Vehicles to share with the secretary of state&#8217;s office the names of noncitizens and non-permanent residents of Louisiana — an estimated more than 40,000 people — to ensure their names are not on the voter rolls. &#8220;The right to vote in United States elections is a privilege that&#8217;s reserved for American citizens,&#8221; he said.  Landry’s order, issued just over two months before the November presidential election, in part codifies existing practice. It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal and state elections, and the state already uses data from the Office of Motor Vehicles and Social Security Administration to verify those who register to vote, said Secretary of State Nancy Landry, who joined Landry Monday, as did Attorney General Liz Murrill. The secretary’s office also cross-references voter rolls with jury questionnaires that indicate citizenship status, the secretary said.</span></p>

August 22 marked a key milestone in the 2024 election – the day the Secretary of State was tasked with making the final certification of which candidates and ballot measures will appear before voters in November. Just before 7:30 p.m. Thursday, the office’s website added Constitutional Initiatives 126 and 127 to its list of issues qualified for the ballot. Montanans for Election Reform, the committee sponsoring the two amendments, celebrated the announcement in a statement. “We’re grateful to make it through the final step of the certification process and see the will of over 100,000 Montanans who want to see these initiatives on the ballot honored,” said Frank Garner, an MER board member. “Our citizens&#8217; initiative process is critical for us to uphold Montana values and hold our politicians accountable. We’re excited to spend the next few months talking with voters across the state about how CI-126 and CI-127 will give voters better choices and allow us to vote for the person, not the party.” CI-126 would create a “top-four primary” in Montana. All candidates from all parties would appear on a single primary ballot, and the four who received the most votes – regardless of party – would go on to the November general election. CI-127 would require the general election winner to get a majority of the vote – at least 50%. It would be up to the Legislature to decide how to implement that, with some possible options being a runoff election or a ranked-choice voting system.</span></p>

This resolution also expresses support for the use of ranked-choice voting in Princeton’s municipal and school board elections once the bill is approved by the state. Princeton Council President Mia Sacks issued the following statement on behalf of the council: “Princeton’s local Democratic club, the Princeton Community Democratic Organization (PCDO), which endorses candidates, and the Princeton Democratic Municipal Committee, which determines ballot placement, have successfully used ranked choice voting for local candidates for the last half decade.

Proctor dismissed multiple claims made by civil rights groups against the new law, known as</span><a href="https://arc-sos.state.al.us/ucp/L1499132.AI1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 1.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Proctor, appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican, only allowed a challenge to the law’s prohibition on assistance to mailing absentee ballot applications and gift and payment prohibitions to move forward. Proctor also dismissed claims against Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen. The law, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a person to knowingly receive payment for “distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining or delivering” an absentee ballot application. If a person knowingly pays or provides a gift to a “third party to distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, complete, obtain or deliver,” they could face a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

In a brief order, the court’s five members upheld a lower court decision that certified Ballot Measure 2, which would repeal the laws that created the state’s ranked choice general election and open primary election.  The order came shortly after justices heard oral arguments in an appeal claiming that the Alaska Division of Elections improperly certified the measure. “Today the Court quickly affirmed that the Division of Elections properly interpreted and applied the law in qualifying this initiative for the November ballot,” said Senior Assistant Attorney General Lael Harrison, in a statement issued by email. “The Department of Law is grateful to the Court for their timely review and decision on this issue, in plenty of time for the Division’s upcoming ballot printing deadlines.” At issue in the appeal was whether the Division of Elections could legally allow petitioners to correct some flaws with petition signature books after they had been submitted to the division. Plaintiffs had argued that the division did not have the power to allow post-deadline corrections under existing law, something the division has allowed since at least 2019.  If plaintiffs had won, the division would have been required to discard some petition books, denying repeal supporters enough signatures for a vote this fall. Justices did not immediately explain their reasoning but said they affirm the lower court’s decision.</span></p>

Under Arizona law, such residents are only permitted to vote in federal elections, regardless of how they registered. The emergency stay follows the August 2 ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that vacated the initial panel’s temporary ruling to block voters registering with the state form without providing documented proof of citizenship. Those registrants will now be added to the voter rolls, but will only be allowed to vote in federal elections, as was the practice before the initial panel’s ruling. Arizona residents who try to register to vote with the widely used state form will have their registration rejected unless they provide proof of U.S. citizenship, under a temporary ruling Thursday from a federal appeals court. Previously, residents without citizenship documents would have been allowed to use the state form, which almost all Arizonans use, to get registered, but they could vote only in federal elections — for U.S. House, Senate and president. That’s because Arizona law requires voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, whereas federal law requires only an attestation that a voter is a citizen, but not documentation proving it. Under a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the state must permit voters who registered without citizenship proof to cast ballots in federal elections, so Arizona has maintained separate rolls of so-called federal-only voters. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, granted a partial stay of a lower-court ruling that struck down newer Arizona laws on federal-only voters. As long as the stay is in place, those voters can register to vote and cast ballots in federal elections only if they use a federal voter registration form, something few people currently do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arizona Supreme Court sided with legislators over a trial court judge who concluded their </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/08/28/prop-140-supreme-court-lets-legislatures-description-of-open-primaries-measure-stand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">description of a ballot proposition to end partisan primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was “misleading,” overturning the lower court’s ruling. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Melissa Iyer Julian previously ruled that a legislative panel responsible for writing summaries of ballot measures that are sent to every Arizona voter wrote a description of Proposition 140, a citizen initiative also known as the Make Elections Fair Act, that was intentionally misleading. If voters approve it in November, the measure would create an open primary system where all candidates for federal, state and local offices would face off in a single primary election instead of segregated partisan elections. Those primaries would also include candidates who are politically unaffiliated.  All registered voters would be able to choose from all the candidates in the primary, and the top vote-getters would advance to the general election, even if they don’t represent different parties. The trial court ruled that the legislature’s description does not supply the proper context on voter ranking and renders the description misleading. But the Arizona Supreme Court disagreed. “We unanimously conclude that the [Legislative] Council’s analysis substantially complies [with the law],” Chief Justice Ann Scott Timmer wrote in the ruling. “The Council’s analysis in the first numbered paragraph therefore accurately describes this provision by stating that the Initiative would amend the constitution to ‘[a]llow for the use of voter ranking at all elections held in this state to determine which candidate received the highest number of votes.’”</span></p>

A group opposed to using ballot machines to count votes has tried to put forth ballot petitions across the state that would ban voting machines and requiring votes be counted by hand. Nine hand-counting petitions were thrown out over alleged clerical errors. The lawsuits say this choice is improper and the petition should be put on the ballot for voters to decide. The lawsuits are being brought by attorney Clinton W. Lancaster. Lancaster is working with Conrad Reynolds, the CEO of Voter Integrity Arkansas. Reynolds thinks something nefarious could be going on inside the machines; he isn’t specifically sure what is happening, but has told Little Rock Public Radio that the machines could be “flipping votes” in between them being cast and printed out. The petition Reynolds and Lancaster are trying to put forward is called “The Hand-Marked, Hand-Counted Paper Ballot Ordinance of 2024.” It would prevent the use of voting machines when counting ballots, except for people with disabilities. Under the ballot initiative, votes would be required to be counted by “human intelligence.” Clerks in several Arkansas counties tossed a petition to mandate hand counting for several reasons, including a determination that some of the petitioners lived out of state. Lancaster is asking for courts to enjoin the clerks from rejecting the amendments and to put the measure on the counties’ ballot.</span></p>

According to court documents, between September 2021 and August 2022, Brockbank allegedly used two social media accounts to post messages threatening Colorado and Arizona election officials. For example, on Aug. 4, 2022, Brockbank allegedly posted a message referring to separate election officials in Arizona and Colorado and then stated: “Once those people start getting put to death then the rest will melt like snowflakes and turn on each other. . . . This is the only way. So those of us that have the stomach for what has to be done should prepare our minds for what we all [a]re going to do!!!!!! It is time.” “We allege that the defendant made detailed death threats against election officials, judges, and law enforcement officers,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Violent threats against public servants are a danger to our democracy, and the arrest and charges announced today make clear that the Justice Department will see to it that perpetrators answer for their actions.”</span></p>

The lawsuit, filed before a state judge in Atlanta, argues the rules violate a state law that makes certification a mandatory duty. The suit asks the judge to find the rules are invalid because the State Election Board, now dominated by allies of former President Donald Trump, is exceeding its legal authority. The lawsuit says the rules invite post-election chaos, that the board is defying state law that says county officials “shall certify” results, and that more than a century of court precedent in Georgia finds county officials have no wiggle room. “According to their drafters, these rules rest on the assumption that certification of election results by a county board is discretionary and subject to free-ranging inquiry that may delay certification or foreclose it entirely. But that is not the law in Georgia” states the lawsuit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court.</span></p>

The indictments come with maximum prison sentences of 10 years, a departure from most election violations that typically result in fines and reprimands. Few cases of illegal voting have been proved after investigations of the 2020 election or since then. Grand juries in Forsyth and Fannin counties this month indicted the defendants for casting in-person ballots in Georgia and voting again in other states — Arizona and Texas — during the November 2022 midterm elections. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger sought the prosecutions based on data generated by ERIC. “Any illegal vote undermines a citizen’s legal vote,” Raffensperger said. “One citizen, one vote — anyone who tries to run up the scoreboard will be prosecuted.”</span></p>

The court&#8217;s 4-3 ruling along party lines held that Benson had the authority under Michigan election law to issue the guidance on election challenger credentialing and requirements regarding how and to whom challenges are reported without going through a longer rules-making process. “Under the Michigan Election Law, the secretary of state is the chief election officer of Michigan, and as such, the secretary has supervisory control over local election officials in the performance of their duties,” Justice Kyra Harris Bolden wrote in the majority opinion for the court&#8217;s four Democratic-nominated justices. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by several election challengers and the state and national Republican parties that challenged a manual issued by Benson to clerks in 2022 that set out instructions for election challengers. Among that set of instructions were a uniform credential form for challengers, limits on when their challenges should be recorded and bans on electronic device possession in closed-door absentee voting counting rooms while polling precincts are open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican National Committee has filed a lawsuit against Detroit, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/rnc-sues-detroit-republican-election-inspectors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleging that city officials haven&#8217;t hired enough Republican election inspectors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under Michigan law, commissioners &#8220;shall appoint at least one election inspector from each major political party and shall appoint an equal number, as nearly as possible, of election inspectors in each election precinct from each major political party.&#8221;  Election inspectors are hired, paid and trained to assist with local elections at voting sites, according to the Michigan Secretary of State&#8217;s website. They greet and check in voters, issue ballots, assist with tabulation and sometimes assist with absentee ballots.  The suit names City Clerk Janice Winfrey, City Council President Mary Sheffield and Corporation Counsel Conrad Mallet as plaintiffs for their positions as part of the Election Commission of the City of Detroit.  According to the lawsuit, the city appointed 310 Republican election inspectors and 2,337 Democrats for the primary election on Aug. 6. This means that of the 335 precincts, 300 failed to comply with the &#8220;equal number, as nearly as possible&#8221; for election workers from each major party, and 202 precincts didn&#8217;t have a Republican election inspector, according to the suit. Of the 310 Republicans that were appointed, only 52 of the 675 nominated by Gnacke-Nemeth were appointed. The lawsuit is demanding that Detroit appoint more Republican election inspectors to &#8220;correct the imbalance&#8221; and &#8220;adhere to legal requirements&#8221; ahead of the November election.</span></p>

The secretary here made a unilateral determination on his own to declare our statutes unconstitutional,” Seu told the justices. “The court should correct this overreach.”</span></p>

In a lawsuit filed over the weekend with the New Jersey Superior Court, the Cumberland GOP organization and three of its countywide candidates allege that the Cumberland County Clerk’s new design violates state laws dictating the design of general election ballots and demands that the county’s ballots be redesigned. Under the clerk’s new design, candidates are grouped by office with no regard for their party, and random drawings were conducted to determine the candidate order for each office. The results of the drawing were that the top position on the ballot went to third-party candidates for president and U.S. Senate, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis) for Congress, and Cumberland County Clerk Celeste Riley – a Democrat who has said she’s recusing herself from election matters this year – for county clerk; Democrats also got first and third position in the race for two county commissioner seats. According to Deputy County Clerk Sandra Olbrich, the new design was made in order to save taxpayer money and reduce voter confusion. But the Cumberland GOP’s lawsuit argues that the design will increase voter confusion, and that it violates a host of state laws governing how ballots must be prepared. Specifically, state law dictates that general election ballots utilize columns to organize candidates by party, and that Democrats and Republicans be given the first two spots before any other candidates are placed on the ballot.</span></p>

Prosecutors allege that Torres personally pocketed $28,000 by gatekeeping plum poll worker assignments. In an indictment unsealed this week, they say that since 2019 Torres has ordered residents to pay her and a “Bronx organization” $150 in order to be selected for one of the poll worker positions. Authorities have not named the organization. People who work as poll workers on Election Day and all nine days of early voting can earn up to $2,750. People who work just one day make only $250 a day. Torres is also accused of falsifying records so she could obtain checks in the name of no-show poll workers, which she would later divide with the Bronx organization. In a statement announcing the indictment, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Torres “brazenly abused her power and lined her own pockets for over five years by demanding that poll workers pay her bribes in order to work as a poll worker and by falsifying records to make it look like certain individuals worked as poll workers during an election even though they never did.&#8221;</span></p>

North Carolina is one of 14 states that ban photographs of completed ballots. According to the state board of elections, the ban is a defense against vote-buying schemes because they can be used as “proof of a vote for a candidate.” Two weeks after Libertarian activist Susan Hogarth posted a photo of herself with her ballot to the social media site X, Hogarth received a letter from the state elections board, informing her that photographing her ballot is a class 1 misdemeanor under state law, and requesting that she remove the photo from social media or face the possibility of being referred to a district attorney for criminal prosecution. A class 1 misdemeanor in North Carolina is punishable by a fine and up to 45 days of jail time for a first-time offender. Hogarth said it wasn&#8217;t the first time she&#8217;s posted a ballot selfie, but the state has never responded to hers in the past. She did not take down her the post. Instead, she took the matter to court.&#8221;The idea that you should have a secret ballot has sort of morphed into the idea that you should keep your ballot secret. And I think those are two different things,&#8221; Hogarth told WRAL News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans sued North Carolina’s elections board, </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/08/23/republicans-sue-north-carolina-elections-board-allege-flouting-of-voter-roll-review-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demanding enforcement of a new law that requires cross-checking jury documents to remove noncitizens from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Republican National Committee and North Carolina GOP allege that the North Carolina State Board of Elections has “deliberately declined” to enforce the law. In a news release, they said the lawsuit was designed to “force the NCSBE to immediately clean the voter rolls and prevent non-citizens from voting in November.” “The NCSBE has chosen to blatantly ignore the law, undermine basic election safeguards, and neglect a fundamental principle of our election integrity,” RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said. “The RNC and NCGOP defended this law in court, and now we will make sure the NCSBE follows and enforces these critical safeguards in The Old North State.” A spokesperson for the board of elections said Republican claims that it was refusing to comply with the law were “categorically false.” Elections staff this month cross-checked voter rolls with lists of those excused from jury duty because they said they were not citizens, spokesperson Patrick Gannon said. They found eight individuals who matched both lists. If those eight people are found to not be U.S. citizens via databases, they’ll be asked to cancel their registration. But federal law prevents the state board from directly removing people from the rolls within 90 days of an election. A new process involving county boards of elections will begin in 2025. The elections board is requesting that Republicans “immediately rescind their press releases” on the matter — arguing that they will “undermine voter confidence on an entirely false premise.”</span></p>

As a result, voters were unable to exercise their legal right either to challenge the decision of the county elections board or to cast a provisional ballot in place of the rejected mail-in ballot, the judge said. “It’s a great day for voters in Washington County,” David Gatling Sr., president of the NAACP branch in Washington, Pennsylvania, said in a statement. The NAACP branch sued the county</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-mail-ballots-invalidated-lawsuit-4db1318fc872bd9ebeb4797226146c24"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as did seven voters whose ballots had been rejected in the April 23 primary and the Center for Coalfield Justice, accusing Washington County of violating the constitutional due process rights of voters by deliberately concealing whether their ballot had been counted. Neuman ordered Washington County to notify any voter whose mail-in ballot is rejected because of an error — such as a missing signature or missing handwritten date — so that the voter has an opportunity to challenge the decision. Neuman, elected as a Democrat, also ordered the county to allow those voters to vote by provisional ballot to help ensure they could cast a ballot that would be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two lawmakers have filed an appeal in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court after a lower court threw out their lawsuit arguing that </span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/pa-court-nixes-lawmakers-suit-claiming-absentee-ballots-should-be-counted-at-polls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">absentee ballots must be counted at the polling places </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">where voters would normally cast ballots rather than at county election offices. The lawsuit, filed in January on behalf of state Reps. Kathy Rapp (R-Warren) and David Zimmerman (R-Lancaster), sought a court order declaring that sections of the Pennsylvania Election Code and the guidance of the Department of State violates the state constitution. The suit named as defendants Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt and all 67 county boards of elections.  In a decision August 23, Commonwealth Court Judge President Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer granted requests by Schmidt and the county boards to dismiss the case, writing that the court was bound by a nearly 60-year-old state Supreme Court decision. Attorney Greg Tuefel, who represents Rapp and Zimmerman, said he filed the appeal Monday and the Supreme Court has indicated that it would hear the case quickly to resolve it before the November election. Rapp and Zimmerman’s lawsuit contended that sections of the Election Code requiring absentee ballots to be returned to and counted by county Boards of Elections are at odds with the Constitution’s requirement that they be returned to and counted in the precincts where a voter resides.</span></p>
