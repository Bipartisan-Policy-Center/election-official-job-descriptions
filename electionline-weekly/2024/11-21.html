														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voting on Tribal Lands</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center insight looks turnout on Native American territories</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Chelsea N. Jones and Coryn Grange<br />
</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brennan Center</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For centuries, the United States denied Native Americans full and equal participation in federal elections. Reflecting this history, </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-tribal-lands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native voter turnout consistently lags that of other groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />This report, <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/votingontriballands_v10_final-2.pdf">Voting on Tribal Lands</a>, uses <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/tribal-technical-appendix.pdf">millions of voter records</a> from 2012 to 2022 to document growing disparities in voter participation between people who live on Native American tribal lands and those who do not. Voter turnout during that period was substantially lower for people living on tribal lands, particularly those where Native Americans are concentrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One hundred years ago, in 1924, Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, which conferred citizenship on Native Americans born in the United States. Voting rights, however, were still dictated by state law, allowing continued exclusion and discrimination. Some states disenfranchised Native Americans who did not pay state taxes or required people to sever ties with their tribal nations to be eligible to vote. Others used strategies, such as literacy tests and gerrymandering, that were superficially race neutral yet had a greater impact on people of color. Collectively, state laws stifled Native American political influence by limiting political participation to those who fully integrated into mainstream U.S. culture and by enacting policies that inhibited Native community building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Voting Rights Act of 1965 instituted federal oversight of state voting policies and curbed generations of race-based disenfranchisement. The law drastically increased voter registration and turnout among Black and Latino people nationwide. However, it did not address many of the unique barriers faced by Indigenous communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-large wp-image-12127" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure1-1024x608.png" alt="" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure1-1024x608.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure1-300x178.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure1-768x456.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure1-1536x912.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure1.png 1948w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />Native American voter participation did not particularly benefit from the Voting Rights Act until 1975, when Congress added Section 203 to the law. The provision extended coverage to “language minorities,” which included Native Americans. The minority language provisions of Section 203 require, in jurisdictions with a certain percentage of voters with limited English proficiency, that election material and oral assistance be provided in non-English languages, including traditional Indigenous languages. Section 203, and subsequent lawsuits to implement it, increased rates of registration and turnout in some jurisdictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite such progress, the difficulty in using the Voting Rights Act to address other issues, like the immense distances to polling places for residents of tribal lands, continues to produce disparities in voter turnout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inadequate collection of data on Native Americans has resulted in limited research into the quantitative effect of the compounded barriers to voting that these citizens face. Given these limitations, this report takes a novel approach to studying Native American political participation in U.S. elections. There are nearly 1.3 million American Indian or Alaska Native people living on federally recognized tribal lands in the United States. We use snapshots of state voter records from 2012 to 2022 for 21 states with populous tribal lands. We use data on U.S. Census–designated, federally recognized American Indian Reservations, which we refer to broadly as tribal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal lands are racially and ethnically diverse and do not collectively represent the 10 million people who identify as American Indian or Alaska Native. As a result of mid-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">century termination policies, during which the federal government ceased to recognize more than 100 tribes’ sovereignty, hundreds of thousands of Native Americans were forced to relocate to urban areas. However, it still remains crucial to understand how hurdles to participation on tribal lands impact the 13 percent of Native Americans who live there. Of the tribal lands we study, 53 percent of the population in 2020 identified as Native. Many of the barriers faced by residents of tribal lands, like the denial of tribal identification cards as acceptable forms of voter ID, are relics of discrimination that have gone unaddressed by governments at all levels and weaken the voting strength of Native communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-12128" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure2-1024x547.png" alt="" width="640" height="342" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure2-1024x547.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure2-300x160.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure2-768x410.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure2-1536x820.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TribalTurnoutFigure2.png 1922w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />The geographic isolation of rural tribal lands is one of the largest obstacles to voting. Election offices are typically located outside of tribal lands; for instance, on the Pyramid-Lake Reservation in Nevada and the portion of the Navajo Nation in Utah, these offices are more than 100 miles away. Some reservation residents, like members of the Karuk Tribe in California, must drive across dangerous terrain to access their county seats for election services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting by mail is also difficult. Many tribal lands use nonstandard addresses that do not contain house numbers or street names and often go unserved by postal carriers. To overcome this, some voters share post office boxes; however, several jurisdictions do not mail ballots to P.O. boxes. Moreover, most post offices are far from homes on tribal lands and have limited hours of operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, many tribal land residents face exacerbated socioeconomic vulnerabilities, such as low levels of postsecondary education and high rates of household poverty and homelessness. People who struggle with such conditions often lack the resources required to vote and thus are less likely to cast ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These long-standing factors make tribal lands a critical case study on systemic inequities in election administration. Our study finds that, from 2012 to 2022, average turnout among individuals who live on tribal lands was 11 percentage points lower than that of their off-tribal-land counterparts. In 2020, for example, had the nearly 900,000 voters on the tribal lands we studied turned out at the same rate as others in their states, roughly 160,000 more votes would have been cast. In addition, turnout was lower on tribal lands with higher shares of Native American adults. Voters on tribal lands were also 7 percentage points less likely than those not on tribal lands to vote by mail or vote early. The U.S. government’s persistent inaction to improve voting conditions for Native Americans has resulted in widespread disenfranchisement and furthered a legacy of mistrust in the political system. </span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5640" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png" alt="" width="300" height="77" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-768x197.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo.png 820w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>CIS Update</strong>: Following some analysis, The Center for Internet Security is out with a summary of Election Day activities, member responses, and the impact of preparation, information sharing, and collaboration in ensuring what we consider the most cyber-secure election to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Data Points:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Internet Security’s Situation Room operated around the clock, supporting approximately 1,300 participants.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were roughly 50 reports, with over half involving scanning, password spraying, or brute force attempts. Information sharing allowed other members to block those IP addresses, preventing any significant impact from those activities.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our protective DNS (web security) service blocked 138,782 attempts to connect to malicious domains:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 60,000 were known malware sites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 30,000 were command and control attack sites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 21,000 were phishing attempts</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports of swatting included 5 bomb threats reported directly by members. Some state-level offices reported multiple bomb threats across their states, for as many as 30 bomb threats across the U.S.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 election showcased greatly improved cyber resilience in election infrastructure. Although there were threats, none succeeded, thanks to advanced cybersecurity technology like Albert sensors, MDBR, and the successful preparation of election officials through tabletop exercises, webinars, and increased information sharing within the EI-ISAC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, the Center for Internet Security combined two teams, Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), led by Vice President Marci Andino, and the CIS Program for Countering Hybrid Threats, led by Executive Director John Cohen. They collaborated with</span><a href="https://www.sheriffs.org/sites/default/files/MEDIA%20RELEASE%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20on%202024%20Election.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> national and local law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address not only cyber threats but also misinformation and physical threats aimed at creating fear and disrupting confidence in U.S. elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This expanded collaborative effort in 2024 has set the path for the future in protecting our elections from a range of threats that will only increase in sophistication as AI continues to evolve.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>

The AP found that election offices in California, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico and elsewhere also reported receiving completed ballots in the mail that should have gone to other states. Terry Thompson, elections administrator in Cascade County, Montana got ballots for elections offices in Wasilla, Alaska; Vancouver, Washington; and Tampa, Florida. In Louisiana, state election officials told the AP some 40 to 50 ballots destined for 10 other states ended up being delivered to local election offices, mostly in Orleans Parish. Deputy Secretary of State Joel Watson Jr. said the Secretary of State’s Office had “extraordinary frustration” for the Postal Service’s continued “inconsistencies” and “lack of accountability.” Dozens of mail ballots from inside the state also were delivered to the wrong local election office, Watson said. In New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, County Clerk Katharine Clark said seven ballots bound for her office were instead delivered to Los Angeles County in Southern California. Those ballots were redirected, Clark said, but did not arrive at her office before the state’s deadline to be counted, which is 7 p.m. on Election Day. “It does mean that person got denied the right to vote, because the ballots from Los Angeles County &#8212; even though they were sent (to Santa Fe) with a four- or five-day lead time &#8212; they didn’t get to us in time to count,” she said. Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, said ballot monitors identified some problems inside facilities during the election season but said they were resolved. “While we are waiting on the final statistics from the Postal Service, all indications show that vote-by-mail was a success in the 2024 general election,” he said in an emailed statement to the AP.</span></p>

They were still counting ballots in Alaska, where a </span><a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/11/20/alaskas-ranked-choice-repeal-measure-fails-by-664-votes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure was on the ballot to repeal the state’s ranked choice voting/open primary system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Late Wednesday (our time) the Alaska Elections Division released its latest and final round of results that show the repeal measure losing by just 664 votes. The final margin for Ballot Measure 2, pending certification, is 664 out of 340,110 votes, with “No” outpacing “Yes” 50.1% to 49.9%. The No on 2 campaign said the failure of the ballot measure was “a win by Alaskans, for Alaskans, which will benefit our state for generations to come.” “We are thrilled that Alaskans from all over the state with diverse views and different backgrounds came together to preserve the system that empowers voters to elect representatives that will put Alaska first,” No on 2 Executive Director Juli Lucky and Campaign Chair Lesil McGuire said in a statement emailed to reporters. Former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman, an advocate for repeal, said he hopes the Legislature will pass a law getting rid of the voting system, but if that doesn’t happen, another repeal initiative is possible.“I would say half of Alaskan voters were influenced, at least in part, and maybe in large part, by  big money from outside the state,” he told Alaska Public Media. “And ours was a grassroots, homebody campaign.” Phil Izon, who led the campaign in support of the ballot measure, said he planned to </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/11/20/alaska-chooses-to-keep-ranked-choice-voting-begich-defeats-peltola-unofficial-results-show/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit a recount request </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">once the election is certified, though he said he was “not optimistic” it would change the outcome. Alaska law allows candidates and campaigns to request recounts, and the state must pay for them in races won by less than 0.5%. Recounts are not automatic except in races that end in a tie.</span></p>

The problem is, many people, even Californians, outside of the elections world don’t understand this and where there is a lack of understanding, mis/disinformation and conspiracy theories can quickly follow. Enter the California Vote Foundation. This year, with the help of some others, CVF officially launched a tracker that is monitoring the vote count in California’s close contests between Election Day and certification of county results.The </span><a href="https://www.calvoter.org/content/close-count-transparency-project"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close Count Transparency Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the tracker — which debuted as a</span><a href="https://www.calvoter.org/content/close-count-transparency-project#2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pilot program in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — provides daily updates on the results of 11 competitive U.S. House races and seven state legislative races, as well as the statewide vote count status. The tool tracks candidates’ vote share, votes counted and the number of unprocessed ballots in each county the districts cover. “We wanted to create a record of where the vote count stood each day, so that if someone came along later and said, ‘Something hinky is going on here,’ there would be a reliable source of information people could turn to to see how the vote count evolved over time,” Alexander </span><a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/11/california-election-results-slow-vote-count/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Cal Matters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6180" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia Rulemaking</strong>: The Georgia State Board of Elections, which made headlines before the election, met for the first time since November 5. According to the Georgia Recorder, the board voted to request state lawmakers</span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/18/in-first-meeting-since-trump-win-georgia-election-board-defers-to-legislature-to-implement-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pass legislation next year making voter lists readily available to the public before and after elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Board members have decided to forward their recommendations to the state Legislature rather than launch their own rulemaking process, which has recently resulted in several of their initiatives successfully challenged in courts. Board members Janelle King, Janice Johnston and Rick Jeffares, asked state lawmakers to pass legislation which would require each county to make publicly available a list of all eligible voters during and after every election. Democratic Election Board member Sara Tindall Ghazal said that publishing supplemental lists of eligible voters during an election could impose an administrative burden on counties. She stressed the need for a better understanding of this burden before making legislative recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6527" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MaineCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Maine</strong>: Rep. David Boyer, R-Poland, said he filed a bill for the next legislative session to </span><a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/11/20/politics/state-politics/maine-bill-prevent-blank-ballots-forcing-ranked-choice-runoff-joam40zk0w/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not require a ranked-choice count in a two-person race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if one candidate does not receive at least 50 percent of votes due to blank ballots. Boyer also said he thinks a runoff is not needed if the number of votes received by a declared write-in candidate is not enough to defeat the winner. Under state rules in place since Maine began using the ranked-choice method in 2018, voters can rank as many or as few candidates as they would like. Those who only rank a second choice have their votes initially recorded as blank. If the race goes to a ranked-choice count, those second choices are counted as first choices. Boyer said he is not sure that he wants to tweak the rules on blank ballots with no first choice and subsequent rankings. He thinks Merenda’s vote total is proof she would not have significantly changed Golden’s lead and that his solution balances practicality with letting write-in candidates “get their voices heard.” “It’s a bad use of tax dollars when it’s clearly a two-person race,” Boyer said.</span></p>

Changes would make it harder for people who use absentee ballots to have their votes count. The plan, included in</span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SB382.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also funds further aid for Hurricane Helene relief, would further strip power from the governor’s office, which currently has appointment power and will remain in Democratic control under Governor-elect Josh Stein. The measure also grants Auditor-elect Dave Boliek, a Republican, new jurisdiction after he defeated Auditor Jessica Holmes and flipped control of an office held by Democrats since 2009. The board’s powers would remain independent of the auditor’s office, according to the bill, but its budgeting and appointments would fall under the direction of the auditor. The auditor’s ability to make appointments would start on May 1, 2025. Karen Brinson Bell, the board’s executive director, said in a statement that the plan’s administrative changes could “make it impossible” for county boards to properly count votes. “State Board staff were not consulted about this significant piece of legislation that transfers authority of the State Board of Elections and makes substantial administrative changes that may make it impossible for the county boards of elections to adequately ensure every eligible ballot cast is counted, especially in high turnout elections,” Brinson Bell said.</span></p>

The board voted unanimously that </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/11/19/ballot-board-clears-ohio-voters-bill-of-rights-organizers-can-begin-collecting-signatures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ohio Voters Bill of Rights </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">contains only one proposed amendment. The proposed amendment would grant counties the ability to set up multiple early vote centers or ballot drop boxes, create a system to update voter registration automatically when someone visits the BMV, and allow for same day voter registration. While the proposal accomplishes several different changes, supporters argued because all them relate to voting, the proposal represents a single amendment. “The Ohio Supreme Court has stated time and again that the ballot board has a clear legal duty to liberally construe the right of initiative,” petitioners’ attorney Jyoti Jasrasaria argued. “As long as the citizen initiated proposed amendment, there’s some reasonable relationship to a single general object or purpose, the board must certify its approval of the amendment as written without dividing it into multiple petitions.” Organizers tried a similar amendment in 2020 only to see their efforts derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although they’ve now cleared the initial administrative hurdles, organizers will need to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures from across Ohio to make it onto the ballot. </span></p>

Among the reforms include the creation of a  new executive agency to manage elections independent of the Lieutenant Governor’s Office, similar to the secretary of state model Utah had until the lieutenant governor position was created in 1976. Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton plans to introduce a bill that would change state code so that only registered voters who request a mail-in ballot will receive one — as opposed to all registered voters automatically receiving one. This shift would keep vote-by-mail as an option for everyone that wants it but would “clean up the voter rolls in one swoop,” Lee said, for voters who have moved or died. Under this bill, voters would be able to opt in to receive future mail-in ballots by marking a box on their mail-in ballot in the upcoming election cycle, Lee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers declined to recommend a bill that would have prevented </span><a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51194456/lawmakers-vote-down-bill-to-prevent-counting-of-mailed-ballots-that-arrive-after-election-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the counting of mail-in ballots that arrive after polls close</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Election Day. The bill was brought forward during the Legislature&#8217;s interim meetings last month and was voted down during a meeting of the Government Operations Interim Committee this week. Utah law requires mailed ballots be postmarked no later than the day prior to the election in order to count. The proposal was meant to address a controversy that arose during the June Republican primary election for Utah&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District, in which several hundred ballots were postmarked late and not counted. Colby Jenkins narrowly lost the race to Rep. Celeste Maloy and contended that the U.S. Postal Service was to blame for some of the ballots being marked late. Had those votes been counted, he argued, they may have changed the results of the election.</span></p>

The lawsuit was filed Nov. 12, after learning about delays in processing early ballots for the 2024 general election. “This is not the first time we’ve seen these kinds of issues in Apache County, and sadly, it’s been an ongoing pattern of disenfranchisement in previous elections,” said Speaker Crystalyne Curley. “The Navajo Nation will continue to fight for our voters, holding Apache County accountable until every Navajo voice is heard and every vote is counted.” The first lawsuit, filed on Election Day, sought to grant Navajo voters in Apache County an additional two hours to vote due to ballot printer failures at several polling sites. The second lawsuit aims to extend the deadline for voters to correct signature discrepancies on their early ballots. Voters initially had until 5pm on Sunday, Nov. 10, to resolve signature issues, but on Nov. 9, the Navajo Nation Department of Justice discovered that Apache County had halted early ballot processing from Nov. 6 to Nov. 8. Additionally, 143 Navajo ballots required signature verification, and as of 5:20 p.m. on Nov. 9, Apache County still had 900 unprocessed early ballots. With just 48 hours to notify affected voters and allow them to cure their ballots, many encountered barriers such as limited cell service, restricted internet access, and long travel distances to the Apache County Recorder’s Office in St. Johns. The compressed timeline made it challenging for voters to receive timely notice and take necessary action. In addition to these delays, many Navajo voters struggled to reach the Recorder’s Office during the election. By the afternoon of Nov. 9, the Arizona Secretary of State’s website still indicated that their ballots had not been received by Apache County, prompting numerous calls to confirm their votes were counted.</span></p>

Dourbetas ruled that existing state law does not block the local measure, which was approved by voters earlier this year. The ruling could clear the way for the majority-Republican city to implement one of California’s only voter ID requirements at the polls in local elections. “It’s a massive black eye to the state of California,” City Attorney Michael Gates said of the ruling. “And what the state of California needs to know, if they haven’t found out already, is Huntington Beach is not going to be intimidated or deterred.” State Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said in a statement to The Associated Press that the Friday decision “does not address the merits of the case.” “We continue to believe that Huntington Beach’s voter ID policy clearly conflicts with state law, and will respond appropriately in court,” the office added. Residents in Huntington Beach voted in March for a ballot measure that lets local officials require voter identification at the polls starting in 2026. It also allows the city to increase in-person voting sites and monitor ballot drop boxes in local elections. A month later, Bonta filed a lawsuit, saying the measure approved in the city of nearly 200,000 people conflicts with state law and could make it harder for poor, non-white, young, elderly and disabled voters to cast ballots. </span></p>

According to the petition, the 7th Circuit’s dismissal contained “serious legal errors” and uprooted precedent allowing federal candidates to challenge a state’s regulations on the time, place or manner of federal elections.  The litigants have argued that Illinois’ 14-day mail-in ballot receipt deadline effectively “expands” Election Day in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law, which requires states to hold Election Day on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Bost’s lawsuit also alleged that the two-week deadline allows “illegal ballots” to “dilute the value of timely ballots cast and received on or before Election Day.” Tuesday’s cert petition — which solely focuses on the issue of standing — maintains that the challenged ballot receipt deadline imposes burdensome financial costs on candidates, who must monitor ballot receipt and counting for an additional two weeks to ensure an accurate tally of votes.</span></p>

No evidence could be found to support Tonya Harmason’s allegations of gerrymandering and bias, Lurry concluded in the hearing at West Baton Rouge Parish Courthouse in Port Allen. Harmason came up 33 votes short for a runoff against frontrunner JB Barker, who will face Plaquemine Selectman/Mayor Pro Tem Timmy Martinez in the election to determine the successor for retiring three-term officeholder Edwin M. “Ed” Reeves Jr. In court, Harmason alleged irregularity and potential bias because Registrar of Voters Kirsha Deshotel Barker is JB Barker’s daughter-in-law. Lurry said she did not see adequate evidence to support allegations of bias or that active voters from two districts had been removed from the electoral logs at polling locations where they voted in past elections.</span></p>

WMUK reported last week that the race between Republican Steve Frisbee and Democratic incumbent Jim Haadsma in the state House District that includes Battle Creek was still in question. On November 13, the Calhoun County Board of Canvassers was sued by the Frisbee campaign seeking to stop the count. The dispute involves re-tabulating absentee ballots from Battle Creek. A programming error on Election Day meant about half of the city’s mail-in ballots weren’t included in the unofficial results. Chris Trebilcock, an attorney who represents Haadsma, said the Calhoun County Board of Canvassers is doing exactly what the law requires it to do. “The process allows for correction. Correction by the board of canvassers. Correction through a recount that may flip votes here or there when you do a hand recount,” Trebilcock said. “Quite frankly, this type of frivolous election litigation needs to stop. Calhoun County deserves better.”</span></p>

Last week the court granted immediate consideration of the request but denied a leave to appeal in the case of Beverly Biggs Leavy, who finished as the top vote-getter in the Nov. 5 recall election. Biggs Leavy was one of five candidates on the ballot in the 3rd Ward election that sought to remove the late Quincy Murphy from office. But because Murphy died on Sept. 29, just days after absentee ballots had been printed and became available to voters, city, Genesee County and state election officials said the results of the election would be invalid because Murphy’s death meant he was no longer an officeholder and therefore not subject to recall. Biggs Leavy, who sponsored the recall, challenged the election officials’ interpretation, filing a lawsuit against them and seeking to preserve the election results. The state Court of Claims dismissed her complaint against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and state Elections Director Jonathan Brater and the state Court of Appeals denied an immediate appeal, leading to the request to the Supreme Court. Biggs Leavy’s complaint against county Clerk-Register Domonique Clemons and Flint Clerk Davina Donahue were filed simultaneously in Genesee County where the case is pending. Clemons said on Wednesday, Nov. 20, that county attorneys have filed a motion for the lawsuit to be dismissed. </span></p>

Officials began investigating after Hubbard County Auditor Kay Rave could not find any completed voter registration forms among the ballots and other materials returned by Scouton according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. Another election judge told an investigator from the county sheriff’s office that Scouton directed them not to use the registration forms, the complaint said, while another said Scouton told them that new voters needed only to sign the back of a book. The complaint said the investigator then met with Scouton at the sheriff’s office. He was advised of his rights but declined to make a statement, and was then put under arrest, the complaint said. The complaint did not give a potential motive. Scouton made his initial court appearance Friday and was released pending his next hearing Jan. 6. He did not immediately return a call seeking comment Saturday, and his attorney declined to comment on the case. The office of Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon called the allegations “extremely serious” and said they must be thoroughly investigated. “Election judges take an oath to administer elections in accordance with the law, a deliberate failure to do so is unlawful and a betrayal of the public trust,” the office said in a statement.</span></p>

They argue that the provision of the state Constitution that strips voting rights for life violates the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.  Jonathan Youngwood, global co-chair of Simpson Thacher’s litigation department, told Mississippi Today in a statement that after filing the petition with the Court, he remains confident in the case, and the firm’s clients remain committed to ensuring their right to vote is restored. “The right to vote is an important cornerstone of democracy,” Youngwood said. “Denying broad groups of citizens, such as those who have completed their sentences for criminal convictions, who deserve the full right of participating in our representative government, is inconsistent with the United States Constitution.” Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of a list of 10 felonies lose their voting rights for life. Opinions from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office have since expanded the list of disenfranchising felonies to 24.</span></p>

Under state law, the votes must be certified within 10 days of the general election. The Hinds County Election Commission said Friday evening shortly before 5 p.m. that the absentee and affidavit ballots had been counted and certified following the Nov. 5 general election. &#8220;There is concern that the Hinds County Election Commission may not finish counting all votes from the Nov. 5 general election, which would be a violation of state law requiring that it be done by (Friday),&#8221; said Branning&#8217;s attorney Spencer Ritchie. &#8220;We are asking the court to force the Election Commission to do their job by today&#8217;s deadline to ensure that voters in all 22 counties of the Supreme Court central district — no matter which candidate they intend to vote for — will be able to vote by absentee ballot starting (Saturday).&#8221;  Around 6 p.m. Friday, Election Commissioners signed off on the November 5 election results, after a marathon day of counting affidavit ballots and responding to a lawsuit filed by a candidate running for Mississippi Supreme Court.

Cypher had registered to vote absentee in this year’s election, but Hofland rejected his registration application on the basis he was committed to the Department of Corrections on a felony despite being housed at the state hospital in Warm Springs. Cypher and Disability Rights Montana then sued. In response to Cypher’s lawsuit, Attorney General Austin Knudsen in October issued a new</span><a href="https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vol.-60-No.-3-Unpublished-Version.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legal opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that found that no felon – no matter whether they are involuntarily committed to the state hospital – enjoys the right to vote while serving their sentence. But Dayton wrote that despite the new opinion, the Attorney General’s Office admitted at a hearing that the state hospital was not a penal institution and that a court had never found Cypher to be of “an unsound mind.” “In this case, if the Court does not enjoin further interference with Mr. Cypher’s right to vote, he will suffer complete disenfranchisement by operation of the AG’s Opinion in this election and in other elections that occur during the pendency of this case,” Dayton wrote. Dayton granted the preliminary injunction, saying that the government’s admissions and the fact that the election had not been certified as of last Friday would mean preventing Cypher from voting would disenfranchise him in violation of the constitution.</span></p>

Griffin’s suit claims the elections board isn’t providing data quickly enough for him to request a recount prior to the Tuesday, November 19 deadline for counties that have completed their canvass. Many, but not all of North Carolina’s 100 counties have completed the canvas process at the time of filing the lawsuit on Monday, though they are expected to finish by the end of the day. It’s one of the closest contests in the general election. Griffin held a narrow lead of less than 10,000 votes over incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs on election night. Since then, Riggs has crept ahead with results from additional provisional and absentee ballots. The two candidates were separated by a margin of 24 votes at the time of filing the lawsuit, according to the document. The State Board of Elections website reported a margin of 70 votes in Riggs’ favor out of more than 5.5. million cast as of 4:00 pm. Monday. “Defendants’ failures have impeded Plaintiffs’ efforts to meaningfully examine the 2024 General Election processes and unlawfully interfered with Plaintiffs’ ability to evaluate the potential need to file any protests in relation to the 2024 General Election,” the document read.</span></p>

Allen is a legal resident of the United States, prosecutors say she is not an American citizen. According to an indictment, however, that didn&#8217;t stop her from improperly registering to vote in March of 2020 before voting in that year&#8217;s November election, with more ballots to follow in the primary and general elections in both 2022 and &#8217;23. A grand jury charged Allen with five counts of illegal voting and one count of false voter registration. If convicted, she could face up to 11 1/2 years in prison. Allen&#8217;s alleged crimes stem from March 7, 2020, when authorities say she filled out a voter registration card and answered &#8220;no&#8221; when asked if she was a U.S. citizen. Per officials, the card &#8220;explicitly states in the instructions that if you answer &#8216;no&#8217; to the U.S. citizenship question, you should not complete the registration card,&#8221; though prosecutors did not indicate how her registration was even approved if she confirmed she was not a citizen.</span></p>

Such ballots have been the subject of years of litigation in various courts, and became an issue again after Bucks, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties moved to count them for the Nov. 5 election. These are the ballots where a voter has neglected to write the date on the return envelope or written something incorrect, like their birthday. There are roughly 1,500 or so ballots in play in the three counties, likely not enough to change the outcome of the U.S. Senate race that is spurring the litigation. Attorneys for the counties had argued that officials there had constitutional concerns about rejecting the improperly dated ballots. They pointed to Commonwealth Court, which has ruled multiple times this year that rejecting mail ballots solely for an improper date violates the state constitution’s free and equal elections clause. A 4-3 majority of the state Supreme Court told the three counties not to include undated and misdated ballots in their counts. It clarified that the Commonwealth Court rulings do not apply to the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>

Now, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah says it would like to see an extension. The Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission and ACLU sued San Juan County in 2016 over voter access in Utah&#8217;s largest geographic county. The lawsuit alleged that San Juan County&#8217;s shift to vote-by-mail also created some hurdles to ballot access. Navajo is a primarily unwritten language and there were limited in-person polling locations, leading to long drives to vote. &#8220;We have a Native American culture that has a completely different language and it&#8217;s not a language that you can learn easily because it&#8217;s not written any place,&#8221; said San Juan County Commissioner Bruce Adams. &#8220;To get the people that can interpret that language at the polling places is probably the most difficult thing that we face.&#8221; The county and the plaintiffs reached a settlement that stretched from 2018 to this election cycle in 2024. That settlement has benefited voters, said Tara Benally, a San Juan County resident who also works on voter registration for the group Stewardship Utah. Adams said he believes things have been working out well. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve gone out of our way to get interpreters where they&#8217;re needed, to get ads on the Navajo radio to get everybody informed whether they&#8217;re on the reservation or off the reservation. I think we&#8217;ve done a great job in trying to make sure that everybody gets a chance to vote,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

In the summer of 2023, Wolfe’s initial four-year term as WEC administrator expired and Senate Republicans said they would not confirm her to a second term.  The three Democrats on the commission, in an effort to shield Wolfe from the Senate, abstained from a vote to reappoint her while the three Republicans on the commission voted to nominate her again. State law requires a majority of the six member body to vote in favor of an administrator’s nomination, however, meaning the nomination wasn’t officially advanced to the Senate for a vote.  But the Senate acted anyway, voting against Wolfe’s appointment. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul immediately filed a lawsuit arguing that under the precedent Republicans set in the Prehn decision, Wolfe is able to remain in her position as a holdover. At the circuit court level, Republicans admitted that the Senate vote to remove Wolfe was “symbolic.” But after a Dane County judge ruled in Wolfe’s favor, the GOP leaders appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. Assistant Attorney General Charlotte Gibson, the Department of Justice lawyer arguing on behalf of Wolfe, said that the statute that gives the commission the authority to appoint administrators does not require it to act when the administrator’s term expires.
