</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New guide from CISA and EAC helps develop public comms plan</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/about/leadership/cait-conley"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cait Conley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants to be very clear about, the American election system is secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11469" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Newser06.20.24-225x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Newser06.20.24-225x300.png 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Newser06.20.24-769x1024.png 769w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Newser06.20.24-768x1023.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Newser06.20.24.png 1086w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />“We are in the most secure and resilient place we’ve been in for any election cycle,” Conley, senior advisor to the director of the </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CISA) said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, Conley also noted, “This is also the most complex threat environment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help state and local elections officials navigate those complexities with the public, this week, CISA and the </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EAC) released </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhancing-election-security-through-public-communications"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enhancing Election Security Through Public Communications,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a guide for state, local, tribal, and territorial election officials who are the primary sources of official information about elections.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials can mitigate risk to election infrastructure and operations by developing a public communications plan that conveys accurate information about how they administer and secure elections and by preparing their teams to communicate effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CISA and the EAC developed this guide to provide a framework and practical tools for developing <img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" />and implementing a year-round communications plan. The guide highlights how officials can tailor their communications plan to meet the unique needs of their jurisdiction while operating within the resources available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials are the trusted sources of election information. This resource supports election officials to successfully deliver accurate communication to voters with the critical information they need before and after Election Day,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, Vice Chair Donald Palmer, Commissioner Thomas Hicks, and Commissioner Christy McCormick jointly. “Effective and transparent communication not only helps eligible Americans to cast their ballot and instill confidence in the voting process but is essential to trusting the security of our elections, and the accuracy of the results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guide provides information on working with a variety of different forms of media, from traditional print and broadcast to social media and also makes recommendations for how the engage with the public. The guide notes that it’s important to know the audience and choose the right format for communication. Additional key points include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it short and simple;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use humor and local references; </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage existing resources; </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish credibility; and </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure communication channels</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="235" height="97" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" />“At the end of the day, and we try to hit this in the guide, different people are going to take information over different mediums,” Conley said. “What we try to encourage is to recognize that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guide also includes worksheets to help election officials develop core plan components. Conley said the design of the guide, especially the inclusion of the worksheets is to make it useful for any elections official, whether they have a communications staff or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They [elections officials] have a very powerful, good news story to tell and it&#8217;s absolutely within their ability to tell it,” Conoley said. “They are the best ones to tell that story because no one in that jurisdiction is going to know better and that is a story Americans want to hear and I do think what&#8217;s the best way to tell that story.”</span></p>

Legislation passed last year paved the way for the Department of Public Safety to build an automatic voter registration system. In a news conference marking the rollout, Secretary of State Steve Simon praised the new system saying it ”strengthens election security and increases voter access.” Previously, applicants needed to opt-in for voter registration by checking a box on their driver’s license renewal form. Now the registration process will be automatic without any extra steps required of eligible voters. “The process shifts the responsibility of registration from voters to elected officials,” said Simon, who added that voter eligibility will be determined by multiple layers of review and verification by the Secretary of State’s office in partnership with local election officials. He estimates the new system could register 120,000 Minnesotans by election day. The system also pre-registers 16 and 17-year-olds applying for their first driver’s license, or other state-issued ID. Since April, 13,000 teens have been pre-registered to vote.</span></p>

Native Voting Hour is a monthly virtual meeting series held on Zoom on the last Tuesday of every month at 2 p.m. Mountain Standard Time. The meeting is open to the public and dedicated to empowering and educating Native voters across the state. “The program was established as a way for our office to be approachable from the community,” said Millicent Michelle Pepion, the outreach coordinator and tribal liaison for the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office. Pepion understands that meeting virtually in the middle of the afternoon may not be ideal for many people. However, having the program set for a regular time every month helps with consistency and reliability. Each monthly virtual meeting is an hour long and focuses on a theme. It features three to four guest speakers with various backgrounds related to the month’s theme. Pepion said that the Secretary of State’s Office often works with different organizations, universities, school departments and tribal councils. However, the Native Voting Hour program is different.  The program is a way for the Secretary of State’s Office to reach out directly to Indigenous community members, she said, and let them know the office is trying to learn what issues are happening within Native communities and how to best address them.</span></p>

In </span><a href="https://www.mynews4.com/news/local/rightcount-launches-in-nevada-with-ex-gov-list-and-sen-gansert-to-restore-election-trust"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two former prominent Republican political figures in Nevada have launched an organization dedicated to rebuilding trust in the state&#8217;s secure election system. RightCount, led by former Governor Bob List and State Senator Heidi Gansert, was founded in an effort to restore trust in the electoral process and to support public officials swore to uphold the rule of law and ensure legal and accurate vote counts. “The integrity of our electoral process is the bedrock of our nation’s strength. However, recent years have witnessed a concerning decline in trust in our elections,” List said. “As a former Governor of this magnificent state, I’m proud to partner with RightCount and local Nevadan leaders, particularly my fellow Republicans, as we work to restore trust and confidence in our state’s electoral system.” In </span><a href="https://kslnewsradio.com/2111078/nonprofit-working-to-build-trust-in-utah-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nonprofit group Trust Utah Elections hopes to reassure everyone that they can trust the process. Former Utah County Clerk Josh Daniels said Trust Utah Elections is working to prevent a repeat of the election four years ago. “You had self-appointed experts asserting that they know what is and isn’t true about election administration,” Daniels said. “You know, way out over their skies asserting all kinds of wild things about what happens behind the scenes of election administration.”  Stan Lockhart, a former Utah Republican Party Chair noted that there is some fraud that occurs, but not like the disinformation that was spread in 2020. “It’s not huge, but there are mothers of missionaries that vote for their kids. That is the greatest source of fraud we’ve discovered in our audits. And there is a well-defined process for remedying that problem … They do not want to send a bunch of moms to jail.”</span></p>

Observations noted that human-run elections cannot be completely free of errors but found &#8220;nothing undermining the overall integrity of the election process&#8221; for the Missoula County primary.  With the success of the program, supported by the Carter Center, the MEOI now plans to recruit and train upwards of 100 more observers to carry out the same oversight for several more counties in the November election. In </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/voting-north-dakota-primary-polling-sites-ran-smoothly-observers-say"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Primary election polling sites received high marks from the League of Women Voters’ volunteer election observers, according to an announcement from the organization. Volunteers on election day monitored more than 30 voting locations in Bismarck, Mandan, Fargo, West Fargo, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Devils Lake and Wahpeton. Their goal was to document how smoothly the polls operated — like whether there were long lines, clear signs pointing voters in the right direction and if the location was accessible for disabled voters. They had a lot of good things to say. “Our nonpartisan observers sent us reports of friendly poll workers, positive voting experiences, and democracy in action at the local level,” Mary Tintes, vice president of the League of Women Voters of North Dakota, said in the announcement.</span></p>

Cass covers the history of women’s suffrage in the United States from the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, through the stories of organizers like Susan B. Anthony, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Alice Paul, Mary Church Terrell, and later Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker. “I did not want to focus on only a few people because that seems like it misses one of the most important things about how these movements function. They require group effort. The cult of personality that is so prevalent in our culture is kind of antithetical to these movements and yet we continue to celebrate well-known individuals,” she told The 19th. “It’s easier to choose a figurehead than to celebrate all of the people who put in the work at once.

A committee of local educators, a Judge of Elections, and artists chose a winning design from each age group to be produced into the commemorative 2-inch “I Voted” stickers given to York County residents who vote in November and in the 2025 primary. The winners are: Grades K-5th winner: Kylie Fisher, Logos Academy; Grades 6-8th winner: Estella Dugger, Home Schooled; and Grades 9-12th winner: Madeline Zarate, Northern York High School. “This was a tough decision for our panel,” said Kelley Gibson, President of the Cultural Alliance of York County. “We had so many talented submissions that really showcased the uniqueness of York County and civic pride in our elections process by these students. We were thrilled with the participation of so many students around the county in the first-ever competition.”</span></p>

The report surveys policy trends over the last four years that have impacted not only how voters cast their ballots, but also the security and independence of our elections.  These emerging trends are poised to significantly impact election outcomes, voter turnout, and public confidence in the electoral process. The report finds that while some states have emphasized voter access and expanding opportunities for voters to become registered, other states have prioritized restrictive measures that undermine the democratic functioning of elections. New analysis shows that since 2020, only 18 states have become more expansive in terms of the policies tracked in this report that provide equal access to the ballot and combat violence and divisiveness. Over the same period, almost half of all states (24) have become more restrictive, signifying their prioritization of efforts to limit access to voting. An additional five states have enacted both expansive and restrictive policies since 2020. “It is evident that the continued polarization of states has the potential to sow confusion among voters and lead to potential disenfranchisement, particularly for marginalized groups who already face ingrained barriers to the ballot box,” said Brian Hinkle, Senior Voting Policy Researcher at MAP. “For this reason, the importance of advocating for federal voting rights legislation and the basic principles of democracy cannot be understated.” Using MAP’s </span><a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=8c6d6ce83e&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democracy Maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and bill tracking, this report shows the progression of these opposing trends in recent years and forecasts how this continued polarization will likely impact the upcoming 2024 election—and American democracy for years to come.​​​ ​</span></p>

It’s the latest move by Steil and House Administration Republicans, who have spent the bulk of this Congress highlighting perceived threats to election security and advancing a series of conservative proposals that would encourage states to adopt policies like mandatory voter identification. Steil gave the department heads until June 26 to comply. The executive order, issued by President Joe Biden in March 2021, sought to remove barriers to the ballot for historically marginalized groups, in part by expanding voter registration efforts. It instructed executive departments and agencies to partner with local officials “to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information.” Steil called it nothing more than a “voter mobilization” effort intended to tilt the scales in favor of the presumed Democratic presidential nominee. He also suggested it could violate federal law that prohibits agencies from spending money without congressional approval.</span></p>

The bill now proceeds to the state Senate Public Safety Committee. </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2642"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly Bill 2642</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — an anti-harassment bill written by Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Menlo Park Democrat, responds to a trend of election workers facing harassment across the country, Berman said. His bill would create a presumption that someone openly carrying a firearm or imitation firearm while in an elections setting would be trying to intimidate someone. It also would allow a victim, elections official or state attorney general to file a civil action to enforce the law. The legislation now advances to the Senate Judiciary Committee after Tuesday’s vote. </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2839"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly Bill 2839</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat, is trying to address disinformation in political ads. The bill would prohibit someone from knowingly disseminating a campaign ad or other election-related message with deceptive and digitally altered images, audio or video four months before an election. It wouldn’t apply to satire or parody. Leora Gershenzon, with the California Initiative for Technology and Democracy, asked committee members to consider an ad showing an elected official accepting a bribe, which was in fact a video created by artificial intelligence. Once seen, it can’t be unseen. Pellerin’s bill now moves to the Senate Judiciary Committee.</span></p>

In 2022, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled no-excuse mail-in voting to be unconstitutional, and earlier this year, Superior Court struck down permanent absentee voting and early voting. The latter ruling was appealed to the state’s Supreme Court, which recently heard arguments, but Democratic lawmakers are pushing forward with an attempt to add all three voting procedures to Delaware’s Constitution. House Minority Whip Lyndon Yearick (R- Magnolia) explains several of his Republican colleagues would opt not to vote on the constitutional amendment in order to wait for the Supreme Court’s ruling. “We feel it’s rather disingenuous to disallow that — we want the court decision to happen first and foremost. It may make this completely a moot point. They may overturn the Superior Court [decision] and say what was initially voted on is going to come back into play,&#8221; he said. Yearick also expressed disappointment with combining early voting and absentee voting in the constitutional amendment, saying they should be considered separately. The Democratic-endorsed amendment’s sponsor, State Rep. Sherae’a Moore (D-Middletown), says acting on all three voting procedures now is appropriate. “As we sit and we wait for the pending decision, we still have the responsibility to our constituents and making sure that we’re doing something because the court decision came because this wasn’t in our constitution,&#8221; she said. While the amendment failed to receive a two-thirds majority vote, House Majority Leader Melissa Minor-Brown (D-Bear) changed her vote from yes to no — a procedure that now allows her to bring the bill back for consideration within three legislative days.</span></p>

The package aims to clean up the post-election process and prevent frivolous recount attempts. It would only allow candidates to file for a recount if they believe in good faith that an error in the canvass or returns of the votes kept them from winning. Current state law also gives that opportunity if the candidate believes “fraud or mistake” cost them the election. Candidates would also have to certify that the number of challenged votes would be enough to sway the outcome of an election for a petition for a recount to go through. Representative Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) said the legislation also changes how much candidates would have to pay for a recount. “This fee structure includes per-precinct fees which charge less for precincts where the results are closer and more for precincts where the margin is so large that it is unlikely a recount could change the outcome,” Tsernoglou said. Another part of the package deals with which ballots are eligible to be recounted. Under the current system, if the number of ballots a precinct has in its possession is out of balance with records, every ballot in that precinct becomes ineligible to be recounted. The legislation would provide a way to still count those ballots should there be a good reason through a sworn affidavit for why things are off.</span></p>

But a similar bill is awaiting action from the governor.

Instead, it would have required those registering to vote for the first time to have documentation in hand that they’re eligible, including proof of citizenship. would have also created an Election Day hotline run by the Secretary of State’s office, the Attorney General’s office and Department of Motor Vehicles. Supporters pointed to the hotline as a potential resource for local election officials to confirm someone’s voting eligibility in real time, though it wasn’t clear based on the text of the bill how the system would have worked. </span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/politics/2024-05-16/nh-senate-backs-stricter-proof-of-eligibility-rules-for-new-voters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also requires stricter proof of citizenship for first-time registrants on Election Day but doesn&#8217;t include the hotline already cleared the Legislature earlier this session. But the fate of that bill is uncertain. Earlier this week, Gov. Chris Sununu said he had concerns about the timeline of both measures, which would go into effect immediately. That would give state and local election officials less than three months to prepare before the state primary in September. Opponents of the bill, including Rep. Connie Lane, a Democrat from Concord, said that requiring a would-be voter to bring certain documents to the polls would be a hardship, given that many people either don’t have a passport or may not have easy access to their birth certificate.</span></p>

The two news organizations reported on the limited ability to identify how some people vote after an independent news site published what it said was the image of the ballot a former state GOP chair cast in the March 5 Republican primary. The League of Women Voters of Texas, American Oversight, the Campaign Legal Center, and Southern Coalition for Social Justice cited the investigation by Votebeat and The Tribune that replicated a series of steps that could identify a specific person’s ballot choices using public records. The outlets did not detail the precise information or process needed to do so. The advocacy groups said the ability to identify how people vote could lead to voter intimidation. The groups’ request to the Justice Department comes a week after the Texas Secretary of State’s Office issued emergency guidance to local election officials, telling them, among other things, to “redact any information on the precinct election records or on the ballot image that identifies the location at which a voter voted.”</span></p>

The filing was in response to the state’s arguments that a preliminary injunction against the law should not be granted. In the 31-page filing, attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote that they are “substantially likely” to succeed on the merits of their speech and association claims. They wrote that assistance is covered under the First Amendment and that the state’s testimonies were not convincing. They said that the bill would fail under First Amendment scrutiny. The Alabama Legislature this spring passed a law that criminalized some forms of absentee ballot application assistance. Civil rights groups, including the ACLU of Alabama, filed a lawsuit in April, saying the law amounts to voter suppression. The state argued in its response that absentee ballot application assistance did not amount to speech. In their filing, plaintiffs argued the new law is “unconstitutionally vague” and “unconstitutionally overbroad.” “Defendants’ arguments only underscore SB 1’s fatal deficiencies: in both their motion to dismiss and opposition brief here,” the filing said. “Defendants can only attempt to explain the scope and meaning of SB 1 by inferring words and meaning that do not exist anywhere in the statute or conjuring their own definitions from thin air.”</span></p>

The findings, described in a letter to the Alaska Division of Elections, resulted from an investigation spurred by voter complaints, the Justice Department said. The department said it has asked the division to correct the problems. “Voting is a fundamental right for all American citizens and ensuring they have full access to the election process is a hallmark of our democracy,” Lane Tucker, U.S. attorney for the District of Alaska, said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to collaborate with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to work toward accessibility in voting for all Alaskans.” According to the findings, certain polling places in the state lacked accessible machines that would have allowed people with disabilities to cast their votes privately, a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Justice Department said. Physical barriers blocked access in some cases, the department said in its letter to state officials detailing the violations.</span></p>

Arizona prosecutors say the delay interfered with then-Secretary of State Katie Hobbs’ job to certify the statewide results. Defendants say the case should be dismissed because, while the countywide canvass was completed after the Nov. 28, 2022, deadline, Hobbs still certified the results before her own deadline of Dec. 5. They also claim the state grand jury that indicted them has no jurisdiction over the crimes they’re said to have committed. Fish disagreed and denied their motions through multiple opinions that hit the docket this week. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release that her office is prepared to move forward with the case. “This is a serious case, and the charges have merit,” she said. “Today&#8217;s ruling by the court supports that.”</span></p>

Laura Hobbs, who lost in the March 5 Board of Supervisors District 2 primary, filed a lawsuit in Shasta County Superior Court claiming it was the county elections office&#8217;s fault she lost the contest. Based on that suit, Judge Stephen Baker ordered a hearing to give Hobbs&#8217; lawyers a chance to persuade him why he shouldn&#8217;t dismiss the lawsuit. After hearing two days of witness testimony and seeing evidence of alleged irregularities in the March 5 primary, the county plans to file a &#8220;motion for judgment&#8221; with the court, &#8220;which means they didn&#8217;t state a clear reason to win the case,&#8221; said Christopher Pisano, an attorney hired by the county to represent it in the case. Pisano said his motion would be similar to requests to either dismiss the lawsuit or receive a summary judgment — a decision by the judge, without a full trial — in the case.</span></p>

As is common, a notice of appeal filed Monday did not detail arguments that lawyers for Byrd and Moody will make at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But they are challenging a final judgment issued May 15 by Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker involving part of the law that would prevent non-U.S. citizens from “collecting or handling” voter-registration applications. In issuing a permanent injunction, Walker said that part of the law violated the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. The groups Hispanic Federation and Poder Latinx and individual plaintiffs filed the challenge in May 2023 after Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican–controlled Legislature approved the restrictions. “Here plaintiffs have suffered — and continue to suffer — irreparable injuries,” Walker wrote in explaining the injunction. “Indeed, the individual members in this case have been unconstitutionally discriminated against based on their non-citizenship status. This discrimination has prevented plaintiffs from registering new voters — a lost opportunity that cannot be remedied with monetary damages.” The state also is appealing a July 2023 ruling by Walker that placed a preliminary injunction on the part of the law related to non-citizens and another part that would make it a felony for voter-registration group workers to keep personal information of voters. A panel of the appeals court heard arguments in January but has not issued an opinion.</span></p>

In her dismissal of the case, Gallagher said the group lacked standing because they did not allege any “concrete or particularized injury … but simply generalized grievances applicable to the community as a whole.” “Courts routinely find such grievances insufficient to demonstrate standing to sue,” Gallagher wrote. In a response letter filed at the same time as the appeal, the plaintiffs wrote they were “confused and disheartened” by the decision and called the judge’s reasoning “more of an excuse not to hear claims of evidence.” “We are confused because voting is a right, a civil right, not a privilege, and as United States citizens we have a right to question issues that concern us about our rights. Citizens always have ‘standing’ when they know their civil rights have been abridged,” they wrote. An opening brief in the appeal is due July 9, with the state’s response due Aug. 8, according to court records. Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown’s office is representing the elections board. A spokesperson for his office declined to comment about the appeal because the litigation is ongoing.</span></p>

Gretchen Whitmer, preserved other state rules that offer clerks broad discretion to accept signatures that don’t exactly match what’s on file. Both sides of the suit cast the decision as a win. Benson spokesperson Angela Benander said the court decision “reaffirmed that it was legal for the department to implement signature verification rules.”  Clerks “carefully review every ballot signature to ensure they agree sufficiently with the signature on file before accepting any ballot,” she said.  At issue is how local election officials should review signatures on absentee ballot applications and envelopes to ensure they were submitted by the actual registered voter.  Under a</span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2023-SB-0370"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amended last year by the Democratic-led Legislature, a signature is &#8220;invalid only if it differs in significant and obvious respects from the elector&#8217;s signature on file.” The Michigan Department of State’s subsequent December 2023 guidance told election clerks that “voter signatures are entitled to an initial presumption of validity.”  But Yates ruled that guidance was “incompatible with the Constitution and the laws of the state of Michigan.” “With apologies to Gertrude Stein … a presumption is a presumption is a presumption,” he wrote in the order. “Whether the guidance includes a gentle nudge instead of a hip check, it’s still a foul under Michigan law.”</span></p>

Last week, an attorney with the Montana Department of Justice wrote to the Supreme Court that utilizing the four election laws in another challenge would be “an ideal vehicle” for the court to address what the administration believes are holes in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision from last summer that could allow for the mostly right-wing theory to take hold in the U.S. court system. “Because the Montana Supreme Court has assumed a de facto new role as the final arbiter of all election legislation in Montana, this court’s review is urgently needed,” Montana Department of Justice Counsel of Record Peter Tortensen wrote in the filing. The Montana Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Austin Knudsen, filed a request for an extension of time last Wednesday with the U.S. Supreme Court asking the court to give the office until Aug. 26 to file its petition with the court calling on it to take up the appeal, referred to a petition for writ of certiorari.

After a two hour hearing in Las Vegas Silva ruled that the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Nevada GOP lacked standing to file the lawsuit. She also ruled that there was no way for the state to resolve the alleged issues when the lawsuit was filed, owing to federal guidelines on the timing of amending voting roll programs to remove ineligible voters. The groups have 14 days to amend their complaint. The ruling marks an initial legal defeat for Republican groups that have already launched a trio of election-related lawsuits in Nevada this year, including efforts to stop the counting of mail ballots after Election Day, as allowed in state law,  and the alleged inclusion of non-postmarked mail ballots.</span></p>

Justice Department attorneys argued in a filing that Ohio’s 2023 law violates federal law because it restricts people with disabilities from having equal access to cast absentee ballots. That mirrors accusations in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Cleveland by the American Civil Liberties Union and League of Women voters against two Republican state leaders, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Attorney General Dave Yost. The lawsuit seeks a federal judge to strike down the law. “No voter should be denied access to the ballot based on a disability,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement. “The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy, and the Justice Department will take action to safeguard that right for all eligible voters, including those with disabilities who need assistance casting absentee ballots.” The move gives federal attorneys standing to help argue for striking down Ohio’s 2023 law. They can do that because the Justice Department is charged with enforcing the Voting Rights Act that requires, among other things, states to avoid discriminating against voters with disabilities. U.S. District Judge Bridget Brennan is overseeing the Ohio case.</span></p>

Lassiter pleaded guilty to a single charge of disorderly conduct on March 27. He had to pay $330 in court costs, according to his online docket. Lassiter showed up to the polling place at Covenant Community Church on Derry Street on Nov. 7, 2023 saying he lost his wallet there. After he found the wallet, Lassiter thought it was missing $100, so as he reported the theft, he told police he’d go home, get a gun, and “handle it himself,” city police said in court documents. Lassiter returned and pulled a 9mm pistol from an ankle holster while still in his car, according to police. As Lassiter exited his vehicle, he appeared to point the pistol at an empty Bureau of Police vehicle, court documents said. Lassiter’s attorney, Mike Palermo, chalked the situation up to a misunderstanding. Police initially charged Lassiter with two more misdemeanors that were dropped: making terroristic threats, possession of an instrument of crime.</span></p>

Douglas will take his knowledge of election law to lead attendees behind the scenes of the most significant cases in the history of voting rights in America.
