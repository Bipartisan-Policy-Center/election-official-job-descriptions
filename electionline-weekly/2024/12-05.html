														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You’ve Got Mail</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">USPS release report on 2024 election</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the 2024 holiday mailing and shipping season gets underway, the U.S. Postal Service this week released their </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/what/government-services/election-mail/pdf/usps-post-election-report-2024-12-02.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 Post-Election Analysis Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12163" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPS2024Report-230x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPS2024Report-230x300.png 230w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPS2024Report-786x1024.png 786w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPS2024Report-768x1001.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPS2024Report.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />Almost 99.9% of general election mail ballots were delivered to election officials within a week and 97.7% of them were delivered within three days, postal officials said. The three-day return rate was similar to 2020 but slightly lower than the rate during the 2022 midterm elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2024, the Postal Service once again admirably performed our role of efficiently and effectively delivering the nation’s ballots,” said Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. “As we continue to transform the nation’s postal network to better meet the demands of the modern mailing and shipping customer, we stand ready to work with policymakers at all levels to make the nation’s effective vote by mail process even stronger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the General Election, USPS processed more than 99 million ballots. On average, Ballot Mail sent from voters to election officials were delivered within one day.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">99.22 Million Ballots Processed in the 2024 General Election: During the general election period of September 1 – November 15, the Postal Service delivered at least 99.22 million ballots to or from voters.*</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">99.88 Percent of Ballots Delivered to Election Officials Within a Week: The agency successfully processed, transported and delivered 99.88 percent of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days, and 99.64 percent within five days.**</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">97.73 Percent of Ballots Delivered from Voters to Election Officials Within Three Days: The Postal Service successfully returned 97.73 percent of ballots from voters to local election officials in fewer than three days.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 Day Average Delivery Time for Ballots from Voters to Election Officials: On average, the Postal Service delivered ballots from voters to election officials within one day.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.37 Billion Pieces of Political and Election Mail Delivered in 2024: The total mail volume surpassed 3 billion mailpieces for both Political and Election Mail tracked.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Postal Service its success in 2024 was the result of a deepened focus on operational precision and integrated communications, the engagement of the USPS Election and Government Mail Services team and execution of <img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />longstanding, proven operational processes and procedures, including extraordinary measures.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The USPS plays an important role in voting at home by ensuring the secure delivery of ballots to and from voters,&#8221; said Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the <a href="https://voteathome.org/">National Vote at Home Institute</a>. &#8220;We are glad to see that they continue to perform that job well. While we agree on the importance of election administrators using USPS recommendations on mail piece design and visibility, we also look forward to reviewing any process or system issues that election administrators raise for even better performance going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-postal-service-mail-ballots-9cc330d51c601cd8fbd7228add1663b5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not everyone was happy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Postal Service’s performance, and there were some </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-voting-mail-ballots-postal-service-7c942c832398d55843fbc20898d85385"><span style="font-weight: 400;">well-publicized</span></a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-dade-ballots-found-on-the-side-of-a-road-worker-fired/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and there is always work to be done to improve the system, but many elections officials were pleased with how the system worked this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From my experience, we had very positive experiences with the USPS this election cycle”  said </span><a href="https://elections.delaware.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delaware State Election Commissioner </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony J. Albence. “Our regional Election Mail point person was outstanding again this cycle, and we were in contact daily (and, often, multiple times a day).”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albence said they experienced no issues with delivery or return of ballots throughout the primary and General Election seasons. The Department of Elections worked with the local post offices and Delaware Processing and Distribution Center for daily ballot pickups directly from the plant in the days immediately preceding election days.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, representatives from the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) participate in Delaware’s Elections Security Group, composed of state and federal officials who work in partnership with our Department, which allowed us to also have insights from their portfolio within USPS operations,” Albence said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several states were impacted by major hurricanes in September and October, USPS reports that the delivery of election mail in the impacted states saw little impact. According to the analysis, Postal Service operations teams worked <img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-12164 alignleft" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPSReportImage2-1024x429.png" alt="" width="640" height="268" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPSReportImage2-1024x429.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPSReportImage2-300x126.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPSReportImage2-768x322.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPSReportImage2-1536x644.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USPSReportImage2.png 1766w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />around the clock to restore operations, deliver any backlog of mail and packages and reopen routes. Mobile retail units were also deployed in the aftermath of both hurricanes to serve as temporary post offices when local post offices were closed or inaccessible, providing residents in affected communities essential postal services and allowing them to receive and return Election Mail. The Postal Service was in regular contact with secretary of state offices and local election boards to address any issues as they arose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[T]he experience in Florida was very positive. We had many twice weekly Bridge Calls with District Managers from across Florida, meeting specifically to address problems arising from the two major hurricanes, and of course elections in general. These calls were open to local and state officials, and had good attendance, said <a href="https://www.leonvotes.gov/About-Us/Meet-the-Supervisor">Leon County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, there were certainly some unavoidable problems related to USPS closures and mail delivery issues for displaced voters relating to the hurricanes, but I think they handled that mess admirably well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earley said USPS officials were responsive and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Certainly, there were instances of late delivered ballots etc, but also instances of USPS employees going way above and beyond normal expectations, such as one USPS employee driving 5 ballots personally from South Carolina to my office on either Nov 4 or 5, to make certain they were received before the close of the polls on Nov 5,” he said. </span></p>

In Kansas, elections director Bryan Caskey said the vote broke three records. For the first time, more than 1.34 million Kansans voted, Caskey said. More than 2 million were registered for the election. And more people voted in person ahead of Election Day than ever before. In Nebraska, the November general election was the first with a voter ID requirement in Nebraska. Secretary of State Bob Evnen said it was a success. “Our county election officials and the Elections Division of the Secretary of State&#8217;s office performed exemplary work in this election,” he said. “Our voters as well, who were part of the first effort in the general election when voter ID was in effect, our voters stood up to that, and our voters complied well with the requirements of voter ID.” Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Wayne Bena said approximately 345 ballots were rejected due to voters not providing ID and 654 early voting ballots were rejected due to not signing the back of the envelope. Arizona officially certified the results of the 2024 election on November 25 and unlike in 2020 and 2022, where election denialists attempted to delay or stop the certification process due to unfounded claims of wide-spread fraud, Monday’s canvass went off without any hiccups, leading some to declare the demise of election denialism. “I think the age of election denialism, for all intents and purposes, is dead,” Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during the canvass. The certification has gone completely without controversy though. In </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/04/canvass-colorado-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, canvass board members in seven counties voted against certifying the 2024 general election results, citing a recent password leak from the secretary of state’s office as the reason. Members in Archuleta, Boulder, Eagle, El Paso, Gilpin, Jefferson and Larimer counties refused to certify the results of the Nov. 5 election but because the other board member and county clerk voted in favor of certification in each of those counties, the election was still certified. And in </span><a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/california-counties-certify-election-results-for-the-first-time-on-unified-deadline/article_89856ae4-b1e5-11ef-9beb-c7c95d331b6d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, county elections offices certified November 5th election results under a new mandate requiring all counties to finalize on December 3rd, allowing more time for mail-in ballot processing. California’s Assembly Bill 3184, signed into law on September 22nd, mandated a 28-day window to certify results. While the bill aimed to address potential issues with mail-in ballots, some election officials were not entirely on board with the extended timeline. The results must now be certified by county boards of supervisors before finally being certified by the state. </span></p>

FM3 Research surveyed 1,658 voters after they cast their ballots. According to the results, more voters in East Portland’s District 1 said they didn’t understand the electoral changes than voters in the city’s three other districts. Voters of color were also more likely to express confusion about the ballot changes than white voters, per the poll. The survey follows a historic overhaul to Portland’s city government and voting systems, approved by voters in 2022. That decision increased the size of Portland City Council, created geographic voting districts, added a city administrator position, and established ranked choice voting, among other things. While most changes go into effect next year, November saw the city’s first ranked choice voting election. The FM3 poll focused narrowly on how Portlanders felt about the new form of voting. In all, 91% of those polled said they understood how to fill out the city ballot, which featured two types of ranked choice voting: one for Portland mayor and another for city councilors. Voters were less confident in the specific type of voting in City Council races; Portlanders used a single ballot to elect three district councilors all at once. According to the poll, 22% of surveyed voters said they did not understand this process. In District 1, which includes nearly all of Portland neighborhoods east of I-205, 37% of voters said they didn’t understand the council voting process. That’s at least 10% higher than the rate of misunderstanding in each of the city’s other three districts. According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, city officials remain optimistic about the poll’s results, which shows that the majority of Portland voters understood the city’s first foray into ranked choice voting. “Broadly, Portland voters report an understanding of ranked-choice voting according to this poll, an encouraging start for an historic electoral reform,” said Deborah Scroggin, who manages the city’s elections division. Elections staff plan to present a more detailed report at a Dec. 18 council meeting.</span></p>

This year’s rosier view of election administration, according to PRC, is entirely driven by a shift in views among those who voted for Donald Trump for president:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">93% of Trump voters say the 2024 elections were run and administered at least somewhat well.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters who supported Kamala Harris for president are less likely today to say the elections this November were run well than Biden’s voters were four years ago.

D&#8217;Souza acknowledged that the film and book &#8220;create the impression that these individuals were mules that had been identified as suspected ballot harvesters based on their geotracked cell phone data.&#8221; Though their faces were blurred, Andrews has publicly come forth and sued over the use of his image, and D&#8217;Souza said he owes Andrews an apology.

This opportunity to debrief helps foster growth and improvements within the office and is a critical aspect of preparing for future elections. The Center for Civic Design has a </span><a href="https://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/post-election-debrief-toolkit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">toolkit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is the first part of a series based on its election planning framework. It is for projects that require sufficient time, energy, and creativity for successful implementation. Planning is the opportunity to set goals for projects that help you improve your office. Planning for these types of projects happens in 4 stages. This toolkit is to support you through the first stage: Debrief an election. Debriefing at the end of an election is important because it allows you and your office to evaluate how you did and to move away from feeling like you are always putting out fires.   </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debrief an election. Create and facilitate space for you and your team to uncover areas of improvement that can increase employee satisfaction and improve the experience of your voters. Tool: Post-election debrief toolkit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set practical goals for the next election. Synthesize your reflection, implement realistic plans, and move them forward. Tool coming winter 2025. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check in on your goals. Create space in your office to check in and prioritize work throughout the year. Tool coming spring 2025. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustain your goals over time. Create an office culture that welcomes collaboration and breaks down silos. Tool coming summer 2025.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support you through the rest of the stages, CCD is developing 3 more nonpartisan generic resources that encourage offices to adopt a collaborative, forward-thinking mindset about planning. They will be released in 2025. </span></p>

The ninth report provides updated findings from the nationally representative survey for the third quarter of 2024, with responses from over 400 local elected officials — as well as 200 school board officials — putting the total number of participants across all nine survey waves at more than 4,100. This round of respondents was surveyed in the run-up to the 2024 election, covering their experiences between July and October. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the second quarter of the year, significantly more local elected officials reported experiencing insults and harassment this quarter, while reports of threats continued at consistent levels. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the past nine survey rounds, in any given three-month period, approximately one in two officials have reported experiencing insults, one in three have reported harassment, and one in six have reported threats. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women and minority officials disproportionately report experiencing hostility compared to their counterparts. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While survey results for the fourth quarter of 2024 covering the election period will be released in early 2025, the latest findings confirm that local officials faced a heightened climate of hostility through the pre-election period. These persistent high levels of hostility demonstrate that community efforts to protect civic space, as well as further research to understand and respond to these risks, will remain imperative in the post-election period, particularly for women and minority officials.  This research is produced as part of a joint project launched by BDI and CivicPulse in 2022 to conduct representative national surveys of local officials on their experiences facing threats and harassment. Quarterly surveys of municipal, county, township, and school board officials will continue into 2025.</span></p>

CIRCLE researchers have produced more than a dozen analyses of the youth vote. Some highlights:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major differences by race and gender: While every group of youth shifted toward Donald Trump in this election, young women and youth of color still preferred Harris by wide margins. But white youth and young men, who had favored the Democratic candidate in 2020, preferred Trump this year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focused on the economy: When asked about their #1 issue in this election, young voters overwhelmingly chose the economy and jobs, followed by abortion and immigration. And youth who prioritized the economy and immigration were much more likely to vote for Trump.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A different electorate: Youth who voted in 2024 were more likely to identify as conservative and Republican than in 2020. And young Trump voters were more diverse and highly educated than in the past election—and more moderate than older Trump voters.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming weeks, CIRCLE will also publish an initial analysis of its own post-election youth survey, which will also include insights on young people who did not vote and some of the barriers to their participation. </span></p>

Republicans, senior citizens, Black and white, have asked, ‘Why can’t we have early voting? We don’t want to stand in line.’” Alabama does not currently allow people to vote in-person prior to Election Day. Alabama currently offers voting by absentee ballot, but only for a limited number of reasons. Under Jackson’s bill, each county would provide at least one early voting center. The centers must be open between four to six days prior to election day, and they must be open for at least four hours, depending on the day. The proposal would require the centers to be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and Saturday, and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>

At the proposal’s core is shifting local elections for mayor, the Anchorage Assembly and School Board from April to November, when they’d be tacked on to biennial state and federal contests. South Anchorage Assembly member Randy Sulte is leading the push for the proposal.  If passed by the Assembly, it would appear as a ballot proposition in the upcoming spring municipal election. Under the proposal, local positions would be voted on every two years, instead of in annual elections. Accordingly, instead of local terms of office lasting three years as they do presently, they would extend to four years. Sulte said the impetus for the proposal is to save the public money by running fewer elections and to boost civic engagement by capitalizing on the higher turnout rates seen in state and federal contests. “I’m looking primarily at the money driver. Why wouldn’t we want it to cost less and increase turnout?” asked Sulte. “The third piece is voter fatigue,” he said. “People just get voter fatigue.”</span></p>

Maricopa County alone saw over 225,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day this year. Sen. J.D. Mesnard (R-Chandler) introduced the legislation, which is a carbon-copy of the bill he sponsored last session that Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed. He told the Arizona Mirror that he introduced an identical bill to have a “good starting point” and hopes to negotiate with others to get it passed in some form.  “I’ve heard some comments that were not giving me a lot of hope from the Governor’s Office on her willingness to address this issue,” Mesnard said, adding that he hopes Hobbs will come to the table to find a version of the bill they can all agree on.  A spokesman for Hobbs did not respond to a request for comment.  The bill is a reaction to the speed at which Arizona counts its ballots, according to Mesnard. Many, including Mesnard and other local Republicans, have often lamented that Arizona’s dayslong post-election ballot counting isn’t as efficient as Florida, which posts the vast majority of its election results by the end of election night.</span></p>

Collins said by doing this, the hope is to get younger Arkansans excited to cast their vote which is a win for the state and as soon as they become eligible, the process will be easy. &#8220;Once they turn 18, they should be able to vote, it should be easy for them to vote,&#8221; said Collins. &#8220;They should be able to register when they are in high school and excited to participate in the process.&#8221;</span></p>

Whitmer’s office said the bills build on the administration’s “commitment to defending fair and free elections by reducing the threat of voter intimidation and suppression.” “Today, we are taking action to prevent voter intimidation and gun violence in our state,” said Tsernoglou. “By increasing security measures, such as this legislation, we are ensuring that every Michigander can cast their ballot free from intimidation and that every election worker can perform their duty without fear of violence.

In a vote along party lines, the committee passed four bills that make up the proposed Michigan Voting Rights Act. Next, the bills will go before the entire House for a vote. They were approved by the Senate back in September after spending nearly a year in that chamber’s committee. The bills aim to expand ballot access by providing ballots in more languages, create a voting data clearinghouse, codify protections for voters who may need help casting their ballot, and broadly aim to prevent voting suppression. According to Votebeat, lawmakers appeared to resolve one of the biggest concerns about the bills: who would actually pay for the significant costs the legislation would impose. Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie said recent House amendments to the bill would place much of the financial burden — about $15 million, he estimated — on the Department of State rather than local governments.</span></p>

Republicans are hoping to expand the law, known as House Bill 1569. It requires all voters to present ID at the polls or they won’t be allowed to vote. And it requires that all new voters must present hard copies to prove their U.S. citizenship through a birth certificate, passport, or other documents. Rep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican and the architect of the existing law, is introducing legislation to extend the documentary requirements to absentee voters. Lynn is also putting forward a bill meant to help people who can’t afford to pay to obtain a copy of their birth certificate from another state – and allowing the Secretary of State’s Office to use databases to attempt to confirm the person’s citizenship. Democrats, meanwhile, are introducing a bill to repeal the law. They argue the new requirements will impose excessive burdens to vote and will disenfranchise people who don’t have immediate access to identification and citizenship documents.</span></p>

The law was passed in direct response to a state law enacted last year that mandates most local elections in counties outside of New York City be held in even-numbered years, which would make them coincide with state and federal elections. Riverhead’s new local law adds a new section to Chapter 103 of the town code, pertaining to biennial town elections. It would require elections for the offices of supervisor, town council, town clerk, receiver of taxes, highway superintendent and assessors to be held in odd-numbered years, as they are currently held now.  A separate local law to keep the elections for town justice as they are presently scheduled is expected to be voted on by the Town Board at its next meeting. The town’s two justices are elected for four-year terms — one during an odd-year election and one during an even-year election.</span></p>

Roy Cooper (D) </span><a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2024-11-26/cooper-vetoes-bill-power-governor-democrats-josh-stein-election-board"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would shift power away from incoming Governor Josh Stein and other newly elected Democrats. Cooper called the legislation passed last week a &#8220;sham&#8221; because it&#8217;s billed as a disaster relief measure but does little for western North Carolina&#8217;s Helene recovery. He said the bill is unconstitutional because it would take away the governor&#8217;s power to appoint members of the State Board of Elections and Utilities Commission. Republican lawmakers want to shift election oversight to the state auditor after GOP candidate Dave Boliek won that office. They say the elections board hasn&#8217;t worked fairly under a Democratic majority. &#8220;We have tried on multiple occasions to put forward the idea that we need to have balance on the board that is responsible for counting votes and making decisions about elections, and the Democrats have said, &#8216;no, no, no, hell no,'&#8221; Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters last week. &#8220;And so we just decided that it was time for us to go ahead and take action.&#8221; On December 2, </span><a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/67365/nc-senate-overrides-veto-of-bill-shifting-elections-board-appointment-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Senate overrode Cooper’s veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The House will meet later this month to vote on an override. During the first vote on the bill, three House Republicans in the Helene-impacted region voted against the bill. None have indicated how they’ll vote on the veto override, although their votes would now be necessary to override the governor’s veto of the appointment shift bill.  Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger said he’s “confident the House will have the votes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate voted to approve two constitutional amendments, sending them to the House for consideration. If approved by both chambers, they would be placed on the 2026 ballot for voter approval; they cannot be vetoed by the governor. </span><a href="https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewBillDocument/2023/9568/0/DRS35405-TCy-65"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 921</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require all North Carolina v</span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/nc-republicans-unveil-new-constitutional-amendments-on-income-tax-voter-id/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oters to present photo ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — including those voting by mail.

Many of the bills are aimed at past practices in Harris County. State Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) pre-filed seven bills that he said address &#8220;election integrity.&#8221; Six of these passed the Senate last year but failed to pass the House by the end of the regular session. The lead bill, reintroduced as</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB505"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 505</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, provides for countywide election audits by the state, with the prospect of the Secretary of State imposing an outside conservator to oversee future elections in the event the audit uncovers violations of state election law. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB506"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 506</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prevent local governments from misleading voters with deceptive ballot proposition language. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB507"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 507</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would increase penalties for failing to deliver election supplies — a response to shortages of ballot paper at Republican-leaning voting centers in Harris County during the 2022 general election. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB508"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 508</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addresses situations where a county takes longer than 24 hours after the polls close to report election results, as occurred in Harris County during the March 2022 primary elections. The bill would allow the Secretary of State to step in and oversee the process of reporting election results when the county has failed to meet the 24-hour deadline. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB509"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 509</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require a county to notify the state Attorney General&#8217;s Office, rather than just the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office, if it files an action under the Texas Election Code seeking a court order to keep the polls open longer, as occurred in Harris County during the November 2022 general election. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB510"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 510</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow the state to withhold payment for voter registrars for not doing their jobs. That could be used to penalize a registrar who fails to cancel voter registrations or respond quickly enough to challenges of voters&#8217; registrations. The newest measure,</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB511"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 511</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would ban local governments from using public funds to send out unsolicited voter registration cards. Harris County pursued a program along these lines in 2020 until the Texas Supreme Court intervened at the request of Attorney General Ken Paxton. During the 2024 election cycle, Paxton threatened to sue Bexar and Travis Counties for pursuing similar programs.</span></p>

Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain. The vote tees the bill up for prioritized consideration when the Legislature convenes in its 2025 general session on Jan. 25.  The legislation comes as some elected officials have expressed concerns about Utah County Clerk Aaron Davidson tracking information on how at least two politicians returned their ballots. Gricius’ bill, as currently drafted, would make it “unlawful for a person to access an election record to determine whether a specific voter” or a small, identifiable group of voters “voted in person or otherwise,” the method they used to return their ballot, or the date they voted or returned their ballot. Under the bill, an election official who already has lawful access to such election records may only access or disclose the information “to the extent necessary to fulfill a duty” within their capacity as an election official, to comply with a court order, or if the specific voter requests in writing that the election official access the information.  “What this bill essentially says is you cannot do a looky-loo at someone’s information for fun,” Gricius said. “If you don’t have a specific election-related purpose, then you can’t just look up specific individuals.” A violation of the bill would be a class B misdemeanor. If the Legislature approves it, it would take effect on May 7.</span></p>

Three registered voters in Maricopa County, including Arizona Republican Party Chair Gina Swoboda, sued Secretary of State Adrian Fontes in June, claiming his failure to remove ineligible voters from the state’s voter rolls threatens to dilute the weight of their votes and diminish their confidence in election integrity. But Lanza remains unconvinced, so far, that the plaintiffs have shown a concrete injury required to establish standing. He released a tentative order dismissing the case in November, reflecting his skepticism.  “Nothing you’re alleging is violating your clients&#8217; right to vote,” the Donald Trump appointee said during a motion to dismiss hearing this week. The plaintiffs cast a wide net when making their claim — based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, state voting surveys and countywide death counts, they say that the voter rolls contain between 500,000 and 1,270,000 ineligible voters who should have been removed in accordance with the National Voting Rights Act. Lanza agreed there are too many people registered but added: &#8220;There’s a bunch of steps between over-registration and your vote being diluted. This is the type of generalized, nonspecific injury that does not hold standing.” He told the plaintiffs that their injury cannot be a nebulous lack of confidence or a fear of potential vote dilution, but instead must be a tangible result of Fontes&#8217; actions or inaction.</span></p>

DeFilippo was ordered to serve one year of probation, including three weekends of incarceration, and to pay a $15,000 fine. Prosecutors said that from June 2018 until July 2021. while he was on the city council,  owned several rental properties that he leased to students at Sacred Heart University in his district. &#8220;Although Bridgeport’s City Council elections are typically held in odd-numbered years, because of repeated absentee ballot irregularities in the Democratic primary for the 133rd District, the September 2017 primary was re-run in November 2017, and re-run again in April 2018, and the general election took place in June 2018.,&#8221; prosecutors said. &#8220;On April 10, 2018, DeFilippo was selected as one of the two Democratic nominees for the 133rd District and, on June 26, 2018, he was elected to the Bridgeport City Council.&#8221; During those elections, DeFilippo stole and falsified Voter Registration Applications and absentee balloting documents, forged signatures, and submitted fraudulent election documents to election officials in the name of some of his tenants who resided in the 133rd District.  The actions denied DeFilippo’s tenants of their right to vote, deprived voters in the district of their right to have their votes fully counted by diluting election results with fraudulent registrations and ballots. On May 6, 2024, DeFilippo pleaded guilty to deprivation of rights under color of law.</span></p>

By election day, the County Clerk deemed the return envelopes of 1069 mailed in ballots “deficient.” According to state law, a return envelope can be deemed deficient if the voter fails to sign the envelope, the signature on the envelope does not match the signature on file or some other condition of the envelope prevents the ballot from being counted. After ballots were cured, incumbent Council Member Tom Cook came away with 26,423 votes (41.6%), which is 97 more than King’s 26,326 votes (41.4%), according to results finalized by the state Office of Elections. Many voters who discovered their ballots had not been counted learned that their return envelope had been deemed deficient despite the signature they put on their envelope being the same as their ordinary signature, according to a news release. “Furthermore, the 2024 Maui rejection rate for signature related deficiencies is nearly double the 2022 state average and more than four times the 2022 national average. The national rejection rate for signature related problems in the 2022 election was .4% of ballots mailed in. The state rejection rate for signature problems in the 2022 election was 1%. Maui County’s 2024 rejection rate was 1.9%,” according to the release. The challenge alleges the County Clerk failed to comply with standards and erroneously deemed return envelopes deficient. Challengers say their constitutional right of equal protection and due process were violated. Approximately 1/3 of all voters who received deficiency notices timely cured their envelopes and their ballots were counted, the County Clerk reports. </span></p>

The complaint details a back and forth with the federal government after state election officials checked voter rolls against a list of people who identified themselves as noncitizens with the state’s Department of Transportation. The vast majority of the 2,176 names had subsequently registered to vote or voted, meaning that some of those people could have become naturalized citizens in the lapsed time. Secretary of State Paul Pate’s office requested information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on the citizenship status of those individuals but did not get it, the complaint alleges. Federal authorities’ “failure meant that the State had to rely on the best — imperfect — data it had available to ensure that no Iowan’s vote was canceled by an illegal, noncitizen vote,” a joint statement from Pate and Attorney General Brenna Bird said. A DHS spokesperson said in an email to The Associated Press that the federal agency does not comment on pending litigation but added that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have “engaged with Iowa and will continue to correspond with them directly through official channels.” </span></p>

Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) 2023 directive that designated certain state and federal agencies as voter registration sites.  In a complaint filed this summer, the Republican plaintiffs alleged that Whitmer and other state officials exceeded their authority by “unilaterally” authorizing voter registration to take place at various agencies, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA). While the RNC and Trump Campaign argued that Michigan law prohibits state officials from designating voter registration sites without express approval from the state Legislature, Whitmer maintained that her actions were consistent with state and federal law. Whitmer and other state officials who were sued also cited a 2021 executive order from President Joe Biden that directed federal departments and agencies to partner with the states to facilitate voter registration. In addition to naming Michigan’s governor and secretary of state as defendants, the GOP legal challenge implicated top federal officials from the VA and SBA, alleging they violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) by entering into agreements with state officials that designated their respective agencies as voter registration sites. The Republican suit claimed without evidence that expanding voter registration sites  “undermines the integrity of elections by increasing the opportunity for individuals to register to vote even though they are ineligible to do so” and suggested it would “harm the electoral prospects of Republican candidates.” </span></p>

It’s a race that could determine the balance of power in the Minnesota House. “The actions of Scott County elections officials constitute a serious breach of not only Minnesota Election Law, but the public trust in our electoral system,” the lawsuit said. Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke was declared the winner last week of the swing suburban Shakopee-area District 54A race by 14 votes after a recount and the official canvass. But Scott County election officials had said earlier, after a post-election audit, that they were unable to account for 21 absentee ballots in the district southwest of Minneapolis. County Attorney Ronald Hocevar reported last Wednesday that his preliminary investigation determined that election workers most likely threw at least 20 of those absentee ballots away, and that they may have been in a paper bale that a recycler had already sent away for shredding. He wrote that they “most likely will not be recovered,” and that even if they were found, it’s unlikely that an unbroken chain of custody could be proven to assure that they weren’t tampered with. The county attorney concluded that the 20 ballots, all from the same precinct, were properly accepted for counting on Oct. 17, but “most likely were never removed from their secrecy envelopes,” and were probably still in them when those envelopes were thrown away. Minnesota House Republicans filed Monday’s lawsuit on behalf of GOP candidate Aaron Paul, asking a court to declare the results invalid and Tabke’s seat vacant, saying the “undisputed facts” make it impossible to rely on the results.</span></p>

The decision by Circuit Judge Jon Beetem found the individual voters and organizations that sued — the Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters — were unable to show they had been harmed by the application of the law and lacked standing to bring the case. And addressing the particulars of their challenge, Beetem wrote the burdens were not onerous on any individual voter. The law requires voters to show a Missouri or federally issued identification that includes a photo, the holder’s date of birth and an expiration date. Identification that has been expired for less than a year is acceptable. “The individual plaintiffs and/or Missouri voters generally do not have a legally protectable interest in avoiding the everyday burdens of getting an expired license renewed,” Beetem wrote. “Any of the individual plaintiffs’ alleged injuries in this regard are generalized grievances shared by the population as a whole.” The appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court will argue that Beetem applied the wrong standard to his analysis, said Denise Lieberman, director of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition and one of the lead attorneys on the case. The focus should be on the sometimes insurmountable burdens that thousands of Missourians face obtaining the documents to secure the needed identification, she said. “The court got the test wrong,” Lieberman said. “It is the burden of the state to demonstrate it has no other way to advance its interests than through a law that burdens voters in this way.”</span></p>

On November 27, a judge issued a ruling that threatened to further delay the certification process as the Jan. 2 swearing-in looms. The judge, in response to a lawsuit, ordered Puerto Rico’s State Elections Commission to count early votes following ID verification even if the postal address used to request those votes is different from the one in the general voter registration. “Contrary to what some actors in our society may have encouraged in public opinion, our legal framework in electoral matters is covered with guarantees of reliability, which leave no room for speculation or doubts about the validity of early votes,” Judge Raúl A. Candelario López wrote. The Nov. 21 lawsuit was filed by a dozen voters affiliated with the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which won the gubernatorial race, according to preliminary results. The ruling noted that those voters alleged “their rights are being violated since they requested early voting, complied with all the requirements for it, and their votes are being subject to additional requirements without any legal basis.” Judicial officials already are investigating allegations made before Nov. 2 about electoral crimes including people who said they received confirmations for early voting when they had made no such request. Numerous obstacles have delayed the certification process, including an increase in write-in votes and a flurry of errors detected in bedside ballots, prompting all electoral commissioners to agree to start counting more than 60,000 such votes from scratch. The delay prompted electoral commissioners last week to temporarily halt the counting of ballots cast in a nonbinding referendum also held Nov. 5 on Puerto Rico’s political status so they could focus on election ballots. Local law dictates the certification process must be completed by Dec. 31.</span></p>

Green’s appeal was in response to Judge William Seals’ decision which ruled that Carla Taylor was a duly elected council member and should be seated. “The commission had a meeting to discuss a pending appeal that’s presently pending at the South Carolina Supreme Court related to the recent town council election regarding the seat that Carla Taylor arguably won that race. So the commission just voted to withdraw that appeal that’s currently pending in the Supreme Court,” Boyd said after the meeting.

The amendments on the ballot included city charter changes such as requiring all city commissioners to reside within city limits, and provide process and reasons for removal of municipal judges. San Benito resident, and former EDC board member, Julian Rios filed a lawsuit s over the amendments. The lawsuit alleges the city violated the Texas Open Meetings Act when the proposed charter amendments were placed on the ballot.  “It protected the voter’s rights, that is what this decision actually did,” Jeff Diamant, Rios’ attorney, told Channel 5 News when asked about the Monday ruling. “The voters are entitled to see transparency; they are entitled to know what they are voting on.” Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza told Channel 5 News his office has not been made aware of the court&#8217;s decision.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-future-of-election-reform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future of Election Reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Election reformers suffered some problems in 2024 when ballot initiatives proposing open primaries and ranked choice voting lost in several states. These reforms had been proposed as ways to improve campaign discourse, empower independents, and elect more moderate candidates. States where ranked choice voting and open primaries were on the ballot either opposed the proposals outright or supported prohibitions on adopting the measures. While rationales differed, many opponents claimed ranked choice voting was too complicated, voters would be confused by the electoral mechanism, and the reform violated traditional voting practices of “one person, one vote.” This is despite evidence in places where ranked-choice-voting has been adopted that voters cast their ballots accurately, saw more civil discourse, and experienced more moderate governance.  On December 12, join the Governance Studies program at Brookings for a webinar featuring election experts who will analyze the 2024 election ballot initiatives and discuss the lessons to be learned for future efforts at election reform. <strong>When:</strong> December 12, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. </span></p>
