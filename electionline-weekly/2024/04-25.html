</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical security takes on an added urgency</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the pre-2020 halcyon days, the physical security of an election and the officials who conduct them, while important, took a bit of a backseat to concerns about cyberthreats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events surrounding and following the 2020 election </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-shows-high-turnover-amid-safety-threats-and"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changed all of that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and state and local elections officials are now equally as focused on protecting the physical safety of themselves and poll workers as they are the cyber side of an election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/state-laws-providing-protection-for-election-officials-and-staff"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are passing bills, the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/25/doj-threats-harassment-election-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is indicting offenders and groups from </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/physical-security-checklist-polling-locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CISA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-official-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the </span><a href="https://safeelections.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are providing tools to help state and local election officials stay safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at some of the work being done to secure elections workers in 2024 and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NEW! Physical Security Checklist From CISA</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released the</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/physical-security-checklist-polling-locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Physical Security Checklist for Polling Locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new tool designed to bolster security preparedness for the frontline of U.S. elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The checklist, part of CISA’s</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/election-security-resource-library"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suite of election security resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is tailored to empower election workers with actionable and accessible security measures for locations serving as temporary election facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Protecting against physical threats to election locations like polling places where Americans cast their vote is one of the most significant responsibilities election officials bear. CISA is committed to doing anything we can to support this mission,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley. “The people who run elections and those who volunteer to work at polling places are heroes, and CISA is proud to support them, including with critical threat awareness and planning tools such as this checklist. While no measure can eliminate all risk, these resources empower officials to understand, mitigate, and address security challenges proactively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resource is designed for simplicity, requiring no prior security expertise for implementation. It covers pre-planning and Election Day procedures and is adaptable to individual facility needs and resources. Through a series of yes or no questions, election workers and volunteers can assess potential security threats and incidents, aiding in the establishment and improvement of physical security measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Physical Security Checklist for Polling Locations is one of a collection of resources CISA has developed to support the physical security of election infrastructure.  The agency has Protective Security Advisors serving all 50 states, District of Columbia, and territories who support state and local election officials through sharing information, conducting physical security assessments of election facilities, and offering no-cost services and trainings on areas like de-escalation techniques, responding to active shooter situations, and other physical threat specific offerings to address the evolving threats facing election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Legislation</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5304" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png" alt="" width="300" height="127" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In its most recent update, dated April 12, The </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/state-laws-providing-protection-for-election-officials-and-staff"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that since 2020,18 states have enacted laws specifically addressing protections for election officials and poll workers. How states protect these individuals varies.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten states have criminalized intimidation and/or interference with election workers by establishing incarceration and fines for offenders.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine requires election workers to take classes in de-escalation tactics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington allow election officials to be included in the state’s address confidentiality programs. Washington also specifically addresses cyber harassment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a number of states have r</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/more-states-move-to-restrict-guns-at-polling-sites-to-protect-workers-voters-from-threats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecently passed legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning or limiting </span><a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/img/maps/citations-guns-in-polling-places.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at </span><a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/democracy-maps/guns_in_polling_places"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joining a growing list of states that already had some prohibition on the books </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Prosecution</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-6136" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DOJ.png" alt="" width="145" height="141" />In late March, the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/25/doj-threats-harassment-election-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that reports of widespread threats against officials running the 2020 and 2022 elections have resulted in charges against roughly 20 people, with more than a half dozen receiving sentences between one and 3½ years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at a press conference in Arizona, DOJ officials said that it remains to be seen if the stiff sentences will serve as an effective deterrent to would-be-criminals in future election cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let these cases be a lesson not to take or attempt to take the rule of law into one’s own hands,” said U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino, Arizona’s top federal prosecutor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentences in the</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/25/justice-department-threats-election-officials-00148934"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases pursued by the task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have ranged from 30 days to three and a half years, according to the Justice Department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as officials touted their efforts at the press conference, DOJ official John Keller acknowledged that “the vast majority” of the disturbing and intimidating messages reported to the Justice Department can’t be prosecuted because they don’t appear to meet the Supreme Court’s standards for a so-called “true threat.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Trainings</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several states made the news recently for the trainings they did (and continue to do) with officials from the </span><a href="https://safeelections.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11081" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-at-11.36.21 AM-300x81.png" alt="" width="300" height="81" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-at-11.36.21 AM-300x81.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-at-11.36.21 AM-768x206.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-at-11.36.21 AM.png 812w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Michigan</span><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-workers-threats-2024-law-enforcement-d2702ae1e1e57c766c3df36f1a7ff763?ref=upstract.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was granted access inside the committee’s training session in Traverse City and allowed to observe the scenarios election workers are likely to face this year and the discussions about how they and law enforcement can prepare for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Michigan training, former Rochester Hills Clerk Tina Barton and former Larimer County, Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith walked local officials through numerous scenarios they could encounter in the coming months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of these scenarios are sensational. They are all things that have already happened in some way, shape or form across the country,” Barton told the group. “To say, ‘Oh, that could never happen.’ These things are already happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the AP, Smith often speaks directly to the police officers and sheriff’s deputies in the room, explaining the role they play in elections and how the environment has changed since 2020. In past years, election officials were likely to deal with issues on their own, such as protesters or unruly citizens looking to promote their candidates at polling places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not that simple anymore,” Smith tells the group. “We need to be at the table and be part of the solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, whose office helped sponsor and coordinate the Traverse City training, said it’s imperative for law enforcement and election officials to work together to ensure a smooth election in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Georgia</span><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-election-officials-and-police-prepare-for-voting-dangers/TFJXE7AS6NFGVLLMJ25DEYEIF4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had an article this week on the trainings happening in the Peach State to prepare local election officials for November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a training exercise last week at Paulding County’s election office, sheriffs and election officials talked through how they would both ensure public safety and protect voting from interference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hopefully it will not grow and get worse than it did in 2020, but I think there’s a chance it will,” said Chris Harvey, a former Georgia elections director who now oversees law enforcement training. “We’re not trying to make you really paranoid; we’re trying to make you a little paranoid and to plan for worst-case scenarios.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serious problems at polling places would require a police response. Election officials would need law enforcement if there were a bomb threat, voter intimidation or interference while election workers tried to count votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minor situations could be managed by election officials, such as talking through a voter’s concerns in a quiet corner or by countering disinformation on social media platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election threats are real, and we need to take them seriously,” Paulding County Elections Director Deidre Holden told the AJC. “November is going to be crazy. That’s usually when the most people come out, and you don’t want people to be agitated.”</span></p>

Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt </span><a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/state-details.aspx?newsid=603"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the election ran efficiently and successfully, noting minimal reports of routine issues from voters across Pennsylvania. “Dedicated and hard-working county election staff and poll workers across the Commonwealth have again conducted a free, fair, safe and secure election,” Schmidt said. “Voters, whether voting by mail or in person at their polling places, also deserve recognition for casting their ballots and ensuring their voices are heard.” Counties received nearly 896,000 mail ballot applications for the primary – more than 795,000 applications for no-excuse mail-in ballots and more than 100,000 applications for absentee ballots. As of the 8 p.m. return deadline, counties had received more than 75% of those completed ballots. &#8220;Very, very quiet&#8221; said Beth Hopkins, </span><a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/luzerne-county/election-day-turnout-luzerne-county-northumberland-county-shamokin/523-fd94b9ef-1272-450f-b00e-34a13f225651"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lackawanna County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Elections Director. &#8220;I would think that November will be much more busy.&#8221; Counties like </span><a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/pre-canvassing-underway-lancaster-county-election-day/521-dc2c94a0-a127-4238-976f-3710f8a94fe6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lancaster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were considering Tuesday’s primary a test-run for November. Even counties, like </span><a href="https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/election/luzerne-county-primary-election-ran-smoothly-officials-say/article_b41a517b-cd0c-54c3-a27b-5bfc72663c9b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luzerne</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/northampton-county/northampton-county-officials-breathe-sigh-of-relief-after-quiet-election-day-brace-for-november"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northampton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which have seen issues in the past, reported relatively few, if any problems. Issues did continue to plague Pennsylvania’s </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2024/04/23/primary-mail-ballot-rejections-incomplete-year-election-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote-by-mail process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> though. A design change Pennsylvania officials made to prevent voters from making a disqualifying error on their mail ballots seems to have tripped up a number of voters. Numerous counties reporting having to set aside improperly dated ballots. Tuesday proved to be a good day for the youth vote. At Lincoln High School in </span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/election-pennsylvania-philadelphia-teenagers-polling-place/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayfair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearly all of the poll workers were teenagers. Some Lincoln students. Others recent grads. “The kids know what they’re doing here, they get good reviews here. The adults who are here with them always give us very positive feedback. The community gives us positive feedback,” said Sarah Caswell, a special education and science teacher. The </span><a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-students-staff-work-polls-primary-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves as a polling site in Philadelphia and many students and staff serve as poll workers. Lucy Rupertus is a first-year political science major from Philadelphia who spent her inaugural primary day as a poll worker on Tuesday. Her voter-registration efforts inspired her to come out to work at the polls. “You spend all year getting people registered to vote and helping to put up signage on campus to encourage people to come out, and this is an opportunity to see the fruits of our labor,” she said. And on the opposite side of the state in the </span><a href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/students-from-former-soviet-republics-get-taste-of-democracy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pittsburgh area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, exchange students from Georgia and Latvia got to see how American democracy works up close. “I’m learning about the importance of local government and the importance of voting and participating in local elections,” said Tengo Kandelaki, who met voters as they entered the polling site at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Hempfield’s West Point neighborhood. </span></p>

Easy to access data and scans of ballots for a legitimate full record of election results. However, the public can rest easy as the names on the ballots are removed.  Ada County elections said the tool, &#8220;will allow the public to explore a wide range of Ada County election data, including ballot images and Cast Vote Records (CVR) for all elections from 2022 forward. The Ballot Verifier is designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of every vote cast in Ada County elections. It allows voters to verify that ballots are being tabulated correctly, while also providing peace of mind that their voices were heard accurately.&#8221; Saul Seyler is the Elections Director for Ada County. He walked KTVB through the new tool which will launch this week, with complete data going back to 2022. “We want everyone to be able to trust in the election process. And this will provide some ultimate transparency into the ballots cast and how they were read,” Seyler said. The county is working with  CIVERA, a company that looks to use technology to build a better democracy.  “Ada County, Idaho, is the first to launch the surveyors ballot verifier,” Adam Friedman, CEO said. “This ushers in a new era of American democracy. Frankly, where the technology is there, the technology makes all of this possible. There&#8217;s really no more excuse for jurisdictions around the country to provide that window into these live operations and into, you know, into the deepest levels of our election process so that everyone feels like together, you know, we&#8217;re all seeing honest results. And we know that people who are being elected really belong there and are there to serve us.”</span></p>

He joined the city commissioners’ office as a temporary assistant in 1987, was mentored by former commissioner Marge Tartaglione in the 1980s and ‘90s, and became such an expert on election law and campaign finance that Deeley drafted him as her chief deputy when she assumed office in 2015.

He started as a ward leader in Northeast Philadelphia and soon became a regular at the city’s voter registration office. He told The Inquirer in 1996: “You can register as many people to vote as you want. But if they don’t come out to vote, it’s worthless.”</span></p>

Money is a motivator, too. Published in the current issue of the Public Administration Quarterly, the study was conducted by UM faculty member Christina Barsky. “Election officials are raising the alarm: The problem of poll worker recruitment is more than a localized problem — it is a timely concern for democracy,” said the study. In an interview with the Daily Montanan, Barsky said she started working with the Missoula County Elections Office in 2015 and became interested in the public servants who give their time to make democracy work — for low or no pay. “I think one of the really incredible things about our democratic process in Montana and in the United States is the process is run by our friends and neighbors,” Barsky said. The study, based on data from more than 1,000 poll workers in four Arizona counties, found public service, or “duty as a citizen” and being “the kind of person who contributes my share,” as a top motivator. Some 91% rated “duty as a citizen” as an important factor in serving as a poll worker — 62% as very important and 29% as somewhat important. Some 93% rated being “the kind of person who contributes my share” as important — 59% as very important and 34% as somewhat important. But social engagement is also a motivator, according to survey results. The survey found 68% rated “I found it exciting” as an important factor, and 72% rated “I like to meet new people” as an important factor. Barksy said the results show the elections space provides a necessary connection to community, especially for seniors. “If you’re not going to work day in and day out, or if you’re not going to a religious service, it’s providing that social connection that I think particularly individuals that are retired look for,” Barsky said. Poll workers also want to earn extra money, according to the results. Some 51% rated compensation as an important factor — 22% as very important and 29% as somewhat important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”We are facing a multitude of election cyberthreats. Several actors are emboldened and interested in interfering in the democratic process. Cyber espionage, information operations, and hacktivism will all be in play to some degree,” said John Hultquist, Mandiant Chief Analyst, Google Cloud</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actors who have previously targeted elections, like those tied to Russian military intelligence and Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps remain the boldest and most aggressive actors that Mandiant tracks. While they are constantly adapting their techniques, many of their operations follow a familiar formula: attacks with limited practical effects are exaggerated for maximum psychological impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will have to strike a balance between preparing for these threats while also being careful not to exaggerate their impacts,” Hulquist said. “This isn&#8217;t 2016. Though there are more actors in play, many are struggling to build and maintain influence in an environment where their operations are regularly identified and removed.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points from the report include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election cybersecurity landscape globally is characterized by a diversity of targets, tactics, and threats. Elections attract threat activity from a variety of threat actors including: state-sponsored actors, cyber criminals, hacktivists, insiders, and information operations as-a-service entities. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored actors pose the most serious cybersecurity risk to elections;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operations targeting election-related infrastructure can combine cyber intrusion activity, disruptive and destructive capabilities, and information operations, which include elements of public-facing advertisement and amplification of threat activity claims. Successful targeting does not automatically translate to high impact. Many threat actors have struggled to influence or achieve significant effects, despite their best efforts;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attack surface of an election involves a wide variety of entities beyond voting machines and voter registries. In fact, our observations of past cycles indicate that cyber operations target the major players involved in campaigning, political parties, news and social media more frequently than actual election infrastructure;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing elections requires a comprehensive understanding of many types of threats and tactics, from distributed denial of service (DDoS) to data theft to deepfakes, that are likely to impact elections in 2024. It is vital to understand the variety of relevant threat vectors and how they relate, and to ensure mitigation strategies are in place to address the full scope of potential activity;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election organizations should consider steps to harden infrastructure against common attacks, and utilize account security tools to protect high-risk accounts;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that wary and experienced defenders and populations are harder targets and without the element of surprise, adversaries are at a disadvantage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cybersecurity community must keep pace as more than two billion voters worldwide are expected to head to the polls in 2024. With elections in more than an estimated 50 countries, there is an opportunity to dynamically track how threats to democracy evolve. Understanding how threats are targeting one country will enable us to better anticipate and prepare for upcoming elections globally. At the same time, we must also appreciate the unique context of different countries. Election threats to South Africa, India, and the United States will inevitably differ in some regard. In either case, there is an opportunity for us to prepare with the advantage of intelligence.</span></p>

The committee’s chairman, Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, said the legislation, despite the defeat, will get “carried over” and placed on the Senate agenda to “give members time to look at it.” Barfoot voted in favor of moving the bill to the full Senate for consideration. Under</span><a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/files/pdfdocs/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/HB100-int.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increased penalties would apply against someone who commits a crime against an election official if that crime is motivated by the officials’ role in working at the polls during an election day. If a felony is committed against the election official, which is motivated by an individual’s role as an election official, then they would be disqualified from voting. The felony would be considered a crime of “moral turpitude.” In Alabama, those crimes include some of the most serious offenses of murder, rape, kidnapping, sexual abuse and torture, human trafficking, terrorism, child sex abuse, etc. It was voted out of the Alabama House with a 95-0 vote on April 16.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6131" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MS-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MS-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MS-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Mississippi</strong>: Thirty-two Mississippians convicted of felonies </span><a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/41590/voting-rights-restoration-for-32-mississippians-advances-after-broader-suffrage-bill-fails"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could get their voting rights back after lawmakers advanced suffrage bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> April 22, weeks after a Senate leader killed a broader bill that would have restored suffrage to many more people with criminal records. The move is necessary due to Mississippi’s piecemeal approach to restoring voting rights to people convicted of felony offenses who have paid their debts to society. To have voting rights restored, people convicted of any of the crimes must get a pardon from the governor or persuade lawmakers to pass individual bills just for them, with two-thirds approval of the House and Senate. Lawmakers in recent years have passed few of those bills, and they passed none in 2023. “I certainly don’t think this is the best way to do it,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Horan of Grenada, who chairs the House Judiciary B Committee. “There comes a point in time where individuals who have paid their debt to society, they’re paying taxes, they’re doing the things they need to do, there’s no reason those individuals shouldn’t have the right to vote.” Despite lawmakers’ dismay with the current process, some are trying to restore suffrage for select individuals. On Monday, lawmakers on House and Senate Judiciary committees passed a combined 32 bills. The bills were introduced after a House hearing on April 17 highlighted the difficulties some former felons face in regaining the right to vote. In March, the Republican-controlled Mississippi House passed a bill that would have allowed automatic restoration of voting rights for anyone convicted of theft, obtaining money or goods under false pretense, forgery, bigamy or “any crime interpreted as disenfranchising in later Attorney General opinions.” But the bill died after Senate Constitution Committee Chairwoman Angela Hill, a Republican from Picayune, refused to bring it up. Horan said the Republican House majority would only bring up individual suffrage bills for those who committed nonviolent offenses and had been discharged from custody for at least five years. Democratic Rep. Zakiya Summers of Jackson said she appreciated the House and Senate committees for passing the individual bills, but decried the death of the larger House bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3833" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Minnesota:</strong> The Senate approved </span><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/04/18/minnesota-voting-rights-act-nears-governors-signature-after-state-senate-approval"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an elections policy bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 18 that would guarantee voters the right to sue if they face vote suppression or vote dilution. On a 35-32 vote, the DFL-led chamber approved the provision as part of a broader bill with one Republican, Sen. Carla Nelson of Rochester, siding with them One item in the bill, which backers are calling the “Minnesota Voting Rights Act,” would guarantee in state law protections previously afforded under the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act. The 8th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals last year ruled against a provision of the law that allowed voters to challenge voting policies or maps that were racially discriminatory. The court said that since voters weren’t directly named in the law, the right to challenge doesn’t apply. Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, said Minnesota should cement the policy in state law and let voters sue over voter suppression and vote dilution, which is a racially driven form of preventing minority communities from electing candidates due to political boundaries being drawn in a fashion that prevents it. The broader elections bill would also use a person’s address prior to incarceration for setting voting maps, rather than counting their residence in the region where they are incarcerated. It would also sharpen the teeth of a state law that makes it a crime  to make and share distorted images and videos intended to influence an election — often called deep fakes. The bill returns to the House to have changes confirmed before moving to the desk of DFL Gov. Tim Walz.</span></p>

Rep. Bernie Willis, R-Springfield, said the measure aims to revise outdated standards and ensure Ohio has a plan should it fall victim to cyberattacks before an election. The bill&#8217;s prospects are uncertain. Secretary of State Frank LaRose said it includes some good ideas, but other parts are entirely unworkable or need significant revision. A spokesman for House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, said he&#8217;s reviewing the bill, which will be assigned to a committee in the near future. Under House Bill 472: Ohioans would be required to provide a BMV-issued driver&#8217;s license or state ID to register to vote and vote by mail, unless they have a religious objection to being photographed. Voters can currently use their Social Security number; Counties would have to hand-count ballots if voters approve the procedure in a general election. To put the question on the ballot, a group must submit a petition signed by 2% of voters in the county; Voters who are flagged as non-citizens have 30 days to confirm their citizenship to election officials, or their registration would be canceled; Absentee ballots that aren&#8217;t properly sealed in envelopes wouldn&#8217;t be counted unless the voter appears at the board of elections to seal it; and The state auditor would annually audit the statewide voter registration database and three county registration systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers have put out at least four different proposals to </span><a href="https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2024-04-19/some-lawmakers-again-pushing-to-close-ohios-primary-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">close Ohio’s partisan primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the start of the legislative session last year. The most recent to be introduced and heard, House Bill</span><a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb437"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 437</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would also prohibit candidates from running with a political party if that candidate had not voted in the party&#8217;s latest primary. HB 437 requires voters and candidates who are switching parties alike to declare their affiliation at least 90 days before an election. “Our belief is this will help deter those who intend to manipulate the results of our primaries,” Rep. Beth Lear (R-Galena) said in her committee testimony. “Each party should have the right to determine their own candidates for general election without meddling from the outside.” Right now, Ohio conducts partially open primaries—meaning voters in partisan elections don’t have to decide which side&#8217;s ballot they will cast until they submit their mail-in ballot application or arrive at the polls.</span></p>

House Bill 3156 </span><a href="https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-ranked-choice-voting-chaplains-in-schools-senate-bill/60595999"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bans the state from offering ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where voters can rank a list of candidates instead of choosing just one. The process would do away with runoffs, and some said it would allow for voters to not have to choose a candidate because they are the lesser of two evils. Republicans argued that the state shouldn&#8217;t change a system that already works fine and are concerned voters may think they have to list candidates on a preference list, even if they disagree with their positions. The bill passed off the Senate floor 37-8 along party lines. The bill is on its way to the governor, signifying a good chance Oklahoma won&#8217;t have ranked-choice voting anytime soon. </span></p>

SCOTUS rejected an appeal brought by </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/04/22/kari-lake-mark-finchem-machine-voting-lawsuit-scotus-rejects-appeal/73347376007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Republicans Kari Lake and Mark Finchem, bringing finality to the duo&#8217;s legal effort challenging the use of electronic voting machines two years to the day after it began.  Lake, a candidate for U.S. Senate, and Finchem, a candidate for state Senate, asked the nation&#8217;s top court to hear their case in mid-March. The court declined to consider it, making that official with an order on Monday that does not include details of the court&#8217;s decision.  Legal experts had predicted the court would not exercise its discretion to add the case to its docket, citing well-established legal precedent and the court&#8217;s low acceptance rate. The court also rejected a challenge to voting rules in </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/22/supreme-court-vote-by-mail-rules/73312049007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that automatically let senior citizens − but not younger people − vote by mail. Mail-in balloting has become a partisan debate as Democrats champion it as a way to increase turnout and Republicans argue it increases the risk of voter fraud. The court declined to hear an appeal brought by three voters in Texas, just as it rejected a similar challenge in 2021 to Indiana’s voting rules. It also twice declined to hear earlier versions of the Texas suit brought by the Texas Democratic Party during the COVID-19 pandemic. The challengers argued that the unequal treatment of voters is age-based discrimination prohibited by the 26</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amendment.</span></p>

Two groups — Maryland Election Integrity LLC and Missouri-based United Sovereign Americans — filed suit in March against the state board for maintaining inaccurate voter registration lists and violating federal election law. Earlier this month, the groups asked Gallagher to issue an injunction against the state that could derail the May 14 primary and possibly the general election in Maryland. On April 22, an attorney representing the board responded, asking Gallagher to dismiss the lawsuit or, at a minimum, deny the request for the restraining order. “The companies’ complaint, however, fails to vest this Court with jurisdiction to entertain their accusations; and fails to factually allege a claim upon which relief could be granted. The companies allege no ‘injury in fact’ explaining how their allegations of election maladministration injured any individual member,” wrote Daniel M. Kobrin, an assistant attorney general representing the Maryland State Board of Elections. Kobrin, in his motion, writes that the two groups failed to establish standing and that their lawsuit “lacks a cognizable factual claim.” Maryland Election Integrity LLC and Missouri-based United Sovereign Americans filed suit in March alleging problems with the state’s elections.</span></p>

Holkeboer was facing election fraud charges stemming from his alleged actions during last August&#8217;s primary election. Holkeboer was previously bound over for trial in 2023. Attorneys representing Holkeboer appealed the decision in May of 2023, claiming the trial court erred by interpreting MCL 168.932 &#8220;to proscribe copying election records where the statute does not use the term &#8216;copy&#8217; or any of its synonyms,&#8221; Holkeboer&#8217;s attorneys wrote. Nearly a year later, the Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with that argument and dismissed the case. &#8220;The trial court erred when it denied Holkeboer’s motion to quash the bindover. The act of copying a list of voters without affecting the integrity of the document or election is not, at least at present, prohibited by MCL 168.932(c). We vacate the trial court’s order denying Holkeboer’s motion to quash and remand for an entry of an order dismissing this case,&#8221; the appeals court opinion&#8217;s conclusion reads. Kent County Prosecuting Attorney Chris Becker shared a statement after the decision to throw out the case: “I have read the opinion and I would anticipate an appeal on this issue after reviewing the reasoning. It seems a bit troubling, heading into a major presidential election, that an election worker can take information from an election computer and not be in violation of the law. I think this is an important issue that needs further review.”</span></p>

The plaintiffs argued that the ATM-style touchscreen machine that can both mark and tabulate ballots does not allow voters to verify that their selections are correctly counted because the machine tallies the selections by producing an automated barcode. The complaint also argued that the barcode system “can (and predictably will) provide fodder for those who peddle in election voter-fraud fearmongering and conspiracy theories about ‘rigged elections’ to reduce public confidence that votes are accurately cast and counted.” The court dismissed the case after finding that those who brought the lawsuit could not show that they would be harmed by the approval of the machines.</span></p>

Biggs has ruled that North Carolina district attorneys </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/04/23/federal-judge-rules-das-cant-prosecute-disenfranchised-probationers-for-mistakenly-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot prosecute people on supervision for felony convictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they mistakenly cast a ballot before regaining their right to vote. The reason, according to a ruling issued by Biggs: the underlying law was enacted to discriminate against Black North Carolinians — and continues to do so today. Plus, that law does not give prosecutors clear standards to prevent it from being enforced arbitrarily, giving district attorneys the ability to seek criminal charges based on “their personal predilections.” Biggs’ ruling is separate from the state Supreme Court’s decision because it deals with a different law. People on probation or parole for a felony will still need to complete the terms of their supervision before they can vote in North Carolina. But because of Biggs’ ruling, if those individuals unknowingly or mistakenly cast a ballot before their voting rights are restored, district attorneys cannot prosecute them. Attorneys for the State Board of Elections said the historical background of the law is “indefensible,” which Biggs called “an extraordinary and telling concession.” The state contended that a new constitution adopted in 1971 “cleansed the Challenged Statute of its discriminatory taint.” Biggs rejected that argument. That constitution expanded the scope of felony disenfranchisement to remove the right to vote of people convicted of felonies not just in North Carolina, but in other states as well. Even if the 1971 constitution did “cleanse” the underlying law, Biggs wrote, Black voters are still disproportionately impacted by the law. “Far from completely curing the law, by expanding the scope to include people convicted of felonies in other states, the constitutional amendment has presumably disenfranchised more Black people,” wrote Biggs.</span></p>

Verwey said the Republican Committee of Chester County’s request for an injunction against the county election board would amount to “preemptively disenfranchising voters.” The lawsuit, filed April 17, contended that in 2023 the county had incorrectly interpreted the state’s mail ballot law with regards to ballots collected from a long-term care facility. The law limits ballot returns on behalf of disabled voters to one per person unless all the voters are in the same household. The law, the GOP committee argued, clearly explains that long-term care facilities should not be considered a single household, meaning residents cannot use the same staff member or volunteer to return their ballots. “The injunction proposed in this matter would disenfranchise and, therefore, harm voters who are unable to submit their ballots on their own and have already provided their mail-in ballot to a designated agent,” Verwey said in his ruling that denied the preliminary injunction while the broader lawsuit progresses.</span></p>

In addition, the court held that the state’s registration form must properly inform potential voters with past felony convictions of their eligibility.  Specifically, the court found that the state’s current practice of denying individuals the right to by rejecting voters’ registration forms when applicants indicate they have a prior felony conviction and requiring those applicants provide documentary proof of their eligibility to vote violates the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). The court also found that Tennessee’s current voter registration form does not comply with the NVRA’s requirements for informing voters if their rights have been restored. The lawsuit alleges that Tennessee has a particularly strenuous process for restoring voting rights to those with prior felony convictions. The plaintiffs also argue that the implementation of Tennessee’s rights restoration process creates “an unequal, scattershot system across Tennessee’s ninety-five counties, causing disparate results for similarly situated individuals,” and at least one county, Rutherford County, charges a fee for the process. The plaintiffs argue that this fee constitutes a poll tax and violates the 24th Amendment. The Campaign Legal Center called this decision “a big step in the right direction” with the rest of the lawsuit’s claims set to go to trial in the coming months. </span></p>

														<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/high-cost-public-service"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The High Cost of Public Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Threats are part of the disturbing new reality of American politics. While abuse directed at federal officeholders grabs the headlines, a</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/intimidation-state-and-local-officeholders"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new Brennan Center report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals that intimidation aimed at state and local officials is distressingly common: 43 percent of state legislators, for example, have experienced threats within the past three years.  In addition to menacing public servants and their families, these threats have serious repercussions for representative democracy. Officeholders report being less willing to work on contentious issues like reproductive rights and gun control and more reluctant to continue serving. Additionally, intimidation is often targeted at groups already underrepresented in government, such as women and people of color. Panelists Gowri Ramachandran, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, Florida State Rep. Anna Eskamani, and former Nevada State Assemblymember Tom Roberts will be joined by moderator Deirdre Walsh of NPR. New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who herself has experienced threats of violence, will also deliver remarks. <strong>Where:</strong> April 30, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
