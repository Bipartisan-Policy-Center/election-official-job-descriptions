							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What’s next?</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the media cover elections moving forward?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only was the 2024 election the </span><a href="https://statescoop.com/cybersecurity-secure-election-day-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most secure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election to-date, it was, without a doubt, the most watched and reported on election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media outlets, from large to small and from around the world covered this year’s election. On electionline’s Daily News feed from right after Labor Day till just before Thanksgiving, we were posting about 100 stories per-day with some days closing in on 200 stories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reached out to several reporters and editors to find out how, if at all, their coverage of election administration may change in the next two to four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, we did reach out to two niche publications–ones that have done a fair amount of reporting on voting and voting rights the last few years and both of them declined to respond because their publications were still assessing how, if at all, elections would be covered. </span></p>

Cassidy, <a href="https://apnews.com/">The Associated Press</a></strong><br />
<em>How do you anticipate, if at all, your reporting on elections may change in the next 2-4 years?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think my reporting will change. I plan to stay focused on covering voting and elections from the ground up, working to understand how elections are run in the U.S., the challenges facing state and local election officials and the work being done to address public confidence in elections. I will continue to look closely at election security issues, understanding what gaps may exist and what work may be done to address them. And I’ll continue to examine the spread of election-related conspiracy theories. <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Associated-Press.pdf">Read more here.</a></span></p>

</span></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you anticipate, if at all, your reporting on elections may change in the next 2-4 years?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think my process will change all that much. It’s funny, in recent weeks, a lot of people have asked me some version of “voting is over, what are you going to cover now?” and I’ve had to explain that elections really is a full-time beat nowadays. That said, I do wonder whether next year will be less frantic than 2021 in terms of legislation and the pressurized environment since early indications are that the public is</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5217819/republican-election-confidence-trump-pew-poll"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pretty happy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with how the voting system worked this time around. But voting is still a major story. The country obviously just elected someone who has said for years the current elections system is fraudulent, so a lot of my time will probably be spent following the ways he does or doesn’t use the office of the presidency to “fix” that problem. <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NPR.pdf">Read more here.</a></span></p>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think will be the biggest stories&#8211;election administration-wise of course&#8211;in the next 2-4 years?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next two election cycles will determine if the crisis in election trust has abated or is merely on hiatus because of this year’s decisive November election. There will still be an emphasis on reinforcing voters’ trust in elections with transparent and well-run elections in the 2026 midterms. It will be important to see whether that’s enough to  reassure voters even if the losing candidates question the results. One big question is what effect the Trump administration and Republican Congress will have on local election administration. It’s unclear if</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2024/11/25/donald-trump-republican-congress-election-legislation-save-act-brad-raffensperger-cleta-mitchell/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Republicans can pass major new federal election laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Trump’s agenda, like the SAVE Act, or dismantle past protestions, but they will likely try. The</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2024/12/09/pam-bondi-donald-trump-department-of-justice-voting-rights-america-first-policy-institute/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump loyalists likely to lead the U.S. Department of Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will treat voting rights cases in line with his agenda and probably act responsively to Trump’s baseless accusations of fraud. <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Votebeat.pdf">Read more here.</a></span></p>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ve focused largely (but not exclusively of course) on voting rights-type issues. How, if at all, will Bolts coverage of election administration change in the next 2-4 years?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Bolts, we’ve taken a large view of covering voting rights and democracy. Our stories cover visible policy areas (say the laws around mail voting, anxieties over certification, the rules of felony disenfranchisement) but we also ask how these matters affect other issue areas (for instance, how a redistricting lawsuit in Georgia may affect energy policies) to make them feel more concrete and take the time to explore the ramifications of seemingly-arcane policies on people’s lives. We’re also interested in people’s lived experience of what democracy is. I’ll flag one of</span><a href="https://boltsmag.org/automatic-voter-registration-native-tribe-members/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our bigger features of 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was about how an expansion of automatic voter registration in Colorado will affect Native communities, and also how this connects to a legacy of violence on these Native land as an example that does a lot of this. We expect to continue pursuing these goals over the next few years! And while a lot will change with the new federal administration, we’ll still be primarily interested in how those changes affect state and local landscapes—much like we’ve been in recent years. (I’ll add that our main north star is to start with the local and state, rather than the federal: not because the latter doesn’t matter, but because the former is what is harder for people with an interest in election administration to navigate and follow.) <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bolts-Magazine.pdf">Read more here.</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center is pleased to announce the 2025 recipients of the annual Peoples Choice Award in advance of its upcoming February workshop in Little Rock, Arkansas, where recipients will be honored and can present their efforts or projects selected by their peers. </span></p>

Submissions are reviewed by the Program Development and Awards Committee and Election Center’s Board of Directors in eight different award categories presented at the annual conference ceremony. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This decades-old program was expanded in 2024 to include the People&#8217;s Choice Award to allow members of the National Association for Election Officials to have a direct say in which of their peers receive recognition for their outstanding efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Election Center, our members are our mission. The sharing of ideas and networking relationships are the heart of election associations,” said Tammy Patrick, Election Center’s Chief Program Officer. “Having a process to recognize and celebrate member successes continues to be an important activity in the profession and a means of elevating our expertise.” </span></p>

The investigator recommended increased review measures to minimize future risk. Beth Doherty Quinn of Baird Quinn, LLC, led the investigation, which was commissioned by the secretary of state’s office. Quinn interviewed department staff, reviewed various department policies and documents, and worked with digital forensics experts. Quinn’s report said all employees interviewed during the investigation showed “a sincere desire to maintain the confidentiality of the BIOS passwords.” She said the “devastating” impact the breach has had on the voting systems team and “on the health and well-being of particular individuals” on the team “was palpable during interviews.” She also said the unique set of circumstances that led to the breach “would have been difficult to anticipate.” Two current employees with the voting systems team Quinn interviewed “sincerely described their belief in the importance of their work — facilitating secure and fair elections — and the importance of doing their job well,” the report says. The report found that employees were unaware of the hidden tabs after the employee who created them left the department.</span></p>

Alaska will keep ranked choice voting and open primaries. According to Alaska Public Media, the repeal effort failed by 743 votes, or about a quarter of one percentage point, according to the Division of Elections. That’s almost exactly the margin reflected in official results certified late last month, which showed the measure failing by 737 out of more than 300,000 votes. The Alaska Republican Party requested the recount and monitored vote-counting alongside the anti-repeal campaign, No On 2. During the recount, election officials re-scanned ballots and</span><a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/12/09/can-you-guess-how-these-10-ambiguous-ballot-measure-2-votes-were-counted/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took a closer look</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at ballots where the voter’s choice wasn’t clear. They also hand-counted at least 5% of ballots from each state House district to ensure the machine totals were correct. The state paid for both of the recounts. State law requires the state to pick up the tab in close races where the margin is less than either half a percent or 20 votes.</span></p>

On future election days, the new building will serve as a staging area for all of the county’s polling sites. “In advance of every election, there’s about a nine-month cycle, a process that we begin about nine months out from any primary,” Madison County Probate Judge Frank Barger said. “So we are already thinking about plans for the 2026 primary that will be the next major election manage out of this facility.” The purchase of the building and its renovation totaled about $5 million. According to Barger, the cost is about $2 million lower than the projected price of building a new facility.</span></p>

David Whitaker (D-Fayetteville) proposes amendments to the state’s current absentee voting laws to allow seniors to vote by absentee ballot without additional requirements. Currently, absentee voting in Arkansas is limited to individuals who are unavoidably absent from their voting place, unable to attend the polls due to illness or physical disability or observing a religious holiday during voting hours. HB1064 adds a fourth category, permitting anyone aged 65 or older to vote absentee on election day. The bill also streamlines the absentee voting process for seniors. For voters over 65, their absentee ballot applications would remain valid for one calendar year unless withdrawn. County clerks would then be required to mail absentee ballots for all elections during that year at least 25 days before the election.</span></p>

The Legislative Audit Committee voted 4-4 on an audit request into the state Elections Division. All four Democrats voted against the request and all four Republicans voted in favor of it. A tie means defeat. The request, which was submitted by committee chair Rep. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican, would have examined the procedures and policies that allowed an election system password leak. “I think it’s very important that … a performance audit be conducted if nothing else to re-instill faith in our election system,” Frizell said. “Unfortunately and due to a wide variety of reasons, I suspect, we’ve seen over the last few years some fairly systemic and problematic issues in the secretary of state’s office when it comes to communication with county clerk and recorders.”</span></p>

Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) announced plans to introduce a c</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/12/11/posthumus-to-propose-constitutional-amendment-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-from-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onstitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the upcoming legislative session aimed at blocking noncitizens from casting a ballot in the state. According to Posthumus’ office, the plan is a response to reports of a 19-year-old University of Michigan student from China casting a ballot in Ann Arbor. Under the state’s ballot secrecy protections a ballot usually cannot be retrieved or canceled after it is fed into a tabulator. If pursued in the Legislature, the two thirds of the members in each chamber must vote to place the matter before voters in the next general election. If pursued through the petition process, petitioners must gather 446,198 signatures to place the matter on the ballot. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson sent the Advance the following statement: “All eligible citizens and only eligible citizens have the constitutional right to vote in Michigan. I’m always open to serious and well thought out efforts to further strengthen our secure system. But many of these proposals will prevent large numbers of eligible citizens from exercising their constitutional voting rights in the name of making it even more difficult and rare than it already is for a noncitizen to vote. We know because other states have already tried this – a similar 2004 ballot initiative in Arizona disenfranchised 47,000 eligible U.S. citizens. A federal court struck down Kansas’s law because it violated both the U.S. Constitution and the National Voter Registration Act. Michigan’s voters have overwhelmingly passed constitutional amendments in recent years to ensure that eligible citizens aren’t denied their right to vote. We should respect their will and focus our efforts on policies that actually improve security, such as a guaranteed source of state funding to ensure clerks have the resources they need for every election.”</span></p>

A plan to allow candidates filing a joint petition to associate with each other on the ballot will remain, just without the physical brackets around their names, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak. Brackets and incumbency designations could have faced legal obstacles: U.S. District Court Judge Zahid Quraishi, who is hearing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of county lines, has indicated that ballots should have no discernable markings that give any candidate an advantage. The draft bill calls for office block ballots that end the practice of giving party-endorsed candidates preferential ballot placement and an option for county clerks to rotate names on ballots by municipal election districts. The bill standardizes the font sizes of names on the ballot and allows county clerks to design a horizontal or vertical ballot based on their own preference.</span></p>

It now returns to the House for concurrence on Senate changes. The bill began as a noncontroversial effort to change Ohio’s information technology policies. But in committee Tuesday, the bill was heavily altered. The bill now would rename the Ohio Board of Voting Machine Examiners to the Board of Voting Systems Examiners and add cyber security experts to the board; allow Ohioans to register to vote or update their registration electronically while at state Bureau of Motor Vehicles offices; and require county boards of elections to conduct post-election audits after every election, instead just general elections and primary elections held in even-numbered years. It also would allow the Ohio attorney general to review the title of any statewide initiative or referendum petition, in addition to its summary, as a fair and truthful statement of the proposal before the petitioners may begin collecting signatures, and provide the Ohio secretary of state broad powers to set security and integrity of ballots and voter registration systems used by county boards of elections.</span></p>

His joint resolution concerns statewide offices and state representatives and senators. Recalls already exist at the local level in Oklahoma in certain cases, according to Sen. Coleman. He argued, “The people need to be involved, and the people will have the final say if this process goes through.” His proposal would just allow lawmakers to vote on whether a recall should take place amid public concern. Then, the issue would go to voters. State Rep. Mickey Dollens (D-Oklahoma City) supports the overall idea but asserted that voters should be able to get the process started too.</span></p>

If the complainants aren’t satisfied, the bill would let them take their requests to the Texas Secretary of State’s Office, which would have to decide whether to investigate further and conduct an audit. State Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who authored the bill, said it will help clear up “any misunderstanding” about elections. But experts and local election officials said Texas already has policies in place that have increased election transparency and security. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/SB00505I.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they said, could instead undermine voters’ trust if election officials have to prioritize an influx of meritless complaints. The measure would also add to the burdens on election officials who are already contending with a flood of public records requests, questions from residents worried about election integrity, and voter challenges, while also trying to comply with strict election deadlines set by state and federal laws, experts said. Bettencourt first filed a similar bill in 2021 and reintroduced it in 2023. Both times, it passed in the Senate but not the House. Senate Bill 505, which he filed last month, is identical to his 2023 legislation. The bill would allow candidates, county party chairs, election or alternate judges — election judges are tasked with supervising polling locations — and leaders of political action committees to request that election officials “provide an explanation to election irregularities or violations of the law and to provide supporting documentation” of such.</span></p>

Jeff Wilson, R-Longview has filed legislation that would </span><a href="https://www.gazette-tribune.com/election/washington-legislation-would-put-security-cameras-near-ballot-drop-boxes/87821/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a new security camera grant program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wilson filed two bills: Senate Bill 5010 to create the grant program and Senate Bill 5011 to update what’s written on ballot boxes. While seemingly minor, the proposal follows ballot tampering leading up to the Nov. 5 general election that destroyed hundreds of ballots. If approved, SB 5010 would direct the state to “create and administer” a grant program allowing county auditors and election officials to purchase and install cameras around ballot boxes. The bill is less than half a page long and straight to the point but fails to mention a financial impact. Creating a new grant program would require new revenue, whether through taxes or services; otherwise, the state would need to identify existing means to fund the cameras. Using existing revenue could mean pulling funding away from another priority, which may also raise issues. Wilson said the fiscal note would come later when the sponsors work with the secretary of state to develop the program, but that it would use existing revenue. He said it shouldn’t come with any “sticker shock” and expects a relatively low price for the benefit of enhanced election security.</span></p>

The trio claim that the Democrat has failed to purge over a million ineligible and unaccounted for voters from Arizona’s voter registration rolls, diluting their votes as eligible voters and costing the Arizona Republican Party time and resources on voter education and mobilization campaigns. Lanza dismissed the lawsuit, siding with Fontes’ argument that the Republicans don’t have sufficient standing to sue his office. Standing is established when a plaintiff suffers a concrete, specific injury, Lanza wrote, that presents an imminent threat and can be resolved by the court. Filing a lawsuit based on the claim that the government broke the law doesn’t constitute standing, and neither does challenging an action that the plaintiff disagrees with, he wrote. A recognizable right needs to have been violated for the court to weigh in on the matter. “…(A) citizen does not have standing to challenge a government regulation simply because the plaintiff believes that the government is acting illegally,”</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25446842-mussi-v-fontes-dismissal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lanza wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year in an abortion case. “A citizen may not sue based on an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law. Nor may citizens sue merely because their legal objection is accompanied by a strong moral, ideological, or policy objection to a government action.” In his 19-page ruling, Lanza picked apart the theories presented by the three Republicans as proof that they have standing to sue Fontes, finding them all to be insufficient. In their lawsuit, Mussi, Swoboda and Gaynor alleged that their votes were being unfairly diluted by the vast number of votes potentially cast by ineligible voters.</span></p>

State officials said they plan to continue to fight over the measure — passed by voters in March in the coastal city of 200,000 people — in the court of appeal. An Orange County Superior Court judge last month found it was too soon for the state to bring litigation over the local law, which allows the city to implement voter identification requirements in 2026. “With preparations for the 2026 elections beginning late next year, we want and need a state appellate court to weigh in expeditiously,” Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. Michael Gates, Huntington Beach’s city attorney, said he supports the court’s ruling and noted that the voting public supported the local measure. “Voter ID in Huntington Beach is the law of our land here, it’s our Constitutional right, and it&#8217;s here to stay – I will make sure of that,” Gates wrote in an email. The Huntington Beach measure also lets the city increase in-person voting sites and monitor ballot drop boxes in local elections.</span></p>

Boyer made his first court appearance, and his arraignment was continued to January 17, 2025. He is accused of submitting four fraudulent voter registration forms to the County Registrar in the months leading up to the November 2024 election. Each form was handwritten, attempted to register fictitious characters to vote, included Boyer&#8217;s home address, and was signed under penalty of perjury. The case was investigated by the Ventura County District Attorney&#8217;s Office Bureau of Investigation after the Ventura County Clerk-Recorder and Registrar of Voters Office flagged the voter registration forms as suspicious. Boyer was released on his own recognizance.</span></p>

In her lawsuit, Lucero claimed that Janice Powell should not have been on the ballot because she had a conflict of interest as she was a member of the council and director of the Shasta Lake Chamber of Commerce. The lawsuit also said former Shasta Lake City Clerk Toni Coates violated a state law that prohibited her from serving on the council within a year of leaving her job with the city. &#8220;It was not a fair election because two people did not qualify,&#8221; Lucero said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shasta County Superior Court Judge Benjamin Hanna </span><a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2024/12/11/dolores-luceros-effort-to-overturn-shasta-lake-election-shut-down/76895022007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled against Lucero&#8217;s request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order preventing county Registrar of Voters Tom Toller from certifying the election.</span></p>

Lawyers in Moody&#8217;s office filed a brief December 4 arguing the Supreme Court should decline to take up an appeal by Terry Hubbard, who was one of 20 convicted felons accused of registering and voting when ineligible. Hubbard went to the Supreme Court in October after the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled that charges against him should move forward. The dispute centers on whether the statewide prosecutor&#8217;s office had authority to file charges against Hubbard. A Broward County circuit judge dismissed the case because he said the alleged wrongdoing occurred in one judicial circuit and that the statewide prosecutor only had jurisdiction in cases involving multiple circuits. In the brief, Moody&#8217;s office argued, in part, that the statewide prosecutor had jurisdiction because the alleged voting crimes involved two judicial circuits. That is because Hubbard filled out voter-registration applications in Broward County and the information was transmitted to the Florida Department of State in Leon County. Broward County is in the 17th Judicial Circuit, while Leon County is in the 2nd Judicial Circuit. &#8220;His conduct formed part of a broader transaction that crossed circuit lines: By registering to vote, he triggered governmental action in the Seventeenth and Second Judicial Circuits,&#8221; the brief said. &#8220;By law, the Broward County Supervisor of Elections was required to transmit information from his voter-registration form to the secretary of state in Leon County, which then reviewed that information in Leon. Only then could Hubbard successfully vote in Broward. The Fourth District (Court of Appeal) therefore correctly found that Hubbard&#8217;s actions &#8216;occur[red] in both Broward and Leon County,&#8217; implicating two judicial circuits. No more is required.&#8221; But a panel of the 4th District Court of Appeal in July overturned that ruling, and the full appeals court later declined a request for a rehearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County Supervisor of Elections Glen Gilzean filed a lawsuit on December 5 asking a judge to order Orange County to </span><a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/orange-county-elections-sues-government-lawsuit-frozen-funds/63114535"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release funding for his office immediately</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. County commissioners voted on last week to freeze the disbursements until Gilzean provided financial records about his office’s spending. &#8220;They have illegally withheld the funds to this office and they have been lying to the public all along,&#8221; Gilzean said after that county meeting and vote on Tuesday. The supervisor followed through with his promise to sue the county. The lawsuit claims the county &#8220;does not have the discretion to withhold funds once budget has been approved,&#8221; and the move would &#8220;result in delayed payment to hard working government employees and contractors &#8212; in the middle of the holiday season.&#8221; Comptroller Phil Diamond, who&#8217;s doing an audit of the supervisor&#8217;s office, sent Gilzean a letter Thursday asking whether he has enough cash to pay his workers. The letter claims that records show more than $4 million in the bank, while payroll is about $250,000 every two weeks. Gilzean&#8217;s lawsuit is asking a judge to issue an emergency order to make the county send the funding right away.</span></p>

In a decision last month, Judge Maureen Ward Kirby dismissed an injunction that would have required Cook County Clerk Cedric Giles to implement ranked choice voting in Evanston, despite the voting system not being one of the systems approved by the Illinois Board of Elections. Kirby ruled that under ISBE rules and the Illinois Constitution, Giles cannot legally use voting machines that are not approved, regardless of Evanston’s home rule status.  This week, RFI said it is appealing the decision to give local municipalities the right to implement the voting system should they so choose. “We’re appealing because we disagree with this ruling, which has far-reaching implications beyond Evanston and ranked-choice voting,” Reform for Illinois Executive Director Alisa Kaplan said. “Illinois residents have a right to determine how they will be governed.”</span></p>

The county hired 23 of 61 election workers recommended by the party. But in a lawsuit, the Republican Party argued that state law required Fulton to hire all of the workers. Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer rejected that argument before the election. He ruled that state law does not give political parties priority when counties hire election workers. The lawsuit was still pending. But on December 4, Judge Robert McBurney dismissed it “for want of prosecution” after attorneys for the Republican Party failed to appear at a status conference on the case earlier in the week.</span></p>

Oster dismissed charges against Patricia Guciardo and Emily McClintock, who were both poll workers in St. Clair Shores. Both faced multiple years in prison for allegedly allowing the voters to cast ballots after they’d already voted in the election and for falsifying election records. But, according to Votebeat, Guciardo’s and McClintock’s cases aren’t necessarily done. Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for Attorney General Dana Nessel, said Tuesday that the AG’s office is “exploring its appellate options concerning the dismissals.” “The Department of Attorney General takes very seriously cases of election fraud, and will attempt to hold accountable all individuals criminally responsible for these instances of double voting in St. Clair Shores,” Wimmer wrote in an email. St. Clair Shores Clerk Abby Barrett told Votebeat that she was relieved for the workers who had charges dismissed. “This sets the precedent that people should not be afraid to work the elections,” Barrett told Votebeat. “We will support our people.”</span></p>

The margin remained at 734 after a first recount.  Griffin is protesting more than 60,000 ballots, including ballots cast by people who his campaign says did not include a driver’s license number or partial Social Security number on their voter registration forms; overseas voters who have never lived in North Carolina but whose parents were eligible voters in the state before they moved; and ballots from overseas and military voters who did not include photo ID.

Writing for the panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Toby Heytens found that several Virginia officials do not enjoy 11th Amendment immunity from claims under the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870, which restored federal representation for the Confederate commonwealth after the Civil War. Heytens, a Joe Biden appointee, determined the plaintiffs have a right to sue under the Ex Parte Young doctrine, which permits lawsuits to be brought against state officials even when the state itself is immune to the claims. The Virginia Readmission Act, which prohibits the commonwealth from barring citizens from registering to vote except for certain felony convictions, is a federal law, Heytens wrote, which meant the federal courts had authority to enforce it. The panel determined two defendants, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin and Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee, should be dismissed from the case, however. Heytens wrote the officials had the power to restore voting rights but no role in administering the rules restricting voter eligibility, which meant they were not responsible for the claimed violations. “If King and Johnson are right that their disenfranchisement was unlawful from the start, they have no need to ask the governor or the secretary to restore their voting rights because those rights were never validly taken away in the first place,” Heytens wrote.</span></p>

The case was dismissed Monday by Judge Peter Froelicher with the option of being refiled in circuit court without the felony charge after a request from Laramie County Assistant District Attorney Steven McManamen. Additionally, Hayden-Ali faced two misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and breach of peace for disturbing an election center from which he was already trespassed. On Aug. 6, Hayden-Ali entered the Laramie County Governmental Complex, allegedly disrupting an election site and tearing up election materials. As of June 29, 2023, Hayden-Ali had been trespassed from the courthouse until 2033, meaning he cannot legally be in the courthouse unless he is there for official business, due to several previous incidents of disruptive and threatening behavior. In order to prosecute the felony charges, the prosecutor would have had to show that Hayden-Ali was making an effort to interfere with the election process. McManamen filed a single-count misdemeanor charge for criminal entry in Circuit Court, which is punishable by up to six months in jail and/or $750 in fines. Hayden-Ali’s initial appearance on the new charge is scheduled for Jan. 7.</span></p>
