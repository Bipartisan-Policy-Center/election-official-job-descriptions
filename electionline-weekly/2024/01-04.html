							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Yes, I am excited for 2024 (&amp; I am not alone!)</strong></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick, CEO of Programs<br />
<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">The Election Center</a></p>
<p>To say that 2023 was a challenging year for me would be a gross understatement.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9073" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2024-Election.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The year started with an airline ground stoppage during the Election Center January JEOLC (Joint Election Official Liaison Conference), then we had hail and snow for our February workshop in Pasadena, California. This was followed by torrential rains at the April workshop in Houston, Texas, and a hurricane cut short the annual conference in Orlando, Florida. And as many of you know, I never made it to the October Symposium at Auburn, Alabama due to a horrific car accident on my way from the airport in Montgomery.</p>
<p>What I learned in 2023 is that we are all tested, every day in innumerable ways — something most elections officials are all too familiar with, especially recently.</p>
<p>While I lay there in the car wreckage waiting for paramedics, not knowing the severity of my injuries (but I could wiggle my fingers and toes!) I realized that I was truly lucky to be alive I shouldn’t take anything for granted: I may not make it to that dinner event, or be able to speak on that panel, or control many things in my life but I could try my best, encourage others, be truthful, and look for the positive.</p>
<p>As we begin  what is sure to be one of the most challenging years we’ve faced, not only as elections officials, but as a nation, there are in fact, many things to look forward to. For me, I’m looking forward  to revisiting and reinventing the calendar of events that were plagued in 2023!</p>
<p>Our<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/event.php?id=246"> JEOLC conference</a> will<a href="https://electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/events-calendar/2024/JEOLC-2024-Draft-Agenda.pdf?v=231207"> kick off the year</a> of election administration convenings with engagements from new speakers and organizations, a trip to Capitol Hill to provide attendees time to educate policy makers and staff, and briefings from the “alphabet soup” of election organizations as all the election acronyms and initialisms will be there.</p>
<p>Election Center now has more than 1750 members and they have selected the Professional Practices they would like to see at our<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/event.php?id=247"> February Workshop</a> (Feb. 21-23) in Nashville, Tennessee. The first-ever workshop<a href="https://electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/events-calendar/2024/Nashville-2024-Draft-Agenda.pdf?v=231207"> agenda</a> built around member programs chosen by members, this proves to be a great couple of days. While we’re still working on confirming speakers, expect to hear about programs covering everything from election observers to data visualization to poll worker split shifts, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Our April (24-28) Workshop in Portland, Oregon will focus on state associations and trainings with an extended session on the renewed Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>The September (9-11) Annual Conference will be in Detroit and provide one last opportunity before the General to network with colleagues in preparation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10582" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign-300x239.png" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign-300x239.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign-768x612.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024ElectionSign.png 948w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Later this spring we will be launching a new website, logo, membership dashboard, and committee platform to keep our members engaged and informed. Online classes have expanded seating availability and we are now offering more renewal classes to accommodate the growth of certified election professionals.</p>
<p>I know it can be hard to believe given the drumbeat of negative news, but I’m not alone in my excitement about 2024. Recently I asked our members what they are excited about for 2024, and many of them responded enthusiastically about everything from implementing new technology, to voter outreach and to put it bluntly, simply doing their jobs.</p>
<p>While not everyone looks forward to implementing new technology in an election year, Kim Meltzer, MiPMC/MMC Clerk, Charter<a href="https://www.clintontownship.com/183/Clerk-Elections"> Township of Clinton, Michigan</a> is not one of those people.</p>
<p>“The Clinton Township board has approved a contract with Modus Elections to help us better organize our election workers and create transparency using the audit trail created by the software. The Presidential Primary will be the first election to use this software and we are super excited about it,” Meltzer said.</p>
<p>Voter outreach is on the mind of Gina Roberts with the<a href="https://www.azcleanelections.gov/"> Citizens Clean Elections Commission</a> in Arizona. Roberts is particularly excited about voter outreach for young and future voters.</p>
<p>“We partnered with ASU&#8217;s Cronkite Agency, which is student led, to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-LFUP9g3FFqt8RK3_230nrVz5sKllRI"> develop videos educating youth</a> about the 26th amendment to help encourage them to register to vote. It came together really well,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>As a part of outreach into classrooms and to encourage the next generation of voters, the commission also developed a comic book written by Clean Elections staff. Although it&#8217;s not entirely final here is a<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HO7wgpj4rf8_0kHYKDMYSScrF1I9caUU/view"> sneak peek</a>.</p>
<p>“We will be launching these in 2024 so we are pretty excited on the youth voter outreach front,” Roberts said. “Along with many other good things to come!”</p>
<p>And in Georgia, Charlotte Sosebee, is Team 2024 to be sure.</p>
<p>“In<a href="https://www.accgov.com/160/Elections-Office"> Athens-Clarke County</a>, we are excited about achieving a number of our strategic goals, engaging our community to increase voter turnout and build trust in elections,” said Sosebee, chief registrar and director of elections for Athens-Clarke County. “With the strategy of increasing access to elections with additional emphasis for disparate communities, our Board of Elections and Registration and staff are excited about a number of things.”</p>
<p>Among the number of things are new polling places determined with the help of a GIS study, new, community designed “I Voted” stickers, more language access materials in polling places and Spanish-language ballots for the November election and enhanced training for poll workers that includes CPR and First Aid.</p>
<p>“So, who could be more excited about 2024 than Athens-Clarke County?” Sosebee asked.</p>
<p>2024 promises to be one for the history books—be excited about your role, your responsibilities.  Be kind—to others and yourself.  The challenges may be great, but they are not insurmountable. I believe in you. I appreciate you. I am excited to see how the story plays out.</p>

The F.B.I. said it had no information to suggest any threats were credible. A copy of the threatening email was provided to the Lexington Herald Leader by<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article283779473.html"> Kentucky</a> Secretary of State Michael Adams’ office. It read, in part: “I placed multiple explosives inside of your State Capitol. The explsoives (sic) are well hidden inside and they will go off in a few hours .I will make sure you all end up dead,” they wrote.  <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/01/02/maine-secretary-of-state-receives-more-threats-as-police-investigate-swatting-incident/">Maine</a>’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and her staff have received threatening communications since she disqualified former President Donald Trump from the state’s primary ballot. Bellows has also been the victim of a swatting incident. “The barrage of aggressive, abusive communications that came into my office all day Friday to members of my staff, the targeting of my family and the targeting of other people online who stood up for me is unacceptable,” Bellows said in an interview Tuesday. “The swatting of my home is unacceptable.”<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-election-official-swatted-as-hoaxes-multiply/HYMIYE5Y7VBKPPP7QEDMCVNZXA/"> Georgia</a>’s Gabriel Sterling was also the victim of swatting.  “My family has now joined the ranks of those who have had their home ‘swatted,’” Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state’s office,<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/swatting-calls-target-politicians-in-georgia-and-across-the-nation/X5REZNXNXVBBRPS4SVJODZE63A/"> posted</a> Wednesday evening on Xwitter. “We should all refuse to allow bomb threats &amp; swatting to be the new normal.” Sterling wrote that<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-election-official-swatted-as-hoaxes-multiply/HYMIYE5Y7VBKPPP7QEDMCVNZXA/"> someone called 911</a> and reported “a drug deal gone bad” at his home address. Police were dispatched, but the episode concluded without incident. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said she received death threats in the wake of the lawsuit that was filed in her state that eventually led to Trump being kicked off the ballot in her state. “Within three weeks of the lawsuit being filed, I received 64 death threats. I stopped counting after that,” Griswold<a href="https://twitter.com/JenaGriswold/status/1741142869291962522?s=20"> said</a> on Xwitter. “I will not be intimidated. Democracy and peace will triumph over tyranny and violence.”</p>

The training, offered to stakeholders and representatives from all 15 counties, is the<a href="https://azsos.gov/about-office/media-center/press-releases/1583"> first in a series</a> to help election officials prepare for the upcoming election cycle. &#8220;Mis, dis and mal-information – or MDM – remain a primary threat to the security of our elections,&#8221; Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said. &#8220;Advances in AI and deepfake technology heighten the potential for chaos. We are going to make sure we are prepared for what is coming our way.&#8221; During the TTX, Fontes tried to fool participants by presenting them with AI-generated audio and video of key officials — including Fontes himself — spinning falsehoods. “It was the first [Election Day simulation] that included artificial intelligence as a focus point,” Fontes told Politico. And unless you knew him or his staff well enough to ferret out the half-truths told in the clips, he said, the AI-powered fakes “wouldn’t necessarily be non-believable.” The fake of Fontes, for example, offered false but trivial facts about himself, like that he had a son who plays ice hockey. Cait Conley, a senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and one of the federal government’s top election officials, praised Arizona’s exercise as one of the “best ways” to ensure states are prepared for Election Day. But she also acknowledged how much harder the fast-evolving tech could make things. “Heading into 2024, generative AI is likely to exacerbate many of the risks election officials already face,” she said.</p>

OPM also announced that federal employees may now use up to four hours of administrative leave per year to serve as non-partisan poll workers or observers.  “The functioning of our democracy and protecting the right to vote are core American ideals,” said Kiran Ahuja, OPM Director. “Today’s guidance advances fundamental goals of the Biden-Harris Administration: to promote democracy, reduce barriers to voting for federal employees, and further position the federal government as a model employer for other employers to follow. OPM is proud to help lead this effort.”  Historically, OPM<a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/flexibilities-during-2020-election"> guidance</a> has provided administrative leave to federal employees on election day only. It also allowed employees to access paid time off in limited circumstances based on employee’s work schedule and the polling hours in their community.<a href="https://chcoc.gov/content/executive-order-promoting-access-voting"> New guidance released today</a> recognizes that voting has evolved beyond a single election day and reduces barriers to voting by directing agencies to provide time off for employees to vote at any time the polls are open, either on election day or during an early voting period.   Additionally, OPM is authorizing agencies to grant up to four hours of administrative leave, which may be combined with other leave or time off, for employees to work as a non-partisan poll worker or election observer. Under the<a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/flexibilities-during-2020-election"> previous policy</a>, issued in 2020, federal agencies were encouraged to authorize excused absences for employees who wanted to serve as non-partisan election officials. OPM’s new policy moves beyond excused absences to allowing a limited amount of paid time off in recognition of the important role non-partisan poll workers play in our democracy.</p>

It would also ban someone from having a gun in the 50-foot area leading up to the polls. That area is called a &#8220;chute.&#8221;  A person who not only violates the proposed law by having a gun in the restricted areas, but then points the gun at someone, could be looking at a prison term of six months to 2 1/2 years.  In Indiana, voters are allowed to bring guns into a voting location, unless it&#8217;s a church, a school or a private space where firearms are not allowed. State Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-District 2, who introduced SB26, proposed a similar measure in 2022. That bill never received a hearing.</p>

Pate said he wants all counties to canvas votes on the Tuesday after election day, which would eliminate Monday as an option. He also proposed that having the number of people helping with a recount should be based on the respective county&#8217;s population. He said this would help make the process more efficient, accurate and consistent across the state. We have to constantly be on guard,&#8221; Pate said. &#8220;There are a lot of foreign actors that try and mess with our elections and we&#8217;ve done a great job on the cyber side. We also know there is a thing about voter confidence and after the last presidential election we&#8217;ve got a lot of national attention to it. Iowans have a great confidence in our system and we believe we&#8217;ve done a good job but you&#8217;ve gotta stay ahead of it. Pate mentioned he wants to make sure poll workers are trained the same, no matter what district they&#8217;re in, to provide all Iowa voters with the same experience.</p>

The bill moves next to the Senate.</p>
<p>Also this week, the House killed a Senate bill,<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=817&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current"> Senate Bill 156</a>, that would have allowed an authorized election official access to nonpublic information in the state’s voter database in order to verify a voter’s identity, if necessary.</p>
<p>Other elections-related bills still up for consideration this year include:<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1786&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current"> House Bill 1133</a>, which would allow overseas voters and those in the military to send in their completed ballots by email,<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1096&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current"> House Bill 1264</a>, would mandate that towns and cities acquire the machines for use in local elections as well. The machines allow voters to use tablets and sound prompts to more easily vote.<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=23137&amp;q=billVersion"> House Bill 1569</a>, would increase the requirements to vote by requiring a photo identification at the polls – with no exceptions. Currently, voters may fill out an affidavit that attests to who they are and where they live and must mail documents to prove this to the Secretary of State’s Office within seven days of the election, or face criminal charges. Lynn’s bill would eliminate that option, and it would require new voters to present a “birth certificate, passport, naturalization papers” or other document that demonstrates their citizenship in order to register.  <a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1394&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current">House Bill 1364</a> would make harassment of election officials a crime, and would make it illegal to post personal information online that brings an “imminent and serious threat” to them or their family. HB 1364 would also prohibit any threats of force or violence made “in retaliation against the official on account of the official’s performance of the official’s duties” – currently, the anti-intimidation law applies only while the poll worker is working at the polling place.<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1367&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current"> House Bill 1310</a>, would require that supervisors of the checklist meet at least every 90 days – during election years and non-election years – to keep the town or city voter rolls continually up to date.<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=22928&amp;q=billVersion"> Senate Bill 490</a> would shorten the state’s schedule to update the voter rolls from every 10 years to every two years.<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_Status/pdf.aspx?id=22299&amp;q=billVersion"> House Bill 1557</a> would mandate that the Secretary of State’s Office enter into a membership agreement with ERIC. Republicans have opposed membership, objecting to portions of the program that promote voter registration.<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1973&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current"> Senate Bill 489</a> would require the Secretary of State’s Office to conduct an audit of at least eight ballot counting devices across the state after an election.</p>

This legislation requires<a href="https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2023/12/22/new-jersey-bill-aims-to-fix-error-prone-voting-machines/"> annual recertification</a> and checks upon software modifications by the Secretary of State. The bill responds to a Monmouth County incident where a school board election result was overturned due to a voting machine error. It mandates testing and a checklist to ensure accurate vote recording and tabulation. The Senate approved the bill unanimously with a 34-0 vote.</p>

Kathy Hochul signed legislation to<a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/hochul-agrees-move-local-elections-even-years-18571340.php"> move most local elections to even years</a>, which will align the normally low-turnout local municipal races with ballots for president, Congress and governor. The move by Hochul, was welcomed by voting suffrage groups and many Democrats, who are most likely to benefit from the change. The bill was admonished by not only Republicans, but also the New York State Association of Counties and some Democratic elections commissioners. The controversial measure was passed in the final stages of the 2023 legislative session. Hochul described the controversial measure as a “significant step towards expanding access to the ballot box and promoting a more inclusive democracy.” Proponents have argued the shift will save taxpayers money by consolidating elections.</p>

At his final council meeting on Dec. 19, outgoing Mayor John Tecklenburg introduced the resolution that calls on the state’s Legislature to add instant runoff, or ranked-choice, voting as an alternative to current election methods. “I want to make clear that we’re not approving instant runoff voting at all,” Tecklenburg said ahead to the vote. “We’re just asking the Legislature to give us that as an additional option and in the event that they decide to pass that on the state level, then a future mayor and a future council would have to make a decision as to whether we want it or not. We’re just asking for it as an option.” The change would require a change in state law, and then municipalities would have to opt in. Opposing bills, one calling for ranked-choice voting and another banning it, have been introduced in the state Legislature.</p>

The bill was proposed by Senator Deon Tedder. Tedder says the goal is to provide better accessibility to the right to vote by providing a one-stop service opportunity. This is contrary to the current method, where it is required to fill out a separate form and sometimes travel to register. Those who do not want to participate and instead go the traditional route may request to decline the automatic registration. Tedder says it is a “common-sense” bill and would ease the process for many in the community, including first-time voters, those who are actively moving, senior voters and more. “When I go to places, speak to people and ask who’s registered to vote, there’s still so many who are not. It’s not because they don’t want to, it’s because there’s an extra step and they actually have to go somewhere to do it. We know everyone’s going to get a driver’s license or identification card. Let’s make it easier,” Tedder says.</p>

You should have to declare your party allegiance … that way, it keeps it in the family.”  Currently, Virginia holds open primaries, where voters have the option to choose which party’s primary they vote in. The current system does give some voters in non-competitive districts a voice, Meagher said — something the proposed bill could change.  The bill, should it pass, wouldn’t take effect until 2025, meaning it would not affect next year’s presidential primary elections.</p>

Elections officials, however, say parts of the initiative may conflict with state and federal law. Rob Anderson filed the proposed Restore Election Confidence initiative with the Clark County Elections Office, which forwarded it to the county prosecuting attorney’s office for legal review and a ballot title. Then, Anderson will need to gather roughly 27,000 signatures by June 8 to get it on the November ballot. The initiative would prohibit “fake ballots” from being sent or counted and require 85 percent of all ballots to be processed and tallied by the end of Election Day. The initiative also calls for security cameras at ballot drop locations, as well as the cleanup of voter registration rolls 30 days before ballots are mailed. If voters approve the initiative in November, it calls for all the measures to be in place by the next election. Funding to implement the changes would come from the election office’s existing budget. Any additional funding would be approved by the Clark County Council. However, the initiative states that “no new taxes or fees shall be proposed or adopted as a source of funding.</p>

Judd and Crosby had balked for weeks about certifying the results. They didn’t cite problems with election results. But they said they weren’t satisfied that the machines used to tabulate ballots were properly certified for use in elections, though state and federal election officials said they were. During brief arraignment hearings late last year, Judd and Crosby pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and interference with an election officer and were informed of future court dates, including a May 16 trial. The county finally certified its results after a judge ruled the Republican supervisors broke the law when they refused to sign off on the vote count by a deadline. Crosby skipped the meeting, leaving Judd and Supervisor Ann English, the board’s lone Democrat, to finally approve the canvass, allowing the statewide certification to go forward as scheduled.</p>

In a written statement, Bixby said, &#8220;A municipal voter ID law is wrong; it violates the Constitutional rights to vote and state law, and we intend to ensure that it never gets imposed in the City of Huntington Beach. Voters should vote down this nonsense, and if they don’t we will make sure that the courts strike it down.” In October, a fractious Huntington Beach City Council<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/huntington-beach-city-council-votes-to-add-voter-id-charter-amendment-to-march-ballot/"> voted</a> 4-3 to add three charter amendments to the March 2024 primary ballot. One would give the city the authority to run its own local elections, a power which currently rests with the county. It would also give the city the power to ask voters for a photo ID before being allowed to cast their ballots.</p>

In a historic ruling issued Dec. 19, the Colorado Supreme Court ordered Griswold not to place Trump on the ballot, siding with plaintiffs who argued that he is ineligible for the office of president under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Section 3 of the Amendment, ratified in the wake of the Civil War, prohibits a person who “engaged in insurrection” after taking an oath to support the Constitution from holding office again. In their filing, attorneys for Griswold echoed the position taken by the plaintiffs in a brief filed, asking the court to weigh in on two key questions raised by the case — whether Section 3 of the 14th Amendment applies to the president, and whether it can be enforced by a state without congressional action — but decline to review a third question presented by the Colorado Republican Party, asking whether denying it the ability to nominate “the candidate of its choice” in an election violates the First Amendment.</p>

Jones ruled this week that a Texas group’s campaign to challenge the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters in the nationally watched U.S. Senate runoffs<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/judge-rules-true-the-votes-2020-mass-voter-challenges-dont-amount-to-illegal-intimidation/"> did not violate the Voting Rights Act</a>. Jones concluded that Fair Fight Action did not show that True the Vote’s actions leading up to the dual Senate runoffs in early 2021 amounted to voter intimidation, as the voting rights group founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams attempted to argue. “Not only have Plaintiffs failed to overcome the fact that their actions did not result in any direct voter contact or alone include or direct county Boards of Elections to pursue an eligibility inquiry, but there is no evidence that Defendants’ actions caused (or attempted to cause) any voter to be intimidated, coerced, or threatened in voting,” Jones wrote in a 145-page<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.285098/gov.uscourts.gand.285098.335.0_3.pdf"> ruling</a>. Jones did, however, express some concern for the conservative group’s methods, particularly when it came to compiling a list of voters to challenge. “(True the Vote’s) list utterly lacked reliability. Indeed, it verges on recklessness,” he wrote. “The Court has heard no testimony and seen no evidence of any significant quality control efforts, or any expertise guiding the data process.” Jones also emphasized in a footnote that his ruling should not be misconstrued as the court condoning True the Vote’s actions in pushing “a mass number of seemingly frivolous challenges.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled that Georgia&#8217;s Republican-led General Assembly<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/georgia-voting-maps-survive-federal-challenge-preserving-republican-advantage/"> &#8220;fully complied&#8221; with his orders to create an additional political district</a> with a majority of Black voters. In 2022, Jones found the state&#8217;s 2021 political district map violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting Black voting power in certain areas of the state, and in October the judge ordered state legislators to draw an additional, majority-Black congressional district in the west-metro Atlanta area. The new district lines, which keep Republicans in control of the state&#8217;s legislature and congressional delegation, were signed into law on Dec. 8 by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp.  While the state gained additional districts with a majority of Black voters under the redrawn maps, it changed little in partisan representation, Judge Jones noted. &#8220;Here, the committee and floor debate transcripts make clear that the General Assembly created the 2023 Remedial Congressional Plan in a manner that politically protected the majority party (i.e., the Republican Party) as much as possible,&#8221; he wrote in his<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pendergrass-v-raffensperger-order-usdc-northern-georgia.pdf"> order</a>.  &#8220;However, redistricting decisions by a legislative body with an eye toward securing partisan advantage does not alone violate Section 2&#8221; of the Voting Rights Act, the judge added.</p>

Taylor<a href="https://www.siouxlandproud.com/news/local-news/state-responds-to-kim-taylors-acquittal-filing/"> filed for an acquittal</a> on December 1, 2023 claiming that there wasn’t enough evidence for a conviction. In the state’s rebuttal late last year they argued that the families that testified at trial were more than enough to prove Taylor’s guilt. The state is asking the court to deny Taylor’s motion for acquittal. There is no date for when the court will decide on the motion. Taylor faces a maximum of five years in prison on each of the 52 counts. A sentencing date had not yet been set.</p>

A complaint filed in Kennebec County Superior Court on Tuesday says Bellows was a “biased decision maker” who should have recused herself from the decision. It also says the Maine secretary of state does not have the legal authority to consider the federal constitutional issues presented in complaints seeking to bar Trump from the ballot and, as a result, that Trump will be illegally excluded from the ballot based on Bellows’ decision. The filing also says that Bellows “made multiple errors of law and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.” Bellows anticipated a challenge and had said her ruling would be suspended until any court appeals could be heard. “Under Maine law, an appeal of the decision to the Maine Superior Court is the next step in the process laid out in the Maine election law,” Bellows said in a prepared statement Tuesday. “I have confidence in my decision and in the rule of law.

Benson</a>, went to trial in November and alleged the legislative boundaries drawn up by the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission (MICRC)  violated the Voting Rights Act (VRA) by diluting Black voting power in more than a dozen Detroit-area legislative districts. “The record here shows overwhelmingly — indeed, inescapably — that the Commission drew the boundaries of plaintiffs’ districts predominantly on the basis of race,” stated the opinion. “We hold that those districts were drawn in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.” The opinion came from U.S. Circuit Judge Raymond M. Kethledge and U.S. District Court Judges Paul L. Maloney and Janet T. Neff, who were all appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush. The plaintiffs, 19 African-American Detroiters who live in 13 different Michigan House and Senate districts that each include a portion of Detroit, filed the suit in March 2022.</p>
<p>The Michigan Supreme Court has ruled that that Donald Trump can<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/27/trump-2024-michigan-supreme-court-00133228"> appear on the state’s Republican primary ballot</a>, but the court declined to weigh in for now on whether Trump is eligible to run in the general election and serve again as president.</p>

Following a clerical error in the Nov. 7 election, the county election administrator — through a court petition filed early this month — is seeking to nullify the election and hold a redo for the four Council wards on the ballot.  Hunter, in court documents, says that the annulment and initiation of a new election would cause him and the public “considerable harm” and could not have had a meaningful impact on the election outcome for Ward 3, which he was reelected to serve.  The error caused some ballots to be distributed incorrectly during the election process. The county says 176 voters voted on an incorrect ballot, but that 1,400 eligible voters were affected by the error. Flathead County Clerk and Recorder Debbie Pierson is asking the court to allow her department to conduct a new election and pay for the election.</p>

Those voters will submit an “affidavit ballot” on Election Day, which “will be excluded from the final vote count unless the person complies with a burdensome identity-verification process within seven days of the election,” the Democrats claim in the lawsuit. Should those voters miss the seven-day deadline, not only will their votes be tossed under the law, but the secretary of state would be required to turn over their names to the state attorney general’s office for possible criminal investigation. The law “does not require that these individuals be informed that their votes will not be counted or that they have been referred for potential prosecution,” the Democrats claim.</p>

Ryba has<a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/no-excuse-vote-mail-remains-open-new-yorkers-now-18578710.php"> rejected a request</a> from U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik and the Republican Party to temporarily suspend a new state law that allows any registered voter in New York to cast their ballot early by mail. The case, in which the GOP is seeking a temporary injunction while they argue their case that the law violates the constitution, will next head to an appellate court in Albany. Stefanik is seeking a final ruling on the merits of the case ahead of the 2024 election, in which New York’s congressional races could dictate control of Congress. Under prior law, a voter could file an absentee ballot if they provided an excuse such as being a member of the military, traveling or having a conflict such as a pre-scheduled surgery. A temporary law during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed anyone concerned about contracting the virus to request an absentee ballot. Stefanik has argued the only way to expand who is eligible to vote by mail is through a constitutional amendment. Ryba found the GOP’s argument for a preliminary injunction, which would have prevented the law from taking effect in 2024, is insufficient. She said the Republicans did not demonstrate they would face “irreparable harm” if the law stays on the books. Republicans immediately appealed the ruling.</p>

The law was first challenged in part on racial bias claims over three years ago, with those who sued hoping to get it addressed in time for the 2020 elections. But following a series of legal hurdles, Webster&#8217;s ruling came just weeks before absentee voting begins for this year&#8217;s primary elections in the nation&#8217;s ninth-largest state for contests like president, governor and attorney general. The groups who sued state election officials can formally object to Webster&#8217;s recommendation to deny their motion and dismiss the litigation to U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs in Winston-Salem, who will make a final decision that could still be appealed further. The lawsuit has continued despite a change to the challenged law in the fall by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, which specified that a felony offender has to know they were breaking the law by voting for there to be a crime. Without that change, which went into effect Jan. 1, a person could be prosecuted even if casting a ballot was an unintentional mistake. Webster, who listened to in-person arguments in Durham federal court in November, sided with state attorneys defending the law who argued that the groups now lack legal standing to sue. But the Jan. 1 alteration requiring intentionality in voting illegally &#8220;substantially diminishes any prospective voter&#8217;s perceived threat of prosecution and any resulting confusion,&#8221; Webster wrote. &#8220;As a result, Plaintiffs can no longer claim that they must divert substantial resources to educate volunteers and prospective voters regarding the new law because much of the confusion concerning one&#8217;s eligibility to vote has been eliminated,&#8221; he added.</p>

The Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) filed the motion Friday to intervene in Pennsylvania State Conference of NAACP Branches v. Secretary, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania so that mail-in ballots with the wrong date — or no date — on the outer ballot would be counted.  “The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy,” the executive directors of the organizations — Sam Cornale, (DNC) Christie Roberts, (DSCC) and Julie Merz, (DCCC) — said in a joint statement. “Every eligible voter in Pennsylvania and across the country has a constitutional right to have their voice heard, but Republicans’ assaults on their freedom to cast their ballots would throw away Pennsylvanians’ perfectly legal votes and undermine our democracy. At every turn, as the GOP launches cynical, baseless attacks on Americans’ voting rights, Democrats will intervene on the side of voters.”  The committees are asking to intervene to ensure that any timely mail ballots that are undated or incorrectly dated are counted in all future elections. The date is not material to the validity of the vote or the eligibility of the voter, the groups argue.</p>

Those individuals explained that the right to vote shouldn&#8217;t come with obstacles in a lawsuit filed in late December.  &#8220;The right to vote really belongs to all the people,&#8221; Derfner said.  After 2020, state lawmakers adjusted absentee voting rules, making it harder to qualify. One of those qualifications is being over the age of 65. Anyone 65 or over can vote absentee. Derfner&#8217;s clients argued that someone&#8217;s age should not give them special voting privileges. They also argue that the law violates the 26th Amendment, which reads: &#8220;The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.&#8221;  &#8220;There are several plaintiffs in the case,&#8221; Derfner said. &#8220;All of them [are] under 65, and all of them want the opportunity [to vote].&#8221;  The five-page lawsuit compared the rule to age discrimination. However, another perspective of absentee ballots is their convenience.</p>

Look Ahead America, Inc., also known as Virginia Voter Assistance, was distributing mailers that Miyares claims were &#8220;false and intimidating&#8221; to voters in northern Virginia, leading the attorney general to send a cease and desist letter in October. According to Miyares, the mailers stated that if voters did not cast their ballots they could lose their Social Security income, Medicare eligibility, unemployment benefits, child tax credits, child custody rights, and concealed carry permits. In turn, Look Ahead America Inc. filed a lawsuit against Miyares challenging voter intimidation statutes. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied the organization&#8217;s requested injunction, however.</p>
<p>More than a year after the indictment of a county election official on corruption charges, the Virginia Attorney General’s Office<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/virginia-ag-drops-corruption-case-against-election-official/"> dropped the final charge</a> in the case. During a brief hearing, Judge Carroll A. Weimer Jr. granted a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/white-motion-Dec.-29.pdf"> motion to end the case</a> against Michele White, formerly registrar for Prince William County.  Charges against White initially included two felonies, corrupt conduct and making a false statement regarding an election, along with a misdemeanor count of neglect of duty by an elections officer. The attorney general’s office dropped the felony charges against her in December.  In court filings, James R. Herring, assistant attorney general, explained that a key witness, Sean Mulligan, “conveniently and quite surprisingly provided a different version of events from that which he had previously provided to investigators.” White&#8217;s attorney, Zachary Stafford of the firm Lawrence, Smith and Gardner, said Mulligan, who served as assistant registrar, never changed his story. Rather, investigators failed to properly vet the witness. He explained that the most concerning charge against White involved altering election results in VERIS  (Virginia Election and Registration Information System) on Nov. 7, 2020, with incorrect numbers for the central absentee precinct. That charge was subsequently disproven, Stafford said.</p>

In one lawsuit from the local chapter of the League of Women Voters Nilsestuen<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/league-of-women-voters-of-wisconsin-v-wisconsin-elections-commission-dane-county-circuit-court-summary-judgment-decision.pdf"> said</a> rejecting ballots based on a failure to meet the witness address requirements violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In another lawsuit from RISE — a group that in part advocates for student debt relief and youth get-out-the-vote efforts — the judge<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rise-v-wisconsin-elections-commission-dane-county-circuit-court-summary-judgment-decision.pdf"> adopted</a> a more lenient definition of the term “address” as pushed for by the group. The two decisions mark another twist in years of legal wrangling over the linchpin swing state’s absentee voting rules, particularly those regarding witnesses to absentee ballots that must sign the ballots’ certificates. Wisconsin, where the last two presidential elections have been decided by less than 25,000 votes, has its primary for the 2024 contest on April 2.</p>
<p>In a 4-3 decision released December 22, 2023, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/12/22/wisconsin-supreme-court-rules-state-voting-maps-unconstitutional/"> Wisconsin’s voting maps as currently drawn violate the state constitution</a> and must be redrawn in time for the 2024 election. Under the Wisconsin Constitution, state legislative districts must consist of “contiguous territory.” Yet, the majority opinion states, “the number of state legislative districts containing territory completely disconnected from the rest of the district is striking.” “At least 50 of 99 Assembly districts and at least 20 of 33 Senate districts include separate, detached territory,” states the majority opinion, written by Justice Jill Karofsky. The voters who brought the lawsuit, Clarke v. Wisconsin Elections Commission, argued that the current districts violate the constitution and asked the Court to  order the adoption of remedial maps. They also asked the Court to declare the November 2022 state Senate elections unlawful, and to order special elections for state Senate seats that would otherwise not be on the ballot until November 2026. The Court’s ruling agrees with the petitioners that “Wisconsin’s state legislative districts must be composed of physically adjoining territory,” and enjoins the Wisconsin Elections Commission from using the current legislative maps in future elections. But it declined to invalidate the results of the 2022 state Senate elections.</p>
<p>In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel from the 2nd District Court of Appeals<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/27/wisconsin-court-backs-activist-on-access-to-ineligible-voter-records/72039539007/"> overturned a Walworth County Circuit Court order</a> that had dismissed a case against Walworth County Register in Probate Kristina Secord who had prohibited Ron Heuer and the Wisconsin Voters Alliance from obtaining records of people placed under guardianship to check them against the statewide voter registration list. At issue in the lawsuit is the balance between protecting the right to privacy for individuals who have been declared ineligible to vote based on incompetency and preventing valid votes from being canceled or diluted by ineligible votes. In the lawsuit, Heuer and WVA alleged the number of “ineligible voters” listed on the Wisconsin Elections Commission&#8217;s public website was inconsistent with counties&#8217; tallies from voting wards. The court ruled that &#8220;if the voter ineligibility determination is, in fact, pertinent to the finding of incompetency, WVA has not only demonstrated a need for this information but has demonstrated that it is entitled to the requested Notices (in full or redacted form) pursuant to the Public Records Law.&#8221; The decision stipulated that neither WVA nor any member of the public should be given guardianship case numbers or individuals&#8217; birthdates, and left room for the circuit court to require additional redactions for privacy purposes.</p>
