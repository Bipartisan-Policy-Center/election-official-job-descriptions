														<p><strong>Brennan Center Local Election Officials Survey — May 2024</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials beef up security as survey shows nearly 40% grapple with threats, harassment</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A new </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-may-2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of local election officials reveals that the vast majority have taken steps since 2020 to protect voters, election workers, and election infrastructure from threats and violence in 2024. The enhanced security measures come as large numbers of election officials who responded to the survey report having experienced threats, abuse, or harassment. Election officials also shared ongoing concerns about both the safety of their staff and colleagues, as well as the possibility of political interference in the upcoming election. As election officials perform crucial work under these challenging conditions, the survey indicates officials’ budgets to grow in order to keep up with administrative and security needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Threats, harassment, and abuse </strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest edition of the Brennan Center’s annual survey found that 38 percent of local election officials experienced threats, harassment, or abuse for doing their jobs. Overall, the surveyed election officials’ concerns about physical safety and harassment remain high. More than half of local election officials reported being concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff — a significantly higher number than in 2023, but about equal to 2022.  More than one in four worries about being assaulted at home or work. And concern about harassment of family and loved ones exceeded levels last seen in 2022, the last federal election year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abuse suffered by officials is fueling an exodus from the field. More than one-third of local election officials know at least one person who resigned at least in part due to safety concerns, up from 22 percent in 2023. We estimate approximately one in four will be administering their first presidential election this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11151" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image1-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image1-300x164.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image1-1024x561.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image1-768x421.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image1-1536x842.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image1.png 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />2024 election security measures  </strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2020, local election officials have taken action to ensure that elections are safe and secure for everyone. More than 90 percent of local election officials reported having taken steps to increase election security over the past four years, such as participating in security trainings and updating polling place contingency plans and election technology. While the specifics vary by state and locality, the increased emphasis on security is nearly universal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most local election officials who reported that the government has worked to increase staff safety since 2020 said these efforts have helped. Eighty-three percent of those who received additional funding from their local, state, or federal government said that the resources helped make their staff feel safer, and 73 percent said the same about legislation intended to protect election workers. Since 2020, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/state-laws-providing-protection-for-election-officials-and-staff"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have enacted such laws.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Political interference concerns </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of election officials said they are worried about political interference in the lead-up to another contentious presidential election. More than three in five said they are worried about political leaders interfering with how they or their colleagues around the country do their jobs, compared to 56 percent who reported worries about interference in their colleagues’ work in 2023. This is a return to numbers in 2022. In 2024, 13 percent said they are concerned about facing pressure to certify results in favor of a specific candidate or party. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, 7 percent of local election officials report using AI for tasks like drafting social media content. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe AI use may become more common in future election cycles. Twelve percent of election officials, or nearly twice as many as the number of officials already using AI to assist them in their work, reported that they had been approached by AI product vendors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even larger numbers of local election officials want the government to provide them with guidance on how, when, and whether to use AI, suggesting an understanding that AI may become more widely used in election administration in future years. While the largest proportion of officials said they “didn’t know” if guidance would be helpful — which is unsurprising given how few are currently experimenting with it — one-third supported the creation of federal, state, or local guidance on using AI in election administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Need for resources </strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, local election officials said they need additional resources to keep up with administrative and security needs. Eighty-<img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11152" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image2-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image2-300x169.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image2-1024x578.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image2-768x433.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image2-1536x867.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05.02.24Image2.png 1864w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />three percent said they need bigger budgets to do so, up from 74 percent in 2023. One in four officials has had a budget request denied, most commonly when requesting support related to personnel, including the hiring of additional staff members and increased wages for poll workers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, Congress approved </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/grants/election-security-funds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$55 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in additional funding for election security, bringing the total amount of new federal funding to </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46646#page=9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$205 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2020. While all funding helps, this allocation falls far short of what election officials need and amounts to </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46646#page=8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 billion less</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than what Congress approved in the years leading up to the 2020 election. The Department of Homeland Security helped offset this shortfall by making nearly $30 million in </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/homeland-security/fy-24-fact-sheet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available for election security needs in 2024 after doing the same in 2023. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years after the tumultuous 2020 election, election officials continue to report unacceptable levels of threats, harassment, and abuse, as well as concerns about safety and political interference. At the same time, they report significant progress in protecting against election threats, with large majorities implementing measures to ensure that election infrastructure remains secure and that both voters and election workers can participate safely in the democratic process. While our annual survey reveals that more work must be done to keep election workers safe, the elections community has been remarkably resilient. Continuing to support it is crucial to maintaining safe, free, and fair elections for all. </span></p>

The Department updated</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> www.justice.gov/voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a one-stop resource providing voting and elections information for voters as well as state and local elections officials. Additionally, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-updated-voting-rights-and-elections-website"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as part of the update, the Civil Rights Division published two new informational guides on voting rights and updated five other guides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Department’s longstanding practice is to update resources and provide information in election years on the efforts of the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, National Security Division, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices throughout the country, to ensure that all qualified voters have the opportunity to cast their ballots and have their votes counted free of discrimination, intimidation, or criminal activity in the election process, and to ensure that our elections are secure and free from foreign malign influence and interference. Over the coming months additional resources will be published. The new guides issued today include one on</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1348556/dl?inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voter Intimidation Under Federal Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, discussing the prohibition on threats, obstruction, or deliberately false information about the time, manner, or place of voting to prevent people from casting their ballots or participating in the electoral process. The Department has prepared</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/assistant-attorney-general-kristen-clarkes-statement-voter-intimidation"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a short video explaining how to report such misconduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The second new guide addresses</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1348561/dl?inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Section 203 mandates language assistance to enable certain people with limited English proficiency to participate effectively in all phases of the electoral process.  Along with the two new guides, the Department updated five existing guides on the Justice Department website. The Department updated its guide on</span><a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/protecting-voter-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Federal Laws Protecting the Rights of Voters with Disabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This guide describes the legal protections designed to allow equal access to every aspect of elections, including registration and voting, for people with disabilities. The Department also revised its</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1429826/dl?inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Guidance Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act for redistricting and methods of electing government bodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another update addressed</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1348586/dl?inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election “Audits.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition, the Department updated its</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1348591/dl?inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Guidance Concerning Federal Statutes Affecting Methods of Voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Along with these revisions, the Department updated information on how to request</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1348571/dl?inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Federal Election Monitors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a jurisdiction.</span></p>

If the measures pass, the auditor’s offices in each county would have to hand-count ballots in the Nov. 5 general election and thereafter. The votes – in Gregory, Haakon and Tripp counties – were forced by citizen-initiated petitions at the county level. Petitioners say they want to ban tabulators because they’re concerned about election security and integrity. According to the South Dakota Searchlight, the auditors in each county are now working to educate their citizens on the election process, including the accuracy and safety of tabulators, and highlighting the potential financial consequences of hand-counting ballots. “More than anything, I want my county to be educated about how our elections run,” said Stacy Pinney, Haakon County auditor. In Haakon County, Pinney plans to hold three town halls ahead of the June 4 primary to answer county residents’ questions. The final town hall will coincide with her statutorily required public test of the tabulator machines. She’ll also present to the local high school’s senior government class about the election process. If the ballot initiative passes, Pinney expects she’ll need 10 extra people to hand-count ballots. That can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 more, she estimates. Julie Bartling, Gregory County auditor, said if her county’s tabulator ban passes, she’ll have to break up the south-central county’s three precincts into six or 10 precincts to have manageable ballot amounts for hand counters. That will cost the county $5,000 to $8,000 more – assuming she can convince poll workers who’ve already been working 12-hour days to stay longer and hand-count ballots. Tripp County Auditor Barb DeSersa said she’ll have to find another 65 people to hand-count ballots if the measure passes. Haakon County plans to audit more than the state-required 5% of ballots after the primary. Tripp and Gregory counties will each conduct a post-election audit of all cast ballots after the primary.  “I’m anxious for the post-election audit because I want people to know that their automated counting machines are accurate,” Bartling said. “They’re counting correctly and the post-election audit will show that and prove it.”</span></p>

According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it’s unclear whether the intrusion was a ransomware attack or some other type of intrusion.The Coffee County Board of Commissioners said in a statement that CISA notified it of “unusual cyber-activity” on April 15. “Upon examination, Coffee County’s IT infrastructure showed no evidence of exfiltration of data/files, but did indicate cyber-activity by an unknown malicious actor,” the board said. “Coffee County has informed federal authorities of the incident and is working diligently with these agencies to identify the origin and possible identity of the persons responsible.” Coffee County is where supporters of former President Donald Trump copied Georgia’s statewide voting system software and other confidential data in January 2021.</span></p>

The </span><a href="https://www.sos.nm.gov/ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seeing is No Longer Believing” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign, designed to help people identify when something is AI-generated. “These images and these voice reproductions and videos can be so realistic, but there are some things that are obvious that we as critical consumers of information can look for,” Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said. The campaign is launching with ads focusing on educating voters about how computer-generated AI can manipulate or even create audio, video, and photos that are easy to miss. One example is ‘deep fakes,’ which are faked audio, images, or videos that look like real people and are used to sway voters. The new state campaign tells people what to look out for to identify fake creations and how to combat them. The campaign includes a quiz to see if you can spot AI, a quick guide to spotting AI and a link to trusted sources for voting information. There is also a way to report AI to the secretary’s office.  “We do anticipate and expect A.I. generated content to come up around this and so again we really want to urge voters to just have their critical thinking caps on and think, you know I’m going to double check and see if this is right,” Toulouse Oliver said. The campaign launches ahead of the state of early voting next week. New Mexico’s Primary Election is coming up on June 4.</span></p>

The winning submission was drawn by Carys Smith, a ninth-grade student at Pine View School. The winning submission was one of more than 350 entries received from 14 Sarasota County schools. The design was selected, in part, because of its whimsical depiction of the many elements that make Sarasota County such a unique place to live. It features an alligator in sunglasses in an innertube. The new sticker design will be used exclusively in Sarasota County for the November 5, 2024 General Election.

The report “represents a systematic examination of voter attitudes and experiences with the election, concerns about election security, and preferences for election reforms&#8221; (p. 10). The 2022 NMES, completed by University of New Mexico (UNM) Professor Emeritus Lonna Atkeson, now director of the LeRoy Collins Institute at Florida State University (FSU), and UNM Political Science Professor Wendy Hansen, with support from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office, highlights the changes and advances in election administration using voter registration data, election observations, and surveys of voters. “The New Mexico Election Study has been pivotal in helping New Mexico</span><a href="https://elections.mit.edu/#/data/rank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rank first in the Election Performance Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year,” said Atkeson. “As our report outlines, New Mexico does elections well.” This is the ninth iteration of the NMES. Begun in 2006 by Professor Atkeson, this effort represents a unique, continuous time series documenting the successes and shortcomings in election administration for each federal election. As stated in the report, “no other state or election jurisdiction has had this kind of sustained and independent scrutiny over multiple elections” (p. 11). Previous reports can be accessed</span><a href="https://polisci.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/nm-election-administration-and-other-reports.html?_gl=1*1rvcfzk*_gcl_au*NTM5Njg5NDI5LjE3MTA5NTg3NjA."><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The information and data in these reports is crucial for assessing the public’s views about their voting experiences in New Mexico,” said Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. “Though it’s a great achievement that New Mexico’s election administration has been ranked first in the nation, there’s always room for growth. This data assists my office and election administrators throughout New Mexico in understanding voter perspectives, identifying successful practices, and pinpointing areas requiring improvement.”</span></p>

The Arkansas Board of Election Commissioners approved the emergency rule April 23. Director Chris Madison said the rule is designed to create consistency because currently, electronic signatures are accepted by some county clerks and rejected by others. “Because we had voters being treated differently depending on what county they were in, we needed to put a stop on everything. That way everybody’s being treated the same,” Madison said.  If approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee,  the emergency rule will be effective for 120 days. Madison said the board will soon begin drafting a permanent rule that will be informed by feedback from a 30-day public comment period and a public hearing. Because voter registration is an ongoing process, Madison said it was important to make the change now because it will be easier to correct paperwork for currently affected applicants, instead of waiting for that number to grow. “What we don’t want happening is those voters showing up in November and having problems voting because of the confusion about their application, and that’s why the emergency rule was adopted was basically, hey, let’s just stop,” Madison said. “We’re going to draw a line in the sand, so to speak, and then we can work through the process and do the due process procedures to get a rule in place. That way if I apply in one county or I apply in another county, I’m treated the same.”</span></p>

Railing against that measure, Min said his bill would remove any ambiguity that a charter city could impose such a requirement. On the March 5 ballot, the measure passed by 32,892 to 28,701 votes, or 53.4% to 46.6%. California officials sued Huntington Beach last month in Orange County in response. “To me, the principle is simple,” Min told the Senate Local Government Committee. According to Min, if evidence of voter fraud were to exist, officials should take action. However, there is no evidence, and it’s the state’s responsibility — not that of individual cities — to dictate election law. Min said he’s asked Huntington Beach council members for evidence of election fraud and has seen none. Charter cities operate under their own charter and have latitude in conducting municipal affairs, though they must abide by state law. California’s constitution doesn’t define “municipal affairs,” creating ambiguity.</span></p>

Among the changes would be a new requirement that recount petitions be filed with a good faith belief that the number of challenged votes could change the election outcome. Current law allows for recount petitions when a party believes &#8220;fraud&#8221; or &#8220;mistakes&#8221; have occurred. The bill would replace those references to fraud and mistakes with ones to &#8220;errors.&#8221; But supporters argue canvassing boards, which oversee recounts at the state and local level, don’t investigate fraud to begin with. The legislation would also double per-precinct fees that petitioners must pay for a recount. That deposit would be refunded if the petitioner proves there was enough error in an original count to change the election result. Another part of the package would replace parts of current statute that prevent ballots from being recounted in certain cases — like if a seal on a ballot container is broken. The legislation would instead provide a new path for previously excluded ballots to still be counted if they meet other criteria. Package co-sponsor Senator Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) described the changes as “common sense.” “It’s modernizing our recount law and giving our clerks greater assurance of what to expect, as well as giving petitioners greater ability to actually ensure that the recounts that they’re calling for get to &#8230; more accurate results,” Chang said. The bills now head to the Michigan House of Representatives.</span></p>

The measure authorizes an exemption from taxable income of $100 for each day an employer provides paid leave to an employee to serve as a poll worker beginning in tax year 2025. “Election officials are grateful to the Legislature and the governor for providing a new tool for recruiting and retaining poll workers, which continues to be a struggle in many counties across the state,” said Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax. “Poll workers are the backbone of our democracy. Our hope is this new law will incentivize employers to provide time off for employees to serve as poll workers.” Stitt also signed</span><a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB3156&amp;Session=2400"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 3156</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that prohibits the use of ranked choice voting. </span></p>

The Democrat-controlled chamber voted to gut a bill that had multiple election-related measures in it – like changing the deadline for in-person applications for mail ballots – and make it what Rep. Scott Conklin called “no frills.” The amended bill would simply let counties start pre-canvassing seven days prior to an election, rather than the current setup of waiting until 7 a.m. on Election Day. The vote to amend the bill was 102-98, with all Democrats in favor and all Republicans opposed. The bill could be put to a final vote in the Democrat-controlled House on May 1.. Its future in the Republican-controlled Senate as a standalone measure appears dim. Among other things, the process involves opening envelopes containing mail ballots and tallying the votes reflected on the ballots, but not recording or publishing those votes. Election directors have repeatedly called for more time to do the work, but previous attempts to get a new law through the Legislature have failed. Sen. Joe Pittman, R-Indiana and the Republican majority leader, said bolstering voters’ confidence in elections is a top priority. Hence, he said, “Any discussion of changes to the administration of elections in our commonwealth must also include a Constitutional voter identification requirement.” Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, has spoken in favor of giving counties more time to carry out pre-canvassing.</span></p>

Patricia Serpa that would allow </span><a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/politics/ri-house-passes-bill-to-implement-automatic-disaffiliation-for-unaffiliated-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unaffiliated voters to stay that way after voting in primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cleared the R.I. House unanimously last week. Currently, anyone not affiliated with a political party automatically becomes affiliated with a party if they vote in its primary. In order to disaffiliate, they have to fill out a form or update their information online. Serpa’s bill aims to remove that process for unaffiliated voters. Those options would still be available for affiliated voters who want to update their party affiliation. According to the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website, 47% of Rhode Island voters are unaffiliated, which is more than 338,000 registered voters. This bill has support from Secretary of State Gregg Amore, who wrote testimony in favor of it to the House Committee on State Government &amp; Elections on March 26. “Currently, in order to remain unaffiliated after voting in a primary, voters must remember to fill out a disaffiliation form on their way out of the polling place,” Amore’s letter said. “Unfortunately, many voters forget to complete that step, so when the next primary approaches, they are unaware that they were automatically affiliated with a specific party – potentially disenfranchising them from the process, especially if they would prefer to vote in a different primary.” The next step for this bill is to pass the Rhode Island Senate. A companion bill has been introduced by state Sen. Leonidas Raptakis. “The Senate Judiciary had a hearing on the Senate version of this bill earlier this month, along with other elections bills,” Senate spokesperson Greg Paré told 12 News. “The Senate President looks forward to reviewing the testimony and consulting with the Chairwoman on the issue.”</span></p>

Napper also ruled that election officials can continue using a variety of voter signature samples while verifying signatures on early ballots. His decision comes in response to two suits filed last year by the Arizona Free Enterprise Club against Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes. The conservative grassroots organization has challenged a variety of statewide voting practices in court. Napper filed rulings in both cases at the same time in one minute entry. It alleged unmanned ballot drop boxes were illegal in Arizona because there was no state statute specifically authorizing their use outside of established polling places. In an earlier lawsuit, the group argued that election officials should only compare signed early ballot affidavits against voters&#8217; signatures on their voter registration forms. Historically, election officials have compared signatures on early ballots to those in any election-related document submitted by the voter, including signature rosters and prior signed early ballot affidavits. Napper wrote in his order that the state&#8217;s current elections rulebook requires certain safeguards that ensure boxes are appropriately &#8220;staffed&#8221; even if they aren&#8217;t being actively monitored by an election official. &#8220;The Legislature has not required that these drop-boxes always be monitored,&#8221; Napper wrote. &#8220;The decision to use staffed but unmonitored drop-boxes is within the discretion of the Secretary.” Attorney Kory Langhofer, who represented the Arizona Free Enterprise Club in the case, said the suit will be appealed.</span></p>

They will ultimately rule on whether an old and obscure law can be used to arrest alleged Bridgeport ballot harvesters Wanda Geter and Eneida Martinez. Fight Voter Fraud Inc., a group that aimed to force the arrest of Bridgeport city worker Wanda Geter and City Councilor Eneida Martinez, ultimately had their case rejected by several lower courts, but they appealed and won, and earned their chance to argue before the state’s seven top judges.“It seems there’s an unwillingness to prosecute,” remarked Atty. Cameron Atkinson, who represented the interests of Fight Voter Fraud Inc., and the three Bridgeport voters who are petitioning a judge to issue an arrest warrant. “The statute of limitations is already running…what are we waiting for?” asked Atkinson. Last month, the State Elections Enforcement Commission sent criminal referrals to the Chief State’s Attorney’s Office relating to Wanda Geter. In June of 2023, they also sent criminal referrals to that office related to similar conduct that dates back to 2019. Those cases are all still pending. Atkinson pleaded his case on why the decades old Connecticut State Statute 9-368 should be enforced. The law effectively says ‘We The People’ can compel a judge to issue an arrest warrant for a violation of election law. The Hon. Andrew McDonald responded with skepticism. He questioned if forcing the arrest of Geter and Martinez would actually be counterproductive to ongoing state investigations. The justices will likely take a few weeks before issuing a written ruling. Fight Voter Fraud said that if they lose, they’ll likely switch their focus from the judicial system to demanding election reform from the legislature.</span></p>

Grimes, reached Monday night by the Kentucky Lantern, said, “After years of investigation, the Franklin Circuit Court has finally put to rest baseless allegations of ethics violations.” She called the judge’s order “a victory for my staff, my administration and our work.” The commission said it is reviewing the order and would decide whether to appeal. It had said in November 2021 that Grimes must pay $10,000 in fines for two ethical violations pertaining to handling of voter data. Shepherd, in his 33-page order released April 29, agreed with Grimes’ arguments that the commission’s charges were barred by the five-year statute of limitations and that the record did not support a finding of any violations of the state executive branch’s code of ethics. The commission had charged that Grimes violated the ethics code by sharing voter information without requiring an Open Records request or other “established process of government.” Grimes submitted that all the voter data at issue was information in the public domain, that she had full legal authority and discretion as secretary of state to access and share such information. She claimed no statute or regulation was violated by the sharing of such public information.  Shepherd faulted the Ethics Commission for not conducting an evidentiary hearing in the case to hear testimony from witnesses.</span></p>

A group of Black Louisiana voters, who started an earlier phase of this legal fight and are represented by the Legal Defense Fund and other civil rights groups, said in a court filing that they plan to appeal the lower court&#8217;s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. This legal battle could help determine the balance of power in the next Congress and set up an opportunity for the Supreme Court to revisit the constitutionality of one of the key remaining parts of the embattled Voting Rights Act, which has been weakened by the high court&#8217;s conservative majority over the past decade. In a 2-1 decision released on Tuesday, the three-judge court found that the map of voting districts — which Louisiana&#8217;s state legislature drew during a January special session with two majority-Black districts to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act — violates the Constitution, ruling in favor of a group of self-described &#8220;non-African American&#8221; voters who argued that the state engaged in racial gerrymandering. &#8220;The predominant role of race in the State&#8217;s decisions is reflected in the statements of legislative decision-makers, the division of cities and parishes along racial lines, the unusual shape of the district, and the evidence that the contours of the district were drawn to absorb sufficient numbers of Black-majority neighborhoods to achieve the goal of a functioning majority-Black district,&#8221; wrote U.S. District Judge David Joseph and Judge Robert Summerhays, both appointees of former President Donald Trump, in the majority opinion for the case known as Callais v. Landry.</span></p>

Morris issued a preliminary injunction that blocks state officials from enforcing the part of</span><a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20231&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=HB&amp;P_BILL_NO=892&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ="><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 892</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that implemented law saying a person could not purposefully remain registered to vote in more than one place at a time, and requiring a person to note their prior voter registration on their application to register to vote at their new address in Montana — lest they face criminal penalties. Morris heard arguments on the request for a preliminary injunction on March 20. The Montana Public Interest Research Group and Montana Federation of Public Employees challenged the law in federal court last fall, saying the portion of it that contains the new requirements —</span><a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0130/chapter_0350/part_0020/section_0100/0130-0350-0020-0100.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Montana Code Annotated § 13-35-210(5)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — violate the U.S. Constitution because they are too vague and broad. Another group is challenging the same provisions of HB 892 in state district court and is awaiting a judge’s decision in Gallatin County. Morris sided with the plaintiffs on nearly every argument. “The court determines that HB 892 has frustrated the purpose of both MontPIRG and MFPE to the extent that HB 892’s multiple registration prohibition and prior registration disclosure requirement perceptibly impair plaintiff’s ability to navigate and advise on the Montana voter registration process,” Morris wrote in finding the organizations had standing in the case. Morris shot down the argument about changing election laws too close to an election by saying courts have upheld changes within 33 days of an election before, and noting the primary election was 47 days from when the injunction hearing occurred and 196 days from the General Election. Morris also took into account Ravalli County Clerk and Recorder Regina Plettenberg’s testimony in the Gallatin County case, in which she said the Secretary of State’s Office had advised elections administrators that HB 892 would leave election administrators’ practices unchanged. “The court determines that limited injunctive relief likely will not significantly impact election procedures in Montana that appear to be unchanged by HB 892,” Morris wrote.</span></p>

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Faith Genser of Zelienople and Frank Matis, of Center Township, who both submitted provisional ballots for the May primary elections after their mail-in ballots were rejected. Their mail-in ballots were not secured in secrecy envelopes, so provisional ballots were cast to compensate for their errors. However, the ACLU&#8217;s legal team said Butler County did not accept their provisional ballots. &#8220;Butler County has advised other voters who made errors on their mail ballots that they can remedy those errors, and one of those remedies is to vote a provisional ballot,&#8221; said Marian Schneider, senior policy counsel. &#8220;There should be no different treatment because these voters forgot their secrecy envelopes.&#8221; She said the ACLU won a similar case in Delaware County last year. &#8220;The ACLU believes the provisional ballots should be counted. They were otherwise valid. These are two eligible registered voters in Butler County, and they should not be denied their right to vote,&#8221; Schneider said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has declined a </span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/3rd-circuit-rejects-request-by-voting-rights-groups-to-reargue-undated-ballots-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request by voting rights groups to reconsider t</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">he decision to uphold Pennsylvania’s requirement for voters to write the date on mail-in ballots. A panel of the 3rd Circuit ruled in March that Act 77, which gave voters the option of casting ballots by mail without an excuse, does not violate a federal prohibition on disenfranchising voters over inconsequential paperwork errors. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania petitioned the court to reargue the case before a larger panel of judges. In a three-page order on Tuesday, Circuit Judge Thomas L. Ambro said a majority of the 14-judge court had voted against rehearing the case. ACLU-PA spokesperson Ian Pajer-Rogers said Tuesday the organizations, which include the Pennsylvania State Conference of NAACP Branches, the League of Women Voters, and Make the Road Pennsylvania, are reviewing their options.</span></p>

The lawsuit was originally filed in 2023 and was dismissed in March 2024 after a Nashville judge ruled in favor of Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett. The judge dismissed the lawsuit due to a lack of standing, which meant the plaintiffs were unable to show they were directly hurt by the law. Victor Ashe, a longtime Republican and the former mayor of Knoxville, and Phil Lawson, a longtime Democrat and businessman, originally filed the lawsuit in 2023. They were joined the League of Women Voters of Tennessee in hopes the laws would be declared unconstitutional and for a judge to say the laws violated their First Amendment rights. On May 1, Ashe and Lawson revived the lawsuit and filed a revised version that included two new plaintiffs they believe will resolve the issue of standing. The revised lawsuit names Phillip Lawson, a Knox County real estate developer and Democrat who has served on several local nonprofit boards, and Gabe Hart, a Madison County educator and op-ed writer for the Tennessee Lookout who publicly documented being challenged and intimidated for voting in a Republican primary in Tennessee as a progressive. The lawsuit challenges two portions of state voting law. One section has not been enforced and requires voters to declare party affiliation or show &#8220;bona fides&#8221; to vote in a primary election. Another section was recently added to state law that requires signs to be posted at all polling places to warn voters they could be prosecuted for not showing their &#8220;bona fide&#8221; party affiliation.</span></p>

Last month, Crystal Mason’s illegal voting conviction was overturned by the Second Court of Appeals. Now the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office is asking the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to reverse that ruling. Mason was convicted in 2018 of illegal voting in district court. Prosecutors maintained that Mason read and signed an affidavit accompanying the provisional ballot affirming that she had “fully completed” her sentence if convicted of a felony. But the Second Court of Appeals ruled that even if she read the words on the affidavit, she may not have known that being on probation for a previous felony conviction left her ineligible to vote in 2016. Tommy Buser-Clancy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which has been one of Mason’s representatives in the case, said in a statement that the request for further review of Mason’s case was “disappointing,” but they were “confident that justice will ultimately prevail.”</span></p>
