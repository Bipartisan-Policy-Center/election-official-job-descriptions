							<h2>In Focus This Week </h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>BPC Resource Roundup</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared Election Security Practices and More</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Grace Klinefelter, project association<br />
Bipartisan Policy Center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPC’s Elections Project provides a roundup of their recent blogs, reports, and explainers on a range of topics that have been frequently discussed this election cycle and will continue to be over the next few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Common Election Security and Integrity Practices</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPC, Issue One, and the R Street Institute published an</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/united-in-security-state-vote-protections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explainer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting key data and talking points on the security and integrity protections that are commonplace in jurisdictions across the country, including partisan balance among poll workers, post-election audits, and voter registration processes. The explainer is also available in</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/unidos-en-la-seguridad-como-cada-estado-protege-tu-voto/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spanish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Election Administration Workforce</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with scholars at UCLA, &#8220;</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/election-official-turnover-rates-from-2000-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Official Turnover Rates from 2000-2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; examined local election official turnover rates since 2000. Notably, the report shows that fears of a recent surge in turnover are somewhat overstated; turnover has been steadily increasing for at least two decades, and recent turnover is in line with this trend. The report also finds that despite turnover, election officials are well prepared to administer the 2024 election. New chief local election officials enter their positions with an average of eight years of experience, and they have training and staff to further prepare them for the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Absentee and Mail Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPC’s “</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/mail-voting-is-safe-secure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail Voting is Safe and Secure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; explains the history of voting by mail, maps state-specific mail voting laws, and answers frequently asked questions about mail ballots and the vote-by-mail experience. The blog is also available in</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/mail-voting-is-safe-secure-es/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spanish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/mail-voting-is-safe-and-secure-vn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vietnamese</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/mail-voting-is-safe-and-secure-cn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chinese</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What to Know about Noncitizen Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noncitizen voting in U.S. elections is top of mind for media, policymakers, and the public ahead of the general election. BPC outlined facts on noncitizen voting and recommendations to strengthen the security and accuracy of voter lists in two recent analyses (</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/four-things-to-know-about-noncitizen-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key takeaways include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizenship is already a requirement to vote in U.S. elections. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to use a common voter registration form which includes an attestation under penalty of perjury that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noncitizen voting is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence that voting by noncitizens has ever been widespread enough to impact the outcome of an election, and any instances of illegal voting, including by noncitizens, is routinely investigated and prosecuted. The Heritage Foundation’s Election Fraud Database found only</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?combine=citizenship&amp;state=All&amp;year=&amp;case_type=All&amp;fraud_type=All&amp;page=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 24 instances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of noncitizen voting between 2003 and 2023.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administrators have safeguards in place to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote. States check voter registration information against state and federal databases (such as those maintained by the Social Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or state departments of motor vehicles) to ensure that identifying information submitted on voter registration forms is accurate and legitimate. This hinders those who may attempt to register to vote using fraudulent or false information.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a federal crime for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. Illegal voting in a federal election can result in a fine and imprisonment, and a noncitizen found guilty of intentionally registering or voting may face deportation and revocation of their legal status.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving voter list accuracy is important. There are a number of steps the federal government and state governments can take to improve the accuracy of voter lists and citizenship checks. The federal government could expand election officials’ access to federal citizenship data in databases like the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. State governments could adopt REAL ID standards and improve data sharing between state departments of motor vehicles and election offices.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communications and the Information Environment<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A BPC and Morning Consult survey explored Americans’ election information habits, the results of which were published in a February report, “</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/who-voters-trust-election-information-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Voters Trust for Election Information in 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” The survey found that while Americans look to election officials for information about how, where, and when to vote, they more often turn to the news media, commentators, and candidates to learn about election results and other election-related information. The survey also found that most Americans have confidence in the upcoming presidential election, though they are more confident that votes in their community and state will be counted accurately than votes across the country (see results from a similar survey conducted in</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/new-survey-data-election-information/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><strong>A Resource Hub for U.S. Elections<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPC has compiled a new elections</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/election-resources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resource hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for concise, factual, and easy-to-share information on topics including the Electoral College, ballot curing, election observers, and more.</span></p>

							<h2>New From the Center for Democracy and Technology</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Generating Confusion </strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress-Testing AI Chatbot Responses on Voting with a Disability</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Democracy and Technology released a new report, </span><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/brief-generating-confusion-stress-testing-ai-chatbot-responses-on-voting-with-a-disability/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generating Confusion: Stress-testing AI Chatbot Responses on Voting with a Disability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11835" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CDTAIReport-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CDTAIReport-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CDTAIReport-1024x487.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CDTAIReport-768x365.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CDTAIReport-1536x730.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CDTAIReport.png 1582w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In 2024, the growth in popularity and availability of chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI) introduces a new and largely untested vector for election-related information and, as our research found, misinformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many communities are concerned that digitally available misinformation will impact the ability of community members to vote, including the disability community. However, up until this point, there has been little research done surrounding the integrity of the online information environment for voters with disabilities, and even less focus on the quality and integrity of information relating to voting with a disability that one can receive from a generative AI chatbot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters, both with and without disabilities, may use chatbots to ask about candidates or ask practical questions about the time, place, and manner of voting. An inaccurate answer to a simple question, such as how to vote absentee, could impede the user’s exercise of  their right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report seeks to investigate how chatbots respond to questions that voters may ask chatbots this year, including practical questions about the time, place, and manner of voting. To date, there has been little research about how the quality and integrity of information from Generative AI may affect voters, let alone those with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the research found, these chatbots are a vector for election-related and disability-related misinformation that could impede users from exercising their right to vote or undermine voters’ confidence in the election itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDT tested five chatbots on July 18th, 2024: Mixtral 8x7B v0.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 2 70b. Across 77 prompts, we found that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">61% of responses had at least one type of insufficiency. Over one third of answers included incorrect information, making it the most common problem we observed. Incorrect information ranged from relatively minor issues (such as broken web links to outside resources) to egregious misinformation (including incorrect voter registration deadlines and falsely stating that election officials are required to provide curbside voting).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every model hallucinated at least once. Each one provided inaccurate information that was entirely constructed by the model, such as describing a law, a voting machine, and a disability rights organization that do not exist.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quarter of responses could dissuade, impede, or prevent the user from exercising their right to vote. Every chatbot gave multiple responses to this effect, including inaccurately describing which voting methods are available in a given state, and all five did so in response to prompts about internet voting and curbside voting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two thirds of responses to questions about internet voting were insufficient, and 41% included incorrect information. Inaccuracies about internet voting ranged from providing incorrect information about assistive technology, to erroneously saying electronic ballot return is available in states where it is not (like Alabama) and, inversely, that it is not available in states where it is (like Colorado and North Carolina).  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots are vulnerable to bad actors. They often rebuffed queries that simulated use by bad actors, but in some cases responded helpfully, providing information about conspiracy theories and arguments for why people with intellectual disabilities should not be allowed to vote.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses often lacked necessary nuance. Chatbots did not provide crucial caveats about when polling places would be fully accessible, and misunderstood key terms like curbside and internet voting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked to provide authoritative information, a positive use case for chatbots, almost half of answers included incorrect information. The scope of inaccuracies included incorrect webpage names and links and a recommendation for users to seek assistance from an organization that does not exist. This is particularly concerning because using chatbots as a starting point for finding other sources of information is an important and frequently recommended use case.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outright bias or discrimination were exceedingly rare, and models often used language that was expressly supportive of disability rights.</span></li>

As observed through multiple election cycles, foreign actors and cybercriminals continue to spread false information through various platforms to manipulate public opinion, discredit the electoral process, and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions. The FBI and CISA <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png" alt="" width="189" height="180" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" />continue to work closely with federal, state, local, and territorial election partners and provide services and information to safeguard U.S. voting processes and maintain the resilience of the U.S. elections. “This PSA is to educate people that false claims of election infrastructure compromise, like a voter registration database hack, may be spread by foreign actors and to not accept claims of intrusion at face value, as these claims may be meant to influence public opinion and negatively impact the American people’s confidence in our democratic process,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley.” &#8220;The FBI continues to investigate any claims of malicious cyber actors&#8217; attempts to target U.S. elections,” said FBI Cyber Division, Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser. “Through our investigations, the FBI has identified that malicious actors commonly attempt to undermine public confidence in US elections by grossly exaggerating about obtaining U.S. voter information. Today’s announcement urges the American public to critically evaluate claims of hacked or leaked voter information and remember that most voter registration information is available to the public. We at the FBI remain committed to continuing to share information to counter false claims and help election officials further secure election processes.&#8221;</span></p>

Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails. There is currently no information indicating those <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />recipients replied. Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump’s campaign to U.S. media organizations. This malicious cyber activity is the latest example of Iran’s multi-pronged approach, as noted in the joint August statement, to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process.  As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible. Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. In particular, Russia, Iran, and China are trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability. Efforts by these, or other foreign actors, to undermine our democratic institutions are a direct threat to the U.S. and will not be tolerated.

The number of major national partners supporting the holiday has grown dramatically, by 42%, since the last presidential election. The number of local community partners grew by over 20%, setting another record. The holiday is a unique collaboration between election officials, media companies, celebrity voices, nonprofits, and community partners across the nation. “We’re glad to have every major election official association backing the holiday to instill confidence in the voting process and help more Americans get registered for this record-breaking year,” states Sec. of State Steve Simon of Minnesota, who co-chairs the holiday’s Steering Committee with Sec. Michael Adams of Kentucky.  “We applaud NASS, NASED, Election Center, and the EAC for being a driving force behind the holiday.  The holiday also received a</span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/09/16/a-proclamation-on-national-voter-registration-day-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> White House proclamation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday and a</span><a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/press-release-5-week-countdown-to-national-voter-registration-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bi-partisan resolution from the U.S. Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July.

We’re also breaking records with over 5,500 Community Partners, including local nonprofits, LWV chapters, libraries, colleges, and others, that are helping register voters in their own communities.” Previous records set in 2020 were 107 and 4,589 respectively.</span></p>

The board “denounces the actions of the State Election Board to introduce new rules within 90 days of the critical November 2024 General Election” and called for the board to self-impose a stay of the rule changes. The timing of the new rules was opposed by Athens-Clarke election&#8217;s board, which is chaired by Rocky Raffle. The introduction of new rules at this stage would create unnecessary confusion among the public and the “dedicated poll workers and elections officials who are critical to ensuring a smooth and efficient voting process,” according to the resolution.

In an effort to recruit more poll workers and preferably younger poll workers, the Secretary of State’s Office formed a partnership with the Kentucky Guild of Brewers to help get the word out.  The campaign, “SOS From Your SOS,” is now being carried by four Kentucky breweries. Together they designed beer labels that solicit volunteers to work the polls and encourage Kentuckians to register to vote.  The labels have QR codes directing people to govoteky.com where they can register to vote and apply to be a poll worker. “Last year I testified to the legislature that we had a poll worker crisis in Kentucky,” Adams said. “COVID-19 certainly hasn’t helped.  We need younger generations to step up and be good citizens, and so we enlisted the help of Kentucky’s craft breweries to reach them.” He said they put the idea together over the summer, designed the logo in house and are grateful for the brewery partners for helping get the word out. Charley Hamilton, owner of Dreaming Creek Brewery, said he jumped at the chance to get involved.  &#8220;We, along with several other microbreweries around the Commonwealth, were eager to help support the initiative, by getting custom labels to help promote and make the information easily accessible through QR codes,&#8221; Hamilton said.  &#8220;With COVID-19 still a strong concern going into voting season, poll workers are in short supply.  This initiative will hopefully bring attention to this and get some new folks to help out working the polls come voting time.”</span></p>

The art installation of four giant voting booths with three flamingos voting entitled “VOTE!” is designed to convey both Florida and the elections operations taking place inside. “Even though VOTE! is a light-hearted image with flamingos, it illustrates the humanity of voting wherein each individual gets to express what is in their heart and mind,” artist Matthew Mazzotta’s website explains. “While all three flamingos stand in identical voting booths, they are voting in their unique way — One flamingo has its head down deep in thought, while the other two flamingos are sizing each other up or trying to see who the other one is voting for. The brightly-colored flamingos of VOTE! are designed to appeal to people from all age groups, serving as a whimsical and educational landmark.” The county set aside about $75,000 in the budget for the new facility for the artwork and solicited proposals from all over the country. Since moving in, Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link has heard plenty of reactions to the voting flamingos. “I’ve heard a little bit of everything. I would say most people really like them,” Link said, adding that a few people offer a joke about the birds, mocking them for a similarity to the logo used by a large and well known state agency. “Some say I thought this was the lottery office.”</span></p>

The City of Worcester Cultural Development Division, along with the Election Commission called for different sticker designs from local artists, ranging from professional designers to schoolchildren, containing the phrase &#8220;My vote counts&#8221; or &#8220;Your vote counts.&#8221; The stickers contain the phrase in several different languages. Five of the 10 are in English, two are in Spanish and one each is in Portuguese, Mandarin and Twi, a language spoken in Ghana. The designs were chosen to represent the various different backgrounds of the people of Worcester, and the immigrants who have come to the city to eventually participate in democracy. The winners were chosen through polling of the submitted designs on the city&#8217;s Facebook page. More than 1,500 votes were cast to narrow a list of 22 semifinalists down to the final 10.</span></p>

Next steps on government funding are uncertain. Lawmakers are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund federal agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a partial shutdown when that budget year begins Oct. 1. The vote was 220-202, with 14 Republicans and all but three Democrats opposing the bill. Johnson, who said after the vote he was “disappointed,” will likely pursue a Plan B to avoid a partial shutdown, though he was not yet ready to share details. “We’ll draw up another play and we’ll come up with a solution,” Johnson said. “I’m already talking to colleague about their many ideas. We have time to fix the situation and we’ll get right to it.” Requiring new voters to provide proof of citizenship has become a leading election-year priority for Republicans raising the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S., even though it’s already illegal to do so and research has shown that such voting is rare. Opponents say that such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans who do not have a birth certificate or passport readily available when they get a chance to register at their school, church or other venues when voter registration drives occur. House Democrats said the proof of citizenship mandate should not be part of a bill to keep the government funded and urged Johnson to work with them on a measure that can pass both chambers.</span></p>

Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, would allow people who are blind, disabled, or unable to read or write to designate another individual to deliver an absentee voter application, or the ballot itself, to an election manager to be considered during an election. “I have a lot of seniors in my district, about five senior living apartment complexes, and I often get calls from those seniors for help with absentee voting,” Clarke said in an interview Wednesday. “I will often deliver an application to them so that they can submit that to the absentee election manager’s office for an absentee ballot.” Under the bill, a person with a disability must designate a person to deliver the application at least five days before an election. The legislation also allows a disabled individual to designate a person to deliver the ballot to the election manager in person or place the ballot in an envelope to be mailed to the election manager by the time of the election. HB 31 is part of a set of proposals from Democratic lawmakers who want to extend opportunities to vote for a larger part of the electorate as the state has imposed greater restrictions on voting in the name of election security and integrity.</span></p>

One of the new laws,</span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2839"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AB 2839,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to curb manipulated content that could harm a candidate’s reputation or or public confidence in an election’s outcome, with the exception of parody and satire.

The Michigan Voting Rights Act will not only build on the federal Voting Rights Act but will add new protections at the state level to shield us from future attacks on our democracy. “Thank you to Senators Camilleri, Moss, Chang, and Geiss for their leadership in this effort and thank you to the Michigan Senate for leading the way and passing this important legislation.

The city has used </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/bloomington-uses-ranked-choice-voting-for-city-races-now-voters-will-decide-whether-to-keep-it/601145523"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked-choice voting </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the past two elections, but in November voters will see a ballot question asking if they want to repeal that system. Members of Residents for a Better Bloomington, the group leading the repeal effort, say the method is confusing and undermines voters’ faith in the system. Supporters, meanwhile, say the system gives voters more choices and reduces acrimony in politics. Top Bloomington city staff say they’re not taking a stance on which method the city should use. “Whatever the voters choose is what the city is going to report and implement,” said Bloomington City Clerk Jamy Hanson, whose office oversees elections. The suburb of about 90,000 people adopted ranked-choice voting in 2020. Both supporters and opponents acknowledge it’s difficult to pinpoint whether ranked-choice voting changed the outcome of Bloomington races, in part because there’s not a definitive way to know who would have won the primary and competed in the general election under the old system. Of the 10 most recent Bloomington races, six were decided in the first round and four were tabulated using ranked-choice voting methods.</span></p>

Chris Sununu (R) signed a bill that requires </span><a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2024/09/12/sununu-definitely-leaning-towards-signing-voter-id-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identification to vote without exceptions and hard proof of U.S. citizenship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for first-time New Hampshire voters to register, a major reversal of his earlier position against it. “We have a proud tradition and proven track record of conducting elections that are trusted and true,” he said in a statement. “Looking forward to the next decade or two, this legislation will instill even more integrity and trust in the voting process.” HB 1569 requires voters to produce a photo ID on Election Day or be barred from voting. It eliminates the current law that allows people who show up to vote without photo ID to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity under penalty of perjury.  And it requires that people voting in New Hampshire for the first time produce documentary evidence of their U.S. citizenship through a passport, birth certificate, or other document in order to register to vote. The bill will take effect Nov. 11, and will not affect the upcoming Nov. 5 general election. Sununu’s decision to sign the bill is a change in position. For months, as HB 1569 advanced through the legislative process, Sununu suggested he would not support it, stating multiple times that he was “not looking into making significant changes in voting laws.”  “I think our system works well, we have really high voter turnout, the affidavit ballot and process seems to be working pretty darn well,” he said in March.  In the interview just after the Republican Unity Breakfast, Sununu acknowledged his previous skepticism of the bill. “I didn’t love it,” he said. But he added that that position has changed.</span></p>

City Clerk Kaitlyn Bernarde says the protections and penalties are designed to mirror a state law that was passed earlier this year but won’t go into effect until next July. The ordinance would protect some 150 poll workers from “physical threats and violence. “[The state law] doesn’t go into effect until next July so we are looking to update our local ordinance to include this protection until the state statute goes into effect,” added Bernarde. Council President Lisa Rasmussen and District 10 Alder Lou Larson agreed the need for the ordinance is sad given the heated nature of politics at all levels. The proposal passed the committee on a unanimous voice vote. The local ordinance creates a civil forfeiture, or fine, for anyone found to have harassed or intimidated a poll worker or clerk. It would come off the books on June 30th, with the state statute going into effect on July 1st. Bernarde notes that the ordinance would cover the Presidential election on November 5th along with the April 2025 non-partisan election and any potential February 2025 primary. The City Council will consider the measure on Tuesday, September 24th.</span></p>

Florida-based Smartmatic is suing Newsmax, claiming the cable network’s hosts and guests made false and defamatory statements after the election implying that Smartmatic participated in rigging the results, and that its software was used to switch votes. Newsmax, also based in Florida, argues that it was simply reporting on serious and newsworthy allegations being made by Trump and his supporters. Attorneys for both sides asked Davis to rule in their favor without holding a trial, which is scheduled to start Sept. 30. “Statements regarding Smartmatic software or voting machines altering the results of the election are factually false,” wrote Davis, who noted that Smartmatic did not provide any election machines or software used in the 2020 election outside of Los Angeles. However, the judge said that not every allegedly defamatory statement published by Newsmax, including statements about Smartmatic’s ties to Venezuela and its late president Hugo Chavez, has been shown to be materially false. “Therefore, the court will allow Newsmax to contest falsity as to Smartmatic’s connections with Venezuela,” he wrote. In court papers, Newsmax has described Smartmatic as “a struggling election technology company with a checkered history” that is using a legally baseless and unconstitutional theory of liability to try to obtain a massive windfall.</span></p>

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama alleges that Allen’s initiative breaches several provisions of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and Voting Rights Act of 1965. The lawsuit also alleges that the action violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it discriminates against naturalized citizens and eligible voters that the Secretary of State’s Office identified. “The framing of the announcement, and the description of the voter roll purge process that Secretary Allen described in that Aug. 13 release gave us immediate concern that there was some unlawful purging activity going on here,” said Jess Unger in an interview Monday, a senior staff attorney for voting rights with the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs, who include the League of Women Voters of Alabama and the Alabama Coalition of Immigrant Justice, argue  that Allen’s action violates provisions of the NVRA, enacted by the federal government in 1993. The lawsuit alleges that Allen, through the news release, initiated a new program within 84 days of the election, less than the 90 days mandated by the NVRA.</span></p>

The court, in a split 4-1 decision, upheld Anchorage Superior Court Judge Ian Wheeles’ decision to dismiss a lawsuit by the Alaska Democratic Party that had challenged Hafner’s eligibility. The decision means Hafner will appear on the November U.S. House ballot alongside incumbent Democrat Rep. Mary Peltola, Republican challenger Nick Begich, and Alaskan Independence Party challenger John Wayne Howe. It also means that election preparations, including ballot printing and distribution, will continue on a previously published schedule. “We would just thank the Supreme Court for issuing a decision on such short notice and preventing any disruption to the election,” said Solicitor General Jessie Alloway, assistant attorney general Thomas Flynn and assistant attorney general Kate Demarest, who opposed the lawsuit on behalf of the Alaska Division of Elections. Under Alaska’s elections system, the top four finishers from the primary election advance to the general election. Hafner finished sixth, but two higher-finishing Republicans withdrew from the race, allowing Hafner to advance.</span></p>

The state incorrectly marked these voters when they registered to vote as already having provided documented proof of U.S. citizenship, when really, it’s unclear whether they have, Fontes said. The error stems from the way the Motor Vehicle Division provides driver’s license information to the state’s voter registration system. The voters affected by this particular error are people who first obtained their Arizona driver’s license before October 1996 and then were issued a duplicate replacement before registering to vote sometime after 2004, according to Fontes. According to Votebeat, it’s unclear why no one noticed the error sooner, Fontes said, but it’s been occurring for roughly two decades and over four administrations.ate. In his</span><a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/201/2024_09_18_05270861-0-0000-ArizonaSecretaryOfStateAdrianF.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Fontes advocated for preserving the status quo during the election and verifying citizenship statuses afterwards. Election deadlines are around the corner, wrote his attorney, Craig Morgan, and introducing new requirements this late in the year will only cause confusion and chaos. Ballots for military and overseas voters are set to be mailed this Saturday, and the last day to register to vote is Oct. 7, just two weeks away. Early voting begins on Oct. 9. On top of that, Fontes added, there’s no reason to suspect that the majority of the 97,000 are noncitizens. In fact, most of the evidence points to most of them being in the country lawfully and being eligible to vote. Republicans backed Fontes’ argument, urging the court to keep things the way they’ve been for the past 20 years. Attorney Andrew Gould, representing the Arizona Republican Party in an</span><a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/201/2024_09_18_05270831-0-0000-BriefOfArizonaRepublicanPartyA.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told the justices that preventing the voters from receiving full ballots would violate federal protections.</span></p>

State lawmakers in May approved an emergency rule drafted by the Arkansas Board of Election Commissioners that requires a “wet signature,” meaning signing with a pen, on voter registration applications unless they’re completed at state agencies, like the DMV. In June, voter advocacy group Get Loud Arkansas challenged the rule with a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against Secretary of State John Thurston, the Arkansas State Board of Election Commissioners and the county clerks of Benton, Pulaski and Washington counties.  Additional plaintiffs include Vote.Org, a national voter registration-focused nonprofit, and two Arkansans who had their voter registration applications rejected because they had an electronic signature — Nikki Pastor and Trinity “Blake” Loper. U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks said he issued a preliminary injunction on Aug. 29 because requiring that voter registration applications be signed with a “wet signature” likely violates the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and will cause plaintiffs irreparable harm.  Defendants in the case filed an appeal with the Eighth Circuit on Sept. 4. According to Friday’s order, the district court’s preliminary injunction is administratively stayed pending a ruling by the Eighth Circuit “on Appellants’ motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending disposition of this appeal.”</span></p>

The lawsuit, filed in the federal Middle District of Florida, focuses on the process for verifying voter registration applicants’ eligibility. Prospective voters are deemed eligible by election officials if certain identifying information entered into the state’s voter registration system lines up with data maintained by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or the federal Social Security Administration. Applicants whose information does not produce an “exact match” are not allowed to vote “unless they overcome burdensome bureaucratic hurdles,” the lawsuit said. The process “not only places the burden of verification on Black voters, it further disenfranchises Black eligible voters,” lawyers representing Florida Rising Together, the plaintiff, wrote in the lawsuit. The group is a nonprofit “dedicated to advancing economic and racial justice across Florida by building power in historically marginalized communities,” according to the lawsuit. The state’s process is flawed, in part, because the federal database used to verify voter registration “is widely known to routinely produce false and inconsistent results,” the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit also said “more than 43,000 individuals who submitted otherwise valid voter registration applications to Florida election officials since 2018 across 26 Florida counties have never been able to register to vote successfully solely due to the ‘exact match’ requirement.”</span></p>

Frazier and Ferguson filed the lawsuit in August in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. The lawsuit said Fulton County violated state and federal laws by failing to routinely remove ineligible voters from its rolls. They also claimed the county had not acted on a recent challenge in a timely fashion. On Monday they filed a motion to withdraw the lawsuit. The duo’s attorney, James Elliott, wrote that he had determined they had “failed to meet a condition precedent for seeking relief” in the court. He did not elaborate, but he indicated the plaintiffs could refile the lawsuit later. In court records, Fulton County officials said they do remove ineligible records as required by law. Among other things, they say the county reviews Social Security Administration records and other documents every month to remove dead voters, checks court records to remove convicted felons and reviews change-of-address information to remove people who no longer live in Georgia.</span></p>

Such a provision, which the lawsuit argued is required by state law, &#8220;preserves the purity of elections and guards against abuses,&#8221; the RNC lawyers said. Angela Benander, a spokesman for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson&#8217;s office, which oversees the administration of elections in the state and issues guidance to local clerks, dismissed the lawsuit as raising an issue a short time before absentee ballots go out that could be easily dealt with as a &#8220;simple administration procedure&#8221; and said clerks have already been instructed to contact the Elections Division with any questions on how to handle the envelopes. &#8220;This lawsuit could have been an email,&#8221; Benander said. &#8220;This is not about the law, our processes or election administration. It’s about getting a headline that causes voters to doubt the integrity of our election processes. It’s an abuse of our judicial system and a waste of all our time.&#8221; The RNC&#8217;s latest lawsuit in Michigan notes that state law requires voters who request or automatically receive absentee voter ballots to sign the return envelopes they send back to their local clerk&#8217;s office for the ballot to count. The lawsuit argues that clerks or their workers must note on the envelope the day it was received. Then, separately, the clerk, after verifying that the signature on the envelope matches one already on file or on the voter&#8217;s absentee ballot application, must attach a written statement to the envelope, after the signature has been verified, that the ballot has been approved for tabulation.</span></p>

The suit, filed by the conservative group Minnesota Voters Alliance, argued that the new law is unconstitutional because it could open people up to prosecution for stating sincerely held false beliefs, like “felons do not have the right to vote.” The legislation was a target of conservative ire even before it passed. The group claimed that the law “subjects anyone who expresses controversial views about Minnesota election laws to criminal prosecution, civil litigation from any member of the public, and even prior restraint on their speech.” Brasel was unpersuaded. Brasel noted that the law allows for false statements to be prosecuted only if two conditions are met: the person making them knows they are false, and the statements are made with the intent to impede somebody from voting.</span></p>

The lawsuit was filed Sept. 12 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi Oxford Division by the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, the Legal Defense Fund and Harvard Election Law Clinic. Filed on behalf of the DeSoto County NAACP, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and two individuals, the lawsuit alleges that the current supervisor district map created in 2022 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. ACLU-MS said the map discriminates against Black DeSoto County residents and dilutes their voting power by splitting the majority-Black city of Horn Lake between supervisor districts 3 and 4. ACLU-MS citied statistics which it said showed a lack of representation for Black voters — though DeSoto&#8217;s population is more than 30% Black, none of the 25 county officials elected by the map&#8217;s district lines are Black. These include the Board of Supervisors, Board of Education, the Election Commission, the Justice Court and Constables.</span></p>

When the ACLU of Nevada staff member went to observe the ballot counting as a “nonpartisan observer,” they were denied access by the county clerk because the county implemented a policy limiting election observation to one observer per political affiliation, even when there’s space available.  “Through its observers, the ACLU of Nevada receives actionable information on issues that arise at the polling locations, gains an understanding of the election process in each county, and can assist voters who are prevented from casting their ballot,” the lawsuit reads.  The lawsuit argues that Nye County’s election observer policy — and the staff member’s denied entry to observe the elections process in June — violates state law and the Nevada Constitution. The ACLU of Nevada said in a release that the case “seeks to affirm the rights of Nevadans to uphold election transparency and prevent viewpoint discrimination in our democracy.”</span></p>

In addition to requiring all first-time voters to prove their citizenship with documentation in hand, the law also eliminates all exceptions for people who show up to vote without an identification. The lawsuit alleges the policies will disproportionately impact younger voters and college students, “who are less likely to have ready access to the limited set of documents with which they must now prove their citizenship.” It also cites the state’s own data showing prosecutions for voter fraud, including non-citizens participating in elections, are exceedingly rare.</span></p>

The Supreme Court said Commonwealth Court lacked authority to hear the case without the inclusion of each of Pennsylvania’s county boards of elections. It also said that naming Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt was insufficient to give the court jurisdiction over the voting groups’ claims.

The Republican National Committee in a Supreme Court filing on Tuesday argued that Ceisler’s decision to allow further proceedings was improper and exceeds the court’s authority. The Republicans asked the Supreme Court to enforce its order and dismiss the case. “Any further proceedings in this case not only contravene this Court’s Order, but also threaten to unleash ‘voter confusion,’ “chaos,’ … and an erosion of the public “[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes [that] is essential to the functioning of participatory democracy,” the RNC said in its filing.</span></p>

The federal lawsuit escalates a pre-election war between Republican state officials and Democratic urban county leaders over voter registration efforts and accuses Texas officials of violating the National Voter Registration Act. Developments in the ongoing battle continue unfolding as the Oct. 7 deadline to sign up to vote looms. “Today, Travis County, once again, fights back,” Travis County Attorney Delia Garza said during a press conference. The federal suit is in response to Paxton turning to state courts to try and block the county from mailing out voter registration applications to people identified as eligible voters who aren’t currently on the rolls. Travis County is home to Austin and has long been a Democratic stronghold in the state. Paxton’s lawsuit argued that the Texas Election Code did not grant a county officials the ability to collect information about private citizens to convince them to vote and claimed that such an effort is illegal. But Democrats, local leaders and election experts disagree with Paxton’s interpretation of state law. Travis officials allege Paxton violated Title 52 of the Voting Rights Act by trying to prevent them from carrying out their duties to promote people’s right to vote. They accuse Nelson of doing nothing to stop Paxton’s alleged unlawful conduct. They argue that the state law not only allows them to send out the applications, but also encourages them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State District Court Judge Antonia Arteaga </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/09/16/ken-paxton-bexar-county-voter-registration-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied a request by Attorney General Ken Paxton to block a Bexar County plan to mail voter registration forms </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to county residents ahead of the November election, saying the request was moot. Bexar County attorneys argued in a hearing before Judge Antonia Arteaga on Monday that there was no reason for the court to issue an injunction because the forms were mailed last week, according to the San Antonio Report. Paxton’s office submitted an updated request before the hearing asking that no additional letters be sent out. “The target of the mailing — qualified individuals who recently moved to or within Bexar County — have received those forms, and perhaps have already returned them,” said Bexar County Assistant Criminal District Attorney Robert W. Piatt III. Ryan Kercher, deputy chief of the special litigation division in the attorney general’s office, argued that the plan could result in ineligible people registering to vote. Paxton appealed the decision on Monday evening, claiming Bexar officials &#8220;expedited&#8221; the mail out to take place before the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nonprofit focused on increasing Latinos’ civic participation </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2024/09/14/texas-civic-group-wants-judge-to-block-ken-paxtons-investigation-into-voter-registration-efforts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued Attorney General Ken Paxton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal court last week so it could continue its voter registration efforts after the Republican official targeted them in an investigation last month. The organization Jolt said in its request for a temporary restraining order that Paxton’s investigation would irreparably harm the organization and its associates by disclosing personal information and potentially placing its workers, volunteers and associates in harm’s way. “If Jolt were forced to disclose confidential information to the Attorney General, it would be considered a betrayal of the trust that Jolt has earned from the Texas Latino community,” the organization’s lawyer, Mimi Marziani, wrote in the lawsuit. “It would make it more difficult for Jolt to associate with others and carry out its mission effectively, and it would likely put Jolt employees and others associated with the organization in danger.” In its lawsuit, Jolt said Paxton did not identify a reason why the nonprofit needed to provide the information and did not accuse the organization of any wrongdoing. The group also said Paxton did not obtain the permission or authority from a court to obtain the documents, instead asking for a “Request to Examine” under state law regulating the organization of businesses. If Jolt did not comply with the request, the nonprofit could forfeit the ability to do business in the state. The nonprofit said in its lawsuit that it is also a Class B misdemeanor to fail to comply with the request from the attorney general’s office.</span></p>

Filed on September 13, the suit states that the city didn’t allow 47 poll workers nominated by the Republican party and approved by the Racine Common Council to work the polls in August. The party nominated 55 people to serve as election workers in that election. “Despite being qualified, nominated, and appointed, the Plaintiffs were neither contacted by the City Clerk nor scheduled by the City Clerk to work as election inspectors for the August 13th Partisan Primary,” the lawsuit states.  The lawsuit names two people the party had nominated to work the polls but weren’t contacted by the city ahead of the election. It claims the Wisconsin Elections Commission has “repeatedly instructed municipal clerks that election inspectors nominated by the Democratic and Republican Parties must be given priority before any unaffiliated individuals are selected or scheduled to work polling locations as election inspectors.” In a statement, Racine City Clerk Tara McMenamin said the city is “committed to hiring election officials who meet all statutory requirements, irrespective of political affiliation.” “In anticipation of potential increases in meritless litigation leading up to the presidential election, we are steadfast in maintaining consistent standards,” the statement said. “We will continue to adhere to all state and federal laws and provide comprehensive training to ensure that all election officials are fully qualified and well prepared to serve City residents on this upcoming Election Day.”  The lawsuit asks that the two nominated poll workers who weren’t asked to work in August be included in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin’s District 2 Court of Appeals has agreed to hear Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s lawsuit </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/appeals-court-will-hear-rfk-jr-lawsuit-to-get-off-presidential-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking that his name be removed from the ballot i</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">n Wisconsin. The court, held by a conservative majority, ruled on Wednesday that it will hear the case, in which Kennedy is attempting to get off the ballot despite having filed nomination papers  in which more than 8,000 voters signed petitions stating they want him on the ticket.  The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) previously ruled that state law requires that candidates who have filed nomination papers and have qualified must be included on the ballot unless they die before Election Day. A Dane County judge ruled earlier this week against Kennedy’s effort. In its ruling accepting the case, the appeals court included a number of questions about the stickers it would like the parties in the lawsuit to answer in their briefs. The questions include if it matters that ballots with stickers on them have not been tested with voting equipment; if a candidate for a statewide office such as attorney general died and stickers were used, would those stickers need to be put on ballots statewide; and if election clerks have the discretion not to use the stickers if a candidate dies after ballots have been printed. The appeals court ruling orders that all briefs in the case be filed by September 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dane County Court court order will soon be </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/dane-county-judge-to-sign-revised-order-absentee-ballot-witness-addresses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated to reflect an earlier appeals court ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over when absentee ballots can be counted in Wisconsin. That’s after the state’s court of appeals sided mostly with a progressive group this summer when it agreed to a broader understanding of when a witness’ address is detailed enough for an absentee ballot to be counted. Under state law, absentee ballot envelopes must be signed by an adult witness who provides their address. But the law doesn’t define what that address should look like. Dane County Judge Ryan Nilsestuen settled on a broader definition, when he ruled in January of this year that a witness address is sufficient, as long as a “reasonable” member of the community can determine where the witness can be reached. GOP lawmakers appealed that ruling, but a state appeals court upheld most of Nilsestuen’s interpretation in July. The appeals panel differed, however, by determining that the reasonableness standard should be determined from the perspective of a “reasonable” municipal clerk, rather than a reasonable community member. On Monday, an attorney for RISE submitted a revised order to Nilsestuen, which reflects the changes ordered by the appeals court, when that three-judge panel sent the case back to Dane County. No one objected to the proposed order and, during a status hearing Monday, Nilsestuen said he plans to sign it.</span></p>

Yet many people don’t fully grasp what their job entails, leaving room for election deniers to spread misinformation. This lack of understanding has fueled a disturbing rise in threats, intimidation, and abuse against election officials since 2020. As we approach another critical election marked by rampant misinformation and attacks on democracy, it’s more important than ever to know the facts about election administration.

American elections have long been a model of freedom and fairness for democracies around the world, with a comprehensive system of checks and balances to ensure all votes are counted and election results are honored.  The Electoral Count Reform Act (ECRA) is one critical safeguard that ensures our presidential elections run smoothly. Congress passed the ECRA in 2022, updating the antiquated Electoral Count Act. The 2024 election will be the first presidential election utilizing the ECRA’s updated rules for finalizing the presidential election. The ECRA lays out the process and timeline for electing the president and vice president from Election Day to the Joint Session of Congress. Importantly, it also closes some of the ambiguous gaps in the prior 1887 law that governed the presidential election process. That is why it is so important that the public, media and elected officials alike are all informed about how the ECRA will work in practice. You&#8217;ll be the first to explore our forthcoming report, Electing the President: From Election Day to the Joint Session, with the experts who wrote it. The report explains the timeline and procedures that will guide the presidential election process. We&#8217;re excited to bring advocates and experts together to discuss the crucial role the ECRA will have in ensuring this year’s presidential election runs smoothly and deep dive into what the process will look like from 2024 forward. <strong>When:</strong> September 24. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</span></p>
