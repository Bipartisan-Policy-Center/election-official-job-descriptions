														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Countdown to November 5</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administration ballot measures</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in 18 states and the District of Columbia will make choices this year on how elections are administered in the future at the state level. With 25 different elections-related measures this is by far the most states and elections-related measures that voters have considered in more than a decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This cycle, statewide measures largely focus on </span><a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/management/2024/10/several-states-could-change-how-their-elections-are-run/400107/?oref=rf-homepage-river"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/infrastructure/2024/09/eight-states-vote-amendments-ban-noncitizen-voting/399940/?oref=rf-today-nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Route%20Fifty%20Today:%20October%201%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_rf_today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noncitizen voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and state primary systems (often included in the ranked choice voting ballot measure, but not exclusively). The others run the gamut from redistricting to voter ID to no-excuse absentee voting. </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/alaska-ranked-choice-voting-repeal-effort-outraised-a-hundredfold-campaign-finance-filings-show/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only state to have a ballot measure that would repeal a previous ballot measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the ballot measures faced court battles during the lead up to the election with the fight over Arizona’s Prop. 140 </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2024/10/05/proposition-140-open-primaries-ballot-measure-supreme-court-ruling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ending as recently as October 5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money has also been a big factor in some of the statewide ballot measures this year. In </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/alaska-ranked-choice-voting-repeal-effort-outraised-a-hundredfold-campaign-finance-filings-show/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group opposing the repeal of ranked choice voting has raised more than $12 million. The campaign to repeal it has raised roughly $120,000. </span><a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/10/16/proposition-131-colorado-spending-ballot-measures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voters First, the group backing Prop. 131 has raised $10.1 million, while the group opposing Prop. 131 has raised just $25,000, all from one donor. Reports from the </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/10/16/hundreds-of-thousands-spent-in-support-of-and-opposition-to-idahos-proposition-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State show Prop 1 supporters have raised $2.8M, while several political committees have spent hundreds of thousands to oppose it. Those supporting ranked choice voting in </span><a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2024/10/14/cash-pours-into-the-campaign-to-take-ranked-choice-voting-statewide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have raised more than $4 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also a number of local ballot measures related to election administration for voters to consider this year. Those range from allowing noncitizens to vote in one California city to repealing ranked choice voting in one Minnesota city to making officials nonpartisan in one Michigan city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alaska:</strong> </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballot Measure 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting (RCV) system that was adopted in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arizona:</strong> There are four elections-related ballot measures for Arizona voters to contemplate this year.  </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 133</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Require partisan primary elections for partisan offices and prohibit primary elections where all candidates, regardless of political party affiliation, run in the same primary election, such as top-two, top-four, and top-five primaries </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_134,_Signature_Distribution_Requirement_for_Initiatives_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 134</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Create a signature distribution requirement for citizen-initiated ballot measures based on state legislative districts </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_136,_Legal_Challenges_to_Constitutionality_of_Initiatives_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 136</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Provide for challenges to an initiative measure or constitutional amendment after the filing of the measure with the secretary of state; and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_140,_Single_Primary_for_All_Candidates_and_Possible_RCV_General_Election_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 140</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Require primaries in which candidates, regardless of partisan affiliation, appear on a single ballot and a certain number advance to the general election, and require general election candidates to receive a majority of votes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> There are no elections administration statewide measures in The Golden State this November, but voters in </span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12003592/santa-ana-voters-to-decide-on-whether-to-allow-non-citizens-to-vote-in-municipal-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Ana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will consider Measure DD on whether or not to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. If passed,</span><a href="https://publicdocs.santa-ana.org/WebLink/DocView.aspx?dbid=1&amp;id=140225&amp;page=1&amp;cr=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Measure DD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would amend Santa Ana’s municipal charter and allow non-citizen residents of the city, both documented and undocumented, to vote in all local elections. That includes mayoral and city council races, proposed sales tax increases on the ballot and municipal bond measures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut:</strong> </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Connecticut_No-Excuse_Absentee_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No-excuse absentee voting amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would authorize the state legislature to provide by law for no-excuse absentee voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(November_2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiative 83</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would establish ranked choice voting and allow Independents to vote in partisan primaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Idaho:</strong> </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_Constitutional_Amendment:_HJR_5,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional Amendment HRJ5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would amend the Idaho Constitution to provide that only a citizen of the United States can vote in the state. </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_Proposition_1,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposition 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would establish top-four primaries and ranked-choice voting for federal, state, and certain local offices in Idaho</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Illinois:</strong> Voters in The Prairie State will be weighing in on three </span><a href="https://www.wgem.com/2024/10/14/illinois-voters-weigh-potential-election-interference-penalties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-binding referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s including one asking whether candidates should face penalties if they try to interfere with election workers doing their job. The non-binding referendum asks voters: “Should any candidate appearing on the Illinois ballot for federal, State or local office be subject to civil penalties if the candidate interferes or attempts to interfere with an election worker’s official duties?&#8221; The referendum does not state what constitutes interference with an election worker’s official duties. It also does not specify specific civil penalties. Since it’s non-binding, Illinois law will not change regardless of how people vote. State lawmakers can, however, use the result as a guide for how to proceed and potentially pass legislation creating new civil penalties for interfering with an election worker doing their job. Illinois law currently makes it a Class 4 felony to tamper or interfere with voting machines. It’s a Class A misdemeanor to refuse to comply with a lawful order from an election authority. That law applies to anyone, not just candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the local level, </span><a href="https://www.oakpark.com/2024/10/14/oak-park-ranked-choice-voting-referendum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oak Park </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">residents will have the opportunity to vote to implement ranked choice voting for village board elections in a binding referendum. If the referendum in Oak Park passes, by a simple majority, RCV would be used to elect village board members beginning in April 2027. This includes village trustees and the village president, but not the village clerk, board of education members, park district commissioners, township trustees, county commissioners, or any other offices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kentucky_Constitutional_Amendment_1,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional Amendment 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit the state and local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michigan:</strong> In </span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2024/08/group-gets-2-proposals-on-ann-arbor-ballot-after-collecting-over-11000-signatures.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Arbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Coalition for Ann Arbor’s Future gathered enough petition signatures to put two proposed city charter amendments to voters Nov. 5. One proposal would make mayor and City Council races nonpartisan, while the other seeks to establish public campaign financing for those races, using city taxpayer funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Residents of </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/bloomington-uses-ranked-choice-voting-for-city-races-now-voters-will-decide-whether-to-keep-it/601145523"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will decide whether or not to repeal ranked choice voting in city elections. The city has used ranked-choice voting in the past two elections, but members of Residents for a Better Bloomington, the group leading the repeal effort, say the method is confusing and undermines voters’ faith in the system. “It’s an election integrity issue,” said David Clark, the group’s co-founder. Supporters, meanwhile, say the system gives voters more choices and reduces acrimony in politics. “There isn’t really any reason to repeal ranked-choice voting,” said Laura Calbone, with Vote No On Repeal, a group supported by FairVote Minnesota, which advocates for the system across the state. Bloomington is one of five Minnesota cities that use ranked-choice voting. Also in Minnesota, voters in </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/st-paul-voters-will-decide-whether-to-move-election-day-to-even-numbered-years/601153755"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Paul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will decide whether or not to move the city’s elections to an even-year cycle. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Montana:</strong> </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kentucky_Constitutional_Amendment_1,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Amendment_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CI-126</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would establish top-four primaries for federal and state offices in Montana and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Montana_CI-127,_Majority_Vote_Required_to_Win_Elections_Initiative_(2024)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CI-127</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require an electoral system in which candidates for certain offices must win a majority of the vote, rather than a plurality, to win the election.</span></p>

							<h2>Prebunking 2024</h2>
														<p><strong>UCSD study shows explaining complexity of counting ballots eases voter distrust</strong><br />
<em>Keep it simple and early</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Thad Kousser<br />
UC San Diego</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters are inherently skeptical of election results released after Election Night. But for many reasons, from the need for careful certification processes to varying state laws to coping with natural disasters, election administrators often need some days after Election Day to count many <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11975" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UCSanDiego-300x87.png" alt="" width="300" height="87" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UCSanDiego-300x87.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UCSanDiego.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />ballots.  This process makes plenty of sense – but voters don’t like, and often don’t trust, delays in results.  As a social scientist who studies election trust in partnership with several state and local jurisdictions around the nation, I was part of a research team that found a simple set of things election officials can do to build trust – if you have time to fit these in now, before Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s the bottom line from our recent study: simple messages explaining why election results might take time can, if presented before Election Day, can prevent voters’ decline in trust. Together with my colleagues Jennifer Gaudette and Seth Hill at UC San Diego, Mindy Romero (USC), and lead author Mackenzie Lockhart (Yale),</span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/10/pgae414/7815439"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our peer-reviewed research article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looked at what happens when you inform Americans that election results took multiple days to be reported in Arizona’s 2022 governor’s race. We find that:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Learning that votes took multiple days to count makes Americans less trusting, but…</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voters can be inoculated against this decline in trust through a factual message produced by election officials.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch the video: The message in</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6dR1Z7zu8U"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this video made for voters by the Arizona Secretary of State’s office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was simple, explaining the timeline for counting ballots, security measures to ensure each ballot is correctly tabulated, and the final canvass deadline dates. Similar videos tailored to other jurisdictions could be made inexpensively.  It might also be possible to have news media organizations transmit similar messages, for example by inviting local TV in for an interview in which an election administrator walks them through the process and explains how it works, why it is secure, and why it may require more time after Election Night for complete counting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we know this? We conducted a nationwide survey of eligible voters in the Spring of 2023 including over 10,000 Americans. Respondents were randomized into four groups:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group who only received information about the outcome of the 2022 Arizona governor’s race</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group who received information about the outcome and how long vote counting took</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group who was presented with an informational video about why vote counting might take time but only received information about the outcome</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group who was presented with an informational video about why vote counting might take time and were told how long vote counting took</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We examined the level of trust in each of these four groups, measured as the percentage who said they trusted the accuracy and integrity of Arizona elections “a lot” or “somewhat,” versus those who distrusted Arizona elections somewhat or a lot.  We then made two comparisons – the difference between those who heard about the slower vote counting and those who did not, and the difference between those who saw the pre-bunking video and those who did not. </span></p>
<p><strong>Results: Percent who report they trust elections in Arizona, by group.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11976" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-1.44.32 PM.png" alt="" width="774" height="218" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-1.44.32 PM.png 774w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-1.44.32 PM-300x84.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-1.44.32 PM-768x216.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can election officials act on these findings? Being transparent with voters and explaining why election results take time is critical. In cases where ballots can’t be counted on Election Day, clearly describing the process to voters in advance so they know what to expect and why the counting sometimes takes longer in some cases can reduce the impact of delays on trust and increase trust among all voters.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t the end of the story.  Our research will continue, because there are things we still don’t know, such as: How long do the effects of messaging last? What is going on in voters’ minds when they see the videos – do they really learn about why votes take time to count in Arizona? And what are the effects of messages like this when mixed with other messages voters see, including misinformation spreading unsubstantiated theories about fraud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research group and other scholars across the country are partnering with election officials to test these and other questions about voter trust during the 2024 election; you can read more about our work</span><a href="https://yankelovichcenter.ucsd.edu/strengthening-democracy/building-trust-in-elections.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at this website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the meantime, I wish you the smoothest October and November possible, high turnout, and satisfied voters.</span></p>

Officials in the </span><a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/15/hurricane-milton-florida-election-supervisors-vote-mail/75682640007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milton-affected counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are calling on Gov. Ron DeSantis to sign a new executive order allowing them to ease voting procedures for the General Election next month. Supervisors cited “excessive rain or tornadic activity” and said “such counties may need to be included in certain provisions of any Executive Order issued to ensure that there are no interruptions resulting from these impacts,” according to a letter signed by David Ramba, executive director of the Florida Supervisors of Elections (FSE). The letter says that polling locations have been destroyed or rendered inaccessible due to flooding and structural damage. The supervisors claim that power outages and disrupted communication lines hinder them from coordinating preparations and informing voters about changes to polling locations or procedures.

More than 400 early voting sites are in operation across the state&#8217;s 100 counties. &#8220;Western North Carolina will vote,&#8221; Karen Bell, the executive director of the </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/politics/north-carolina-rebuilds-election-infrastructure-in-counties-decimated-by-helene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state&#8217;s board of elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said on Tuesday.  In September, Helene knocked out power, washed out roads and left dozens of polling places unusable.  &#8220;The vast majority [of polling places] are going to be open and available to the voters in some shape or form,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;It might require a generator, it might require a porta-potty, but we are getting those sites open.&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/buncombe-county-helene-election/62602758"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buncombe County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director of Elections Corinne Duncan says there is a shift in voter needs following Hurricane Helene. She says in the last two weeks, voters voiced concerns about how they&#8217;ll be able to cast their vote in this year&#8217;s elections. &#8220;Voters did start reaching out very early. People and poll workers even showed up to our office on the Saturday afterward,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There has been a big increase in requests for absentee by mail. So we have about 14,000 requests just in Buncombe County.&#8221; In an attempt to make things easier for voters, Duncan says they will make a number of changes to early voting/ &#8220;[We&#8217;]ve expanded the hours on the weekends. We did that because there are a lot of people that don&#8217;t have power. We didn&#8217;t want our poll workers to be out late at night, and it&#8217;s very good for communication, which we&#8217;re having challenges with. It&#8217;s just 9 to 5 every single day, including weekends, until that last Saturday,&#8221; Duncan said.</span></p>

Voters in eighteen states may now vote in-person or in-person absentee. While a few jurisdictions have reported a decline in early voters compared to previous years, voters are lining up, literally, in other states to early vote. </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/10/15/georgias-early-voting-first-day-turnout-on-already-breaks-record/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which started early voting on Tuesday is breaking turnout records all over. By the end of the first day, 305,900 votes had been cast in person, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s datahub.  The first day early voting record is 136,000 votes cast in 2020. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his office’s goal at early voting sites and at the 2,400 polling places on Election Day is to have voters spend as little time as possible filling out their ballots. It took the average voter only a few minutes to cast a ballot on Tuesday morning. “We want to make sure that they’re less than an hour. We loved when we had in 2022 the average wait time was less than three minutes and got down as low as two minutes at times,” Raffensperger said. “This morning, there appeared to be no slowdowns and lines have been moving everyone in less (time) than that.” In <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/elections/idahoans-line-polls-early-voting-ada-county-general-election-nov-2024/277-c09bb822-6798-4c92-8eb3-debe82c7f8d7">Idaho</a>, </span>Ada County Clerk Trent Tripple said it&#8217;s been brisk. “Turnout has been really surprisingly good,” Tripple said. <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/10/16/iowans-line-up-to-cast-ballots-on-first-day-of-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were lined up all the way down the block waiting to enter the Polk County election office in Des Moines just before 8 a.m. Wednesday, the first day of early voting in Iowa for the 2024 general election. Once the doors opened, the line moved inside but voters waited about a half-hour to move to the counter to check in and get their ballots. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate encouraged Iowans to make a plan to vote in the upcoming election, either absentee voting or on Election Day. According to WOSU, early voting in central </span><a href="https://www.wosu.org/politics-government/2024-10-16/first-week-of-early-voting-brings-out-60-000-people-in-central-ohio-counties"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is nearly doubling in most area counties compared to the 2016 election, but is lagging behind the 2020 election, when many people voted absentee because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early voting began Wednesday in </span><a href="https://www.actionnews5.com/2024/10/17/1000s-shelby-co-voters-brave-long-lines-cast-ballots-day-1-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and lines were long in some locations—some voters waited close to an hour. “This is my first time voting at this location, so I was a little surprised. I’m encouraged by that; I love to see people voting,” said KT Lawton, one of the first voters in line at a Shelby County polling place. And while there have been lines and some waiting, overall there have been very few reports of problems. However, a <a href="https://stjohnsource.com/2024/10/15/elections-board-member-ordered-to-apologize-for-early-voting-incident/">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> elections board member was forced to apologize after creating a situation at an early voting site on Monday. And while it wasn&#8217;t early voting in the true sense of the term, fifteen members of the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-orchestra-china-election-day/">Philadelphia</a> Orchestra lined up outside the drop-off box on the south side of City Hall to submit absentee ballots. The orchestra will be tour in China on Election Day. </span>Principal bass Joseph Conyers hopes everyone is watching and similarly makes a plan to vote. “It’s less about letting them know that Joseph Conyers is voting, and more about the fact that there is a group of citizens of the city who are not going to be in town, but are recognizing that our vote and our voice matters,” he said.</p>

Secretary Benson announced the new dashboard while speaking in Detroit alongside partners from the Center for Civic Design, who helped design the look and feel of the dashboard, and the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI). “Democracy works best with an informed and engaged electorate, and I’m very excited today to announce our latest effort to make government more transparent and accessible to the people we serve,” said Secretary Benson. “We know that election misinformation frustrates voters. We also know that official sources of information are more important than ever to help center our conversation on the rule of law, on the truth, and on the security of the system. Making those official sources of information more user-friendly, more accessible, and easier to understand makes them more useful. It prebunks misinformation and builds trust in our elections.” Data is posted starting 45 days before each Election Day, reporting the number of absentee ballots requested by voters, the number of absentee ballots completed and returned to be tabulated, and the number of ballots cast at early voting sites. The totals are broken down by county and jurisdictions. Data on the dashboard is updated daily and is pulled from the state’s Qualified Voter File (QVF). The QVF is the secure database of voters used by the Michigan Bureau of Elections and more than 1,600 election clerks throughout the state. The dashboard will not display information about individual voters to protect their right to ballot secrecy. The Michigan Department of State and Bureau of Elections are working with the students at UMSI enrolled in a year-long User Experience capstone course to further develop the dashboard. The team intends to release more data in 2025. “It’s important that voters are able to distinguish a trusted source by providing a look under the hood like this tool does in the ballot request, ballot returns, early voting, and turnout statewide,” said Canton Township Clerk Michael Siegrist. “Most importantly, the information is provided by legal members and is distributed through the department’s trusted dashboard. It is trusted, reliable information that anyone can see how their community is, and the public will have a better understanding of how elections work.”  </span></p>

The Durango Herald has an </span><a href="https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/his-last-act-hesperus-man-casts-first-general-election-ballot-before-his-death/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotional story about the power of voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and what elections officials will do to make sure everyone has that chance. Almost 98-year-old La Plata County, Colorado resident Fritz Herbine wanted one last chance to vote. He knew it would be his last. His daughter Kate Feldman reached out to  La Plata County Clerk and Recorder Tiffany Lee to see what could be done. Nothing, was the answer, until Sept. 21 – the first day that electors may be issued a ballot in Colorado. As that date neared, Feldman called again and spoke with Lee. “She said, ‘We’re coming, we will come to your father’s bedside,’” Feldman told the paper. “I was like, ‘Are you really kidding me?’” On Saturday, Sept. 21, Lee arrived with two election judges, one Democrat and one Republican, in tow. Herbine was weak – he could barely speak, his daughter said. Even though he needed it, he was not on morphine. Herbine clutched Lee’s hand as she asked if he knew what they were doing. “Voting,” he responded with a nod. Just as when a voter’s markings on a ballot are unclear and must be interpreted by judges to determine intent, Lee and the bipartisan delegation had to agree on Herbine’s intent. “Without a doubt, all three of us were like, ‘We know exactly what that man wanted,’” Lee said. “She said, ‘We’re finished, Fritz,’ and he just closed his eyes and leaned back,” his daughter said. “… She (Lee) looked at all of us, and she said ‘Fritz Herbine is the first person to vote in La Plata County in the 2024 election.’” About 48 hours later Herbine died. “It was his last act,” Feldman said.</span></p>

The Clerk and Recorder&#8217;s Office says the contest allows young community members to participate in the election process, even though they aren&#8217;t old enough to vote. “It was a joy for me to see what &#8216;I Voted&#8217; meant to our winners and how they used their talent to translate it into their design,” said El Paso County Clerk &amp; Recorder Steve Schleiker. “These meaningful and impactful pieces of art truly capture the essence of civic pride and the importance of voting.

A resolution is on the agenda of Wednesday’s Town Board meeting to schedule a Nov. 7 public hearing on the proposed law. The proposal has not been discussed during a public Town Board meeting and was added to the agenda after last week’s work session. The proposed local law would add a new Article VII to Chapter 103 of the town code, pertaining to biennial town elections. It would require elections for the offices of supervisor, town council, town clerk, receiver of taxes, highway superintendent and assessors to be held in odd-numbered years. Riverhead’s action is in response to a state law enacted last year that mandates most local elections in counties outside of New York City to be held in even-numbered years. The bill was vehemently opposed by Republicans, who argued it was an attack on local control in counties outside of New York City. Several upstate counties, along with Nassau and Suffolk counties, two Nassau County  towns and four Suffolk County towns, sued the state in the hope of having the law invalidated.  Last week, their legal challenge succeeded. A State Supreme Court judge in Onondaga County on Oct. 8 ruled that the “Even Year Election Law” is void because it violates local home rule provisions protected by the state constitution.</span></p>

During a Senate State Affairs committee hearing, lawmakers expressed interest in reviving legislation modeled on a proof of citizenship requirement in Arizona, currently the only state with such a requirement in force. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called the hearing on noncitizen voting after Gov. Greg Abbott issued a press release boasting that the state had removed more than potential 6,500 noncitizens from its voter rolls. An investigation by ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and Votebeat published this week found the governor’s figure was likely inflated and, in some cases, wrong. The secretary of state’s office confirmed the news organization’s reporting during the hearing after state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Democrat, cited the article’s findings and pressed Christina Adkins, the state elections division director. After the hearing, Zaffirini told Votebeat she is concerned that the intense focus on making sure noncitizens aren’t on the voter rolls “will be interpreted as voter intimidation in some cases,” even if it’s not intended that way. Nonetheless, multiple lawmakers on the committee, which is comprised of nine Republicans and three Democrats, said they believe the state needs to adopt requirements similar to Arizona’s 2004 law. Only six committee members attended all or part of the hearing.</span></p>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, without comment, a Delaware federal judge&#8217;s decision to dismiss ES&amp;S&#8217;s lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews said last year that the last remaining ES&amp;S patent in the case was invalid. Spokespeople and attorneys for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. Omaha, Nebraska-based ES&amp;S sued the U.S. branch of London-based Smartmatic in 2018. It said Smartmatic infringed two patents covering improved voter-assistance terminals and ballot-marking devices for physically disabled voters. ES&amp;S dropped one of the patents from the case in 2022. Andrews ruled last April that the remaining patent related to the abstract idea of &#8220;giving voters a choice of returning or depositing their ballot.&#8221; ES&amp;S told the Federal Circuit that the Delaware court had oversimplified its invention. The appeals court held oral arguments in the case last week.</span></p>

Manasco said that Alabama must stop moving those voters from active to “inactive” status, as the election is just three weeks away. “As part of this program, they were all reported to Alabama’s chief law enforcement authority for criminal investigation,” said Manasco, adding “as far as I know nothing has been done to undo that.” Manasco, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump in 2020, said she could not discount the negative impact that such a notice from the state would have on a potential voter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A three-judge panel on the 11th Circuit Court </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-absentee-ballot-restrictions-appeals-court-fbe8ca328ee2c2bf80d10f85415800d6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously affirmed a lower court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from September that blocked a portion of the law that limits help with absentee ballot applications. The measure made it illegal to distribute an absentee ballot application that is prefilled with information such as the voter’s name, or to return another person’s absentee ballot application. The new law also made it a felony to give or receive a payment or a gift “for distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining, or delivering a voter’s absentee ballot application.” In a two-page decision, the appeals court judges ruled that removing the lower court’s injunction would “injure” voting access for disabled voters and goes against the public interest. In the original lawsuit, voter outreach groups said their paid staff members or volunteers, who are given gas money or food, could face prosecution for helping disabled voters with an application. “The court’s decision recognizes that many vulnerable voters would be unable to vote if Alabama were allowed to enforce the blocked law,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement on Friday.</span></p>

Lanham ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to show how the relief they requested would address the harm of “vote dilution” that they alleged. Additionally, she noted that voters cannot be removed from voter rolls within 90 days of an election per the National Voter Registration Act.  In her order, she wrote, “The court declines to order Arizona’s county recorders to divert resources from preparing for the general election to instead submitting thousands of requests to DHS.”</span></p>

Worse, the circuit court’s novel interpretation arrives just before early voting begins, threatening the orderly administration of early voting in the State.” Griffin continues to support the argument brought by commissioners’ attorney Joe Rogers that the county clerk cannot designate an early voting polling site outside of the county clerk’s office in the county seat, which in this case is Marion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Jennifer Standerfer, who represents two West Memphis voters who intend to cast their ballots early, has asked the Arkansas Supreme Court to</span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/briefs/attorney-asks-arkansas-supreme-court-to-disqualify-attorney-general-from-early-voting-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strike a recent filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Attorney General Tim Griffin and disqualify him from the case.</span></p>

McBurney issued the ruling temporarily blocking the new Georgia election board rule challenged in a lawsuit filed by Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration, which argued it would impose onerous new rules onto poll workers during  the 2024 election in a closely contested presidential election. McBurney wrote in his court order that the election board’s approval of the hand-count rule came too late in this year’s election season to give  local election workers time to comply with new procedures for the November election. The injunction will remain in effect until McBurney makes a final decision on the case at a time to be determined, according to McBurney’s order. The new state rule, which the state attorney general says could be invalid, calls for a trio of poll workers to hand count every paper ballot cast on election day and verify that their count matches the machine-calculated totals. McBurney wrote that the hand count rule on paper appears to be consistent with the election boards mission to ensure fair, legal, and orderly elections, however its timing complicates the electoral process in a way that is not in the public interest. “A rule that introduces a new and substantive role on the eve of election for more than 7,500 poll workers who will not have received any formal, cohesive, or consistent training and that allows for our paper ballots – the only tangible proof of who voted for whom – to be handled multiple times by multiple people following an exhausting Election Day all before they are securely transported to the official tabulation center does not contribute to lessening the tension or boosting the confidence of the public for this election,” McBurney said in the Tuesday order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney has ruled that </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/a-judge-ruled-that-county-election-board-members-in-georgia-must-certify-elections/635RIP3ILBC4ZH5AGMMSQXPYBQ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certifying elections is a required duty of county election boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Georgia, and they’re not allowed to refuse to finalize results based on suspicions of miscounts or fraud. McBurney rejected claims brought by Fulton County election board member Julie Adams, who voted against certifying this spring’s presidential primary. McBurney ruled that Georgia law requires certification and county election boards don’t have any discretion not to do so. “If election superintendents were, as plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so — because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud — refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,” McBurney wrote. “Our Constitution and our election code do not allow for that to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Georgia Democrats have </span><a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/appeal-filed-suit-remove-gop-backed-georgia-election-board-members"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed an appeal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to force Gov. Brian Kemp to investigate and potentially remove three Republican members of the State Election Board over rule changes they claim could undermine the integrity of the upcoming election. State Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, D-Duluth, former Fulton County Election Board Chair Cathy Woolard, and Democratic state Senate candidate Randal Mangham filed the suit, alleging that the three board members — Janice Johnston, Janelle King, and Rick Jeffares — violated state law and ethics codes. The Democrats sought an administrative law hearing as the first step in the process to remove the trio from their positions.  That lawsuit was thrown out last week, but Monday, the trio filed a notice of appeal for the Georgia Court of Appeals to review the merits of the case. Fulton County Chief Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville dismissed the case last Wednesday, dealing a blow to Democrats’ efforts to challenge the GOP-appointed board members. Despite the setback, Sen. Islam Parkes vowed to continue the fight, saying the board members were &#8220;sowing chaos within our election system.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross said October 10 that she </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-voter-registration-hurricane-helene-862c30b93cd99f4d6a9c6f6391bc3310"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t order Georgia to reopen voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for November’s elections despite recent disruptions to registration caused by Hurricane Helene. Ross rejected arguments that the state should reopen registration through next Monday. The registration deadline was last Monday and she said in her ruling from the bench Thursday afternoon that there would be no extension. Ross said in her verbal ruling that three groups that sued didn’t sufficiently prove their members were harmed and said there are no state laws allowing Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the Republican defendants in the case, to order an extension of the voter registration deadline. Although the groups presented testimony Thursday that they know of at least two people unable to register, Ross said the testimony wasn’t detailed enough to link that failure to the burdens of Helene. “I don’t think we had even one voter who had been harmed or would likely be harmed by failure to register to vote,” Ross said.</span></p>

The settlement was filed in a St. Louis, Mo., circuit court, where Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss had sued The Gateway Pundit, an influential site that shared false and misleading information about the 2020 election. The terms of the deal were not made public. We “respectfully provide notice to the court that the parties have reached agreement to settle all claims and counterclaims asserted” in the case, attorneys for Freeman, Moss and The Gateway Pundit stated in a joint notice of settlement, news of which was first reported by The Guardian. In a statement, Freeman and Moss’ legal team said the dispute “has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties through a fair and reasonable settlement.”</span></p>

In 2019, Linn County Auditor Joel Miller, a Democrat, alleged the state’s computerized database of registered voters is potentially vulnerable to cyber threats. Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, said Miller failed to give an example of a specific security threat and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission dismissed the complaint. The Linn County Auditor filed a lawsuit in 2020 and a district court dismissed the lawsuit last year. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled Miller has the right to proceed with his lawsuit that questions whether the state’s computerized list of registered voters is vulnerable to hacking.  Secretary of State Paul Pate, in a written statement, said “first and foremost,” he wants to “assure Iowa voters that Iowa’s election systems are secure.” Pate said in the years since Miller’s complaint was filed in 2019, the state has installed “robust cybersecurity measures” in its election systems. In a statement to The Des Moines Register, Miller said his complaint is still valid because Iowa is “using the same voter registration system that I complained about in 2019.”</span></p>

It&#8217;s the latest in a half-dozen &#8220;election integrity&#8221; lawsuits from the Republican National Committee, which alleges guidance from Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson violates residency requirements in the Michigan Constitution.  Benson&#8217;s office called the suit a public relations &#8220;campaign to spread unfounded distrust&#8221; in Michigan elections and said it targets voting rights of U.S. citizens, including children of military members &#8220;making sacrifices for our freedom.&#8221; At issue is a small number of U.S. voters who have never lived in the U.S. but were born to parents who previously lived in Michigan. GOP attorneys fear those voters could “overwhelmingly” support Democrats and thereby harm Republicans like presidential candidate Donald Trump. Federal law requires states to allow eligible citizens living abroad to vote in federal elections. And Michigan is one of 38 states that also allow &#8220;never resided&#8221; voters to cast ballots, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, which aids members of the military and U.S. citizens abroad. Benson’s guidance to Michigan election administrators instructs that a citizen who has never lived in the U.S. “but who has a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who was last domiciled in Michigan” is eligible to vote “as long as the citizen has not registered or voted in another state.” Attorneys for the RNC and Michigan Republican Party contend that violates the state constitution, which says voters must be 21 years old, “resided in this state six months” and meet “the requirements of local residence provided by law.”  But both the age and residency requirements in the state constitution were previously nullified by a U.S. constitutional amendment and U.S. Supreme Court ruling, respectively. There is still a 30-day residency requirement in state law, which the lawsuit does not mention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota</strong>: The Republican Party of Minnesota is part of a lawsuit against Hennepin County regarding the 2024 election and its eventual handling of absentee ballots.

Republican Party Chair David Hann says Hennepin County did not select any names from their list of 1,500 provided to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s office. The petition was filed in conjunction with the Minnesota Voters Alliance, a conservative organization that often sues over election matters. It asks the state Supreme Court to require that Hennepin County create party balance on election absentee ballot boards. In a written response, the Hennepin County Auditor says the county is complying with Minnesota law and the Office of the Secretary of State with respect to the absentee ballot board members.</span></p>

Following the guidance of Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar (D), election officials in Carson City, Storey County, Clark County and Washoe County did not process those voter challenges. In September, Citizen Outreach Foundation and its President Chuck Muth filed lawsuits against the local election officials claiming that they violated state law when they failed to process the voter challenges.  The plaintiffs asked state courts to order county officials to process the challenges immediately by mailing notices to the challenged registrants and marking them as inactive voters if they did not respond within 30 days. The plaintiffs also requested that ballots cast by the challenged registrants be separated until their voter eligibility could be confirmed. County and state officials argued that Pigpen Project had failed to meet state requirements when submitting the challenges and that voter challenges cannot be processed within 90 days of an election per the National Voter Registration Act. Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar announced the withdrawal on Monday, saying: “In a victory for Nevada, several meritless challenges to our voter rolls – which could have affected eligible voters including members of our military and their families, who fight and sacrifice to protect our fundamental right to vote – are being dropped. No eligible voter should be subject to suspicion or confusion about their voter status.

Under state law, several close relations are legally allowed to do so. But following a federal court ruling requiring greater flexibility for disabled voters, Ohio’s Secretary of State Frank LaRose imposed a new requirement that anyone dropping off a ballot on behalf of someone else must sign a form attesting that they are following state law. Two voters and the Ohio Democratic Party challenged LaRose’s directive, arguing the attestation would unnecessarily restrict voting access. By demanding helpers fill out a form, they said, the directive limits drop off to hours when the board of elections is open, and access to drop boxes is restricted to people dropping of their own ballot. The Supreme Court sidestepped the question of whether LaRose’s directive violates state law. Instead, the majority determined the challenge came too late in the process. But in a pair of dissents, the minority blasted LaRose’s directive as “a sleight of hand that should make our citizens shudder” and chided the majority for its “failure to uphold the rule of law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Ohio Supreme Court partially </span><a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/ohio-supreme-court-tells-county-to-include-pollworker-training-on-noncitizen-ids/VWE35TUZIZF5ROPOZLB3FPJZGA/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed a complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the Montgomery County election board, ordering local election officials to pass along updated training materials to precinct election official volunteers who took classes before the evening of Sept. 25 and voting location managers who attended the board’s training before Sept. 29.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has filed a lawsuit in federal court over the decision of Ohio election officials </span><a href="https://www.kshb.com/politics/path-to-the-white-house/green-party-presidential-candidate-jill-stein-files-suit-over-ohio-decision-not-to-count-votes-for-her"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not to count votes for her after her running mate was named by the national party after a state administrative deadline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cleveland.com reports that the lawsuit was filed October9 in U.S. district court in Columbus by Stein, the person named as her running mate on the state ballot and three Ohio voters. It alleges that the decision infringes on their constitutional rights to free speech, association, and equal protection and the voting rights of the Ohio-based plaintiffs. The Ohio Secretary of State’s Office granted a request to remove Rios from the ballot but said Ware&#8217;s name couldn&#8217;t be added because the state deadline to replace an independent vice presidential candidate on the 2024 ballot had passed. Office spokesperson Dan Lusheck told Cleveland.com that Stein&#8217;s name will still appear on state ballots, which were already being sent to overseas and military voters, but votes for her would not count. The lawsuit asserts that the withdrawal letter was written and delivered by a local party official without the knowledge or consent of Rios. The plaintiffs are asking the federal court to issue a preliminary injunction and restraining order to ensure that any votes for Stein and Rios are counted.</span></p>

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg claims the Pennsylvania Department of State guidelines that say military voters and their spouses are exempt from voter identification and eligibility verification requirements violate the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and  Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). The suit seeks an injunction requiring election officials to verify the identities of people applying for overseas ballots and any ballots received before Nov. 5 to be segregated and not counted until the senders’ identities have been verified. The Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections in the commonwealth, said in a statement that the suit appears to be a continuation of litigation first filed in 2020 and intended to sow confusion and throw out the votes of millions of Pennsylvania residents in that year’s presidential election. “Thousands of Pennsylvanians are currently serving our country abroad as members of the military, putting their lives on the line to defend our freedoms. But despite the sacrifices they make to protect us, some elected leaders are now making bad-faith arguments to prevent these votes from being counted,” DOS spokesperson Matt Heckel said. Heckel noted the suit was filed two weeks after Pennsylvania counties started mailing ballots to military and overseas voters and it baselessly challenges Pennsylvania law, which clearly lays out procedures for processing ballot applications by overseas voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luzerne County </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/settlement-reached-in-lawsuit-over-luzerne-county-pennsylvanias-2022-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled a federal lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">brought by residents alleging that election administration issues — including paper ballot shortages across at least 50 precincts — disenfranchised voters during the county’s 2022 midterm elections.   As part of the</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/75-2024-10-15-Parties-settlement-agreement.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settlement agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Luzerne County agreed to adopt written election policies and procedures that outline specific requirements to ensure adequate ballot paper supplies in future elections. Per the settlement, the county will continue to order ballot paper after each election cycle to avert potential shortages and will retain an election law attorney to revise its election administration policies. The agreement further stipulates that county election personnel will receive annual training on election administration and states that the county will pay the plaintiffs’ counsel $30,000 for litigation expenses. The county did not, however, admit any wrongdoing. The lawsuit at issue in today’s settlement agreement claimed that Luzerne County and its election officials mismanaged the Nov. 8, 2022 midterm elections in a manner that left some voters unable to cast a ballot on Election Day.</span></p>

Among the rules struck down by Rodriguez was a ban on compensation for anyone who assists a voter and a requirement for anyone who assists a voter to sign an oath under penalty of perjury that the voter qualifies to receive help. Rodriguez also blocked provisions that require assisters to make certain disclosures about their relationship to the voter they are helping and a provision that restricts voter assistance given during door-to-door voter outreach operations. Rodriguez based his decision on the section of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act that guarantees voters with disabilities or literacy limitations the right to receive assistance from whoever they choose. Although the judge has blocked any type of prosecution under these provisions, the rules and instructions on forms about requiring voter assisters from signing an oath are technically still in place for the upcoming Nov. 5 presidential election, because it is too close to the election to change the forms themselves. “This ruling will be most impactful for voters with disabilities, voters who have limited English proficiency, voters with literacy issues and the people who assist them,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, voting rights program director at the Brennan Center for Justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 7, a federal court </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/10/texas-ken-paxton-travis-county-registration-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">returned a lawsuit to state court </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had filed against Travis County over an effort to register voters before the November election. The federal court found that it did not have jurisdiction over the issue, as Travis County officials had argued, and it granted Paxton&#8217;s request that the lawsuit be returned to state court. The decision is the latest development in a bitter pre-election brawl between Republican state officials and Democratic county leaders. Republican leaders have maintained that they are trying to keep the state&#8217;s voter rolls secure ahead of a charged election, while Democrats, county officials and nonprofit groups have accused them of stoking baseless fears to suppress Democratic votes and to cast doubt on the election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5228" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-300x229.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Virginia:</strong> The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Virginia election officials October 11 that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5150774/the-justice-department-says-virginia-is-illegally-striking-voters-off-of-voter-rolls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accuses the state of striking names from voter rolls in violation of federal election law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria says that an executive order issued in August by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin requiring daily updates to voter lists to remove ineligible voters violates federal law. The National Voter Registration Act requires a 90-day “quiet period” ahead of elections for the maintenance of voter rolls. “Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-virginia-violating-federal-laws-prohibition-systematic-efforts"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.” In its lawsuit, the Justice Department said the quiet-period provision reduces the risk that errors in maintaining registration lists will disenfranchise eligible voters by ensuring they have enough time to address errors before the election. A similar lawsuit was filed earlier by a coalition of immigrant-rights groups and the League of Women Voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waynesboro city elections officials are </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2024/10/14/waynesboro-officials-refuse-to-certify-nov-election-per-lawsuit/75677245007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refusing to certify the November election without changes to Virginia election policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a lawsuit recently filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court “The Plaintiffs believe that to certify the election under the current legal and administrative regime, therefore, would be a violation of their oaths of office and, absent court intervention, shall refuse to certify the 2024 election,” reads the suit. The suit was brought by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Waynesboro city Board of Elections, Curtis Lilly and Scott Mares respectively, against Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections Susan Beals and Chairman of the Board for the State Board of Elections John O’Bannon. According to the Staunton Leader, Lilly and Curtis’s reasoning goes like this. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution of Virginia reads, “Secrecy in casting votes shall be maintained, except as provision may be made for assistance to handicapped voters, but the ballot box or voting machine shall be kept in public view and shall not be opened, nor the ballots canvassed nor the votes counted, in secret.” The ballots cannot be counted in secret. “Board members are unable to personally review and verify that: the voting machine program being used to count the ballots is keeping a true and accurate count; the voting machine program being used to count the ballots is recording the true and accurate count; and/or that the voting machine record tape accurately represents the ballots cast,” reads the complaint. Because they cannot check the anonymized ballots themselves, the complaint states, “the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined.”</span></p>
