</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last-minute resources for securing the election and keeping everyone sane while doing so</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just over three weeks to go until Election Day, this week we’ll take a look at some resources available to elections officials to ensure election security and to make sure officials and their staff are mentally OK, as well as physically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is a lot of information about election security and wellness, we reached out to some partner groups for their suggestions on things, be it security measures or wellness plans, that can still be implemented with the short calendar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Security</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has it’s </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/protect2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#Protect2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> site filled with information about how to protect against the cyber, physical, and operational security risks to election infrastructure during the 2024 election cycle. But for some of <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />those recommendations, the time has come and gone.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wellness</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the Henderson, Nevada city clerk’s office won a Professional Practice Paper award from the Election Center for their <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Peace-Polls-and-Pups.pdf">Peace Polls and Pups: Mental Health &amp; Wellness in an Elections Environment</a>. Following a series of stressful elections where many election staff members became ill during or directly after the election, the Clerk’s Office worked with the city’s Mental Health &amp; Wellness Program Manager that would help keep staff healthy and happy. The City of Henderson’s focus on mental health and wellness, during our 2023 Special Election, showed that small actions can have a huge impact on the wellbeing of staff members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polls: During an election, the staff interact with thousands of voters and are exposed to a myriad of germs. Normal precautions, such as cleaning and sanitizing protocols were implemented. According to Healthline, anecdotal evidence suggests that essential oils may have <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11949" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-11.39.21 AM-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-11.39.21 AM-300x224.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-11.39.21 AM.png 526w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />immune boosting effects. In addition to sanitizing practices, an oil diffuser was deployed, which continually diffused oils shown to promote immune defense. Additionally, staff members were provided with snacks and drinks onsite to encourage frequent short breaks for sustenance and hydration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace: Dealing with the public, especially in an election setting, can be stressful. In order to provide a respite from the stress, a “tap out” space and room were created. One space was in a hallway next to the vote center and included some comfortable chairs and flyers with several stress management techniques. This area was an ideal space for a quick <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11950" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-11.39.04 AM-223x300.png" alt="" width="223" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-11.39.04 AM-223x300.png 223w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-11.39.04 AM.png 452w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />hydration break. Additionally, the Clerk’s Office converted a little used storage closet into a dark and quiet area where staff could take a few minutes of alone time to relax and recharge. This area included chairs, an oil diffuser diffusing oils shown to enhance relaxation, and the flyers of stress management techniques.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pups: On election day, the Clerk’s Office partnered with Molly, a licensed therapy dog, to provide pets and cuddles. Molly provided a much-needed distraction on a very busy day. Her presence brought smiles to staff and voters alike. Molly was the MVP of election day!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the guide: Many of the resources included in this guide start with the notion of self-care. That said, framing wellness in terms of self-care can sometimes feel selfish and isolating, as if one is left on one’s own when it comes to wellness. A more helpful way to think about wellness is that it involves several individuals, all of whom make up a community. In other words, we should promote taking care of ourselves as well as taking care of others. By taking care of ourselves, we can navigate challenging situations and in turn take care of others.</span></p>

							<h2>Voter Education Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You are invited to the Election Day Voting Party</strong><br />
<em>Celebrating National Voter Education Week</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Lia Merivaki and Mara Suttmann-Lea</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If wedding planning is not on your election bingo card, it should be. We have heard many election officials compare running elections to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H8r5hCY23I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planning multiple weddings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that take place simultaneously across different locations in their jurisdictions. Like weddings, the expectation is that on Election Day everything has to be perfect, and everyone should have a great experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our community knows just how many hats election officials wear: they’re administrators, communicators, tech experts, and emergency responders. And with early voting already underway in many states, these officials are in full election mode, navigating high-pressure environments while ensuring everything runs smoothly. And they do this work while navigating a high-risk environment that makes them a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/03/justice-election-threats-prosecutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">target</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they don’t stop there. Election officials are also tapping into their social media game, connecting with voters online and offline to share crucial updates. Whether it’s debunking myths, posting deadlines, or handling last-minute emergencies, they’re using every platform available to make sure voters have accurate, reliable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://nationalvotereducationweek.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Education Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we on team voter education want to showcase the tremendous work election officials across the country are doing to educate voters about “the times, places, and manner of elections,” build confidence that U.S. elections are free, fair, and safe, and bring in more voters to celebrate democracy on Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We launched the </span><a href="https://www.merivaki.com/election-officials-communications-tracker.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Officials Communication Tracker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to document the various ways election officials discuss elections and voting in their communities, and to highlight how community is built on the ground, through outreach and partnerships with local stakeholders, from highschools and colleges, to public libraries, Rotary Clubs, and yes, even sports teams and breweries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We track over 1,500  accounts from state and local election offices on Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, and Threads, and label content shared on these platforms using a comprehensive list of election-related labels. Our labels help organize this content by method of delivery, type, theme, and strategy. Between August and September, we have collected, and currently label over 29,157 posts from state and local election officials.</span></p>
<p><strong>State and local election officials’ post activity on various social media platforms, August-September 2024.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11925" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Graphic1-1024x382.png" alt="" width="640" height="239" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Graphic1-1024x382.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Graphic1-300x112.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Graphic1-768x287.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Graphic1.png 1302w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tracker’s findings from 2024 show how election officials are using major election events to educate and engage voters. For example, on National Poll Worker Recruitment Day (August 1) election officials reminded voters that poll workers are their neighbors and community members—building trust, one local connection at a time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why are we doing this work?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, election officials are central actors in the election ecosystem, whose efforts to educate voters about how to vote and how elections are kept secure can move the needle in building trust in elections, as well as help identify participation gaps across underserved populations. In an era where the dissemination of low quality content is supercharged by technologies such as AI, the potential to drown out credible sources of information is higher than ever. Understanding, therefore, how communications flow in the current ecosystem, and which strategies are more effective in building resilient information ecosystems is what drives our work.</span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7086" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USDOJ-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USDOJ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USDOJ-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USDOJ.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />DOJ News</strong>: On Tuesday, October 8, the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against a citizen of Afghanistan residing in Oklahoma, for </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conspiring to conduct an Election Day terrorist attack in the United States </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). According to a criminal complaint filed, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, conspired and attempted to provide material support to ISIS and obtained firearms and ammunition to conduct a violent attack on U.S. soil in the name of ISIS. As part of the plot, the defendant allegedly took steps to liquidate his family’s assets, resettle members of his family overseas, acquire AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition, and commit a terrorist attack in the United States. “As charged, the Justice Department foiled the defendant’s plot to acquire semi-automatic weapons and commit a violent attack in the name of ISIS on U.S. soil on Election Day,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America’s national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people. I am deeply grateful to the public servants of the FBI, National Security Division, and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Oklahoma for their work to disrupt this attack and for the work they do every day to protect our country.” According to the criminal complaint, as part of the investigation into Tawhedi, the FBI searched Tawhedi’s phone and obtained communications between Tawhedi and a person who facilitated recruitment, training, and indoctrination of persons who expressed interest in terrorist activity and who Tawhedi understood to be affiliated with ISIS. Tawhedi was also seen in a video recorded on July 20 reading to two children text that describes the rewards a martyr receives in the afterlife. Tawhedi also allegedly accessed, viewed, and saved ISIS propaganda on his iCloud and Google account, participated in pro-ISIS Telegram groups, and contributed to a charity which fronts for and funnels money to ISIS. “This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,&#8221; said FBI Director Christopher Wray. &#8220;I am proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed. Terrorism is still the FBI&#8217;s number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people.&#8221; The complaint alleges that while liquidating their family’s assets prior to the attack, Tawhedi and his co-conspirator, who is a juvenile, advertised the sale of the family’s personal property on Facebook. At the FBI’s direction, a confidential human source responded to inquire if a computer was still for sale. The FBI source noted that he needed the computer for a new gun business he was starting, which ultimately led Tawhedi and the juvenile to meet with the source and other FBI assets at a rural location to test firearms. Tawhedi expressed interest in purchasing two AK-47 assault rifles, magazines, and ammunition from the source. According to the criminal complaint, on Oct. 7, Tawhedi and the juvenile met with the FBI assets at a rural location in the Western District of Oklahoma and purchased, received, and took possession of two AK-47 assault rifles, ten magazines, and 500 rounds of ammunition. Upon receipt of the rifles and ammunition, Tawhedi and the juvenile were arrested. In his seized communications, Tawhedi allegedly indicated that his attack was planned for Election Day, and in a post-arrest interview, Tawhedi allegedly confirmed the attack was planned for Election Day targeting large gatherings of people, during which he and the juvenile were expected to die as martyrs. Tawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, if convicted. The case is being investigated by the FBI Oklahoma City Field Office, with valuable assistance from the Oklahoma City Police Department and the Moore, Oklahoma Police Department.</span></p>

According to the update, a range of foreign actors continue to try to influence U.S. elections as we approach November. These activities include broad efforts aimed at undermining trust in U.S. democratic processes and exacerbating divisions in our society, while also seeking to shape voter preferences toward specific candidates. Our assessments about the activities and goals of Russia, Iran, and China are unchanged from earlier election security updates. On the presidential race, the IC continues to assess that Russia prefers the Former President and Iran prefers the Vice President; China is not seeking to influence the Presidential election.  As we approach election day, the IC also expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election’s results after the polls close. Foreign actors are almost certainly considering the possibility of another contested presidential election and a tight contest for control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. They will likely take advantage of such an opportunity to use similar tactics in a post-election period to undermine trust in the integrity of the election, election processes, and further exacerbate divisions among Americans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Threat Landscape</strong>: The Multi-State Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), the Electricity Information &amp; Analysis Center (E-ISAC), the Faith-Based Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Organization (FB-ISAO), and the Water Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (WaterISAC) have authored a white paper on the <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Election-Threat-Landscape-TLP-CLEAR.pdf">2024 Election Threat Landscape</a>. This paper discusses threats from the cyber, physical, and hybrid perspectives and includes recommendations for election offices and associated parties to implement to improve their preparedness.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide array of cyber threat actors (CTAs) are likely to target election offices, election officials, and voters using opportunistic and targeted campaigns as well as leverage emerging technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI), and developments in more common tactics like phishing.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observed malicious campaigns included election-specific lures and the use of stolen election correspondence to increase the likelihood of success.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransomware attacks pose a threat to election offices, even if they are not the direct target of the attack.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTAs will increasingly aim to sell election-related information online leading up to the 2024 U.S. general election, taking advantage of the increased interest surrounding the election.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politically motivated hacktivists are highly likely to increase elections-focused targeting throughout the 2024 election cycle due to the hacktivism resurgence brought on by the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials and poll workers are likely to be targeted with physical threats online and in-person. False narratives regarding elections infrastructure will likely influence and direct threat actors (TAs) to target the U.S. electoral system and companies facilitating elections. Supporters of these narratives may become motivated to take physical action.</span></li>

DVEs’ mobilization to violence depends on a blend of ideological, sociopolitical, and personal grievances, which vary among individual extremists; their reaction to divisive topics in public discourse; and their access to potential targets. The FBI and DHS advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners to remain vigilant of these potential threats.</span></p>

This fact sheet provides recommended actions to protect against this malicious activity. IRGC actors target and compromise the personal and business accounts of Americans, in particular. individuals associated with national political organizations. They also target individuals and organizations working or have worked on issues related to Iranian and Middle Eastern affairs. CISA and the FBI recommend mitigations and best practices that will help organizations and individuals strengthen their security and resilience, including keeping applications and operating systems updated, training staff to only use official accounts for business, and implementing</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   “With FBI, CISA works to provide timely, actionable information that helps our partners reduce their risk from myriad threats,” said CISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Jeff Greene. “IRGC cyber actors pose an ongoing and escalating risk.

Here’s a look at where they stand. In </span><a href="https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2024-10-03/desantis-signs-executive-order-election-changes-counties-impacted-hurricane-helene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order authorizing election changes in 10 counties trying to recover from Hurricane Helene. DeSantis’ order allows supervisors of elections in heavily damaged areas to make changes to early voting sites and to set up consolidated voting centers where people can cast ballots. The order also loosens restrictions on requests for mail-in ballots and allows state employees to take paid administrative leave to serve as poll workers on Election Day. The governor’s action came as supervisors throughout the state are mailing ballots to voters for the Nov. 5 election. A bid to extend the state’s voter registration deadline failed in court. In </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/10/07/georgia-elections-officials-dont-expect-major-voting-delays-due-to-storm-damage/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said earlier this week that  local election officials are back on schedule Monday for the first day to mail out absentee ballots and remain on track for the start of voting on Oct. 15. County election offices were spared from any significant damage caused by the storm. Raffenspeger credited the county election supervisors for dealing with challenges of lost internet and electricity during the storm’s tear through Georgia. County election officials “really put public service first because they understand how important voting is in 53 counties that so far have been declared federal disaster areas,” Raffensperger said during the media briefing. “Our office is working hard to make sure the counties have what they need so it can go off without a hitch.” In </span><a href="https://www.wfae.org/politics/2024-10-07/nc-elections-board-makes-voting-changes-for-13-helene-impacted-counties"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the State Board of Elections this week voted unanimously to make casting a ballot easier for residents in the 13 western counties that were most devastated by flooding from Hurricane Helene. Karen Brinson Bell, the board&#8217;s executive director, said she plans to start early voting in all 100 counties as scheduled, on Oct. 17. She said that all county elections offices in the Helene-impacted areas have now reopened. But she said there are about 10 early voting sites in the disaster area that are unusable as of now. There are also early voting sites that are currently being used for emergency response, such as fire stations. “We also plan to provide as much voting opportunity as we can, recognizing that we may need to take voting to the people,” she said. County elections boards may need to change early voting sites and Election Day polling places. They also might need to change voting hours. The General Assembly approved </span><a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/66361/emergency-election-measures-millions-nc-legislators-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 million for election administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 25 counties by the storm.

And some counties will have to move polling places entirely, or adjust what rooms are used at existing locations. </span></p>

At a meeting this week, members of the public packed the City Hall chamber to offer comments both in opposition to and in support of the mayor. But ultimately the city took no action and did not even discuss the mayor’s proposal to add funding to address what Diny called “inadequate nighttime lighting.” In </span><a href="https://www.wmtv15news.com/2024/10/09/ballot-drop-boxes-being-used-dodge-county-sheriff-reports-correction-after-trump-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodge County, Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the county sheriff was forced to make a correction to a comment he made at a Trump rally when he said no drop boxes were being used in the county. “From time to time, corrections need to be made if it is discovered that something stated was incorrect,” Sheriff Dale Schmidt wrote on Facebook. Dropboxes have been in use in the town of Beaver Dam. Beaver Dam City Clerk Tracey Ferron said her staff was concerned about voter confusion when they saw the sheriff make this false statement on Sunday.

Those dropping off ballots on behalf of someone else will be required to fill out an attestation form that certifies they are complying with state law. Stark County Board of Elections Deputy Director Regine Johnson said the board is still waiting on more information from the secretary of state&#8217;s office on some details, and there could be changes to the plan as a lawsuit plays out in Ohio Supreme Court. </span><a href="https://www.kktv.com/2024/10/05/el-paso-county-expands-voter-accessibility-adding-three-new-ballot-boxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Paso County, Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently added three new dropboxes bringing the county’s total to 41.

The articles touched on everything from voting by mail to ballot counting to testing. The AP sends content to over 3,000 U.S. sites (including all 50 states and the District of Columbia). and 900 international sites, with support for 23 languages so this information will have a broad reach, which is especially important at this time.

First, second and fourth graders at Downingtown Area School District’s Shamona Creek Elementary School have colored specially-designed notes to thank the poll workers. According to the Daily Local News, Chester County Voter Services Director Karen Barsoum and Chester County Commissioners’ Chair and Election Board Chair Josh Maxwell joined some of the second graders in Julie Dimino’s art class, to help color the cards and to thank the students for their contribution to the County’s election process. “Having the students color these notes of thanks will brighten the day of the thousands of poll workers who will be based at our precincts from early morning to late at night on Election Day,” said Barsoum. “Meeting with the students as they colored the cards also gave us the chance to share with them how important voting is in our country.” Shamona Creek Elementary School Art Teacher Julie Dimino said, “The students and I enjoyed showing our appreciation to our local volunteers. We wanted to illustrate our gratitude for all their volunteer efforts in the 2024 elections.”</span></p>

Anthony, and placed their “I Voted” stickers on her headstone. The tradition grew so much that the cemetery had to place protective plexiglass over the headstone. Well this year, another part of Susan B. Anthony’s life (and death) will be part of the election process. From Oct. 26 to Nov. 3, </span><a href="https://www.campustimes.org/2024/10/07/early-voting-at-the-susan-b-anthony-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Susan B. Anthony Museum and House (SBA) will be holding early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last April, ahead of the March presidential primaries, the SBA House opened its doors to early voters for the first time. According to President and CEO of the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House, Deborah Hughes, the organization aims to share the story of Anthony’s fight for voting rights, and has wanted to become a voting site for a long time. “We thought it was really appropriate [to become a polling site], but things just opened up to make that possible recently. One is that we have early voting in New York state now.” The only space big enough on the museum’s campus was the carriage house, a larger space built in the ’90s to accommodate educational events in conjunction with the visitor center. It wasn’t until this winter that a second door was installed on the carriage house so that the space could become eligible as a polling place. “We had approached the Monroe County Board of Elections and said ‘We would really like to be a voting site, is that possible?’ They came and they had a whole set of criteria that they had to look at,” Hughes said. “And one of the pieces was you need to have two doors, just for safety and security.” The move to install the door had been in the works long before though, according to Hughes. However, it wasn’t until early voting became a serious possibility that the organization was able to expedite the project in time for the presidential primaries. According to Hughes, “everybody who shows up to vote, everybody who stands in line, no matter who they vote for, is a courageous person. And I just — I can’t imagine how much fun [it would be] to take that daring step right here.”</span></p>

The report explains the critical processes that take place after voting ends that help to protect the accuracy, integrity and security of our election system. In a time where voter confidence is suffering and election denialism is surging, it’s important that voters understand how their vote is counted, why results take time, and how results are verified and finalized. In addition, this report seeks to help voters resist further partisan divides and potential misinformation as we look ahead to the November 2024 elections. Although they play an important role in protecting the security and accuracy of our elections, post-election processes are much less understood than the policies and requirements for casting a vote. This new report outlines the steps that occur beginning Election Day to make sure that election results are verified, accurate, and secure.   Using MAP’s Democracy Maps, which track dozens of election-related policies, this report illustrates how state laws vary on important points of post-election processes—such as ballot pre-processing, post-election audits, and the certification process. The report also details why these differences lead to certain predictable outcomes, such as some states taking longer than others to release their final election results. </span></p>

In this historic election year, questions persist about the stability of democratic institutions, election fairness, and voter suppression in marginalized communities. The systematic exclusion of millions with felony convictions should be front and center in these debates. This report from the Sentencing Project updates and expands upon a quarter century of work chronicling the scope and distribution of felony disenfranchisement in the United States.</span></p>

Councilwoman Joanna Bryn Smith proposed the election worker protection ordinance, saying it would provide an additional option for law enforcement to charge those accused of a range of alleged crimes against poll workers. Council Vice Chairman Brian Thornton said he condemns violence but spoke with county District Attorney Sam Sanguedolce and was informed the ordinance could be “inviting lawsuits” against the county because laws already exist at the state level. Thornton also read portions of an email from county Election Director Emily Cook, concluding the proposed ordinance is “ultimately a waste of time” because “there are no legitimate actionable offenses that were not already addressed as protections for these workers under the law.” Bryn Smith argued her ordinance is needed, particularly at a time when the county has placed boulders around the county’s Penn Place Building in downtown Wilkes-Barre for security purposes. Thornton suggested the council draft a resolution or proclamation condemning violence against election workers.</span></p>

The filing on the evening of October 2 came after the U.S. appeals court earlier that day blocked the CFTC&#8217;s effort to prohibit derivatives trading platform KalshiEX LLC from listing elections contracts, pending an appeal. A lower court had previously allowed Americans to place those bets. &#8220;The public&#8217;s interest lies with prompt disposition of this appeal,&#8221; the CFTC&#8217;s filing with the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit read. The agency argued that election contracts are susceptible to market manipulation, and that the contracts could create the perception that the integrity of elections is at risk. &#8220;[This] would put the CFTC in the position of investigating such activities in election markets, well outside of its traditional areas of responsibility,&#8221; it said. The agency has asked the court for oral arguments in early December and noted that Kalshi has previously indicated it will oppose the effort to fast-track the appeal. In dismissing an earlier motion by the CFTC to pause the D.C. District Court&#8217;s order allowing Kalshi to list and trade election contracts, the appeals court said the regulator failed to show how the agency or the public interest would be harmed by Kalshi&#8217;s &#8220;event&#8221; contracts, as it had argued.</span></p>

David Proctor </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/federal-judge-wont-delay-ruling-limiting-alabama-absentee-ballot-assistance-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected a state request to delay a ruling l</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">imiting the scope of a new state law criminalizing some forms of assistance with absentee ballots. In a 10-page filing, Proctor wrote that his Sept. 24 ruling — applied to the ability of blind, disabled and illiterate voters to choose people to assist them with applying for absentee voting — reflected the federal Voting Rights Act and took issue with the Alabama attorney general’s office’s characterization of his decision.  “In reading Defendant’s Motion, one would think the court has enjoined Defendant from enforcing the entirety of Alabama Senate Bill 1 (‘SB 1’),” he wrote. “To the contrary, the court entered a limited injunction, which prohibits enforcement of SB 1 only to the extent that law is preempted by Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act (‘VRA’). Particularly in light of the tone of Defendant’s Motion, it is appropriate to put the court’s limited injunction into perspective.” Proctor’s rejection comes after the attorney general’s office filed a request October 2 that a court</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/04/ags-office-files-opposition-to-preliminary-injunction-in-lawsuit-over-voter-inclusion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not issue a preliminary injunction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a lawsuit over the state’s efforts to remove some voters from the voter roll. In the 32-page filing, the state wrote that the plaintiffs challenging the removal misunderstood Secretary of State Wes Allen’s August news release to read it as proposing a systematic and untimely voter purge that targets naturalized citizens. “They were just wrong about the nature of the process, which they said would ‘immediately inactivate … and remove’ thousands of naturalized citizens,” they wrote. “…There’s a world of difference between that accusation and the reality hidden by the ellipsis: Secretary Allen instructed registrars to ‘inactivate and initiate steps necessary to remove all individuals who are not United States Citizens.” </span></p>

The error in the database used by the state’s Motor Vehicles Division affects people with pre-1996 licenses who had received replacements. They had been registered to vote for decades, but were never asked to prove their citizenship because of the “data coding oversight” in the system. America First Legal and Jennifer Wright, the former head of the Arizona attorney general’s Election Integrity Unit, filed the lawsuit on behalf of Strong Communities Foundation of Arizona, a nonprofit led by conservative activist Merissa Hamilton. According to the lawsuit, Hamilton’s group filed a records request after news of the issue broke seeking “a subset of the Statewide Voter Registration Database (VRDB) that contains only those registered (active and inactive) voters that” were part of the data glitch. A few days later, the Secretary of State’s Office responded saying that the records “will be made available for inspection at the soonest available time and to the extent the law allows access. But no access will occur before the 2024 General Election.” Fontes’ office said that releasing that information now “would create confusion, chaos, uncertainty and consternation among the public — all of which is avoidable, and indeed must be avoided amid an ongoing election during which we expect to receive record turnout.” The group is suing to make those records available before early voting begins on Oct. 9. “We are suing the state of Arizona for refusing to provide the list of 218,000 voters who failed or refused to establish citizenship. It is absolutely imperative that we stop the dire threat of illegal alien voting, which is the gravest form of foreign election interference,” Miller said in a press release about the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arizona Supreme Court ruled on Friday, affirming the Sept. 19 decision of a trial court that </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2024/10/05/proposition-140-open-primaries-ballot-measure-supreme-court-ruling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backers of Proposition 140 had gathered enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and that even if they hadn’t, the court could not legally order election officials to disregard votes for it. The ballot measure, known as the Make Arizona Elections Fair Act, would allow all registered voters to choose from all the candidates in the primary, regardless of their party affiliation, and the top vote-getters would advance to the general election, even if they don’t represent different parties. The goal of the campaign is to eliminate extreme partisan influence in elections. Opponents of the measure, including the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, challenged it in court, claiming that the campaign had gathered too many duplicate signatures, putting it beneath the threshold to make it on the ballot.</span></p>

The Appeals Court in September issued an administrative stay that allowed state officials to implement the “wet signature” rule while parties in a lawsuit over the regulation prepared court filings. On October 3, the appeals court converted the administrative stay into a stronger delay to give state officials time to prepare their appeal of a federal district judge’s preliminary injunction against the rule that limits the use of electronic signatures on voter registration forms.</span></p>

The county Board of Election Commissioners voted 2-1 to appeal Circuit Court Judge Chris Thyer’s ruling that they should conduct early voting at one of three contested sites in West Memphis. He also asked attorneys on both sides to file an appeal so the high court could offer clarity on early voting statutory construction. Plaintiffs’ attorney Jennifer Standerfer said her clients were satisfied with at least one early voting location and would not take the case higher, but Republican election commissioners Frank Barton and Anita Bell voted to appeal Thyer’s order; Democratic member James Pulliaum voted against it. The appeal was filed Friday on behalf of the board by attorney Joe Rogers. The appeal only challenges the decision regarding early voting at Seventh Street Church of Christ in West Memphis, which Thyer found County Clerk Paula Brown appropriately designated under her authority.</span></p>

You’re as defiant as any defendant this court has ever seen,” Barrett told her in handing down the sentence. “You are no hero. You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.” Jurors found Peters guilty in August for allowing a man to misuse a security card to access to the Mesa County election system and for being deceptive about that person’s identity. Before being sentenced, Peters insisted that everything she did to try to unroot what she believed was fraud was for the greater good. “I’ve never done anything with malice to break the law. I’ve only wanted to serve the people of Mesa County,” she told the court. “I’ve let you go on enough about this,” Judge Barrett said. “The votes are the votes.” Later, the judge noted that Peters has kept up public appearances in broadcasts to sympathetic audiences for her own benefit. “It’s just more lies. No objective person believes them. No, at the end of the day, you cared about the jets, the podcasts and people fawning over you,” Barrett said.</span></p>

The voters — Diahann Phillips, Alison Scofield and Albert Bottone — sought the arrests of Wanda Geter-Pataky, deputy head of the city’s Democratic Town Committee, and City Councilwoman Eneida Martinez based on accusations that they illegally had put absentee ballots in drop boxes to be counted. The three voters sought to challenge those conclusions through a legal mechanism known as a “writ of error,” which they filed with the state Appellate Court and the Supreme Court then transferred to its own docket. The Supreme Court did not consider the validity of Welch’s legal conclusions. Rather, it ruled that the three voters were not “aggrieved” by the judge’s denial of the arrest warrants “because they do not have a specific, personal, and legal interest in the arrest of those who allegedly violate election law,” according to the decision, written by Justice Gregory T. D’Auria. He quoted a past state Supreme Court decision explaining that such a personal legal interest is different from “a general interest that all members of the community share.”</span></p>

Hinkle that said allowing people to register to vote for the November election beyond Oct. 7 would overload supervisors of elections as they prepare for what could be “the most closely watched election.”  The Florida chapters of the League of Women Voters and the NAACP wanted the court to order Gov. Ron DeSantis to reopen the voter registration process for at least 10 more days. The groups argued that Floridians obeying mandatory evacuation orders on Monday shouldn’t have to choose between their safety and their right to vote. DeSantis on Monday declined to extend the deadline because the hurricane hadn’t hit yet.  Hinkle didn’t buy that argument, saying during the Wednesday afternoon emergency hearing in Tallahassee that people could have registered to vote online. “I hope it didn’t come off as insensitive. … If they had evacuated, they still could have registered while evacuating,” Hinkle said, noting that he didn’t think the online registration form would take more than five to 10 minutes to fill out.</span></p>

The group’s attorneys claim that the “massive and widespread disruptions and devastation” caused by Helene in the state “likely prevented tens of thousands of Georgia residents from timely registering to vote because they lacked internet access, could not travel, lacked access to postal services, or had no operational county election office.” They are seeking to extend the deadline until next Monday.</span></p>

McAfee dismissed the case because Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger complied with state law when he certified the Dominion voting system as “safe and practicable” before it went into use in 2020. “Although applicant may firmly believe that the secretary’s current processes are ‘nonsensical’ and ‘appalling,’ and good-faith concerns over how to better secure our elections should be taken seriously, this matter is currently one that must be deferred to the policymaking branches,” McAfee wrote in the dismissal. The GOP lawsuit argued that the encryption keys that protect passwords and other information for voting machines were revealed within election databases released by four Georgia counties in response to records requests. The Republican Party alleged that the Dominion voting system doesn’t meet federal standards and asked McAfee to order Raffensperger to take steps to meet those standards. Attorneys for the secretary of state’s office said the voting system has been certified both by the federal government and by Raffensperger himself.</span></p>

The suit, filed in the Fulton County Superior Court, seeks judgment on whether or not the half-dozen rules are within the State Election Board’s authority and/or are “unreasonable.” “The SEB’s Sept. 20 rules lack statutory authorization, conflict with and improperly expand provisions of the Election Code, impermissibly intrude on the exclusive authority of the Secretary of State and county superintendents, and neither promote uniformity nor are conducive to the fair, legal, and orderly conduct of elections,” the filing reads. “&#8230; The rules therefore exceed the SEB’s statutory authority and should be declared invalid.” The rules challenged by the Cobb Elections Board were passed by the State Election Board on Sept. 20 — less than two months from Election Day.</span></p>

The rule the Muscogee County Board opposes is the “Hand Count” rule. The rule states that after the polling place closes, and all votes have been cast, three sworn precinct polling officers will independently count the number of votes cast in each ballot box. They will not tabulate the vote totals for each candidate. The Muscogee County board alleges the new voting rule implemented by the state board contradicts Georgia law, leaving the board in a state of legal uncertainty saying, “Compliance with the Hand Counting Rule runs contrary to O.C.G.A ss 21-2-420, which requires that after completing the required accounting and related documentation for a precinct, ‘the poll manager and at least one assistance manager shall… immediately deliver all required documentation and election materials to the election superintendent.&#8217;” In addition to claiming the rule contradicts Georgia law, the Muscogee Board says hand counting the ballots would delay election results and increase voter distrust. “Hand-counting also introduces more possibilities for human error, which creates opportunities for misinformation about the certainty of election results,” the petition reads.

According to the</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-03-Application-for-writ-of-mandamus.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which names Nadine Williams— the Director of Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections — as the defendant, only nine of 45 qualified Republican poll workers were allegedly hired to work during the early voting period. And only six out of 62 qualified Republican poll workers were hired to work on Election Day. The lawsuit also alleges that Williams violated state law by not directly hiring poll workers from a list of qualified candidates submitted to her, instead delegating the duty to temp agencies and the managers of individual polling locations. The lawsuit asks the court to order Williams to hire Republican poll workers from the lists provided to her, or submit written statements to each poll worker on the list explaining why they can’t be hired. </span></p>

The alleged double voting was the result of voters casting both absentee and in-person ballots during the primary on Aug. 6. It was caught shortly afterward by voting officials and investigated by local police before Macomb County prosecutor Peter Lucido ultimately declined to prosecute. But Attorney General Dana Nessel announced felony charges against those voters, as well as three St. Clair Shores assistant clerks, after her office conducted another investigation into the double votes. The four voters are accused of two separate felonies: one count of voting absentee and in person, and one count of offering to vote more than once. The combined maximum penalty for those violations is nine years in prison. Three assistant clerks also face felony charges. Patricia Guciardo and Emily McClintock are both charged with the same felonies as the voters, as well as an additional count of falsifying election returns or records, which has a maximum sentence of five years. The third, Molly Brasure, faces two counts of falsifying election records and two counts each of voting absentee and in person, and offering to vote more than once.</span></p>

It argues the state already has a robust process for ensuring noncitizens do not vote (which is illegal nationwide) and accuses Republicans of seeking a “drastic change” in the home stretch of the election cycle that is not allowed under federal laws. The lawsuit, filed by former President Donald Trump’s campaign along with the Nevada GOP and Republican National Committee, accused state election officials of not adopting regulations to verify that people on the voter rolls are citizens and that the state has not systematically removed noncitizens from the voter rolls. It says this disadvantages Republicans, and calls for the judge to require officials to conduct systematic voter roll maintenance ahead of the November election. The lawsuit was the fourth filed by national Republican organizations this year in Nevada, and all other three have either been dismissed or denied but are in various stages of appeal. Republicans have said these lawsuits are necessary to bolster trust in elections, but Democrats argue the suits are destined to fail and are simply a ploy to diminish trust in elections.</span></p>

The judge sided with Republican-led challenges to the law arguing that it conflicts with individual county charters. Twenty New York counties are chartered, meaning they have locally drafted and approved laws outlining the structure and authority of county government, and there have been three separate amendments in the state Constitution allowing for and protecting counties&#8217; abilities to govern through charters. At issue is a law passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in December 2023 that moves several local elections outside of New York City to even-numbered years starting in 2025, with the exception of some city or village elections, and races for county clerk, sheriff, district attorneys, local judges and others protected in the state Constitution. “The prerequisites of a special law were not followed and the subject matter of the Even Year Election Law is inherently a local issue as it affects no state offices. The Even Year Election Law is unconstitutional as specifically prohibited by Article IX of the New York State Constitution,” Judge Gerard Neri wrote in his ruling. Neri noted the fact that the law doesn’t apply to races like county clerk and sheriff would confuse voters. The judge also argued that maintaining the election schedule as it means that local interests would not have to compete for attention with more widely covered state and national issues. “Be it in the local paper, television, radio, online, or one’s mailbox, the competition for a voter’s attention is fierce. New York and the Plaintiff Counties are home to some of the most competitive House of Representative Races, and with that competition comes massive spending on advertising. There is simply no way local races can compete and obtain media attention, paid or earned, in that maelstrom,” Neri wrote.</span></p>

The complaint filed by the RNC and North Carolina Republican Party takes issue with how the board is applying North Carolina’s Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act (UMOVA), which allows for military members and U.S. citizens living abroad to vote in state and federal elections. The lawsuit alleges the state election board is incorrectly using state and federal law to extend voter qualifications to people living abroad who aren’t residents. It says the state election board’s guidance to county election officials advises that voters who never resided in North Carolina but are attempting to register to vote in the state are exempt from the HAVA requirement. Republicans are asking a state court to declare that the North Carolina election board’s application of the law conflicts with how the state constitution defines eligible voters and is therefore unconstitutional. They also want the court to void the guidance issued to clerks in September and block the board from accepting voter registration forms from individuals who don’t have the proper HAVA requirements. The plaintiffs want the election board to instruct county clerks to not process ballots returned by voters who never lived in the state.</span></p>

Dismissing a request by the voting rights groups to block the enforcement of a rule requiring mail-in ballots to bear a handwritten date on the return envelope, the Supreme Court said the risk of confusing voters with a change in voting rules was too great. “This Court will neither impose nor countenance substantial alterations to existing laws and procedures during the pendency of an ongoing election,” the unsigned order said. Chief Justice Debra Todd filed a dissenting statement in which she argued that voters and election officials need guidance in the upcoming election. “We ought to resolve this important constitutional question now, before ballots may be improperly rejected and voters disenfranchised,” Todd said. The court also rejected a request by the Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania to stop county election officials from allowing voters to remedy mistakes on their mail-in ballots that would cause them to be disqualified.</span></p>

Josh Shapiro’s order implementing automatic voter registration in the commonwealth. Members of the Freedom Caucus led by state Rep. Dawn Keefer (R-York) asked the court to intercede in the case before the Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the case, which also challenged an executive order by President Joe Biden directing federal agencies to work with third-party organizations to improve ballot access across the country.  The high court’s decision sets the stage for arguments before the 3rd Circuit in December, after the Nov. 5 presidential election, in a case that would clarify which branches of government have the power to make election law under the U.S. Constitution, attorney Erick G. Kaardal said.</span></p>

Based on a series of stipulations reached between the parties to the suit, plaintiffs Republican National Committee, Montgomery County Republican Committee Chairman Christian Nascimento and Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick withdrew the petition for a special and preliminary injunction, court documents state. The petitioners filed a civil complaint in court last month, accusing Montgomery County election officials of sending out mail-in ballots prior to wrapping up “logic and accuracy testing,” which is mandated by a Pennsylvania Department of State directive to ensure the functioning of equipment and systems ahead of an election.</span></p>

The suit is in response to an August Executive Order from Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed in which he said increased election security by approving actions like &#8220;best-in-the-nation voter list maintenance.&#8221; Youngkin&#8217;s executive order required the Department of Elections to send a notice to individuals whose names could be removed from the roles, but that one notice isn&#8217;t enough, the statement says&#8211;especially since they say there is no requirement to confirm the accuracy of the DMV info the notice relies upon. &#8220;Individual voters have less than 14 days to respond to the notice in order to avoid removal — a burden that falls disproportionately on naturalized US citizens,&#8221; the League of Women Voters said.</span></p>

The order says the town violated federal law aimed at making voting easier for people with disabilities. The preliminary injunction states that the town’s clerk and three-member board of supervisors violated the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, by failing to provide at least one “voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities” at its single polling place in the April 2 and Aug. 13 elections.  According to court documents, the town’s former clerk Suzanne Pinnow cited “the controversial nature of electronic voting machines” during a June 2023 town board meeting as part of the justification for moving to hand-counted, paper ballots. Meeting minutes show she also claims that municipalities with “less than 7,000 voters” are “not required” to use the voting machines. The injunction stems from a joint agreement between U.S. investigators and Thornapple officials in which the town agreed to provide one electronic voting machine at the town’s sole polling place, and that the “voting system is, for the full period that the polling place is required to be open under Wisconsin State law, plugged into a functioning electrical outlet, turned on, and readily visible and accessible to voters.” The town has also agreed to not enforce its June 2023 resolution “to stop use of the electronic voting machine,” post signs alerting voters that the voting machine is available for use and allow representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice to ensure the court’s order is being followed during the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
