														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Summer Reading 2024</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s on your list?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend marks the unofficial start to summer. Camping, trips to the beach, picnics and primary elections in more than half of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While elections officials will be busy conducting primaries and preparing for the November General Election, hopefully the summer of 2024 means a bit of time away from the office with friends, family and maybe a good book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like us and simply cannot leave work at work, we’ve pulled together some election-related “beach” reading for your summer travels or just for those quiet times on your porch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve linked to the books through their publisher or Amazon descriptions, however you may want to also consider making your purchases through</span><a href="https://bookshop.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bookshop.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which makes donations to local bookstores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy reading. Happy summer. Hopefully happy time off.</span></p>

The Voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Troubling Story of How the Supreme Court Has Undermined Voting Rights, Joshua Douglas– In The Court v. The Voters, law professor Joshua Douglas takes us behind the scenes of significant cases in voting rights—some surprising and unknown, some familiar—to investigate the historic crossroads that have irrevocably changed our elections and the nation. In crisp and accessible prose, Douglas tells the story of each case, sheds light on the intractable election problems we face as a result, and highlights the unique role the highest court has played in producing a broken electoral system. Douglas charts infamous cases like: Bush v. Gore, which opened the door to many election law claims; Citizens United, which contributed to skewed representation—but perhaps not in the way you might think; Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the vital protections of the Voting Rights Act; and Crawford v. Marion County Elections Board, which allowed states to enforce voter ID laws and make it harder for people to vote The Court v. The Voters powerfully reminds us of the tangible, real-world effects from the Court’s voting rights decisions. While we can—and should—lament the democracy that might have been, Douglas argues that we can—and should—double down in our efforts to protect the right to vote.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691257716/a-real-right-to-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Real Right to Vote: How a Constitutional Amendment Can Safeguard American Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Throughout history, too many Americans have been disenfranchised or faced needless barriers to voting. Part of the blame falls on the Constitution, which does not contain an affirmative right to vote. The Supreme Court has made matters worse by failing to protect voting rights and limiting Congress’s ability to do so. The time has come for voters to take action and push for an amendment to the Constitution that would guarantee this right for all. Drawing on troubling stories of state attempts to disenfranchise military voters, women, African Americans, students, former felons, Native <img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11244" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-23-at-11.51.40 AM-186x300.png" alt="" width="186" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-23-at-11.51.40 AM-186x300.png 186w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-23-at-11.51.40 AM.png 618w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />Americans, and others, Richard Hasen argues that American democracy can and should do better in assuring that all eligible voters can cast a meaningful vote that will be fairly counted. He shows how a constitutional right to vote can deescalate voting wars between political parties that lead to endless rounds of litigation and undermine voter confidence in elections, and can safeguard democracy against dangerous attempts at election subversion like the one we witnessed in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. The path to a constitutional amendment is undoubtedly hard, especially in these polarized times. A Real Right to Vote explains what’s in it for conservatives who have resisted voting reform and reveals how the pursuit of an amendment can yield tangible dividends for democracy long before ratification.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://source.wustl.edu/bookshelf/learning-to-disagree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to Disagree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In a tense cultural climate, is it possible to disagree productively and respectfully without compromising our convictions? Spanning a range of challenging issues — including critical race theory, sexual assault, campus protests and clashes over religious freedom — highly regarded thought leader and law professor John Inazu helps us engage honestly and empathetically with people whose viewpoints we find strange, wrong, or even dangerous. As a constitutional scholar, legal expert, and former litigator, John has spent his career learning how to disagree well with other people. In “Learning to Disagree,” John shares memorable stories and draws on the practices that legal training imparts — seeing the complexity in every issue and inhabiting the mindset of an opposing point of view — to help us handle daily encounters and lifelong relationships with those who see life very differently than we do.</span></p>

Dionne and Miles Rapoport argue that universal participation in our elections should be a cornerstone of our system. It would be the surest way to protect against voter suppression and the active <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10552" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/constitution-300x282.png" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/constitution-300x282.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/constitution-1024x962.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/constitution-768x722.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/constitution.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />disenfranchisement of a large share of our citizens. And it would create a system true to the Declaration of Independence’s aspirations by calling for a government based on the consent of all of the governed. It’s not as radical or utopian as it sounds: in Australia, where everyone is required to vote (Australians can vote “none of the above,” but they have to show up), 91.9 percent of Australians voted in the last major election in 2019, versus 60.1 percent in America’s 2016 presidential race. Australia hosts voting-day parties and actively celebrates this key civic duty. It is time for the United States to take a major leap forward and recognize voting as both a fundamental civil right and a solemn civic duty required of every eligible U.S. citizen.</span></p>

All Presidents have nightmares. This one is about to come true. Matthew Keating, a one-time Navy SEAL—and a past president—has always defended his family as staunchly as he has his country. Now those defenses are under attack. A madman abducts Keating&#8217;s teenage daughter, Melanie—turning every parent&#8217;s deepest fear into a matter of national security. As the world watches in real time, Keating embarks on a one-man special-ops mission that tests his strengths: as a leader, a warrior, and a father.</span></p>

Parents and caregivers can be prepared to help them understand and process the messages around them by using this book. What to Do When the News Scares You provides a way to help children put scary events into perspective. And, if children start to worry or become anxious about things they’ve heard, there are ideas to help them calm down and cope. This book also helps children identify reporters’ efforts to add excitement to the story which may also make threats seem more imminent, universal, and extreme. Read and complete the activities in What to Do When the News Scares You with your child to help them to understand the news in context—who, what, where, when, how—as a means of introducing a sense of perspective.

It was a relatively quiet day “at the polls” everywhere with few problems reported.  In </span><a href="https://localnews8.com/politics/idaho-politics/2024/05/21/secretary-of-state-explains-2024-primary-election-technical-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Secretary of State Phil McGrane said there were initially some minor issues with getting results from local elections offices, but all results were eventually obtained. &#8220;Part of the process is just uploading the results,” McGrane said. “Part of our election security measures is that the equipment that we use to tabulate results is never connected to the internet, and so there is a process to go through to get the results uploaded to share with the public. And it was part of that upload process where we ran into a couple of errors in Bonneville County.&#8221; In </span><a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/no-major-issues-reported-so-far-at-election-polls-in-georgia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Secretary of State Brad Rafensperger said elections were running smoothly statewide, with an average wait time of just two minutes reported at polling stations. He expressed satisfaction with the preparations made by county election officials and the state office, highlighting the absence of major issues. &#8220;Virtually none, nothing I really can report on. So it&#8217;s been very, very quiet. So we’re pleased with that,&#8221; Raffensperger said. &#8220;The counties understand how important this year is and how highly scrutinized it is by the focal center for elections in America. But Georgia does lead in elections. We’ve shown that we have the cleanest voter rolls and the shortest lines because we put it into state law. But we’ve worked with the counties to make sure that counties had the resources to keep those lines short. We understand how important it is.&#8221; The </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-2024-primary-voters-head-to-the-polls-on-election-day/EMGFGBF25ZCG3ID4LM2ES7HHYE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Voter Page went offline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for about an hour during the primary Tuesday afternoon, leaving voters unable to check their precinct locations, find registration information and view sample ballots. Voting at precincts wasn’t affected. And as with every election, there were some isolated issues at polling places. In </span><a href="https://www.lagrangenews.com/2024/05/21/east-vernon-polling-place-moved-to-grace-baptist-due-to-wreck/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troup County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a polling place had to be relocated due to a traffic accident in front of the polling place. Georgia College and State University students helped run some of the polling precincts in </span><a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/local/milledgeville/georgia-college-students-work-election-polls/93-9de44003-b432-4b3d-9e95-96012ac67be6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milledgeville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is part of an internship that gives these students the opportunity to receive an election administration certificate.  These students say they&#8217;re happy to serve the community and educate them on their right to vote. Lauren Trinkwalder is an upcoming senior at Georgia College. &#8220;It feels important to be a part of a civic process like this,&#8221; Trinkwalder said. Turnout for this week’s primary in </span><a href="https://www.wkyufm.org/news/2024-05-22/kentucky-secretary-of-state-says-primary-turnout-bolstered-by-early-voting-despite-calls-by-some-for-repeal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was only about 13%, which Secretary of State Michael Adams says was bolstered by early voting. The number of early voters has increased every year since being introduced in 2020. Adams says turnout would likely have been lower without the three-day early voting period. Adams says he’s expecting the presidential contest to increase state turnout to around 60% this fall. He added his office will work to increase polling locations and awareness about early voting over the next several months. Attorney General Russell Coleman said his office’s </span><a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/briefs/hotline-logs-one-report-of-election-day-vote-buying-or-selling-more-kentuckians-voted-early/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Integrity Command Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received one possible report of vote buying or selling among calls it took Tuesday morning.  Coleman reported that in the first few hours of voting in Tuesday’s primary, the center received 11 complaints from Barren, Boone, Boyd and Fayette counties. “When the polls close and the winners are announced, I hope every Kentuckians can feel confident that our election is secure and our constitutional order has worked,” Coleman said. In </span><a href="https://www.wbko.com/2024/05/21/logan-county-election-worker-spends-decades-assisting-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, longtime poll worker Bobbie Jean Burnett, who has been on the job since the 60s, said she has seen countless changes when it comes to elections such as changes in how elections are done and the results of those elections. Her commitment to a fair voting process has never wavered. “I know that I can count on her. I know that if I needed to call her to fill in a spot during early voting, I could,” said Stacy Watkins, Logan County Clerk. “She volunteers for everything and she’s just wonderful to have on our team.” In all vote-by-mail Oregon, the results were really the biggest news on Tuesday. But for </span><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2024/05/in-multnomah-county-staggeringly-high-last-minute-voting-leads-to-uncertainty-about-final-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multnomah County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was the procrastinators that made the headlines. At the close of business Monday, the half-million-plus registered voters in Oregon’s most populous county had gotten only about 105,000 ballots to the county elections office. But 93,600 or so ballots poured in through in-person drop-offs Tuesday or via the mail Tuesday and Wednesday, said county spokesperson Denis Theriault. In </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/05/22/eugene-rejects-star-voting-rating-based-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene, Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters said no to a ballot measure that would have implemented the STAR voting system. And Democrat Tobian Reed will face Republican Dennis Linthicum in the </span><a href="https://www.koin.com/news/elections/oregon-secretary-state-candidates-05212024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secretary of state’s race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November. </span></p>

In </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/05/21/arizona-republicans-set-up-a-ballot-measure-to-squash-future-ballot-measures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lawmakers have placed a measure on the November ballot that would severely restrict direct democracy by imposing strict geographic requirements on where organizers must gather signatures. Right now, petitioners need to pass just one statewide test to qualify a measure: They need to gather more signatures than a minimum number defined in the state constitution, regardless of where the signatures come from. (The threshold is 10 or 15 percent of all votes cast in the most recent governor’s race, depending on whether the proposal would amend the constitution.) If the new measure passes, it would create 30 separate tests instead: Initiatives would need to meet that same threshold of signatures in each and every one of Arizona’s 30 legislative districts. In the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/22/dc-voting-ballot-initiative-signatures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, circulators are collecting signatures for I-83, a proposed ballot measure that would allow about 74,000 people registered as “unaffiliated” to vote in D.C.’s primary elections starting in 2026. II-83, would also implement a ranked-choice balloting system in which voters could rank candidates for an office in order of preference. In </span><a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/22/missouri-voters-will-face-ballot-question-about-ranked-choice-voting/73787949007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislators approved a resolution to put a measure opposing ranked choice voting on the November ballot.  The resolution states that under no circumstances “shall a voter be permitted to cast a ballot in a manner that results in the ranking of candidates for a particular office.” Despite this ban, the resolution also has a carve out for St. Louis, which implemented an approval voting system in 2020 for its municipal elections. In </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/05/22/eugene-rejects-star-voting-rating-based-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene, Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week, voters rejected a proposal for a new rating-based election system. If the measure had passed, the city would have adopted the STAR voting system in 2026 in races for city council, mayor and the city’s water and electric board starting in 2026. Under the system, the public would rate multiple candidates on a scale of zero to five. The two highest scorers would then advance to an automatic run-off election. In </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-open-primary-ballot-initiative-cdc43a6cee1447fd53d06de79bfb325d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Monae Johnson’s office said that it has certified a proposed constitutional amendment for the November ballot, that if approved, would move the state to a top two primary system. The South Dakota Open Primaries group submitted the necessary petition signatures earlier this month. The state’s candidates in gubernatorial, congressional, legislative and county races currently compete in partisan primaries. If voters approve it, the amendment would have them compete in a unified primary instead. “Today, almost 150,000 South Dakotans who are independent or unaffiliated voters have almost no say and are shut out of taxpayer-funded primary elections. It’s just flat wrong,” sponsor Joe Kirby said in a statement. “That’s why we’re so excited to be bringing forward this simple reform to make sure all registered voters have a voice in who leads our state. We need to let all voters vote,” Kirby said. South Dakota’s GOP chairman, state Sen. John Wiik, has been opposed, saying he sees “no good coming out of it for the Republican Party.” Democratic Party Executive Director Dan Ahlers has said the party hasn’t taken a position, but already allows “no party affiliation” and independent voters to participate in its primary, along with registered Democrats. </span></p>

In the </span><a href="https://www.kbia.org/2024-05-22/s3e16-professionalizing-the-election-field-one-oreo-at-a-time-with-ohios-aaron-ockerman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 22 episode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fey and Lennon speak with Aaron Ockerman, the Executive Director of the Ohio Association of Election Officials. They spoke about the importance – and power – of state associations, how having a non-election administrator in charge can strengthen an association, as well as the role a state association can play in better preparing election officials, both old and new, for the increasingly complex nature of their jobs. In the latest two episodes of </span><a href="https://www.aei.org/tag/the-voting-booth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Voting Booth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast from The American Enterprise Institute, hosts John Fortier and Donald Palmer speak with Doug Lews about HAVA and the beginning of the Election Assistance Commission. In another episode they talk with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Rafensperger about fortifying voter trust and confidence in elections.

Shortly after the 2020 election, Trump demanded that Georgia officials “find 11,780 votes” so that he could win the state. The recorded phone conversation is a linchpin in the Fulton County racketeering case against Trump. Refusing that demand, Raffensperger—a lifelong Republican—received death threats from enraged Trumpists, and the State Senate still wants to investigate him for it. But the politician tells Remnick that he hasn’t lost faith in his party. He believes he can convince election deniers of the fairness of Georgia’s methods. And, by the way, that story line on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” about the Georgia crime of giving a person water while they wait in line to vote? Raffensperger has a suggestion for Larry David.</span></p>

House bill to require</span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-bill-noncitizen-voting-could-have-unique-impact-north-dakota"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections could have unintended consequences for North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the only state that does not require voter registration. U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-ND, said he’s working on an amendment to the House bill that would exempt the measure from applying to North Dakota, and that he’s successfully introduced similar amendments to other voting-related bills in the past.  “Without that amendment, the way I read it … North Dakotans would have to prove citizenship before the primary and before the general election every two years, or they would force us into voter registration,” Armstrong told the North Dakota Monitor. Armstrong said he supports the premise of the House bill, but that he would vote no if the exemption is not adopted. The amendment would mirror an exemption already provided to North Dakota under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which sought to regulate and streamline how states register voters. Five other states — Wyoming, Wisconsin, Idaho, New Hampshire and Minnesota — are also exempt from the act. North Dakota Secretary of State Michael Howe said that while he was not familiar with the specifics of the House bill, the state already has adequate protections against noncitizens casting votes.</span></p>

The heart of HCR 2056 is an effort to get final election results in a more timely fashion. It proposes to do that by requiring that ballots be counted at each polling location and restricting when and where Arizonans can drop off their early ballots if they haven&#8217;t put them in the mail. All that is designed to avoid a process that now can take weeks, and not just because ballots have to be transported to a central counting location. What also can delay results in verifying the signatures on those early ballot envelopes is that they can be delivered by voters to polling places right up to 7 p.m. on Election Day. What&#8217;s in the measure still would allow Arizonans to bring their early ballots to polling places on Election Day. But the could not be simply dropped off, as is now the practice. Instead, the individual would have to first stand in line to present identification. Secretary of State Adrian Fontes told members of the Senate Elections Committee there are a series of problems with the proposal, ranging from insufficient funding to purchase all those tabulators that will now be needed at each polling location &#8212; actually, two at each site &#8212; to what he said is less convenience for some individuals who will lose their ability to drop off their early ballots at vote centers on Saturday, Sunday or Monday before the election.</span></p>

Tim Walz (D) signed an</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CCRHF4772.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> omnibus bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law May 17 with multiple provisions that will benefit voters, including one that establishes a </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/minnesota-governor-signs-pro-voting-package/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Democracy thrives when everyone’s voice is heard. Today, we’re ensuring a strong democracy by prioritizing accessibility and voter protections,” Walz said in a</span><a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/#/detail/appId/1/id/624826"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “With this bill we are breaking barriers that stand in the way of voting, protecting fair democratic processes, and paving the way for Minnesota to continue to lead the nation in voter turnout.” The state’s new Voting Rights Act will prohibit voter suppression and vote dilution, so that no one is allowed to deny someone else the right to vote or make it so that their vote does not have the same weight as another person’s. Specifically, someone can claim this act has been violated if someone else’s action “results in a disparate burden” on a minority group and the burden is “related to social and historical conditions affecting members of the protected class.” The law also states that voters do not have to prove that someone acted with a discriminatory intent when passing a law or policy or committing an action to find that it’s a violation of the Minnesota Voting Rights Act. The attorney general, a county attorney or any individual or entity affected by a violation of this act can file an action in the district court for the county where the potential violation occurred. The law also ends prison gerrymandering, which means that Minnesota will alter its census counting so that incarcerated individuals will be counted at their last address, and not where they are currently incarcerated. The legislation will make it easier for college students to vote, reimbursing cities and counties that create polling locations on college campuses. It also requires many universities to provide voter registration forms to students during the fall and spring of each year. To combat the threat that artificial intelligence poses to the security of elections, a section of this law details the consequences for people using a deep fake to influence the election. Deep fakes are images, video and audio often generated by artificial intelligence technologies that reflect an event that never actually happened, but they look and sound realistic.</span></p>

Members of the Missouri House voted 97-43 Friday to pass the resolution. It has already passed the Senate and does not need the approval of Gov. Mike Parson. The resolution states that under no circumstances “shall a voter be permitted to cast a ballot in a manner that results in the ranking of candidates for a particular office.” Despite this ban, the resolution also has a carve out for St. Louis, which implemented an approval voting system in 2020 for its municipal elections. Through this system, voters can select as many candidates as they want in a primary. The top two candidates then go to a runoff election. The proposed constitutional amendment would not affect St. Louis’ system. In addition to the ban on ranked choice voting, the resolution also states that the candidate that receives the most votes in a political party primary will be the only candidate on the ballot for November for that party. The resolution also states that all elections will be by paper ballot or by “any mechanical method prescribed by law.” Also included within the proposed resolution is language stating that only U.S. citizens who are 18 or older, residents of Missouri and are residents of the political subdivision they vote in are entitled to vote in elections. That language does not make any changes to existing law. Rep. Ben Baker, R-Neosho, sponsored the House version of the resolution. He said he was not in favor of the exception for St. Louis. “I&#8217;m not okay with it, but this is where we&#8217;re at with this language of what we can get done in the body. I think it&#8217;s still a big step in the right direction,” Baker said. In speaking against the resolution, Rep. Eric Woods, D-Kansas City, said it was unnecessary and not the way to reassure people about election results. “There are other ways, other systems, other ideas that we can adopt to keep our democracy or our republic, whichever word you want to prefer to use, vibrant,” Woods said.</span></p>

Gov. Chris Sununu indicated he doesn’t support the bill, but has stopped short of committing to vetoing it. “I’m really not looking to make any significant changes,” Sununu said Wednesday in response to a question about the bill. “So any bill that got to my desk would have to be fulfilling a clear need of the system. Overall our election system in New Hampshire works really, really well.” The bill requires voters to produce a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization papers to demonstrate that they are a U.S. citizen before being allowed to register to vote. And it eliminates voters’ current ability to cast a ballot without having identifying documents on Election Day if they fill out a legally binding affidavit swearing to their identity.  While Senate Republicans voted their approval, they also passed an amendment that would pare back the House version of the bill. And they indicated they may seek further changes.  The House version had required that voters present citizenship documents every time they moved to a new polling area within the state and re-registered. The Senate-amended bill requires that voters produce the documents only the first time they register to vote in the state.</span></p>

Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a person to receive a payment or gift “distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining or delivering” an application. It would be a Class B felony, up to 20 years in prison, for a person to knowingly pay or provide a gift for a “third party to distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, complete, obtain or deliver.”  Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bill in March. Republican supporters of the measure said they were trying to prevent “ballot harvesting,” which they defined as third parties collecting and submitting absentee ballots. Evidence of ballot harvesting was not presented in the House or Senate. Democratic opponents said it would make it much harder for people with disabilities in rural areas to vote. Civil rights groups, including the ACLU of Alabama and the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, filed suit seeking to block the law on April 4. The complaint cited Alabama’s history of voter suppression and said that volunteers helping people with absentee ballots could be punished.</span></p>

The laws require voters who cast a provisional ballot to provide a photo ID by the Monday following an election for their vote to be counted, prohibit people from standing within 100 feet of a polling location, require county clerks to verify the voter’s signature on an absentee ballot application with the voter’s registration application, and shorten the deadline for in-person absentee ballot delivery. According to</span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thurston_v._League_of_Women_Voters_of_Ark.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the League of Women Voters argued the acts violated various provisions of the state Constitution and would make it more difficult for eligible voters to cast a ballot. The state argued the laws were enacted to protect election integrity and promote public confidence in election security.  After the circuit court held the laws unconstitutional and permanently enjoined their enforcement, the defendants appealed to the state’s high court, which overturned the ruling. Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Cody Hiland said, “We hold that the Acts are not clearly incompatible with the sections of the Arkansas Constitution as alleged by the Appellee; thus, we reverse and dismiss.”</span></p>

Gavin Newsom that the</span><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2024/05/20/lawsuit-against-oc-registrar-of-voters-board-of-supervisors-challenges-use-of-vote-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convenience of having multiple choices of locations that open for days ahead to cast a ballot breaks California election law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A 2016 law passed by the state legislature opened up the opportunity for counties to allow voters to cast a ballot at any vote center within their county, versus assigning people to traditional neighborhood polling places. Orange County was an early adopter in the state, and made the change to vote centers in 2020. Called the Voter’s Choice Act, the measure also allows counties to mail every registered voter a ballot, expand in-person early voting and provide secure ballot drop off locations throughout the county, according to the secretary of state’s website. The issue being raised by the lawsuit is with the electronic poll books that verify voter eligibility and whether a voter has already voted. The plaintiffs, who are all also current or former candidates for elected office in Orange County — argue connecting the electronic poll books at vote centers to the internet is in violation of a state election code that says “no part of the voting system shall be connected to the internet at any time” and that “no part of the voting system shall electronically receive or transmit election data through an exterior communication network” or “receive or transmit wireless communications or wireless data transfers.”</span></p>

Laura Hobbs, who lost in the March 5 primary election to represent District 2 on the county Board of Supervisors, asked a judge to &#8220;find moot the nomination of Allen Long as winner&#8221; of the election. The lawsuit further asked that if a judge finds substantial errors in how the election was conducted to either demand a new election or qualify Hobbs for a runoff election against Long. Hobbs also suggested a vote recount under guidelines that she established. Baker said he asked for the court hearing because Hobbs had not followed up on her court initial filing. She had also incorrectly named former registrar of voters Cathy Darling Allen as a defendant. Baker also said Hobbs had not properly notified Darling Allen and Long that they had been sued. Baker said he considered dismissing the lawsuit due to the problems with the lawsuit. The judge said he requested Monday&#8217;s hearing to have Hobbs properly file the lawsuit and serve notice to defendants.</span></p>

In January, Wang dismissed Peters&#8217; attempt to halt those proceedings.

Walker ruled that the law discriminated against noncitizens based on their status. He cited the harm the law inflicted on Veronica Herrera-Lucha and Norka Martínez, two of the plaintiffs in the case. Here, the record is clear that individuals like Ms. Herrera-Lucha and Ms. Martínez either can no longer work as paid canvassers or have had the terms of their employment substantially changed for fear of running afoul of the citizenship requirement. And defendant Moody has the authority to enforce the citizenship requirement,” Walker wrote in a 12-page ruling. “Here plaintiffs have suffered — and continue to suffer — irreparable injuries. Indeed, the individual members in this case have been unconstitutionally discriminated against based on their non-citizenship status,” he added. “This discrimination has prevented plaintiffs from registering new voters — a lost opportunity that cannot be remedied with monetary damages. The public has no interest in enforcing an unconstitutional law — especially one that facially discriminates based on alienage. On the other side of the ledger sits the individual plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection under the law. There is no comparison. Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction,” Walker concluded.</span></p>

Last year the county accepted a $2 million grant from the Alliance for Election Excellence, a nonprofit group. Republicans say the grant violates a 2021 Georgia law that prohibited local election officials from accepting outside assistance. In a lawsuit filed Friday in DeKalb County Superior Court, the RNC says it sought communications and other documents related to the grant and the county’s membership in the alliance in a series of records requests in November and December. The lawsuit says the county repeatedly delayed disclosing the information and ultimately did not disclose all relevant documents. The lawsuit says DeKalb violated the Georgia Open Records Act, naming Election Director Keisha Smith and other county officials as defendants. “Ensuring illegal money is not influencing our election process is critical in Georgia and beyond,” RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement announcing the lawsuit Friday. “This lawsuit is necessary to obtain the full record regarding DeKalb County’s receipt of election-related funds and hold the county accountable.” DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond issued a statement blasting the lawsuit. “This frivolous lawsuit is another thinly-veiled attempt by the MAGA-backed RNC to undermine confidence in our democracy,” Thurmond said. “The RNC’s goal is to create a pretext to pedal baseless conspiracy theories about the upcoming November 2024 election, like the ones it pedaled in 2020.”</span></p>

Filed on behalf of Maryland Election Integrity and United Sovereign Americans — a group that identifies itself as trying to “get answers to clear questions about election fraud” — the case challenges the state’s voter roll maintenance policies and use of voting machines.  The lawsuit goes as far as requesting that the court prevent the Maryland Board of Elections from certifying any election until the groups’ claims of irregularities and other perceived violations were remedied. The district court declined that request, so now the right-wing plaintiffs are asking the 4th Circuit to consider their case.  In the dismissal of the challenge, the district court judge found that the plaintiffs lacked the ability to bring their lawsuit and failed to show that the groups would be harmed by the state’s election procedures. “Here, the mere hypothetical possibility of a past, speculative injury,” the judge wrote of the groups’ claims, “does not give rise to a certainly impending injury.” </span></p>

The court denied an appeal filed by attorneys Gregory J. Rohl, Brandon Johnson, Howard Kleinhendler, Sidney Powell, Julia Haller, and Scott Hagerstrom, according to a news release. The attorneys are also barred from filing further complaints unless approved by the court.  &#8220;Any attorney who knowingly makes false claims in court undermines the rule of law,&#8221; Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. &#8220;The attorneys involved in this meritless election lawsuit betrayed their professional obligations, and this stunt is just their latest attempt to evade sanctions they owe the State of Michigan. I&#8217;m glad the Court rejected this frivolous attempt to skirt justice.&#8221; Nessel said her office will pursue payment of the sanctions that the attorneys owe to the state. This comes after U.S. District Court Judge Linda Parker granted the sanctions in August 2021, ruling that the attorneys abused the court system by challenging the state&#8217;s election results in favor of President Biden. In June 2023, a panel of the Sixth Circuit upheld the sanction imposed by Parker. Additionally, the Supreme Court denied a rehearing of the sanctions in April 2024.</span></p>

The high court upheld a lower-court judge’s earlier dismissal of Beadles’ lawsuit, which claimed that Washoe County’s registrar of voters, the county manager and a county commissioner violated the state constitution by failing to respond to his complaints of fraud. “Taking all the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing every inference in favor of Beadles, he can prove no set facts that would entitle him to relief as pleaded,” the Supreme Court ruled. Beadles lost an earlier lawsuit in state court in 2022 that sought heightened observation of Washoe County’s vote-counting process. He has helped lead attempts to recall or otherwise oust numerous county officials since he moved to Reno from California in 2019. The Supreme Court’s ruling said Beadles misapplied a section of the Nevada Constitution guaranteeing the right to assemble and petition the Legislature in his most recent lawsuit, which sought the removal of Jamie Rodriguez, then-Washoe County registrar of voters; Eric Brown, county manager; and Alexis Hill, county commission chairwoman. “There are no set of facts that could prove a violation of that constitutional right based on respondents’ failure to respond directly to Beadles’ allegations,” Chief Justice Lidia Stiglich wrote in the five-page ruling. The ruling said state law permits a voter to file a complaint with the secretary of state’s office about election practices, but “these laws do not establish that respondents had a duty to respond to Beadles’ allegations.”</span></p>

Marc Thielman, a former school superintendent who captured 8% of the vote in his sixth-place finish in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary, led several other Republicans in suing then-Secretary of State Shemia Fagan in October 2022.  Current Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade, appointed after Fagan’s 2023 resignation, welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “Both the rulings from the District Court and the Ninth Circuit got it right: Oregon’s vote by mail system is the gold standard with no widespread voter fraud to speak of,” she said. “I’m very pleased to see the Supreme Court leave the lower courts’ ruling in place.” The</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.169576/gov.uscourts.ord.169576.1.0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claimed – without providing any evidence – that Oregon voters have been disenfranchised by “voting anomalies.” The bulk of the suit rested on “2,000 Mules,” a 2022 film from far-right commentator Dinesh D’Souza that purported to show that people in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin delivered multiple ballots to drop boxes. The film doesn’t include Oregon, and election experts have debunked its claims.  They sought injunctions blocking Oregon from using mail voting and preventing ballots from being counted by tabulation machines, which are faster and more reliable than hand counting. U.S. Magistrate Judge Stacie Beckerman dismissed the suit last summer, writing that “generalized grievances” about the state’s election system didn’t give Thielman, Linthicum and others standing to sue. A three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Beckerman’s ruling in December. </span></p>

At this time, it remains uncertain as to whether the court of appeals will hear the case and issue a ruling before the state’s Aug. 13 primary elections or Nov. 5 general election. From 2014 up until October 2022, the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) on multiple occasions issued guidance that authorized an absentee voter who had already returned their ballot to contact a local election clerk, request the ballot back, spoil the old ballot and subsequently cast a new one.  In a set of guidance promulgated ahead of the state’s August 2022 partisan primary, WEC noted that it would allow for the spoiling of absentee ballots in light of an uptick in requests from voters to cast new ballots after changing their minds or making an error. Under WEC’s guidance, absentee voters who cast ballots in the state’s primary election for a candidate who dropped out of a race before Election Day could spoil their ballots and cast a new one for an active candidate.  However, following a lawsuit brought by the conservative legal group known as Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, in a March 2024 ruling, the judge permanently invalidated the guidance, holding that it violated Wisconsin election law and concluding that voters are only permitted to spoil their absentee ballots in cases of ballots that are damaged or improperly certified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marinette County Judge James Morrison has</span><a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2024/marinette-co-judge-temporarily-bars-elections-commission-from-requiring-new-absentee-ballot-envelope/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granted a temporary injunction </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">barring the Elections Commission from requiring clerks to use a new agency-approved envelope that continues to double as a voter’s official request for an absentee ballot. Morrison will now hear further arguments on whether to permanently bar the agency from requiring the use of the envelopes.  While the previous version of the envelope also doubled as the written request for an absentee ballot, the revised one includes an explicit declaration, “I requested this ballot and this is the original or a copy of that request.” </span><a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/240521Lawsuit.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in February, seeks a declaration that all absentee ballots requested through the Elections Commission’s MyVote website must be accompanied by a copy of the signed request to receive it before the vote can be counted. It also seeks to invalidate the use of the redesigned envelope. The motion for a temporary injunction argued voters who certify on the envelope that it serves as their written request for an absentee ballot are violating the law. The suit argues such a request must be its own separate document, and anyone voting with the new envelopes risks having their vote invalidated. Morrison, who granted the temporary injunction on May 17, has motion hearings scheduled on May 30 and June 5 in the case. That’s three weeks ahead of the June 27 deadline for absentee ballots in the August primary to start going to voters who have a request on file with their local clerks.</span></p>

Join us for a virtual discussion with Berman and former West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant about how reactionary conservatives have capitalized on structural inequalities in our institutions, like the Senate and the Supreme Court, to entrench their power, as well as the pro-democracy movement striving against these regressive efforts. <strong>When:</strong> May 30, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

What are lawmakers and election administrators thinking about now to prepare? Find out in this four-part series, hosted  by the National Conference of State Legislatures in partnership with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
