The PSA affirms the incredible efforts local and state officials have invested, through the federal government, in ensuring security and integrity of the elections process, and <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10802" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-11.02.33 AM.png" alt="" width="206" height="160" />specifically how seriously CISA and USPIS take the security of election related mail. As CISA leads federal efforts to ensure election officials have the resources they need to defend against the range of cyber and physical threats to election infrastructure, USPIS ensures the safe and secure delivery of election mail, and the protection of election officials from potentially dangerous mail. “CISA, alongside our federal partners like the US Postal Inspection Service, are committed to helping those on the frontline of our democratic process have the tools and resources necessary to accomplish their incredible mission while staying safe from the range of hazards they may face,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Together we can protect America’s election infrastructure against new and evolving threats and that is our continued goal for Protect 2024 here at CISA.”  To report suspicious mail and election mail-related security or criminal incidents contact USPIS at (877) 876-2455 or you can report election mail crimes at</span><a href="https://www.uspis.gov/report"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uspis.gov/report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Foreign adversaries are using a variety of sophisticated disinformation campaigns, often leveraging new tools, such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), to craft and spread misleading content.  “As we approach Election Day, it is important to remember that while elections are political, election security is not. Election security is <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />national security. Our foreign adversaries are looking to attack our democratic process to further their own objectives, and we need the help of all Americans in ensuring they are not successful,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley.  “There has been incredible effort across local, state and federal governments to ensure the security and integrity of our nation’s election infrastructure. Americans should be confident that their votes will be counted as cast.  They should also know that our foreign adversaries will try to make them believe otherwise. We encourage everyone to remain vigilant, verify the information they consume, and rely on trusted sources like their state and local election officials.”  The PSA highlights specific examples of tactics we have seen used by Russia and Iran during the 2024 election cycle to target all Americans. These include things from mimicking national level media outlets like the Washington Post and Fox News and creating inauthentic news sites posing as legitimate media organizations to using paid influencers to hide their hand. It is important for voters to critically evaluate information sources, particularly as disinformation campaigns evolve to use AI-generated content. Both agencies urge the American public to rely on trusted information from state and local election officials and to verify claims through multiple reliable sources before sharing them on social media or other platforms.  For more information on how to protect yourself from disinformation, visit the official websites of the FBI and CISA’s dedicated election security webpage,</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/protect2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cisa.gov/Protect2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

However, this year, with </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-conspiracy-theories-misinformation-trump-musk-0e5a84b1d9e6cd63cd8ca22ee9900387?user_email=594ea5f0f5317563502975ed318ebbd4d3c386022fc550eca0e70c06903bd8eb&amp;utm_medium=Afternoon_Wire&amp;utm_source=Sailthru_AP&amp;utm_campaign=AfternoonWire_Oct23_2024&amp;utm_term=Afternoon%20Wire"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mis-/disinformation spreading  quickly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media, it’s a whole different ball game. Already there have been issues in several early voting counties where officials have needed to debunk information being spread. Election officials in </span><a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/beyond-the-podium/blown-out-of-proportion-whitfield-county-clears-air-on-voting-machine-fraud-claim-dominion-cast-ballot-voters-vote-paper-ballot-2024-election-georgia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitfield County, Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked to put to rest a rumor about a voting machine that printed a different selection than what a voter put on their ballot. It turned out that it was an error on the part of the voter, Georgia&#8217;s top state election official confirmed, but that didn’t stop people from spreading false information about the incident. “And then it got blown out of proportion by people that like to use, you know, Twitter and other forms of social media,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. “But we&#8217;re going to respond quickly to these sorts of things in 2024 because it&#8217;s not supported by the facts. The equipment&#8217;s working. We&#8217;ve done all sorts of audits, you know, since the last election, and coming up to this election.&#8221; In </span><a href="https://wreg.com/news/local/election-officials-tennessee-lawmakers-address-concerns-over-early-voting-touchscreen-issue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters have reported the problem in Davidson, Williamson, and Shelby Counties. Officials said those using their fingers to cast their ballot on the touchscreen machines have reported their vote not registering, and instead, “jumping” to a different candidate. Davidson County election administrator Jeff Roberts told News 2 the problem is new, but it&#8217;s not related to the integrity of the machines. Misinformation about </span><a href="https://www.nbc-2.com/article/claims-florida-voting-machines-not-working-properly-debunked/62685435"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee County, Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting machines is spreading across social media, causing some people to be concerned that their votes may not count. Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle explained that the machines do contain a privacy screen that prevents anyone nearby from seeing the screen except the person using it, similar to a privacy screen protector some people place on their phones. &#8220;That means you really have to be aggressive when you make your marks or punch your choice,&#8221; Doyle said. He was aware of social media claims about the machines not working properly, but he insisted there had not been one single official complaint brought to his attention. Some of these ballot “errors” aren’t errors at all, but voters posting misleading information. In </span><a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/tarrant-county-officials-clear-up-ballot-controversy/3677687/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarrant County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one voter said a voting machine switched his choice for president, but county leaders said there was no evidence of that. On Tuesday, videos shared on social media showed a man claiming that when he voted in White Settlement, his printed ballot indicated a different choice for the presidential candidate than the one he made on the machine. Elections Administrator Clint Ludwig posted a social media message on X on Tuesday evening, saying the machine printed out the voter&#8217;s selection. &#8220;We have one individual who&#8217;s claimed that the vote that they selected on the machine was not the vote that was printed on the printed ballot. What we believe to have occurred is that the individual did make a selection on the machine and that selection was printed on their ballot. When they went to cast their ballot they checked it and realized that was not the vote that they wanted,&#8221; Ludwig said.</span></p>

In a blend of civic duty and community spirit, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections has teamed up with four local animal rescue organizations to launch </span><a href="https://www.cbs12.com/news/local/palm-beach-county-supervisor-of-elections-launches-paws-to-the-polls-with-animal-rescues-for-early-voting-south-florida-news-pets-politics-october-18-2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Paws to the Polls.&#8221; </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative comes after the state recovers from the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. With shelters damaged from the storm, and at capacity, many of these animals are housed in Palm Beach County. As voters head to the polls during the early voting period— October 21 to November 3 —they will have the opportunity to meet and interact with adoptable pets from Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, Big Dog Ranch, Kelly’s Fosters, and Barky Pines Animal Rescue. The Supervisor of Elections Office said this program initiative aims to make the voting experience more enjoyable while also addressing the surge in pets needing homes. “We believe that voting should be a positive experience,” said Sartory Link.. “By partnering with these incredible animal rescue organizations, we not only encourage voter participation but also help find loving homes for pets in need.”</span></p>

Board of Elections used high school summer interns in addition to college interns. Nick von Hindenburg, a student at Georgetown Day School was assigned typical intern duties such as outreach, voter services, and election worker training assistance. But von Hindenburg had an additional idea. He wanted to create a </span><a href="https://pollworkerconnect.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll worker recruitment website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “ Nick had this idea when he began with us,” explained Monica Evans, director of the D.C. Board of Elections. “ We encouraged him [and w]e helped him refine the tool. We were impressed by his enthusiasm.” Evand said he worked with the DCBOE web designer to assist with the refinement of the site. von Hindenburg messaged Evans after this internship was over to let her know how things were going with the site. “We are circulating the website at GDS, including sending all school emails, meeting with the community engagement office, and doing announcements at assemblies. We are also proud to say we have already got some people who filled out the DC election worker application form. Furthermore, we are talking with students and faculty at other schools in the DMV about getting the word out about the website and volunteering as election workers.”</span></p>

To connect voters with this information ahead of the 2024 general election, CTCL distributed grants to nonpartisan organizations that could build and promote online ballot lookup tools. This year’s grantees include</span><a href="https://vote.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vote.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rock the Vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://poderlatinx.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Poder Latinx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://www.mifamiliavota.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mi Familia Vota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Increasing language access is essential to ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in the electoral process,” said Armondo Salud, Deputy of Elections in Yolo County, California. “When voters have access to materials and assistance in their native language, it removes barriers that could otherwise prevent them from engaging. Ultimately, language access enhances the fairness and transparency of elections, ensuring that all voices in our community are heard.”</span></p>

After questioning witnesses for three hours about redacted and changed addresses on signature collection sheets from Conway, Faulkner and Saline counties, the Committee voted to refer the matter to the Arkansas attorney general, the state ethics commission and a prosecuting attorney. State law requires canvassers for ballot measures to be residents of the state and to provide the address of their current residence on the pages in which they collect signatures. Eighteen canvassers from other states collected signatures for the Hand Marked, Hand Counted Paper Ballot Ordinance of 2024, and 14 blacked out their current residence addresses and substituted the address of the Home2 Suites hotel in Conway, according to documents provided to the Joint Performance Review Committee. County clerks in nine counties have faced recent lawsuits seeking to put the proposed measure on countywide ballots after they rejected the efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12013" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IndependenceCoAR-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Independence County, Arkansas</strong>: The </span><a href="https://www.kait8.com/2024/10/23/ordinance-could-change-how-voters-decide-future-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand Marked, Hand Counted Paper Ballot Ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require all elections in Independence County to use paper ballots. The ordinance was petitioned by resident Bryan Norris. He said voting machines in Arkansas are susceptible to outside influence, namely the company that makes them since he says the public has no access to how the machines count those votes. “We are not allowed to know that source code, so we cannot say that there’s nefarious activity or there isn’t nefarious activity. We just don’t know, and we don’t think that that’s proper or fair, and we think Arkansans deserve better,” Norris said. The ordinance would also require workers to count votes and verify them by hand. Norris said the paper ballots would return integrity to the voting process. But not everyone is on the same page. County Attorney Daniel Haney said the change isn’t needed and voter integrity isn’t an issue in the county. “We have a Secretary of State who oversees elections, and we have quite a few individuals who have their hands in this. And again, if it was a problem, we’d be seeing our legislature take care of it,” Haney said. Haney said if the ordinance is passed, it could cause concerns from how it will adhere to state legislation to the time it will take for the ballots to be counted. It could also be a financial concern. “One is nobody sure really knows what the cost is,” Haney said. “If the county is supposed to appropriate funds to ensure that we have a hand count verification process. But we don’t know the cost. The county is now in trouble with possibly operating in the red, and nobody wants to do that.”</span></p>

The bills aim to prevent voter suppression, expand ballot access to more language communities, create a statewide voting data clearinghouse, and clarify protections for voters who need help casting their ballot.. Clerks told Votebeat they have a lot of concerns about the MVRA, though some are not prepared to think about about laws that wouldn’t come into play until next year at the soonest as they prepare for a general election that’s already underway. “I’m not really excited about this as it stands,” said Michael Siegrist, Canton Township clerk and second vice president of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks. He and other clerks say they’re nervous about the potential costs that would largely be passed on to municipalities as well as the proposed consequences for what could be simple human errors in the course of running an election. The state municipal clerks association is officially neutral on the package of bills, as is its county-level counterpart, the Michigan Association of County Clerks. Both groups had a hand in shaping the legislation, but say there’s still room for improvement.</span></p>

Council voted 6-5 to approve the resolution proposed by council Vice Chairman Brian Thornton, which discourages the use of ballot drop boxes &#8220;because of safety and security concerns associated with them.&#8221; The resolution does not have the force of law and does not compel the county election board or administration to take any action. It does demonstrate that council supports the safety of voters, poll workers, election officials and the public, Thornton has said since the resolution appeared on the agenda for council&#8217;s Tuesday voting session. The resolution states that council is &#8220;dedicated to the democratic process of fair, free and secure elections,&#8221; and supports the right of election workers &#8220;to perform their duties free of harassment, intimidation and threats against their physical safety.&#8221;</span></p>

Judd was initially charged with two felony counts of conspiracy and interference with an elections officer, and had pleaded not guilty. On Monday, though, she pleaded guilty to a separate misdemeanor charge of failure or refusal to perform duty by an election officer and “acknowledged that she failed to canvass the election as required by law,” according to a news release from Attorney General Kris Mayes. Judd will be sentenced to at least 90 days’ unsupervised probation, and will pay a maximum $500 fine, according to the release. A copy of the plea agreement was not yet available Monday morning. “Any attempt to interfere with elections in Arizona will not be tolerated,” Mayes said in a statement announcing the plea deal. “Today’s plea agreement and sentencing should serve as a strong reminder that I will not hesitate to use every tool available to uphold the rule of law and protect the integrity of Arizona’s elections,” Mayes said.</span></p>

The U.S. Department of Justice announced that a federal judge sentenced Ogstad to the two-and-a-half year prison stint along with three years of supervised release. Ogstad pleaded guilty to one count of making a threatening interstate communication on July 25, 2024. He will also have to pay a $1,000 fine. “In this election season we honor and respect those public servants who enable Americans to exercise their constitutional right to vote,” U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino said in a statement. “And we seek to protect all election workers from intimidation and harassment. Threats of violence, whether conveyed by words or deeds or pictures, will be met in this District with robust prosecution.”</span></p>

The decision comes four days before early voting begins in Arkansas and after a few weeks of fast-paced legal filings and a ruling from Crittenden County Circuit Judge Chris Thyer, who ordered local election officials to conduct early voting at the Seventh Street Church of Christ in West Memphis — one of three contested sites. Attorney Joe Rogers appealed Thyer’s order on behalf of the members of the Crittenden County Board of Election Commissioners on Oct. 4. The commissioners, and later Attorney General Tim Griffin through an amicus brief, argued that County Clerk Paula Brown inappropriately designated the Seventh Street Church as an early polling site and called on the commissioners to staff it. Earlier in the day, the court granted Griffin permission to file his “friend-of-the-court” brief, despite an attempt to disallow it by the attorney for the plaintiffs in the original case. Hours later, in a decision authored by Justice Courtney Rae Hudson, the high court sided with Thyer’s ruling in that Brown appropriately designated the Seventh Street Church of Christ as an early voting location, but found Brown should conduct the voting, not the county election commissioners. The high court also reversed part of Thyer’s ruling, in which he said election commissioners were not required to conduct early voting at the First Baptist Church in West Memphis — which had been used as an early voting site in 2022 — because the commissioners did not establish it as a polling site this year. Hudson said sites outside of the county seat established by the county board of election commissioners.</span></p>

Civil rights groups, collectively represented by nonprofit plaintiff Florida Rising Together, sued Secretary of State Cord Byrd, Attorney General Ashley Moody and Supervisors of Elections in Broward, Duval, Miami-Dade and Orange counties last month. In their suit, they alleged that more than 43,000 people in Florida have been denied their right to vote since 2018 because the identifying information they used to register was not an exact match for information on a state or federal database. But according to the RNC and RPOF’s motion, upending the rule “will result in more ineligible voters being added to and remaining on Florida’s voter rolls, which impairs … accurate registration lists.” “The voter registration matching law is a commonsense election safeguard that protects against fraud,” RNC Chair Michael Whatley said in a statement.</span></p>

The Republican National Committee filed an emergency appeal directly with the Georgia Supreme Court last week to expedite the appellate process in order to have the rules enforced for the Nov. 5 election. Typically, the Georgia Court of Appeals is a necessary interim step before superior court rulings are considered by the state’s high court.

The rules that Cox invalidated include three that had gotten a lot of attention — one that requires that the number of ballots be hand-counted after the close of polls and two that had to do with the certification of election results.  In a statement announcing the appeal. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley accused Cox of &#8220;the very worst of judicial activism.&#8221; &#8220;By overturning the Georgia State Election Board&#8217;s commonsense rules passed to safeguard Georgia&#8217;s elections, the judge sided with the Democrats in their attacks on transparency, accountability, and the integrity of our elections,&#8221; Whatley said. &#8220;We have immediately appealed this egregious order to ensure commonsense rules are in place for the election — we will not let this stand.&#8221; Alex Kaufman, a lawyer for the state Republican Party, said that the party filed an emergency notice of appeal with the Georgia Supreme Court.</span></p>

The man continued to &#8220;preach&#8221; from a distance, but later started walking back across the road toward voters who were standing in line, yelling and being disruptive again, according to the report. The deputy intercepted him before he made it back to the precinct and arrested him.</span></p>

The lawsuit was filed earlier this month in response to a lawsuit filed in September by DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin, who is seeking a judge’s order to compel Kaczmarek to comply with county regulations regarding the payment of bills. In her countersuit, attorneys for Kaczmarek note that the Illinois attorney general’s office has issued “multiple opinions” regarding the clerk’s authority to manage internal operations of her office. They also highlight opinions from the state’s attorney general that the county board’s budgetary authority is limited to the appropriation of lump sums for three categories of expenses — equipment, material and services — and does not allow for line-item limitations. “This lawsuit repeats the same points of law my office has been raising for over two years,” Kaczmarek said in a press release. “Despite plain and unambiguous language backing us up, the state’s attorney chooses to ignore it.”</span></p>

Patel said in a written opinion that the Oct. 8 lawsuit was filed too close to Election Day. While that alone would bar the lawsuit, the election practices the GOP are challenging are &#8220;consistent with federal and state law, and the Michigan Constitution,&#8221; the judge said. The Michigan GOP, the Republican National Committee, and Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry sued Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and her elections director, alleging they are unlawfully allowing voting by overseas residents who have never been Michigan residents. Though numbers are not available from state officials, the concern mainly relates to a small number of voting-age children and spouses of overseas residents. The Federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act supersedes state law in allowing citizens who are not currently residents of the state to vote. But the lawsuit argued that the federal law does not eliminate residency requirements entirely, and allowing voting in Michigan elections by those who have never lived in Michigan violates the state constitution. The suit argued this is especially harmful to Republican candidates, since overseas voters skew Democratic.</span></p>

She will, however, allow the GOP to file an amended lawsuit, as she did in her June dismissal of the first iteration of the lawsuit.  The lawsuit is the latest legal defeat for the RNC and Nevada GOP, which have filed a slew of lawsuits in Nevada this year related to voter rolls and mail ballot procedures. Republicans have not succeeded in any of their Nevada lawsuits this year, but some of the cases are in various stages of appeal. In a statement, an RNC spokesperson said the group plans to amend the lawsuit.</span></p>

Meyers dismissed the GOP plaintiffs’ claim under a federal law known as the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), but sent a separate state constitutional claim back down to a North Carolina court. The order noted that the case will return to state court on Oct. 22 barring an appeal of today’s ruling by the RNC and North Carolina GOP.  In an Aug. 23</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-23-Complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the RNC and state Republican Party alleged the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) unlawfully registered large sums of “ineligible” voters — “including possible non-citizens” — prior to December 2023 using a form that failed to collect necessary identification information. The RNC originally filed its complaint in state court, the case ended up before a federal court after the NCSBE sought to move the legal proceedings to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Per last week’s decision, the case will return to a state court for consideration of the plaintiffs’ remaining claim brought under a clause of the North Carolina Constitution that guarantees the fundamental right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superior Court Judge John Smith denied the Republican National Committee’s </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/rnc-challenges-north-carolina-laws-allowing-for-overseas-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request to disenfranchise certain military and overseas voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state court rejected the RNC’s bid for a preliminary injunction, court records show. This means that individuals born overseas to parents or guardians who were last North Carolina residents will be allowed to vote in the November election. Smith determined that the RNC failed to present substantial evidence “of any instance where the harm that plaintiffs seek to prevent has ever ‘fraudulently’ occurred,” the decision said.  “…This court should not be invoked to treat an entire group of citizens differently based upon unsupported and speculative allegations for which there is not even a scintilla of substantive evidence.” The RNC and its co-plaintiffs appealed the denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction to the North Carolina Court of Appeals.</span></p>

Mitchell also determined there was probable cause to bind Tawhedi over for trial. FBI agent Derek Wiley testified that Tawhedi also is linked to an investigation in France that led to the arrests this month of three people, including two of Tawhedi’s brothers, who authorities say were plotting a terrorist attack in that country. One of those arrested in France, a 22-year-old Afghan who had residency papers in France, was being investigated for a suspected plan to attack people in a soccer stadium or shopping center.</span></p>

That means voters who fail to correctly sign or date the return envelope or fail to use a secrecy envelope are entitled to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day at a polling place and have it counted, as long as that ballot wouldn’t be rejected for some other disqualifying issue. The court said that provisional voting was meant to assure access to the right to vote, while simultaneously preventing double voting. Justice Christine Donohue, writing for the majority, noted that the Republican litigants argued that in order to maintain election integrity, provisional ballots should not be counted, but said the majority was “at a loss to identify what honest voting principle is violated by recognizing the validity of one ballot cast by one voter.” “If appellants presume that the general assembly intended to disqualify the provisional ballot of a voter who failed to effectively vote by mail in order to punish that voter, we caution that such a construction is not reconcilable with the right of franchise,” she wrote.</span></p>

Pollard’s alleged victim, an employee of a state political party who lives in western Pennsylvania, wasn’t named in court records. But Pollard allegedly sent threatening text messages to the person on Sept. 6 at about 10 p.m. because the person was recruiting volunteers to serve as poll observers on Election Day.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit October 22 alleging that the state Department of Motor Vehicles’ system made it impossible for some 17,000 eligible teenagers to register to vote while obtaining a driver’s license or other identification. The lawsuit also names the State Election Commission. Voter registration has been closed for a week already. But Paul Bowers, an ACLU spokesperson, said the organization did not hear about the issue until Oct. 12, when a social media post by state Rep. Spencer Wetmore, D-Folly Beach, brought it to the group’s attention. The 17-year-old son of a friend, Wetmore said, thought he’d registered to vote while applying for a driver’s license at the DMV. State law allows teenagers who will turn 18 by Election Day to register to vote up to 13 months in advance. Normally citizens can check a box saying “yes, I wish to register to vote” at the DMV and be added to the voter roll with almost no additional steps. But the state DMV system was programmed to ignore requests from teens who were not already 18 when they attempted to register, even if they would turn 18 by Election Day, according to the lawsuit. The system did not necessarily notify these teenagers that their attempt to register was unsuccessful, according to the lawsuit. Over the past week, the ACLU worked with the SCDMV to identify 17,564 people who fell into this category over the last 13 months. The ACLU then checked with the State Election Commission and found that 6,240 of these teenagers had registered successfully to vote some other way, leaving over 10,000 potentially unregistered. “I had no idea it was going to snowball into this,” Wetmore told the SC Daily Gazette. “I just didn’t have any concept it would be so many kids.” The lawsuit, filed in Richland County, includes a request for an emergency order for the DMV to identify any 17-year-olds who checked the box to register to vote but were not processed, and add them to the voter roll.</span></p>

In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Paxton, joined by the Texas Secretary of State, claims U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not adequately comply with the attorney general&#8217;s request to verify the citizenship status of Texans who have registered to vote without a state-issued driver’s license or identification card. There are over 450,000 such voters registered in Texas, Paxton says in the complaint. He is asking the court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the defendants to provide information on their citizenship. In his complaint, Paxton bemoans Congress&#8217; failure to pass the SAVE Act, saying: &#8220;Texans are increasingly concerned about the possibility of non-citizen voting, and the Attorney General of Texas and the Secretary of State of Texas have the responsibility to uphold the integrity of Texas’s elections.&#8221;</span></p>

Board of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, challenging its decision to reinstate disqualified candidate Ida Smith on the ballot for delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The legal action not only questions the board’s authority but also highlights a longstanding issue in the territory: the lack of clarity around residency terms like “inhabitant” and “resident.” Fawkes’ lawsuit, filed on Oct. 17 in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, seeks a temporary restraining order and an injunction to block Smith’s inclusion on the ballot. According to Fawkes, Smith was disqualified in June for failing to meet residency requirements, specifically for not submitting a tax return transcript by the June 10 deadline. Fawkes cited 18 V.I.C. §411, which grants the supervisor of Elections sole authority to determine a candidate’s qualifications. She argued that Smith’s failure to provide the necessary documentation was sufficient to remove her from the race. Despite this, the Board of Elections, led by members Raymond J. Williams and Epiphane Joseph, voted on Sept. 4 to reinstate Smith, reversing Fawkes’ decision. In her lawsuit, Fawkes contends that this move was beyond the board’s legal authority, as determining whether a candidate meets the legal requirements falls solely under the supervisor of Elections’ jurisdiction. Fawkes is asking the court to declare the board’s actions illegal and reaffirm the power of her office in deciding candidate eligibility.</span></p>

The lawsuit, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed their own lawsuit challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results. In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>

White says her reputation as a dedicated election official was tarnished in 2022 when Miyares prosecuted her for election fraud relating to the 2020 election. The commonwealth dropped the charges in 2023. &#8220;As an election official, I worked every day for nearly twenty years to ensure that Virginia elections ran smoothly and according to law,&#8221; White said in a press release. &#8220;None of that mattered to the defendants, who showed no interest in the truth. Instead, they treated my career and well-being as collateral damage in their effort to promote false claims of widespread election fraud.&#8221; White says Miyares used her prosecution to legitimize the launch of the state&#8217;s election integrity unit, a group of 20 lawyers, many of whom lack election backgrounds, to investigate election fraud. Since its founding, two days after White&#8217;s 2022 indictment, White is the only official to have been charged.</span></p>

The guidance at the heart of the lawsuit advises clerks on what to do if “Election Day Registration” or EDR postcards are returned to their offices and marked undeliverable. The postcards are used to verify the address a voter gives at the polls when registering the day of an election. Public Interest Legal Foundation President J. Christian Adams said Wisconsin law is clear that if an EDR postcard is returned to a clerk, they’re supposed to suspend that person’s voter registration and refer them to the local district attorney for potential criminal charges. He claims the commission’s guidance “advised clerks not to follow that law.” “We just want to get a better understanding of why Wisconsin Elections Commission officials would have been doing that,” Adams said. “And so, we asked for the records, they didn’t turn them over, and a lot of time has gone by.” A spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the guidance and lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys involved in efforts to reverse President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in Wisconsin are asking a judge to create a </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/weeks-before-election-lawsuit-seeks-to-change-wisconsins-citizenship-screening-process-for-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new system for checking people’s citizenship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for voting. The</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-10-01-amended-mandamus-pet.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which comes just weeks before Election Day, asks Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Michael Maxwell to order the Wisconsin Department of Transportation and the Wisconsin Elections Commission to cross-reference data for millions of residents on Wisconsin’s voter registration list before the Nov. 5 election. If any noncitizens are found on the voter rolls, the suit wants them removed. The lawsuit claims around one-half of 1 percent of people who applied for voter ID cards over the last decade were denied because of fraud or ineligibility. Dean and Scott contend that given that rejection rate, there could be around 10,000 illegally registered active voters statewide, and Dean suggested during a lengthy court hearing Thursday that the number could be higher.</span></p>
