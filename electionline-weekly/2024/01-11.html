							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Ensuring Hot Topics Don’t Catch Fire</strong><br />
<em>Using Social Listening to Protect Elections</em></p>
<p>By Marina Anwuri and Grace Kim<br />
<a href="https://www.forsmarsh.com/">Fors Marsh</a>’s Social Listening Lab</p>
<p>Social media is everywhere these days—so much so that it surrounds us like a “digital forest.” And while it can be exciting to <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />explore, it can also be a source of danger, especially when the wildfires of misinformation and disinformation (mis/disinfo) threaten to catch fire and spread. In recent years, few topics have posed a greater “fire threat” than elections.</p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election is a hot topic online right now. People flock to the internet to express their sentiments and to engage in debates about a wide variety of issues, all of which will be at stake this November. Protecting the legitimacy and integrity of our democracy from mis/disinfo is just as important to election officials as preventing forest fires is to park rangers—because, as we have already seen, mis/disinfo can catch and spread frighteningly quickly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a way to watch the digital forest for signs of trouble. Election officials can prepare for trouble in 2024 and beyond by conducting social listening and monitoring social media conversations and trending content. Voters use social media to ask questions about the election process and to occasionally express frustration, concern, confusion, or uncertainty, and sometimes—by mistake (or deliberately in the wrong hands)—these narratives can quickly become fuel for mis/disinfo. Election officials can use what they learn from social listening to help inform communications with voters to resist the threat of mis/disinfo and to educate the public and to demystify the voting process to affirm the public’s trust in the election process.</p>
<p>Fors Marsh’s social listening team analyzed online conversations from September 2022 to September 2023 to identify aspects of the voting process associated with negative sentiment; in other words, the topics that are most likely to ignite a digital firestorm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poll Workers</strong>: Many people expressed having a negative perception of poll workers based on previous experiences and that poll workers instill mistrust in how they do their jobs. Examples included descriptions of eligible voters being turned away by poll workers if their name was not on the voter roll, if they did not have a voter registration card, or poll workers expressing concerns about signature verifications. Other observations identified poll workers’ attitude and suggestions of voter intimidation, such as poll workers glancing at submitted ballots or claims that some poll workers were urging individuals to vote for a particular candidate.</li>
<li><strong>Voting Portals and Websites</strong>: Voters’ conversations also included numerous complaints about the difficulty of tracking ballots. Confusion about the status of submitted ballots left some believing that they were victims of voter suppression due to discrepancies between their ballot status on the state’s website and the actual acceptance of their ballots.</li>
<li><strong>Polling Locations</strong>: Voters also had concerns about casting ballots. Other noted concerns included official websites containing incorrect information; wait times; or the location of polling places, which led to some needing to find another polling location. Others expressed frustration about long lines or wait times, closed polling locations, or polling locations that were crowded or inaccessible.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10651" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ForsMarsh-300x97.png" alt="" width="300" height="97" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ForsMarsh-300x97.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ForsMarsh.png 334w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The one thing these complaints all have in common is evidence of mistrust or doubt in the election process, which, if allowed to persist, can make an issue ripe for mis/disinfo due to a poorly time lightning strike—or worse, arson.</p>
<p>Election boards can protect themselves and voters by being vigilant about incendiary mis/disinfo and using social listening to listen to voters and, in return, to educate the public and to provide transparency about the entire voting process. Based on these findings, election officials should consider the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soak the forest</strong>: Plan strategic communication to boost information that addresses election integrity during the elections to saturate digital feeds when people are most likely to be exposed to circulating narratives of misinformation.</li>
<li><strong>Build a firewall</strong>: Create social media content that highlights protections regarding mail-in voting, calendars to track ballots and deadlines, or messages about how ballot counting works to demystify the election process.</li>
<li><strong>Promote fire safety</strong>: Hold digital Q&amp;As with election officials on their official social media accounts to establish transparency and trust with local election officials and to drive traffic to official election websites.</li>
<li><strong>Recruit volunteer firewatchers</strong>: Execute creative digital communication strategies that increase confidence in elections by collaborating with local candidates and resharing articles or social media posts that fact-check trending misinformation narratives against news sources that are considered more neutral.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social media can be a magnificent place for voters to gather to discuss the ideas of the day. But recognizing that the “digital forest” is at constant risk of catching fire due to misinformation and disinformation is a critical task for election officials in 2024 and beyond. Social listening can be a powerful tool to counter that threat by identifying risks and addressing them effectively—helping us all prevent online fires.</p>

Roy Cooper’s veto. The law requires the State Board to seek “diversity of population size, regional location, and demographic composition,” in selecting the 10 counties. State Board staff recommended using information on the race of voters in each county to ensure demographic diversity. Some members of the SBOE pushed back on using race as a diversity standard and instead wanted age to be a standard. However, Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell said using median age doesn’t work to ensure a diverse group of counties because it doesn’t vary much. The State Board of Elections in selecting the software.  Once the pilot program is finished after the primary election in March, the state elections board must send a report to the legislature for state lawmakers to use as they consider how, or if, to expand the program. The new law says that during this initial pilot program, North Carolina officials shouldn’t reject ballots that the software flags for the signature not matching. Officials plan to use multiple software vendors during the pilot, which could give a good indication which programs work best and whether there are issues that need to be ironed out before a more permanent, statewide program begins. “This is for experimental purposes only,” the elections board wrote in a news release. “It will not affect the counting of any voter’s ballot in the primary election.”</p>

A new program in Nashville aims to<a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/01/08/new-nashville-program-provides-eligible-jail-inmates-pathway-to-voter-registration-restoration/"> guide potential incarcerated voters through the process of registering and voting</a>. “The requirement to serve jail inmates has been around for a long time,” Davidson County Administrator of Elections Jeff Roberts said in an email.  “The goal is to create a more effective and efficient program for both the Election Commission and the Sheriff’s Office.  This new effort has no additional cost for Metro.” Voter registration, navigating the absentee ballot request process, voting rights restoration support, and civics education will be a part of the new program, according to a news release from the Davidson County Election Commission, Sheriff’s Office and Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office. The process and deadlines for voting are different for individuals housed in local jails. For example, the deadline for incarcerated persons in Tennessee to request an absentee ballot is 21 days before the election. The deadline for people who aren’t incarcerated is 7 days. “After conversations with the Sheriff’s Office and other advocacy groups, we recognized a need for an on-site, dedicated election specialist to provide guidance to active inmates,” Roberts said. A veteran Election Commission employee transferred last month to the Sheriff’s Office to work with inmates on voting questions.</p>

The annual Elections Conference is a unique opportunity for our County Clerks and Election officials to gather and exchange insights and experiences and learn together in a space that is constantly evolving. We have significant elections coming up in 2024, and this year&#8217;s Elections Conference was a great opportunity to kick things off so that we&#8217;re all working together to ensure Idahoans can have confidence in how our elections are run.&#8221;</p>

														<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> Republican state lawmakers say they want to keep election integrity intact by supporting a bill that criminalizes the act of giving or receiving<a href="https://www.wsfa.com/2024/01/09/lawmakers-renew-push-criminalize-assistance-absentee-voting-alabama/"> assistance on absentee voting</a>, including delivering the ballot. However, many grassroots organizations are concerned about how this bill would impact the work they do. This bill nearly became law during last year’s legislative session, but time ran out before it could pass. This year, this is the first thing lawmakers are expected to debate.<a href="https://www.legislature.state.al.us/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/SB1-int.pdf"> Senate Bill One</a> makes it a misdemeanor to get or give help with an absentee ballot. If payment is involved, the charges increase to a felony. The only exception is for family and election officials. “We’ve got to protect absentee voting in Alabama because a lot of people utilize it,” said Secretary of State Wes Allen. As a state representative, Allen sponsored a similar version of this bill in 2022. Another version was introduced in 2023. Both failed to pass.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-8974" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CochiseCoAZ-150x150.png" alt="" width="126" height="126" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CochiseCoAZ-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CochiseCoAZ-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CochiseCoAZ-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CochiseCoAZ-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CochiseCoAZ.png 1326w" sizes="(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px" />Cochise County, Arizona</strong>: In an effort to reduce the wait times at vote centers in the county, the Cochise County Board of Supervisors voted 2-1 to<a href="https://www.azpm.org/p/headlines/2024/1/9/218697-cochise-supervisors-approve-50000-funding-request-for-extra-voting-machines-ahead-of-elections/"> approve the funding request of $50,000</a> to the elections department to purchase additional voting equipment. The funds will go towards the purchase of 10 new Elections Systems and Software ExpressVote machines. In a December work session, Cochise County Elections Director Tim Mattix said that some vote centers in the 2022 General Election reported wait times greater than 30 minutes. Mattix said that by law and as outlined in the Elections Procedure Manual, the officer in charge of elections must establish and approve a wait time reduction plan to ensure voters don’t have to wait in line to vote for more than 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> Sen. Blaise Ingolia is pushing a bill that would<a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/vote-by-mail-florida-bill/46306664"> make it more difficult to vote by mail</a>.  Currently, people who want to vote by mail in the state of Florida simply register to vote and request a mail-in ballot. However, Senate Bill 1752, would change that system with one word: eligibility.  The bill says a qualified absent voter may vote by mail if, on election day and during early in-person voting, the absent voter expects to be: Absent from the county of his or her residence; Unable to appear personally at the early voting site because of illness or physical disability; A resident or patient of a United States Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility; or Absent from his or her legal residence because he or she is confined in jail.  It’s a move that Ramon Perez, the executive director of the nonprofit organization Digital Democracy Project, believes would limit access to voting. &#8220;Making that a consistent process, having to justify why you need an absentee ballot. I think that makes it harder for people to vote,&#8221; he said. SB 1752 would also change the number of times people must request a mail-in ballot. The rules state a request to receive a vote-by-mail ballot covers all elections from the date a request was submitted through the end of the calendar year for the next regularly scheduled general election. This bill would require voters to request a mail-in ballot for each election. &#8220;If we&#8217;re now going to make it harder to get an absentee ballot, I think that a lot of voters will not realize that and will end up losing out on their opportunity to vote,&#8221; Perez said. Senate President Kathleen Passidomo said she’s<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/652049-kathleen-passidomo-opposes-bill-restricting-mail-ballots"> opposed</a> to the measure. “I have a large number of elderly constituents,” Passidomo, a Naples Republican, told reporters during the first day of the Regular Session. “My parents, who unfortunately recently passed away — they voted by mail. They were dyed-in-the-wool Republicans. They were not able to get in a car and drive to the polling place.”</p>

Carol Ammons, D-Urbana. She sits on the committee. The bill would allow counties to move to the vote-by-mail system. They would choose to send every registered voter a ballot instead of making them request one or go to a polling place. Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons, the husband of bill-sponsor Carol Ammons, would also like to see it become the norm. “My experience as a voter and as a county clerk tells me there is no greater voter access than voting from the comforts of your home,” he said. If counties make vote by mail the norm, there would still be polling places and in-person voting. The number would be reduced, however, as fewer people are likely to physically go to the polls.</p>

If SB10 is successful this year and is passed by the voters on the November ballot, elections usually held in off-years — including governor, attorney general, secretary of state and commissioner of agriculture — would be moved to even-numbered, presidential years starting in 2028. In previous years, the proposed constitutional amendment has passed the Senate with the necessary three-fifths majority. But it has usually stalled out in the House, and for the past several attempts it did not even receive a committee hearing. If it were to make it past both chambers, the amendment would land on the ballot in a statewide referendum.</p>

The proposal called for a panel to investigate Bellows’ actions and report back to the 151-member House for an impeachment vote. If the proposal had moved forward, then there would have been a trial in the 35-member Senate, where Democrats also have a majority. Rep. Kevin O’Connell, of Brewer, said Bellows “faithfully discharged her oath of office.” He called her “an honorable person” who should not be removed from office for “simply doing her job.” “You might disagree with her decision, and some folks do. But every government official has an obligation to follow the law and fulfill their oath to the Constitution,” he said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are considering a bill that would award Maine’s four electoral college votes to the presidential candidate who<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/01/08/maine-lawmakers-consider-joining-effort-to-work-around-electoral-college-system/"> wins the national popular vote</a>. The proposal is designed to reduce the influence of a handful of key battleground states with more weight in the Electoral College, and ensure that the candidate who gets the most total votes nationwide wins the office. Joining other states in awarding Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote would ensure that votes cast in Maine carry as much weight as those cast in close, swing states that command the most attention from candidates, supporters argue. “This bill will make every vote equal,” said Rep. Arthur Bell, D-Yarmouth, the measure’s sponsor. If enough states agree to do the same, the popular vote winner also would be the Electoral College winner.</p>

The initiative would apply to Montana’s constitutionally defined offices, including the governorship, most executive branch positions, and state and federal legislative seats. The text of the initiative leaves some room for interpretation, directing legislators to prescribe what happens if no one candidate receives a majority of the vote. That could mean a series of run-off elections or a so-called instant run-off, a type of ranked-choice voting system similar to what voters recently adopted in Alaska. Ballot Issue 13 has already received legal approval from Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. If supporters gather enough signatures — equivalent to 10% of the total number of votes cast for the office of governor in the last general election — the proposal will be listed on the 2024 ballot as CI-127.  Montanans for Election Reform is also sponsoring a related initiative that would create a system of open primaries in the state under which the top-four vote-getters in a given race would advance to the general election, regardless of party. That proposal received support from the interim committee late last year but failed to pass Knudsen’s legal review.</p>

According to a press release, the signing reaffirms the Governor’s longstanding commitment to expanding democracy, building on previous voting rights expansion measures enacted during the Murphy Administration, including automatic voter registration, in-person early voting, online voter registration, and the restoration of voting rights for individuals on probation or parole, among other reforms. “To strengthen our democracy, we must ensure that all eligible voters can participate in it,” said Murphy. “Across government, we see how the decisions we make today impact future generations. I am proud to sign legislation that expands access to the ballot box while engaging and empowering a new generation of voters.” Current law permits a person who is at least 17 years of age to register to vote if the person will be at least 18 at the time of the election. However, the person is designated in the Statewide Voter Registration System as temporarily ineligible to vote until that person’s 18th birthday. The legislation signed by Governor Murphy today, which will take effect on January 1, 2026, allows that person to vote in a primary election as long as the person turns 18 years of age on or before the next general election.</p>

The amendment defines the period for the 30 days,” Tom Deadrick of the secretary of state’s office said in an email to KELOLAND News. The Legislature in 2023 passed<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24232/250983"> Senate Bill 139</a> which has a requirement to live in the state for 30 days prior to registering to vote.  The state allows full-time travelers to be South Dakota residents if they spend one night in the state. Many list post office boxes at locations around the state as their place of residency as they travel. The locations serve as areas where mail can be sent and then forwarded on to the full-time traveler resident or where the traveler can pick up the mail. When asked if the proposed SB17 legislation would change voting for full-time traveling residents, Deadrick said in an email, “That is a legal question that has many different legal avenues it could go down and is not a question we can answer.”</p>

In the piece he notes that in ongoing redistricting lawsuits mainly across the South, Republican state officials have been raising novel arguments that threaten to erode a key set of protections against racial discrimination in the election process. The three arguments include a case in Arkansas where Republican state officials have argued that groups do not have a right to bring suits against the VRA, those are only for individuals. So far, a federal judge and a panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have agreed, pointing out that the text of the Voting Rights Act does not explicitly say there is a private right of action under Section 2. In Alabama, although the Supreme Court rejected Alabama&#8217;s attempt to severely limit how race can be used when redrawing voting maps, the state&#8217;s Republican officials have signaled they&#8217;re gearing up for another challenge against race-based redistricting. Louisiana and Georgia Republicans argue the end of race-based affirmative action means race-based redistricting should also end.</p>

The complaint is filed against Republican Secretary of State John Thurston and the state Board of Election Commissioners, which Thurston chairs. The Restore Election Integrity Arkansas ballot committee has proposed both of the constitutional amendments. Reynolds&#8217; and the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative&#8217;s complaint seeks the state Supreme Court&#8217;s certification of the proposed popular names and ballot titles for the two proposed constitutional amendments. In the complaint, Reynolds and the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative ask for the state Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a 2023 state law that requires the attorney general to consider certifying proposed ballot language for ballot measures, and a 2023 state law that requires petitions for proposed ballot measures to have signatures of registered voters in at least 50 counties rather than at least 15 counties. Act 376 of 2019 shifted the responsibility of certifying a proposed ballot measure&#8217;s popular name and ballot title from the attorney general to the state Board of Election Commissioners before Act 194 of 2023 shifted the responsibility back to the attorney general. The complaint claims Arkansas Code Annotated 7-9-126 (e) and 7-9-107 conflict with Article 5, Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution. The complaint asks the high court to expedite this case on its docket, enjoin the enforcement of the two state laws, and to issue a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction.</p>

A Pueblo District Court judge ordered Patton to undergo an outpatient mental competency exam following his arrest, and, in December 2022, the judge ruled that he was not competent to stand trial. The judge ordered Patton to participate in outpatient mental health treatment in hopes of bringing him to trial at a later date. Instead, Patton’s felony election tampering charge was dismissed Jan. 3, although court records do not specify the reason. A gag order was placed on those involved in the criminal proceedings because the case generated significant media attention in the wake of ongoing conspiracy theories about rigged elections, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 presidential election.</p>

On Jan. 5, attorneys for the Republican Party filed documents with the Nevada Supreme Court that stated they are dropping their appeal. In 2021, then-Gov. Steve Sisolak signed a law that mandates Nevada hold a presidential primary with state and county election officials organizing it. At the time, officials said the law was an effort to put Nevada closer to the front of the primary voting states nationwide and that the primary system tends to get higher rates of voter participation. That is scheduled for Feb. 6. State law does not require the Nevada Republican Party to recognize the state&#8217;s primary results when putting forth a general election candidate. Primaries have voters submit private ballots in elections run by county and state governments. Meantime, caucuses are planned, financed and run by political parties instead of state election officials. The local party members can nominate candidates to represent their political party and voting is public.  If both elections move forward and the Nevada Republican Party chooses to honor the caucus results, the presidential primary results would essentially be disregarded and not count.</p>

The case now becomes the first in what is poised to be a growing number of challenges over potential voting rights violations among voters of color in local elections across the state. It marks the<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/in-first-ny-voting-rights-act-suit-hispanic-voters-sue-hudson-valley-town-for-diluting-their-votes"> inaugural lawsuit</a> filed under the newly enacted John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York, named after the late Georgia congressman and civil rights champion. The suit seeks to replace Mount Pleasant’s at-large voting system — which lets voters across the town vote for all the candidates in local elections, as there are no districts — with an alternative that would make it more likely for a Hispanic person or other candidate of the community&#8217;s choice to be elected to the town board.</p>

Welte&#8217;s decision to adopt and implement a new map comes after a flurry of court filings in the lawsuit since his Nov. 17 ruling that the state&#8217;s 2021 redistricting map &#8220;prevents Native American voters from having an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.&#8221; The judge had given North Dakota Republican Secretary of State Michael Howe and the GOP-controlled Legislature until Dec. 22 &#8220;to adopt a plan to remedy the violation.&#8221; The deadline passed with no new map as Howe and lawmakers sought a delay of the judge&#8217;s ruling and more time to respond. Welte said the new map &#8220;requires changes to only three districts and is the least intrusive option that complies with the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution.&#8221; The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe brought the lawsuit in early 2022. They alleged the 2021 redistricting map &#8220;simultaneously packs Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians members into one house district, and cracks Spirit Lake Tribe members out of any majority Native house district.&#8221;</p>

The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless and other nonprofits claimed Republicans in the state legislature passed House Bill 458 under cover of darkness and with little or no public input to drastically change the way the Buckeye State runs its elections. The legislation eliminated the use of utility bills, bank statements or other documents as forms of identification for in-person voting, and also limited the number of absentee voting drop-boxes to one per county. Early, in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day was also eliminated under the bill. The nonprofits claimed these changes would disenfranchise poor, elderly and minority voters. Nugent found that, under either the Anderson-Burdick undue burden test or a rational basis form of review, the changes had little impact on voters and were constitutional. He cited the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, in which a similar ID law was upheld as constitutional, and pointed out that, &#8220;today, at least 18 states, including Ohio, generally require photo-ID for in-person voting.&#8221; The elimination of early, in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day similarly failed to tip the scales in the plaintiffs&#8217; favor, according to Nugent. He emphasized that the nonprofits provided no evidence of any individuals who were unable to vote in the May or August 2023 elections as a result of the schedule change, and also pointed out the early voting hours from that Monday were &#8220;redistributed&#8221; to other days.</p>

The van was first used in Racine&#8217;s municipal elections in 2022. It was purchased with grant money Racine received from the Center for Tech and Civic Life. The van was used only to facilitate early in-person voting during the two weeks prior to an election, Racine City Clerk Tara McMenamin said. She said the vehicle was useful because it was becoming too cumbersome for her staff to set up their equipment in remote polling sites. It traveled across the city to meet voters in their neighborhoods and collect early ballots. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, on behalf of Racine County Republican Party Chairman Ken Brown, filed a complaint the day after the August 2022 primary with the Wisconsin Elections Commission, arguing that the van was against state law. They argued that it was only sent to Democratic areas in the city in an illegal move to bolster turnout.</p>
