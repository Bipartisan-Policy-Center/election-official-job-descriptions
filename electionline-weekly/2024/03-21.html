							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Measuring a decade of improvements in election administration<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIT Election Lab releases the 2022 Elections Performance Index</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10944" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EPI-300x72.png" alt="" width="300" height="72" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EPI-300x72.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EPI.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Today, the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election Data + Science Lab</a> released the latest iteration of the <a href="https://elections.mit.edu/#/">Elections Performance Index (EPI)</a>. The index, which provides an objective measure of election performance in each state for federal elections, has now been updated to include data from 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the EPI tracks data as far back as 2008, it officially launched just over a decade ago in 2013. It has been updated throughout those ten years, including the addition of new indicators, but it remains a comprehensive, data-focused assessment of how election policy and administration function in all 50 states and DC. In a landscape where election officials must continually adapt to changing environments and new challenges, nonpartisan data-driven measures like the EPI are critical to identifying and sharing the story of how US elections are managed.</span></p>
<p><strong>What does the 2022 Index show us?<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest update to the EPI shows that <strong>election management across the United States improved in the 2022 midterm election</strong>, continuing an upward trend we see throughout the past few iterations of the index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPI compares “like with like” elections, so we measure the 2022 election against previous midterms, rather than the most recent presidential election. But in many ways, the EPI shows us that the 2022 election was a return to “normal” after the challenges of 2020, and continued to consolidate the gains made in previous elections, including in 2020. Looking back at the 2018 midterm, we can see that one of the only indicators that fell between 2018 and 2022 was voter turnout. In 2018, however, turnout significantly outpaced the previous midterm; as a percentage of the voting-eligible population, the turnout in 2018 was the highest it has been in a century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10945" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-10.15.50 AM-1024x526.png" alt="" width="640" height="329" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-10.15.50 AM-1024x526.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-10.15.50 AM-300x154.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-10.15.50 AM-768x394.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-10.15.50 AM-1536x789.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-10.15.50 AM-2048x1051.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has improved on nearly every other indicator. Notably, the 2022 EPI also features new indicators—these indicators were added in 2020, and show up for the first time here for a midterm election. The inclusion of an indicator on risk-limiting audits, in particular, helped many states improve their scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking further back to the first midterm election the EPI measured, states’ massive improvements are even more dramatic. In 2010, the nationwide average score on the index was just 63%. <strong>In 2022, that has leapt to 80%, an incredible achievement</strong>. Among the biggest factors driving state improvement have been improved data collection and practices, as well as more capable websites that feature better tools for voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To explore those historical trends and see how states do over time and across borders, we encourage you to visit the EPI’s website at elections.mit.edu.</span></p>
<p><strong>In summary: Election administration across the country continues to improve<br />
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPI provides an opportunity to step back from the immediate concerns of any given election and take a broader look at how elections are going overall. In this 2022 snapshot, we see that election policy and management in the United States continue to improve across the country. Following the 2020 election, which saw election officials working overtime to ensure that the primary and general elections were able to proceed safely and fairly in the face of the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/healthyelections/www/home.html">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the 2022 election saw both a return to “normal” and a consolidation of the improvements that were made. Compared with the most recent midterm election in 2018, the index shows us improvements across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we look forward to the 2024 EPI, we continue to consider ways to improve the index and to analyze the data we already have. Revisit the <a href="https://elections.mit.edu/#/data/map">EPI webpage</a> from time to time to see what we’re thinking about these issues and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Performance Index is a small part of a continuing conversation about election administration, based on data and nonpartisan commitment to improving how elections are run in the United States. Each election brings its own challenges, and we can’t say for certain what the EPI might tell us—or how it might change—in the years to come, but we can say with certainty that<strong> elections in 2022 were more transparent and easier to access when compared with 2010</strong>. We hope to see the trend continue.</span></p>

In 2024, nearly 97% of all voting-age citizens live in states that will offer at least one universal option to vote <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10936" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CEIRReport1-300x145.png" alt="" width="300" height="145" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CEIRReport1-300x145.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CEIRReport1-1024x495.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CEIRReport1-768x371.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CEIRReport1-1536x742.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CEIRReport1.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />before election day, a major expansion from the 2000 general election when just 40% of voting-age citizens lived in states with such an option. To trace this expansion, the CEIR research team reviewed state legislation and legislative history for relevant voting methods—such as early voting and mail voting—in each state and cross-referenced their findings with other data and the interpretation of state officials to identify changes to the voter experience over time. “In red states and blue states alike, policymakers, election officials, and voters have all recognized the value of having options to vote before election day. The benefits of expanding options to vote before election day are clear, from bolstering election integrity and providing eligible voters more opportunity to cast a ballot,” said David Becker, Executive Director of The Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. “Providing options to vote before election day minimizes the risk of technical problems on election day and allows time to protect against misinformation and build voter confidence.”</span></p>

In </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/20/arizona-presidential-preference-election-voter-turnout/73022998007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not many Arizonans turned out for the state&#8217;s presidential preference races, but those who did saw few lines and a relatively smooth election day statewide. A printer out of ink in Prescott, missing keys for a Navajo Nation polling site and poll workers playing hooky in the Valley were among the biggest problems on Tuesday according to the Arizona Republic. According to the paper, the near-perfect election day bodes well for the upcoming state primary and general elections. While there are still some races headed to </span><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/03/20/a-recount-and-some-runoff-elections-are-still-ahead-in-palm-beach-county-after-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recounts and run-offs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Florida, overall voting was smooth on Tuesday. The day was largely marked with </span><a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/orange-county-elections-low-turnout/60249722"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low turnout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with many of those who did turnout, </span><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/03/19/gop-presidential-primary-more-than-300000-floridians-have-voted-so-far-on-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voting by mail or early </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-person. Ballots are still being counted in a close race in </span><a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/03/20/states-attorney-primary-could-be-in-limbo-for-days-as-mail-in-ballots-wont-be-counted-until-friday/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but overall it was an uneventful election day in Illinois. Turnout in Chicago and other areas reached a </span><a href="https://www.rrstar.com/story/news/local/2024/03/20/voter-turnout/73026581007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://news.wttw.com/2024/03/19/voting-underway-illinois-primary-chicago-election-official-warns-shockingly-low-turnout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> low. While election judges across the state saw less people voting today, the Illinois State Board of Elections reported a significant amount of people </span><a href="https://www.wandtv.com/news/illinois-election-officials-report-significant-use-of-vote-by-mail-for-2024-primary/article_97523000-e632-11ee-a767-af25bd01ec3a.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted early</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the 2024 primary election.  Roughly 430,000 people voted early in Illinois, and 250,000 of those votes were sent by mail. The Illinois State Board of Elections reported only 183,000 people cast their ballots in person prior to Tuesday. </span><a href="https://www.kwch.com/2024/03/19/kansas-voters-experience-short-lines-quick-process-presidential-preference-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held its first presidential preference primary since 1992 and only the third overall. The cost of the primary was about $5 million. “I think it’s really important. We always vote, and also our state’s paying for it,’ said Sedgwick County voter Kandace Jones. The law passed last year by lawmakers to use a primary instead of a caucus is only in place for this election cycle. “The state legislature did the right thing, I think, to have a primary, call it a preferential primary,” Sedgwick County Commissioner Pete Meitzner said. “It’s just this was the wrong year for it with Trump and Biden already secured. I think if they could adjust it, we ought to do it on Super Tuesday like a lot of states.” And in Ohio, while there had been concerns about the impacts devastating storms may have on polling places and voters, overall the primary day went well. Secretary of State Frank LaRose said other than a few logistical measures, there have been</span><a href="https://www.wtrf.com/ohio-election-results/ohio-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-gives-update-on-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> little to no issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the 3,000 polling locations in the state. LaRose credited the 30,000 poll workers who have been expressing their patriotism by working together to ensure voting is a secure and simple process. The </span><a href="https://www.ashlandsource.com/2024/03/19/police-defuse-tensions-at-3-ashland-county-polling-sites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashland County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sheriff’s Office and the Ashland police responded to seven calls on Tuesday to respond to complaints of hecklers and the placement of campaign signage. No charges are expected in any of the incidents from either agency. A </span><a href="https://www.morningjournal.com/2024/03/19/lorain-county-elections-board-poll-worker-fired-after-leaving-provisional-ballots-unattended-at-a-bar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorain County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll worker was fired March 19 after he took a bag of provisional ballots into a bar and left them unattended while dining at the establishment. Undergraduates studying management information systems at the University of Dayton worked with the </span><a href="https://udayton.edu/news/articles/2024/03/boe.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Elections to upload voter information from polling locations across the county. “Election workers like these students are vital to helping us run the primary,” said Board of Elections Director Jeff Rezabek. “Every vote matters, and these students help us ensure ballots are counted accurately and reported promptly.”</span></p>

Bloomington, Indiana, in the path of totality, is expecting around 300,000 visitors around the April 8 eclipse. Because of the increased traffic and all that comes with it, the </span><a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/monroe-county-voter-registration-closed-on-eclipse-day-when-where-to-register.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monroe County voter registration office </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be closed. Voter registration will be extended until noon on April 9. The deadline extension is required by state law. Whenever a filing deadline occurs on a day an office is closed, the deadline rolls over to noon the next day the office is open, according to Indiana Election Division (IED) Co-Director Angela Nussmeyer. Nussmeyer said the IED does not have a list of counties where the county clerk’s office or a separate board of voter registration/elections is closed April 8, but added, “Counties have been provided information by IED on how to handle this potential impact to their workflows.” The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_23,_2044"><span style="font-weight: 400;">next full solar eclipse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t until 2044, but that’s also a presidential year and it’s on a Tuesday! Fortunately it’s a Tuesday in late August (23rd) so that shouldn’t interfere with too many (if any) registration deadlines or election days. </span></p>

The stickers are handed out like little prizes after voters cast their ballots, passed out at precincts and included in vote-by-mail packets across the city. The artist behind the new sticker, Jane Ignacio, has designed everything for the board for more than 20 years, from its social media posts to its election judge handbooks. “Going to the polling place on Election Day is like my Super Bowl,” the freelance designer told The Chicago Tribune. A graduate of DePaul University’s communications school, Ignacio has always been interested in politics, she said, though she began her long-term relationship with the “I voted!” stickers largely by luck after the studio she worked for after college took on the city elections board as a client.

I know my family’s excited to get one when they vote. It’s just cool that everyone’s going to see what I did,” she told the Tri-City Herald. “I wanted that sticker to be for everyone,” Padilla said. Padilla hopes that as voters submit their ballots this fall and put on her sticker, that they’ll be encouraged to continue being civically engaged citizens. “They should keep voting,” she said. Starting with the April 2 election in </span><a href="https://www.mycouriertribune.com/schools/lillian-schumacher-students-create-i-voted-stickers/article_c9ca3c40-b4e3-550d-a022-9fb4f6bbd153.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clay County, Missouri </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters will receive one of four new “I Voted” stickers created by Lillian Schumacher students Juli Abduliah, Genevieve Raash, Kaylee Bridges and Sydney Lunt. Last year, Liberty Public Schools and the Clay County Election <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10933" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClayCoMOIVoted-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Board collaborated to have an “I Voted” sticker competition in Lillian Schumacher Elementary School’s fourth-grade classes. This was an exercise in government, art and education. The students were invited to participate in the competition, followed by an election that determined the winners. The four winning designs will be given to voters in the 2024 April, August and November elections at all Clay County polling locations. “Tiffany Ellison (the Democrat director for the county election board) came to me with this awesome idea of having my fourth-graders create ‘I Voted’ stickers for upcoming elections. I absolutely loved this idea and knew I had to make this happen,” said 4th grade teacher Celeste Fansher. “The kids had the chance to connect to the voting process,” she explained. “I believe parents, grandparents and neighbors will try to collect the stickers this round when they head to their polling places,” Ellison said. With this success, Ellison said every other year, another school will be tapped to participate.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama</strong>: Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation into law this week that put </span><a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2024/03/20/alabama-enacts-new-restrictions-absentee-ballot-requests/?outputType=apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new restrictions on absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Republicans in the Alabama Legislature had named the bill as a key priority for the year and aimed to get it in place before the November election. Republicans said it is needed to combat voter fraud through “ballot harvesting,” a term for the collection of multiple absentee ballots. Democrats argued that there is no proof that ballot harvesting exists and called it an attempt to suppress voting by absentee ballot. The absentee voting bill would make it a misdemeanor to distribute a pre-filled absentee ballot application to a voter. The bill also says that no one other than the voter applying for an absentee ballot can return the application to their county&#8217;s absentee election manager. Absentee ballot applications can be returned in person or by mail or commercial carrier. It would become a felony to give, or receive, a payment or a gift “for distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining, or delivering a voter’s absentee ballot application.”</span></p>

Katie Hobbs, Republicans want to ask voters to end early voting by mail, sharply limit early voting in person and cap precinct voting locations in Maricopa and Pima counties at 1,000 voters.  Republicans have introduced two separate bills that</span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/03/01/more-than-75-of-voters-use-early-ballots-every-az-house-republican-voted-to-take-that-away/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eliminate early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by far the most popular way to vote in Arizona, and to</span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/03/04/republicans-want-to-limit-voting-to-1000-voter-precincts-arizona-would-need-more-than-4100/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cap voting precincts at 1,000 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But if those pass through both chambers, Hobbs would have the power to veto them. </span><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/80419"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Concurrent Resolution 2032</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would instead go to the November ballot and ask the voters for approval, avoiding Hobbs and her veto stamp. Unlike the bill that would ban voting centers to be replaced by 1,000-voter precincts, the resolution would allow counties with populations of 500,000 or less to use voting centers, while it would require counties with populations of 500,000 or more — Maricopa and Pima counties are the only to fit that criteria — to use 1,000-person precincts, though they could open voting centers in addition to those. Jen Marson, executive director of the Arizona Association of Counties, told lawmakers on the Senate Elections Committee that the precinct cap, even with an allowance for voting centers in addition to precinct locations, was completely unworkable. She estimated that around 2,500 precincts would be necessary in Maricopa County alone. That’s more than twice as many as the 1,100 or so the county had 20 years ago — and it was a struggle to find workers to staff them back then. Marson said that the bill “hamstrings counties in a way that’s just untenable.”</span></p>

In addition, the bills would</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-house-passes-bill-to-put-watermarks-on-2024-ballots/B6DXJYZ6OZGIBOB4SN6VIZSXWE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> add watermarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ballots, make voter intimidation a felony, require election workers to be U.S. citizens, allow candidates to proof ballots before they’re printed, and require referendums to raise taxes to be held during high-turnout primary or general elections. The Senate Ethics Committee approved the measures, House Bill 974, House Bill 977 and House Bill 1207, along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The bills also guarantee that official poll watchers have access to voting locations and can sit or stand “as close as is practicable” to election workers. Another proposal would set up a program to scan the human-readable text printed on ballots to ensure that they were counted correctly from computer QR codes. The program would cost an estimated $6 million, and Senate Ethics Chairman Max Burns said legislators are considering the cost during budget negotiations. At least two other election bills are also under consideration this week. A bill that would criminalize using</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/deepfakes-in-elections-could-be-made-illegal-in-georgia/GAW2AHJRY5GA7CSJDSMWTS4F6M/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deepfake computer-generated versions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of politicians to deceive voters cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Ethics Committee considered legislation this week that would, in theory, make it </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-senate-panel-plans-to-strengthen-voter-challenge-laws/IDN6ECORA5CX5DPYUC4J3PZU3Y/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harder to challenge individual voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill from Max Burns comes in response to activists who have challenged over 100,000 voter registrations during the past three years. Burns said House Bill 976 would clarify that voter challenges should be upheld if a Georgia voter registers in another state, claims a homestead exemption in a different jurisdiction or registers at a nonresidential address. The committee heard debate but did not vote on the legislation. </span></p>

A bill approved by a House committee on Tuesday would extend that to 250 feet. Secretary of State Phil McGrane agreed, saying electioneering has gotten out of hand in some places, like Kootenai County. Last year, he said people fought over the single parking space at the local elections office that was 100 feet from the door. “It became competitive for who gets to park and put their signs in that spot to the point that there was a collision competing to get the spot and law enforcement had to be called,” McGrane said. The bill wouldn’t apply to private property within the 250 foot exclusion zone. It now goes to the House floor.</span></p>

Currently, state and federal laws require U.S. citizenship for a person to be able to vote in State and Federal elections, but state Democrats have proposed changes that would allow noncitizen migrants to vote in school board races if their children are in the school district. The Illinois Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 14 would amend the Suffrage and Elections Article of the Illinois Constitution to ensure that U.S. citizenship would be required to vote in any election in the state. The amendment would need to be approved by both houses of the General Assembly by May 5th in order to be placed on the November 5th General Election ballot, to be approved by voters.</span></p>

State Senator Steve Stadelman’s bill would create a new fine for harassing or abusing people who run the polling sites. Stadelman came up with the idea in response to the growing amount of harassment election officials are seeing across the country. He points to a recent report from the William Brennan Institute for Labor Studies that found one in three election workers has been harassed. Stadelman’s bill would establish a maximum $1,000 fine for people caught harassing or abusing election judges. Political analysts say the increase in harassment coincides with a trend of fewer people signing up to be election judges. The bill is still in committee. Illinois does not have any fines like this right now.</span></p>

He said the system is not working as intended. “I think a better model would be, use a regional voting center for the three days of early voting but to reintroduce the precincts for election day itself,&#8221; Thayer said. Under the bill, all counties would move back to a traditional precinct style of voting, much like pre-pandemic. Thayer said the vote center model works in some but not all counties. He added constituents in his home county, Scott, have reached out to him complaining of longer distances to get to one of its 12 voting centers. Kentucky counties can currently choose how to run their individual elections. Tabatha Clemons, Grant County clerk is also president of the Kentucky County Clerk&#8217;s Association, said the system adopted post-pandemic allows clerks to choose what works best for their individual county. “They know their counties best,&#8221; Clemons said. &#8220;Those of us who are serving every day in our local communities understand the needs of our county.&#8221;</span></p>

Carlson’s bill would expand that provision to include delivery by mail. Carlson’s bill is the House and Governmental Affairs Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills under consideration include: </span><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&amp;b=SB134&amp;sbi=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 134</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, would completely revoke voting rights from people on probation or parole for a felony offense. It would reverse laws approved in 2018 that allowed people under community supervision to vote.  Seabaugh’s bill is assigned to the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee. </span><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&amp;b=SB101&amp;sbi=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 101</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, that would prohibit any parishes or municipalities from adopting a ranked-choice voting system of elections. Ranked choice allows voters to note their order of preference for candidates. Advocates say it provides voters a greater say in who ultimately is elected, while critics have argued it goes against the one-person, one-vote standard. </span><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&amp;b=HB90&amp;sbi=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 90</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Rep.

Despite having a limited fiscal impact on the state, Del. Wilkens’s bill does call for the state’s corrections department to hire a new “Voting Rights Ombudsman for Incarcerated Individuals.” This position would mediate any voting access disputes between incarcerated individuals and the MSBE. According to the bill, this new hire would also “assist in facilitating voting by incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>

The bill,</span><a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2024&amp;id=1198&amp;txtFormat=pdf&amp;v=current"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1569</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would require a person registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship, using a method such as a birth certificate or passport.  Republican supporters have presented the bill as a way to solidify the state’s existing ID laws, and eliminate a process known as “affidavit voting.” But Democrats warned the bill, if signed into law, would disrupt the coming presidential elections and prevent some residents from voting. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu suggested he did not think the bill was necessary. Currently, new registrants must sign an affidavit on penalty of perjury that they are citizens, but they do not need to bring in hard proof. The Attorney General’s Office has the power to investigate and prosecute any voter suspected of voting illegally, including by falsely claiming citizenship. The bill would require identification in order to vote – with no exceptions. If passed, the bill would prevent voters who show up to vote without identification from signing an affidavit attesting to their identity and domicile in order to do so. Those voters would need to return with identification or be barred from voting. After approving the bill, the narrowly divided House voted not to reconsider it, a move that prevented Democrats from attempting to redo the vote with better turnout. The bill heads next to the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are moving closer to creating a statewide election portal, a bipartisan proposal that would allow residents to </span><a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2024/03/15/lawmakers-close-in-on-online-voter-registration-in-new-hampshire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register to vote online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the proposed legislation,</span><a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_Status/pdf.aspx?id=23664&amp;q=billVersion"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 463</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the secretary of state would be empowered to create an online tool to let voters fill out a new voter application, request that an absentee ballot be mailed to them, and make any changes to the voter registration database – including their name and party affiliation. Currently, most of those tasks must be done in person, either by a set deadline before the election or on Election Day. Proponents of the bill say it would make it easier for voters of all ages to register and would ease the workload for town poll workers, who are often inundated with new voter registrations on the day of major elections. The portal would cost $426,000 to set up and about $84,000 per year to maintain, according to projections from the Secretary of State’s Office. </span></p>

Rep. Daniel Pae of Lawton was the only Republican to vote no on the bill.  Several House Democrats argued the measure would dissuade citizen participation in initiative petitions and add financial burdens to grassroots campaigns. Presenting the bill on behalf of House Speaker Charles McCall, Majority Floor Leader John Echols described HB1105 as a transparency measure designed to give Oklahomans more information on who is circulating petitions. He said 10 days is insufficient for groups to challenge an initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill to ban ranked choice voting statewide,</span><a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB3156&amp;Session=2400"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 3156</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Eric Roberts, R-Oklahoma City, cleared the House on a mostly party-line vote. The proposal faced pushback from Democrats who argued the measure thwarts local control. Rep. Marcus McEntire of Duncan was the sole Republican no vote.</span></p>

Speaker Joanna McClinton had proposed these measures as part of a wider package of election changes in the last two-year session, but like many election law proposals it died in the politically divided Legislature. “Every bill requires compromise,” McClinton, D-Philadelphia, said Monday as she began to seek cosponsors for the more narrow approach. “We have a lot of work to do in our chamber, of course across the aisle and across the building.” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, R-Indiana, responded to McClinton&#8217;s proposal by referring in a statement to a GOP-supported proposal that also has stalled in the General Assembly: “A lot can happen if we get Voter ID as a Constitutional Amendment.” County officials who run the nuts-and-bolts of Pennsylvania elections have long clamored for more time in the immediate run-up to elections to process mail-in ballots, a proposal McClinton included in her previous bill but is leaving out this time. Lawmakers also did not act to move the day of this year&#8217;s Pennsylvania&#8217;s spring primary, scheduled for April 23, so the date remains in conflict with the first day of the Passover holiday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state Senate committee approved a bill that would </span><a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2024/03/pa-republicans-advance-bill-to-eliminate-election-drop-boxes.html&amp;subscribed=google-oauth2%7C111821618161092336169"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ban dropboxes and satellite election offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where voters can turn in their mail-in ballots rather than relying on the Post Office. The bill was approved by the state government committee by a 7-4 party-line vote. It was opposed by Democrats who disputed claims of intentional fraud involving drop boxes, and argued dropboxes are convenient and more reliable than the U.S. mail. To take effect, the bill would still have to be approved by the full Senate and the state House, and then be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who supports dropboxes. </span><a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=99"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, SB 99,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was spearheaded by state Sen. Cris Dush, R-Jefferson County, who stressed the 2019 state law that made mail-in voting available to everyone doesn’t include dropboxes.</span></p>

Jay Inslee (D) signed </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/washington-governor-signs-three-elections-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three election-related bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law last week. Two of the bills were introduced at the request of Secretary of State Steve Hobbs (D) and will expand the ease of certifying elections and maintaining voter registration information in the Evergreen State.  One of those bills,</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5843.PL_.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 5843</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, authorizes the secretary of state to certify election results in any given county if that particular county’s canvassing board refuses to do so without a reason. S.B. 5843 also adds security measures specifically aimed at countering cyber hacking of election materials and setting penalties for election interference. The second bill,</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1962.PL_.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1962</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, removes a state requirement that any voter who moves within the state must re-register to vote.  Two other bills passed by the Legislature at Hobbs’ request — one that makes harassing election workers a felony and another that expands voter eligibility — are still awaiting Inslee’s signature. Hobbs said in a statement that the four bills passed by the Legislature at his request “will go a long way toward reducing barriers to voter registration, enhancing election security, and supporting libraries and other key services.” The other bill signed by Inslee last week,</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6269-S.PL_.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 6269</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, empowers the secretary of state to start a pilot program for counties to test new options for signature verification on ballots. Signature verification on ballots — whereby election officials crosscheck a voter’s ballot signature with their voter registration signature —  is known to be “notoriously and error-prone,” according to the nonpartisan voting rights nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. This new law allows for the secretary of state to let counties develop their own methods for verifying the signature of any given ballot.</span></p>

At issue was a sweeping Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that barred White House officials, FBI officials, CDC and election experts, and officials from other agencies from having contacts with social media platforms. The appeals court decision is on hold pending a Supreme Court decision in the case later in the term, though the court&#8217;s three most conservative justices&#8211;Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch, would have allowed it to go into effect. Five individuals and two Republican-dominated states&#8211;Louisiana and Missouri&#8211;claim that the government is violating the First Amendment by systematically pressuring social media companies to take down what the government sees as false and misleading information. The Biden administration counters that White House and agency officials are well within their rights to persuade social media companies about what they see as erroneous information about COVID-19, or foreign interference in an election, or even election information about where to vote.</span></p>

The Alaska Public Offices Commission ruled in January that leaders of an effort to repeal Alaska’s open primary and ranked choice voting system violated state law when they funneled their campaign money through an organization registered as a church in Washington state. APOC commissioners fined the leaders of the ballot effort more than $94,000 for violations of campaign disclosure requirements, and ordered them to publicly disclose the sources of their funding. The opponents of Alaska’s voting system appealed APOC’s decision to the Anchorage Superior Court in February. Hartz agreed to a request to expedite the process that came from supporters of Alaska’s voting system. Hartz said in an order issued Friday that the court would issue a decision in June, months before the question on repealing Alaska’s voting system is set to appear before voters.</span></p>

Finchem, who also lost his election in 2022, and Lake each filed lawsuits after that election seeking to overturn the results. In both cases judges found that neither candidate could prove that there was any fraud, malfeasance or maladministration that changed the outcome. In August 2022, U.S. District Court Judge John Tuchi threw out the tabulator case and issued a scathing ruling. He later ordered $122,000 in sanctions against the attorneys in the case, saying that Lake and Finchem’s claims amounted to mere “conjectural allegations of potential injuries.” In October 2023, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with Tuchi’s decision to throw out the case, agreeing that it was “frivolous.”  On March 14, Lake and Finchem asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the lower court’s decision. </span></p>

The suit, brought on behalf of seven District residents argued that the law “dilutes the vote of every U.S. citizen voter in the District,” “infringes on Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to vote” and “unlawfully discriminates against U.S. citizens living in D.C.” in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs also alleged that the law violates the plaintiffs’ “constitutional right to citizen self-government” by “enfranchising noncitizens, and also by allowing noncitizens to hold public office.” The plaintiffs asked the court to block the local law, but the court declined to do so today after finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the law. In her dismissal, Berman Jackson concluded that the plaintiffs “have not alleged that they have personally been subjected to any sort of disadvantage as individual voters by virtue of the fact that noncitizens are permitted to vote, too.”  The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs may object to the law as a policy matter, but “their votes will not receive less weight or be treated differently than noncitizens’ votes; they are not losing representation in any legislative body; nor have citizens as a group been discriminatorily gerrymandered, ‘packed,’ or ‘cracked’ to divide, concentrate, or devalue their votes.” The opinion concludes: “At bottom, they are simply raising a generalized grievance which is insufficient to confer standing.”</span></p>

The case was one of 20 that drew widespread attention when Gov. Ron DeSantis announced charges alleging convicted felons had violated election laws by casting ballots. Those charges against convicted felon Terry Hubbard were thrown out in December 2022 because the judge on the case said the statewide prosecutor only had jurisdiction to prosecute crimes that occur in more than one judicial circuit. Now, state attorneys are arguing that the alleged crimes actually occurred in two circuits, so they want to see those charges reinstated. This all stems from charges filed against convicted felon Terry Hubbard and 19 others in 2022, alleging they violated election laws by casting ballots. In 2018, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment to restore the rights of convicted felons who have completed the terms of their sentences, but it doesn’t apply to anyone convicted of murder or sex offenses, which includes Hubbard. However, when Hubbard applied for voter registration in Broward County in 2019 and 2020, he was issued a voter ID card and voted in the 2020 election. The charges were dismissed after a judge said the statewide prosecutor could only prosecute crimes that happen in more than one judicial circuit. But state deputy solicitor general Alison Preston said the crime spanned across two counties and that Hubbard knowingly committed voter fraud. The panel, made up of three judges, asked both attorneys a series of questions but then adjourned without indicating how or when it will rule.</span></p>

Hours later, Wade resigned. McAfee had ruled that Willis showed a “tremendous lapse in judgment” in having a romantic relationship with Wade and by not keeping clear records of how they financially split personal expenses while working on the case. Removing Willis could have derailed a trial in the case. Willis and Wade each testified the relationship began after she hired him and that she repaid him for trips they took together. But Trump, former White House aide Michael Roman and co-defendant David Shafer urged McAfee to remove Willis because of what they said was a conflict of interest.</span></p>

Lambert was arrested by U.S. Marshals after a hearing over possible sanctions against her for disseminating confidential emails from Dominion Voting Systems, the target of conspiracy theories over former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss. Lambert obtained the Dominion emails by representing Patrick Byrne, a prominent funder of election conspiracy theorists who is being sued by Dominion for defamation. In a statement, the Marshals office said Lambert was arrested on “local charges.” A Michigan judge earlier this month issued a bench warrant for Lambert after she missed a hearing in her case, in which she’s charged with four felonies for accessing voting machines in a search for evidence of a conspiracy theory against Trump.</span></p>

The bill’s new registration requirements are being challenged in both state and federal court. Montana Public Interest Research Group and Montana Federation of Public Employees sued last fall, saying the additional requirements and language requiring a voter cannot “purposefully remain registered” to vote in another state or country are overly vague and broad in violation of the U.S. Constitution. This week’ hearing was on their request for a preliminary injunction blocking the new registration requirements. Morris said he would have an order out as soon as possible and outlined his considerations in whether to grant an injunction. “You’ve talked about the need for election integrity, but we’ve also had in our country a history of suppression of the franchise, and we’ve passed laws to make sure that that franchise is open to all eligible citizens,” he said. “So, how do I balance those two concerns, one of election integrity and No. 2 is making sure that someone isn’t deterred from exercising their right to vote because they’re not sure about their registration status and are worried about potential prosecution even though they only vote once.”</span></p>

This action, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, accuses the state of violating the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by neglecting to ensure voter registration records are accurate and updated, a foundational requirement of the act. Efforts to address these concerns commenced with a formal notice sent to Aguilar in December 2023 by the plaintiffs, urging compliance with National Voter Registration Act mandates. The state&#8217;s inaction has escalated the situation to the current legal challenge, according to the suit. &#8220;At least five counties in Nevada have inordinately high voter registration rates. At least three Nevada counties have more registered voters than they have adult citizens who are over the age of 18. That number of voters is impossibly high. An additional two counties have voter registration rates that exceed 90% of adult citizens over the age of 18. That figure far eclipses the national and statewide voter registration rate in recent elections,&#8221; the plaintiffs say in the lawsuit. In its January reply to the notice sent by the GOP, the state faulted the data the Republican National Committee utilized to assess the accuracy of the state&#8217;s voter registration records.</span></p>

Quraishi gave no timetable to rule on arguments he heard Monday from Rep. Andy Kim — who says the so-called “county line” ballot system used by 19 of New Jersey’s 21 counties violates his right to compete in a fair election. Kim is seeking an injunction to get the unusual ballot system changed before the election is held. Quraishi listened to witness testimony in the case in a hearing that lasted more than nine hours. There were more than 20 lawyers representing the county clerks and three representing Kim, and the judge repeatedly rushed lawyers on both sides.</span></p>

Four county voters are also plaintiffs in the case. They argue that Innamorato did not obtain approval from the Board of Elections or receive public input </span><a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2024-03-14/allegheny-county-sued-ballot-drop-off-locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">before going forward with the drop-off plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as required by law. The filing asks a judge to order an injunction and stop the county from opening the additional drop-off locations until the county executive complies with the laws. Innamorato announced the drop-off locations in February, citing the need to “[expand] access to voting, while maintaining the safety and security of our elections.” DeMarco and fellow council and Board of Elections member Bethany Hallam criticized the administration for circumventing the three-member board, of which the county executive is the chair. DeMarco is also the chairman of the Republican committee of Allegheny County and the only Republican on the board. The suit is being supported by the Republican-backed national group Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections. RITE will pay the plaintiff’s attorney fees in the case. DeMarco said he did not have an estimate of what the suit might cost.

The issue is on the board’s meeting agenda for Wednesday. After the vote, the plaintiffs said they will dismiss the lawsuit — regardless of the outcome.</span></p>

Gibney Jr. gave a greenlight this week to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/judge-rules-suit-against-virginia-felon-disenfranchisement-rule-can-proceed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">novel legal argument challenging Virginia’s long standing felon disenfranchisement policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on limits imposed on the state when the Civil War ended. The lawsuit is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed the former Confederate state to rejoin the U.S. Congress. As a condition for regaining elected representatives in the federal government, the law states that the Virginia Constitution cannot be used to deprive anyone of voting rights “except as a punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” At the time, common law felonies included “murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, robbery, rape, sodomy, mayhem and larceny,” according to filings in the case. In his initial opinion on the case, Gibney indicated that argument had enough legal merit to survive the state’s attempts to have the case thrown out. Rejecting the state’s assertion that federal courts shouldn’t intervene in what’s effectively a Virginia political matter, Gibney ruled that the case “plausibly presents” the possibility that Virginia officials are violating federal law. Though the judge dismissed some aspects of the case, the ACLU of Virginia hailed the ruling as a victory for their side. “Virginia may no longer be a Confederate state, but the provision of our constitution that was specifically put in place to suppress the voting rights of newly enfranchised Black citizens after the Civil War is still oppressing Virginians today,” Vishal Agraharkar, a lawyer with the ACLU of Virginia, said in a news release. “Virginia is still living in the past, but by allowing our case to proceed today, the court demonstrated that it’s never too late to work for justice.”</span></p>

It comes after months of legal back and forth, following the decision last August that district maps drawn in 2021 would need to be reworked. The court’s latest decision boots some state lawmakers out of their own districts, and critics say the ruling undermines voters in the Yakima Valley. Lasnik determined months ago that the legislative district boundaries near the Yakima Valley had to be redrawn. He wrote in the decision that the original maps dilute the voting power of the Latino community, violating the federal Voting Rights Act. In a ruling issued March 15, Lasnik selected a different version of the map to fix that problem, connecting Latino communities across a stretch of the Yakima Valley into the 15th legislative district.</span></p>

Prosecutors charged Zapata in November 2022 with one felony count of misconduct in public office and three misdemeanor counts of election fraud. Her attorney, Daniel Adams, had argued during a two-day trial that Zapata saw herself as a whistleblower and didn’t mean to hurt anyone. Assistant District Attorney Matthew Westphal countered that Zapata went rogue and broke the law rather than sharing her concerns with state election officials, reporters or legislators. “She is not a whistleblower. She’s not exposing information. She’s committing election fraud,” Westphal said during his closing arguments Wednesday morning. “As a society we cannot tolerate people who break the law when there are multiple legitimate means to raise those same concerns.” The jury found her guilty in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on all four counts after starting deliberations Wednesday morning. Zapata faces up to five years behind bars when she’s sentenced on May 2.</span></p>

In honor of Women’s History Month, we’re bringing together women from our Faces of Democracy campaign to hear about their experiences as election officials and the important role they play in our democracy. Join Issue One for a discussion featuring Faces of Democracy members Maggie Toulouse Oliver (NM Secretary of State), Carly Koppes (Weld County, CO Clerk), and Claire Woodall (Milwaukee, WI Election Commission Executive Director).

They are spread by authoritarian state actors and malign non-state actors bent on undermining and damaging free and liberty-loving republics. Unfortunately, most solutions come internally from social media platforms or rest with governments to devise. A new grassroots strategy is needed: bottom-up rather than top-down. That is why R Street Institute and George Mason University are holding an Idea-thon to address the problem and find new solutions. Teams will form to attack misinformation and disinformation from four tracks: government, business/technology, nonprofit, and education. Winning teams will receive prizes. Examples of work products include new legislation and regulations, a business plan for a tech start-up, a mobile app, an academic course, or a new nonprofit. Be creative! Software developers are needed, but no computer science skills are necessary to participate. Just bring your best ideas for combating misinformation and disinformation. <strong>When:</strong> April 20. <strong>Where:</strong> Fairfax, Virginia</span></p>
