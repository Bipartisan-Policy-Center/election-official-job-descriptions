							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Launching Stanford-MIT Election Performance Central</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, scholars at MIT and Stanford are launching a new project to shed light on the challenges facing election administration in the United States during the 2024 election: the</span><a href="https://www.elexcentral.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stanford-MIT Election Performance Central</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EPC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11632" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-01-at-10.48.19 AM-300x54.png" alt="" width="300" height="54" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-01-at-10.48.19 AM-300x54.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-01-at-10.48.19 AM-1024x183.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-01-at-10.48.19 AM-768x137.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-01-at-10.48.19 AM.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The EPC will provide critical information and analysis assessing how the American election administration system responds and adapts in light of the major disruptions administrators have faced since 2020. It takes inspiration in part from the successful</span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/healthyelections/www/home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 2020, which was focused on addressing the unprecedented threat that the COVID-19 pandemic posed to that year’s election. Like the Healthy Elections initiative, the EPC will bring together academic research and the extensive knowledge of those in the trenches of election management. In doing so, we seek to promote best practices to ensure American elections can proceed with integrity and equal access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPC will be home to research on a growing number of topics, including</span> <a href="https://www.elexcentral.org/ballot-drop-boxes-2024-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ballot drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.elexcentral.org/use-undecided-option-2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use of the undecided option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in presidential preference primaries. The website will also house academic reports analyzing the experience of voters and election officials in various battleground states as they navigate voting in 2024. These reports include, for example, after-action reports examining primary elections in</span><a href="https://www.elexcentral.org/state-updates/georgia"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.elexcentral.org/state-updates/wisconsin"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <a href="https://www.elexcentral.org/state-updates/nevada"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others. In all of these reports, a major focus will be on understanding where election administration stands now, as voters and election officials recover from the disruptions imposed by the pandemic in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPC is grounded in the belief that the public is best served when they have access to objective, data-driven analysis of issues and controversies that arise in the course of elections.  Over the past four years, some of these issues have included questions over the patterns of election returns as they are reported on election night, the accuracy of voting machines, and the advisability of hand-counting ballots. The EPC website will host resources that respond to issues such as these, for the benefit of the public, election officials, the media, and policymakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-leading the EPC are</span><a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/justin-ryan-grimmer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Justin Grimmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Morris M.

							<h2>New Brief on AI</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Integrity Recommendations for Generative AI Developers</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New brief from Center for Democracy and Technology </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Tim Harper, senior policy analyst, Democracy and Elections<br />
</span><a href="https://cdt.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Democracy and Technology</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11626" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CDT-300x120.png" alt="" width="300" height="120" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CDT-300x120.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CDT.png 658w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />With over</span><a href="https://perma.cc/H96M-WMH3"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 80 countries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more than</span><a href="https://perma.cc/NP7G-AQR8"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> half of the world’s population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going to the polls this year, 2024 represents the largest single year of global elections since the advent of the internet. It has also been dubbed the ‘</span><a href="https://perma.cc/BYU3-SWEN"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First AI Election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’, in light of the boom in widely accessible generative AI tools that have the potential to accelerate cybersecurity and information integrity challenges to global elections this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the risks that generative AI poses to elections requires an ecosystem approach. In part, that requires focusing on the distribution of deceptive AI-generated election content on social networks and private messaging services, and through robocalls, TV, and radio. While identifying solutions to the distribution of this content is absolutely necessary — and CDT has supported several initiatives to create voluntary standards for technology companies that help to prevent these risks — it is also necessary to consider the policies and product interventions that generative AI developers should adopt in order to prevent harmful content from being created on or spread through their apps and services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we are halfway through this election year, it remains imperative for AI developers to quickly develop election integrity programs employing a variety of levers including policy, product, and enforcement to protect democratic elections this year and beyond.</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usage Policies</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit the generation of realistic images, videos and audio depicting political figures or political and electoral events.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit users from conducting political campaign activities or demographic targeting — at least in the short term — and develop transparent goals for longer-term ethical development of political uses of AI.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit the use of generative AI ad tools for political advertisements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit any conduct that interferes with elections, including actions that prevent someone from voting; mislead someone into voting differently or not voting at all; or incite, support, or encourage violence against election processes or workers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refrain from using stored memory or other methods of personalization in generating responses to electoral and political queries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refrain from releasing text-to-speech cloning tools that allow users to replicate the natural voice of real people, including political figures. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Interventions</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop user interface pop-ups or labels relating to known narratives of election mis- and disinformation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclose how recently your chatbot’s training data was updated when providing responses to time-sensitive election queries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote, and direct users to, authoritative sources of election-related information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow users to report policy-violating answers in chatbots and policy-violating apps built using an API.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include an appeals option for enforcement actions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to develop and embed machine-readable watermarks and metadata into image, video, and audio content using a common standard that social platforms can detect. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcement</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactively enforce usage policies on elections at all times, not just during active election periods. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistently deploy product interventions for the most common election lies, and create protocols to quickly deploy product interventions to address newly emerging, election-specific mis- and disinformation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactively test model answers to common election queries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create escalation channels to accelerate leadership’s visibility into emerging issues, particularly during high risk election periods.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adequately resource and staff policy and enforcement teams. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute actor-level enforcement for election integrity policy violations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparency</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be transparent about election policies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publish regular transparency reports on election mis- and disinformation and deceptive AI usage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consult with civil society and facilitate researcher access to usage data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop relationships and communication channels with election administrators.</span></li>
</ul>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5994" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ODNI-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />ODNI Updates</strong>: The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has recently released two election security updates. The first edition of the report was released back  in </span><a href="https://www.odni.gov/files/FMIC/documents/ODNI-Election-Security-Update-20240709.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">early July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  and the IC assessed that a diverse, growing, and more capable group of foreign actors is or will likely try to influence our elections this November. At this point, the principal actors we are tracking are Russia, China, and Iran. With 100 days (as of July 28) till November 5, ODNI </span><a href="https://www.odni.gov/files/FMIC/documents/ODNI-Election-Security-Update-20240729.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released an update to the original report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The IC continues to observe a range of foreign actors conducting or planning influence operations targeting U.S elections this November. These actors are closely monitoring U.S. political developments, and we expect them to adjust to this month’s developments to promote influence narratives seeking to undermine democratic institutions, foment discord, and/or change public opinion. In general, these foreign actors are conducting broader influence campaigns focused on their core interests and to undermine the United States’ global role, so they are likely to continue to calibrate their efforts to any shift during this election cycle to achieve those objectives. Of note for this cycle, we have observed foreign influence actors refining their tactics to better hide their hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />DDoS Attacks</strong>: This week, as part of their public service announcement series for the 2024 election cycle, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) jointly released</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/psa-just-so-you-know-ddos-attacks-could-hinder-access-election-information-would-not-prevent-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just So You Know: DDoS Attacks Could Hinder Access to Election Information, Would Not Prevent Voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This public service announcement is to raise awareness that Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on election infrastructure, or adjacent infrastructure that supports election operations, could hinder public access to election information, but would not impact the security or integrity of election processes. The PSA is part of the agencies’ ongoing commitment to provide the public with information and the election infrastructure community with the support they need to run safe and <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png" alt="" width="190" height="181" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI-300x286.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FBI.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" />secure elections.“With Election Day less than 100 days away, it is important to help put into context some of the incidents the American public may see during the election cycle that, while potentially causing some minor disruptions, will not fundamentally impact the security or integrity of the democratic process,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley. “DDoS attacks are one example of a tactic that we have seen used against election infrastructure in the past and will likely see again in the future, but they will NOT affect the security or integrity of the actual election. They may cause some minor disruptions or prevent the public from receiving timely information. It is important to talk about these potential issues now, because nefarious actors, like our foreign adversaries or cybercriminals, could use DDoS incidents to cast doubt on the election systems or processes. An informed public is key to neutralizing the impact of foreign influence operations and disinformation, which is why we put out this advisory on what a DDoS attack could – and couldn’t – do.” This warning highlights the importance for voters to seek out information about how to vote prior to Election Day and demonstrates the FBI’s and CISA’s continued commitment to sharing information with the public about potential cyber threats.” This publication is to help educate the public on what DDoS attacks are, their effects on election infrastructure, recommendations for voters, and victim reporting information.</span></p>

Previously, voters had to fill out a cancellation form and return it to their county’s election office. “This is a convenient tool for any voter who wants to secure their voter registration by canceling their old one when they move out of state,” Raffensperger said. “It will also help keep Georgia’s voter registration database up to date without having to rely on postcards being sent and returned by an increasingly inefficient postal system.” Unless voters cancel their own registrations, it can take years to remove them from the rolls. Through the new website, voters who want to cancel their registrations can enter their name, county, date of birth and personal identifying information, such as a driver’s license or state ID number. Then county election officials will receive a notification from the state’s voter registration system and remove those voters. The website can be used by voters who have moved, those who no longer wish to be registered and relatives of voters who have died. County election officials will then send verification letters to voters who cancel their registrations. After the site launched this week, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cancel-voter-registration-personal-information-5bf7d7d474e0e077c7fd50141ff487e8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a glitch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allowed people to access a voter’s date of birth, driver’s license number and last four numbers of a Social Security number. That’s the same information needed to verify a person’s identity and allow a registration to be canceled. The problem, which Raffensperger spokesperson Mike Hassinger said lasted less than an hour and has now been fixed, underscored concerns that the site could allow outsiders to unjustifiably cancel voter registrations.</span></p>

Voters in Tennessee are voting in state and local primaries today (Aug. 1) and voters on Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands will finish voting on Saturday, Aug. 3. On Aug. 6, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington complete their primary cycle. After that, there are still 11 states that will hold primaries. It was a </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/30/arizona-primary-maricopa-county-says-its-ready-for-election-day/74545505007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively smooth day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for voting in Arizona on Tuesday with only minor reports of issues. Polls largely opened on time statewide, and lines were minimal throughout the day. Voting was unimpeded by the technical issues that plagued several counties during the 2022 election cycle, outside of a few early printer jams in the Tucson area and a brief printer setup snag in Phoenix. &#8220;Today&#8217;s primary election across the Grand Canyon State has been mostly smooth sailing,&#8221; said Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, praising poll workers and county election officials for their work. </span><a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/07/31/voter-turnout-tuesdays-primary-election-was-lower-than-expected-maricopa-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turnout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> varied but was lower than expected in Maricopa County. While not on the level of Sharpie Gate, a small number of voters were having </span><a href="https://www.kawc.org/news/2024-07-30/arizona-election-official-says-some-ballots-may-have-fading-ink"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issues with ink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some voters seemed to be using a type of ink that seemed to be fading. &#8220;Having seen many ballots over the years filled out in pencil, yellow highlighter, or the use or pink or purple sparkly gel ink, this doesn&#8217;t surprise me that the new pen technology with the ability to erase ink mistakes could cause problems,&#8221; Lisa Marra, state election director, told a local television station. Many Republican state and county officials in Arizona who have defended the fairness of the state’s elections appeared to have </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/31/nx-s1-5058464/stephen-richer-maricopa-county-elections-arizona-primary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost primary races </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday to challengers who campaigned at least in part on the idea of stolen or broken elections.

I thank NASS for providing this tool to further help people successfully participate in our democracy.” The Google™ Translate function will be available across all NASS webpages including those on business services, cybersecurity, election administration, events, news releases, and more. “Modernizing the NASS website by adding Google Translate ensures citizens may successfully access the voting and business services information needed for success. Accessibility is a key component of our work as state executives, and we encourage all members to consider incorpo­rating in their own states,” said Michael Watson, NASS President-elect and Mississippi Secre­tary of State.

It began in various forms during the Civil War when soldiers could not get home to vote, and it picked up steam again during World War II for the same reason. Mail has been and continues to be a method for providing citizens with access to election information and materials. Today, every state has some form of voting by mail. The </span><a href="https://postalmuseum.si.edu/voting-by-mail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Postal Museum’s exhibition “Voting by Mail: Civil War to Covid-19” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">explores the significant role of voting by mail in America’s democracy. Over time, legislation for both military and civilian voting using the mail has been shaped by events and politics with provisions added, removed and amended. On view Saturday, Aug. 24, through Feb. 23, 2025, “Voting by Mail” invites visitors to explore the changing logistical and political reasons for the various ways mail has been part of the election process, and how it continues to define where, when and how Americans vote in elections. Early methods for absentee voting that used the mail enabled military members to participate in elections when wartime deployments took them away from their polling precincts. The Civil War and World War II caused many states to temporarily establish or expand absentee voting for significant numbers of voters in the military. Allowances for civilians voting absentee grew in the early 20th century and in 1901 Kansas became the first state to permit voting by mail but limited this to railroad employees traveling for work. Since the 1980s, in addition to in-person voting, some jurisdictions, including eight states and the District of Columbia, have instituted all-mail voting with the automatic distribution of ballots to registered voters. The public health emergency of the Covid-19 pandemic brought about temporary procedures, new laws and debates over using the mail for voting.</span></p>

They spoke about Rachel Lightfoot in Polk County, Heather Hall, the Republican Director of the Election Board in Clay County, and Adrienne Lee in Vernon County.

The set of community-created voting stickers will be available at Soldotna polling locations during the Oct. 1 municipal election. Hadley Kornelis, 12-year-old Soldotna Montessori student, won the “Future Voter” category with a depiction of a sockeye salmon against mountains at sunset. Isla Crouse, 15-year-old Kenai Central High School student, won the youth category with her image of a sockeye salmon moving along the riverbank. Addie Nelson won the adult prize with her image of a tent overlooking an ice field. Crouse said her design, centering salmon, was intended to capture an impression of “where we’re from.” Salmon, she said, are something most people who live on the Kenai Peninsula can relate to. “I’m very honored,” she said of being chosen as a winner of the contest. “It’s great to feel that support.” Earlier this year the </span><a href="https://thecitizenonline.com/groveland-township-announces-i-voted-sticker-contest-winners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groveland Township, Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11624" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GrovelandTwpMIIVoted24-300x118.png" alt="" width="300" height="118" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GrovelandTwpMIIVoted24-300x118.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GrovelandTwpMIIVoted24-1024x402.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GrovelandTwpMIIVoted24-768x301.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GrovelandTwpMIIVoted24-1536x603.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GrovelandTwpMIIVoted24.png 1810w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />clerk’s office launched an “I Voted” sticker contest. The contest was open to all students from kindergarten to 12th grade students from Brandon, Holly and Goodrich school districts. A total of 93 students responded and six were selected, two from each school district. Some of the stickers purchased by townships will be available at the polls. The design project was spearheaded by Groveland Township Clerk, Jenell Keller. “This was an idea that I was excited to implement,” said Keller. “I wanted to encourage young children to get involved with the election process and create an ‘excitement’ for it, especially considering the often negative connotation that ‘election’ receives. I was also hoping that these stickers would instill a sense of community in our voters as they proudly wear the children’s stickers as their badge of honor for participating in the election process.”</span></p>

The SECURE IT Act—originally introduced by US senators Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican—could significantly improve the security of key election technology in an era when foreign adversaries remain intent on undermining US democracy. “This legislation will empower our researchers to think the way our adversaries do, and expose hidden vulnerabilities by attempting to penetrate our systems with the same tools and methods used by bad actors,” says Warner, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. The first provision would codify the US Election Assistance  Commission’s recent addition of penetration testing to its certification process.The bill’s second provision would require the EAC to experiment with a vulnerability disclosure program for election technology—including systems that are not subject to federal testing, such as voter registration databases and election results websites. The bill would require manufacturers to patch or otherwise mitigate serious reported vulnerabilities within 180 days of confirming them. The EAC—which must review all changes to certified voting software—would have 90 days to approve fixes; any fix not approved within that timetable would be “deemed to be certified,” though the commission could review it later. The SECURE IT Act doesn’t authorize any new money for the EAC to run these programs.</span></p>

On August 1, the county’s Operations and Administrative Committee is expected to discuss whether to put a referendum on the upcoming ballot. It would ask voters if the Rockford Board of Elections Commissioners should consolidate with the County Clerk’s election division in order to save taxpayers money. Currently, the two bodies operate independently with the Board of Elections handling operations within city limits. It is guided by a bipartisan group of three people who are appointed by the circuit court. Rockford voters approved the commission in 1910. The Winnebago County Clerk oversees voting in the remainder of the county.</span></p>

In an 8-2 vote on July 31, the State Administration and Veterans’ Affairs Interim Committee voted to have a provisional bill drafted. The committee heard testimony from election experts and Montana&#8217;s Motor Vehicle Division about the specifics of how the process works and their options. It comes two months after the group Secure Democracy USA urged the legislators to move forward with the proposal. Although the proposal has bipartisan support, one Republican expressed concern about security. “Granted, I’m a dinosaur and I have trouble understanding all of the electronic processes. But I don’t trust all of them. And especially with the increasing development of artificial intelligence and robotic kind of answers,” said State Sen. Mike Cuffe (R-Eureka). “When we talk to people who are under 40, I’m finding that they are shocked that this is the one thing they can’t do online. Security could easily be dealt with. We deal with it with motor vehicles. We deal with, the bigger threat, if you want to say there’s a threat, is to the voter registration system as opposed to the online piece of it. and that seems to be well, well under control,” said State Rep. Ed Stafman (D-Bozeman), the legislator who brought the motion up for a vote. The bill draft will be presented at their September meeting, and members could then vote to advance it to the 2025 session as a committee bill. The Secretary of State’s office did not participate in the discussion despite being requested to do so, according to Stafman.</span></p>

Howell and assistant Sierra Gustin cited many reasons for wanting to split the operations of the offices. Howell also cited state code that the clerk and recorder is the default election administrator unless another is appointed. District 1 Commissioner Brent Teske wanted the proposal run by Lincoln County Attorney Marcia Boris. Howell also mentioned other counties such as Missoula, Glacier, Bighorn and Cascade that she said have separated the election department from the clerk and recorder’s Office with no detriment. District 3 Commissioner Josh Letcher said he understood the drive for secure elections, but also saw the need for cross-training in both offices so Election Department employees can help in the Clerk and Recorder&#8217;s Office during the off season. Commissioners are expected to continue discussing the proposal at their Aug. 7 meeting. </span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5218" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama</strong>: The Alabama attorney general’s office described a</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-absentee-voting-restrictions-c048cc3214c875a34a1bee7566596658"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new ban on providing voters with absentee ballot application assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “commonsense ballot integrity,” while lawyers challenging the restrictions said they have halted important civic work in the community. The diverging depictions of the new law were aired during a federal hearing on Alabama’s request to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the statute. U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor did not indicate when he would rule, but said he understood the two sides want a decision before the November general election. The new law, originally known as Senate Bill 1, puts restrictions on who can fill out and return a voter’s application form to receive an absentee ballot. It makes it illegal to distribute an absentee ballot application that is prefilled with information such as the voter’s name, or to return another person’s absentee ballot application. And it is a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison to give, or receive, a payment or a gift “for distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining, or delivering a voter’s absentee ballot application.” During the hearing, Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour described the law as a ballot-integrity measure that prevents paid operatives from corralling votes through absentee ballots. “SB1 helps fight fraud and confusion by ensuring that the absentee ballot application process remains in the hands of voters,” LaCour told Proctor. He argued that there are exceptions for disabled voters who need assistance.</span></p>

Earlier this month, Anchorage Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin ruled that there was insufficient evidence to disqualify the measure from a statewide vote. While Rankin disqualified some signatures from a petition seeking to force a repeal vote, a recount by the Alaska Division of Elections confirmed that enough signatures remain for that vote to take place. On July 25, opponents of the repeal initiative asked the Alaska Supreme Court to review an element of Rankin’s decision. In a document called a statement of points on appeal, they say Rankin was wrong when she allowed the Alaska Division of Elections to permit signature gatherers the ability to correct minor mistakes with the ballot measure petition after the submission deadline. In June, Rankin wrote that the division has allowed petitioners the ability to correct minor mistakes as far back as 2015 and that it is allowed under a 2006 Alaska Supreme Court decision that said in part “that the right to initiative is not to be defeated by technical rule violations.” If the high court rules against Rankin’s decision, it could leave petitioners with insufficient signatures for a 2024 vote. The Supreme Court has set an accelerated timeline to hear the case, with written arguments scheduled to finish by Aug. 19. The court has scheduled oral arguments for Aug. 22, two days after the statewide primary election. The court must rule quickly: Ballot designs must be ready in time for ballots to be printed and mailed to overseas voters by Sept. 21.</span></p>

Ogstad sent 18 Instagram direct messages to an account run by the Maricopa County Election Department in August 2022, the majority of which contained threats on election workers’ lives. Ogstad was indicted and arrested in February 2024, and at his subsequent arraignment he pleaded not guilty to five felony counts of interstate threats. He decided to change his plea on July 2, pleading guilty to one of the five counts Thursday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge John Boyle.  “This guilty plea should send a message to anyone who tries to take the rule of law into their own hands through vigilante justice,” U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino said in an email to Courthouse News. “But it also showcases the resilience of public servants. Thanks to the election professionals in Maricopa County who have worked courageously to maintain free and fair elections in spite of the threats received.” Ogstad pleaded guilty to a class D felony, carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison and up to $20,000 in restitution to the victims, none of whom appeared in court Thursday afternoon. The four remaining counts will be dropped at sentencing, scheduled for Oct. 1, according to the plea agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arizona Free Enterprise Club filed a lawsuit over the constitutionality of the Make Elections Fair Act, a </span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2024-07-28/arizona-free-enterprise-club-files-lawsuit-over-open-primary-ballot-measure"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ballot initiative that would institute open primaries in the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The group says it violates the Arizona Constitution by having several amendments in a single ballot measure. The defendants involved include Secretary of State Adrian Fontes and political committee Make Elections Fair AZ. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club points to the other changes made by the initiative, such as the integration of ranked choice voting in the general election. Earlier this month, Make Elections Fair AZ alleged Republican legislators misled voters about the ballot measure. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club has also filed a lawsuit alleging more than half of petition signatures used to get the open-primary measure on the November ballot are illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Jennifer Ryan-Touhill said this week that  she finds </span><a href="https://www.kawc.org/news/2024-07-30/arizona-judge-worried-about-rules-on-political-apparel-not-allowed-to-be-worn-near-polling-places"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;troubling&#8221; some rules enacted by the secretary of state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that she says could lead to people being charged with crimes for exercising their First Amendment rights on Election Day. Ryan-Touhill said the wording of the Elections Procedures Manual could be read to make it illegal for someone to wear a T-shirt into a polling place that criticized one of the candidates on the ballot. And she said she also is concerned about prohibitions in the manual against harassment and intimidation. Assistant Attorney General Josh Whitaker told the judge there is no basis for her concerns. He said the manual is designed to be &#8220;guidance&#8221; for election workers, with no basis to apply its provisions to the general public. Anyway, he said, the manual does not &#8212; and cannot &#8212; expand the laws approved by the Legislature. Ryan-Touhill was not convinced. &#8220;The problem is that the words that were chosen &#8230; have very specific meanings and consequences in a legal sense,&#8221; she said, words she said that appear to have the provisions apply to all. Add to that, said the judge, is that the manual has the force of law, with violations carrying four months in jail and a $750 fine. On top of that, she said, what the manual appears to criminalize are certain behaviors, complete with examples, like raising one&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

During opening statements, an attorney for Peters said Peters was  trying to prevent voting information from being erased. Under the laws in place in 2021, when Peters allowed a man who prosecutors say was working with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell to make a copy of a Dominion Voting Systems computer’s hard drive, she was allowed to hire a “consultant” to make such a copy, defense attorney Amy Jones said during opening statements. “She believed she needed to save that data,” said Jones, who did not deny that a copy was made. But prosecutor Robert Shapiro portrayed the man as a “cyber mercenary” who Peters brought in without conducting a background check and committed identity theft by passing him off as another person who had obtained clearance to work for her office. He said Peters contacted the man, who has not been charged, after she met with Douglas Frank, another person working with Lindell, one of the nation’s most prominent election conspiracy theorists. Frank, an Ohio math teacher, had been traveling around the country looking for evidence of voter fraud when he met with Peters and she hatched the plan, he said. The trial began after several delays, Peters’ failed bid to become Colorado’s secretary of state and her decision to change attorneys on the eve of a trial date in February. The jury was seated July 31 after being questioned by lawyers earlier in the day. Peters is charged with three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, criminal impersonation, two counts of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, one count of identity theft, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.</span></p>

Residents of Districts 2 and 4 who just voted in the May primary election, and in the District 2 runoff, will have to do it all over again — likely in 2025. An election do-over, while extremely rare in Georgia, will allow individuals to run for office who were unable to qualify for this year’s election because they lived outside the district lines in the county-passed map. The order is the second case out of Cobb Superior Court tossing out the county’s unprecedented, self-passed map. The first case, filed by voters and a sitting commissioner, was appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court and then dismissed on procedural grounds. Hill ruled in favor of plaintiff Alicia Adams, a candidate who was disqualified from running for office because she did not live in District 2 under the county map. The Cobb Board of Elections is unlikely to appeal the ruling due to its continued neutral stance on the map’s legality. Elections Board Chair Tori Silas said that while still processing the decision, the board is “glad to have finally received guidance from a court.”</span></p>

Attorneys for the state and groups suing over the law agreed on stopping its enforcement, and District Judge Teresa Watson in Shawnee County, issued an order earlier this week ratifying their agreement. Her order will remain in effect at least until another court hearing after the November election. The law made “falsely representing” an elections official punishable by up to 13 months in prison for a first-time offender, though two years’ probation would have been the most likely sentence. The crime includes causing someone to believe another person is an election official. The Republican-controlled Legislature enacted the law in 2021 by overriding a veto by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. The groups challenging the law argue it’s so vague that volunteers who register voters could face criminal charges if someone mistakenly believes they are election officials, even if those volunteers are clear that they aren’t verbally, in writing or on signs. Watson initially refused in 2021 to block the law’s enforcement and a state Court of Appeals panel later dismissed the case. But in December, the Kansas Supreme Court revived it, saying the law is vague enough for the groups to contest it. </span></p>

The groups asked the Court of Appeals for an expedited hearing on July 16, just one week after appealing a district court judge’s rejection of their election security claims. In a one-page order issued July 25, the court declined to fast-track the case. It gave no reason for denying the request. It was the latest in a series of courtroom filings and arguments between the two groups and the elections board. The case began in March when Maryland Election Integrity LLC and Missouri-based United Sovereign Americans sued the Maryland State Board of Elections in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, alleging a number of violations of federal election law. The group claimed that through “meticulous analysis” it found at least 79,392 voter registration violations that allegedly included duplicate registrations, “registrants with questionable inactive status,” and more than 40,000 with “instances of a questionable registration date.” Their complaint also claimed that “voting system error rates are exponentially above the maximum allowable error rates. Inaccuracy and the specter of fraud have irretrievably damaged the reliability and credibility of results.” And the groups said the elections board denied their requests for election reports made under the Maryland Public Information Act. The lawsuit asked U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher to order the board not to certify the primary election results until the errors were corrected. But Gallagher, in a May decision, dismissed the lawsuit without considering the allegations.</span></p>

Guirola handed down his ruling July 28, becoming the second federal judge in recent weeks to dismiss such a lawsuit. “Mississippi’s statutory procedure for counting lawfully cast absentee ballots, postmarked on or before election day, and received no more than five business days after election day is consistent with federal law and does not conflict with the Elections Clause, the Electors’ Clause, or the election-day statutes,” Guirola wrote. Another federal judge recently dismissed a similar lawsuit in Nevada, rejecting Republicans’ assertions that counting absentee ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but received days later was unconstitutional and violated federal law. In dismissing the suits, Guirola wrote that “no ‘final selection’ is made after the federal election day under Mississippi’s law. All that occurs after election day is the delivery and counting of ballots cast on or before election day.”</span></p>

The lawsuit, bound for the Nebraska Supreme Court, clarified arguments that supporters of felon voting rights made two weeks ago, stating that only courts can stop a law, that the will of voters and lawmakers is being ignored, and that Evnen’s action threatens people’s freshly restored rights. On July 17, Evnen announced he had consulted Attorney General Mike Hilgers about concerns Evnen and Gov. Jim Pillen shared that only the executive branch and the Pardons Board could restore the voting rights of people with felony convictions, not the Legislature. Evnen said he based his decision on an informal attorney general’s opinion from Hilgers arguing that the Legislature had overstepped its constitutional authority, raising legal questions about separation of powers. The two laws at the core of the conflict are Legislative Bill 20, which eliminates a two-year waiting period to restore felon voting rights, and LB 53 from 2005, which established that two-year waiting period. The lawsuit argues that Evnen, through his actions, usurped the Legislature’s authority by invalidating a new statute, LB 20, and that he did the same by now refusing to carry out the previous statute, LB 53.  “That remarkable, unprecedented, and unlawful action prompts this lawsuit,” the lawsuit explained. The lawsuit echoed the argument that years of practice by state officials and court precedent indicate the Legislature has its own authority to restore voting rights in statute without running afoul of others’ constitutional powers.</span></p>

U.S. Representatives Elise Stefanik, Nicole Malliotakis, Nicholas Langworthy and Claudia Tenney, alongside other Republican elected officials, voters and the party’s state and national committees, filed suit on Sept. 20, 2023 — the same day Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Early Mail Voting Act into law. New York previously required voters to select a reason when applying to submit a mail-in ballot, including being absent from home, sick or disabled. The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division’s Third Judicial Department affirmed the law and found there had been “no express provision” in the state constitution mandating in-person voting since Jan. 1, 1967. The Republican representatives&#8217; appeal followed under claims the state constitution seeks to limit who gets to vote by mail. A 1966 amendment outlines conditions for vote-by mail-ballots, for instance, including absence or disability, which the plaintiffs claim applies more broadly than just to absentee voting. “The constitution does not speak in terms of absentee voting,” Michael Hawrylchak, an attorney for the Republican representatives, said Tuesday. “Section two applies to two categories, some of whom are people who are absent, and others are people who are ill or disabled.” Judges on the state’s high court pressed Hawrylchak on whether New York&#8217;s constitution expressly demands that voters cast their ballot in person. The judges did not rule from the bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five out of six defendants surrendered to authorities July 25 to face charges in an </span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/6-charged-election-fraud-case-2023-nyc-council/15094430/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">election fraud case linked to last year&#8217;s New York City Council primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Flushing, Queens. All six are being charged with absentee ballot fraud. They were all volunteers for the campaign of Yu-Ching James Pai, a candidate in the June 2023 Primary for City County District 20. &#8220;As alleged in this case, the defendants went to the Board of Elections and filed fraudulent absentee ballot applications on behalf of 23 voters they had never met,&#8221; said District Attorney Melinda Katz. The six face charges including criminal possession of a forged instrument, falsifying business records and illegal voting were. The arrests are the result of a long-term investigation which began after fellow Republican Dany Chen alleged Pai committed voter fraud on his way to winning the district&#8217;s primary, and after 23 complainants claimed to prosecutors that they were disenfranchised. Prosecutors say they cast 23 absentee ballots for Pai without the voters&#8217; permission. The voters complained after they were told at a polling place that they had already voted.</span></p>

South Carolina’s congressional map was upheld two months ago in a 6-3 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said the state General Assembly did not use race to draw districts based on the 2020 Census. Those new maps cemented Republicans 6-1 U.S. House advantage after Democrats surprisingly flipped a seat two years earlier. The lawsuit by the League is using testimony and evidence from that case to argue that the U.S. House districts violate the South Carolina constitution’s requirement for free and open elections and that all people are protected equally under the law.</span></p>

The ruling stems from a lawsuit Thomas Oldenberg, a voter from Amberg, Wisconsin, filed in February. Oldenberg argued that the state Elections Commission hasn’t been following a state law that requires voters who electronically request absentee ballots to place a physical copy of the request in the ballot return envelope. Absentee ballots without the request copy shouldn’t count, he maintained. Commission attorneys countered in May that language on the envelope that voters sign indicating they requested the ballot serves as a copy of the request. Making changes now would disrupt long-standing absentee voting procedures on the eve of multiple elections and new envelopes can’t be designed and reprinted in time for the Aug. 13 primary and Nov. 5 general election, the commission maintained. Jeffrey Mandell, an attorney representing Disability Rights of Wisconsin, one of several groups that joined the lawsuit, said in an email to The Associated Press that Weber determined that Oldenberg waited too long to file the action. Commission attorneys noted in their May arguments that the envelope sign-off has been in play since electronic ballot requests began in 2006 and Oldenberg could have brought challenged the practice anytime after that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature asked Dane County Judge Everett Mitchell to </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/07/30/legislature-requests-stay-in-lawsuit-over-electronic-ballots-for-disabled-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stay his temporary injunction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granting voters with disabilities the ability to cast absentee ballots electronically so the order can be appealed.  The lawsuit, brought by Disability Rights Wisconsin, the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and four voters with disabilities,  alleges that the current absentee voting system discriminates against voters with disabilities such as blindness because they can’t cast their ballots without assistance under the current rules, violating the right to cast a secret ballot.  In June, Mitchell issued a temporary injunction siding with the voters, ordering the Wisconsin Elections Commission to “facilitate the availability of electronically delivered (i.e., emailed) accessible absentee ballots for the November 2024 general election for absent electors who self-certify to having a print disability and who request from their municipal clerk an electronically delivered absentee ballot in lieu of mailing.” The emailed ballots must be able to be read and marked electronically using assistive technology such as a screen reader.  Despite a request from the groups bringing the lawsuit that ballots be allowed to be returned electronically as well, the completed absentee ballots will still need to be printed and mailed back to voters’ municipal clerks, with Mitchell writing that the order “shall not be construed to permit electronic return of a marked absentee ballot.”</span></p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://pitcases.org/events/data-democracy-workshops-savi-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data &amp; Democracy Workshops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In today’s data-driven world, Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) can be a vital tool for fostering voter turnout and strengthening democracy. This August, the Spatial Analytics and Visualization Institute (SAVI), an official SJSU Campus Institute in the California State University system is offering a special virtual workshop series to empower election officials, policy professionals and researchers to pursue data-driven projects that support free and fair elections. The Data &amp; Democracy Workshop series will be taught by expert SAVI faculty. The six workshops will take place across three Saturdays: August 10, 17 and 24. Each workshop includes a lecture, a lab session and a hands-on exercise. Participants will earn badges by completing individual workshops, or a certificate of completion for completing all six. Participants will explore how Python, R and open source GIST skills can unlock the power of data analysis and visualization in the design and administration of elections, defending democracy in November 2024 and beyond. <strong>When:</strong> August 10, 17 &amp; 24. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

Unlike Electoral College reform or national voting rights legislation, ending partisan primaries does not require a constitutional amendment or an act of Congress. In fact, states like Alaska and California have already taken steps to eliminate partisan dominance of the primary process, by instituting reforms like top-two primaries and ranked choice voting. On August 22, 2024, from 2-3 p.m. ET, Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith will host author and Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano for a discussion on his book, “The Primary Solution: Rescuing Our Democracy from the Fringes.” <strong>When:</strong> August 22, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
