							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Guide Helps Election Officials Handle Intense Job Stress</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/">The Carter Center</a></p>
<p>Being an election official is hard. Not only is there a never-ending stream of deadlines, but there also is a constant crush of complaints and criticism that sometimes escalates to stalking or death threats.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10678" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-18-at-10.41.07-AM-241x300.png" alt="" width="241" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-18-at-10.41.07-AM-241x300.png 241w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-18-at-10.41.07-AM-823x1024.png 823w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-18-at-10.41.07-AM-768x956.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-18-at-10.41.07-AM.png 950w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" />As the United States enters another presidential election year, election workers’ jobs will only get more difficult. The Carter Center has created a<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/mental_health/mental-well-being-guide-for-election-officials.pdf"> resource guide</a> to help them cope.</p>
<p>“I was talking to people at an election officials conference a couple of years ago, and when I would casually ask them how they’re doing, some of them would just start crying,” said Avery Davis-Roberts, a former associate director in the Center’s<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/index.html"> Democracy Program</a>. “They were telling me all the things they had been experiencing since the 2020 election, all of the threats they&#8217;d been enduring and the impacts of that experience on their lives, on the lives of their children, their parents, their spouses. These are just people doing a job that they thought was going to be one thing — administering elections — and now it’s also requiring that they withstand this onslaught.”</p>
<p>Bill Gates is a member of the Board of Supervisors of Maricopa County, Arizona, which has 2.5 million voters. One of the board’s duties is election supervision. After the 2020 presidential election, Gates endured so much harassment that his family went into hiding and he experienced post-traumatic stress disorder. He credits his wife for persuading him to seek treatment after he lost control of his emotions in public.</p>
<p>“That was the worst moment, and that’s when my recovery started,” he said.</p>
<p>The help he received allowed Gates to serve through the chaotic 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election.</p>
<p>“That was a challenging time, but I felt I was in a really great position for it,” he said. “When we’re struggling with trauma and the effects of the trauma, we need to get help.”</p>
<p>Without help, the job and the abuse can seem impossible to endure.</p>
<p>“Tragically, I’m just one of many who have gone through this over the past three years,” Gates said. “It’s driving people from the profession, which I think is sad.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Indeed, a 2023<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-april-2023"> survey</a> by the independent Brennan Center for Justice reveals a high turnover rate among election officials. Eleven percent of current officials surveyed said they are very or somewhat likely to leave their posts before this year’s election. If they do, that means close to 2,000 officials will have left the profession between the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Brennan Center reported.</p>
<p>Although her jurisdiction in bucolic Defiance County, Ohio, is much smaller than Gates’ (just 26,000 voters), Tonya Wichman almost became one of those casualties. Her office recently administered four elections in 10 months. Two full-time officers and four part-time clerks handled all the voter registrations, changes of address, candidate filings, electronic ballot programming, petition filings, absentee and overseas ballots, provisional ballots, early voting, poll worker recruiting and training, Election Day operations, and vote counting and tabulation — four times over.</p>
<p>“It was kind of overwhelming,” Wichman said. “Our poll workers are tired.”</p>
<p>On top of that, she and her crew had to deal with shadowy people trying to intimidate them, and a perpetually angry voter who on Election Day questioned the integrity of the voting process, made threats, and brought election workers (including Wichman’s mother) to tears. A dispirited Wichman wrote a resignation letter, which the board refused to accept.</p>
<p>“I took (the abuse) really personally,” she said. “We work so hard to make sure it’s right that I did take it personally. And everybody’s like, ‘Just ignore that.’ Well, I can’t, because I really believe in what I do.”</p>
<p>Stories like these are why The Carter Center created<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/mental_health/mental-well-being-guide-for-election-officials.pdf"> Taking Care of Yourself to Serve Others: A Well-being Resource Guide for Election Officials</a>.</p>
<p>The guide, co-developed by the Center’s<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/index.html"> Democracy</a> and<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/health/mental_health/index.html"> Mental Health</a> programs, lists signs and impacts of trauma, outlines techniques for promoting resiliency and recovery, provides links to mental health support services, and offers security tips and toolkits.</p>
<p>“Stress takes a tremendous toll on a person’s physical and mental well-being,” said Eve Byrd, Mental Health Program director. “We developed this guide to direct election officials to resources that may help them navigate the unique challenges that come with serving at the front lines of democracy.”</p>
<p>Wichman shared the resource guide with her staff and with the president of the Ohio Election Officials Association, who distributed it across the state.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing about this guide is the fact that The Carter Center saw there was a problem, that someone was acknowledging the stress that election officials go through,” Wichman said.</p>
<p>Davis-Roberts advised election workers to practice self-care and take pride in the important work they do.</p>
<p>“While we&#8217;re in this period of hyperpolarization, we just have to take care of ourselves and each other,” she said.</p>

Submissions are judged on their innovation, sustainability, outreach, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and positive impact. Any program used in an election could be submitted for consideration.</p>
<p>EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks highlighted the significance of the awards in a joint statement:</p>
<p>“Election officials and their staff work tirelessly year-round to navigate the ever-changing landscape of elections, and we would like to continue to recognize these unsung heroes through the Clearies. Their hard work and dedication are instrumental in ensuring that all eligible American voters have a smooth and positive voting experience on Election Day. Through the Clearies, the EAC celebrates the commitment shown by election officials as they address the critical challenges in election administration, including security concerns, accessibility needs, and more. This year’s Clearies will serve as a reminder of the critical role that election officials play in the nation’s electoral process.”</p>
<p>Historically, the Clearies have played a pivotal role in advancing the EAC’s mission as the primary source for election administration best practices, and core to that mission is the opportunity to spotlight deserving programs regardless of jurisdiction, size, or project scope.</p>

While always “one to watch” this year’s primary will feature the added pressure of <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-primary-write-in-votes-voting/46398230">counting thousands of write-ins</a> because of a campaign mounted by supporters of President Joseph Biden who does not appear on the ballot. &#8220;When it comes to counting the ballots,<a href="https://www.sos.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt561/files/inline-documents/sonh/epm-2022_2023-ada_0.pdf"> the instructions</a> that we are giving the moderators and the poll workers generally, is that what is important when you’re counting that vote is can you determine the voter’s intent?&#8221; New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan said. More write-in votes than usual are expected on Jan. 23, but Scanlan said that he still believes that results will be announced on election night. Officials in several towns were still <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/11/metro/new-hampshire-towns-seeking-poll-workers-2024-presidential-primary/">looking for enough poll workers</a> as late as this week. In <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/politics/2024-01-16/bracing-for-a-wave-of-write-ins-and-other-potential-curveballs-nh-poll-workers-prep-for-primary-day-2024">Keene</a>, the city is more than doubling its roster of election volunteers, from 70 to 150 people. “We reached out to the Chamber of Commerce, various large businesses downtown that often allow their employees to do a day for civic service,” Keene City Clerk Patricia Little said of her recruitment efforts. According to New Hampshire Public Radio, along with the unknowns surrounding write-in votes, New Hampshire election officials are also preparing for any possible complications surrounding the state&#8217;s new<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2023-12-15/first-affidavit-ballot-was-cast-in-nh-last-month-and-then-was-pulled-from-final-vote-tally"> affidavit ballot</a> law. The primary will mark the first statewide election where voters who register at the polls for the first time without valid identification will use special, marked ballots. If they don&#8217;t return proof of eligibility to the Secretary of State&#8217;s office within seven days, their votes<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2023-12-15/first-affidavit-ballot-was-cast-in-nh-last-month-and-then-was-pulled-from-final-vote-tally"> could be removed</a> from the final tally. In addition to prepping for new laws and write-ins, local elections officials are doing other routine election prep like <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/ballot-machines-test-new-hampshire-primary-011724/46426208">testing voting equipment</a>. “It is my honor” to help run elections, said <a href="https://www.laconiadailysun.com/news/local/gilford-poll-workers-prepare-for-a-long-day-but-a-fun-day/article_16db93a2-b578-11ee-bdf3-572e1df6f508.html">Guilford</a> Town Clerk Danielle LaFond. “It can be a long day, but it’s a fun day.”</p>

In <a href="https://www.9and10news.com/2024/01/16/early-voting-offered-for-everyone-in-michigan-for-the-first-time-counties-preparing/">Michigan</a> elections officials are busy preparing for the February 27 Presidential Primary which will feature in-person early voting for everyone for the first time. Officials are still awaiting e-poll books and training. “Our first time ever, we’re still waiting on equipment from the state of Michigan, our poll box that we need to utilize and figure out on our own first and how we’re supposed to utilize them,” said <a href="https://www.9and10news.com/2024/01/16/early-voting-offered-for-everyone-in-michigan-for-the-first-time-counties-preparing/">Isabella County</a> Clerk Minde Lux Lux. And clerks still need to go through training. “We have to be trained and then we have to train those that are going to be working the nine-day early voting,” said Lux. But they will be ready. “We’re going to be setting up there Feb. 1 and we’ll be there until the end of February. So, all of our equipment ballots, everything will be there,” said Lux.

He said Tong’s decision was disappointing, but not directly related to what he wants — the decision referenced constitutional offices like governor and secretary of the state, not municipal or national elections. “Because we&#8217;re starting with the allowance of getting rank choice voting, getting the foot in the door, this gives people the opportunity to see what rank choice voting is,” Eliott said. “And then if it is determined that later down the line that people really liked rank choice, and they want to see it implemented for other elections, then we can look towards changing the constitution.” Elliott said this session, he&#8217;s focused on passing legislation to convene a task force or working group to determine the feasibility of ranked-choice in Connecticut. He said the state constitution could be amended in the future to allow ranked-choice — but that would be a ways away. In <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/01/12/ranked-choice-voting-opponents-file-petition-in-quest-to-overturn-alaskas-voting-system/">Alaska</a>, a group seeking to overturn Alaska’s voting system on Jan. 12 submitted signatures to the Alaska Division of Elections, a necessary step in their effort to put the repeal question on the 2024 ballot. The embattled opponents of ranked-choice voting — recently fined over $94,000 by Alaska’s campaign regulatory commission — are seeking to use a ballot measure to overturn the state’s open primaries and ranked-choice general elections. The system was approved via a ballot measure by Alaska voters in 2020, and first used in 2022. It is now up to the Division of Elections and the lieutenant governor’s office to count the signatures and verify they fulfill the state’s requirements to certify the question and place it on the 2024 ballot. In an initial count completed Friday morning, election workers tallied 41,895 signatures.</p>

							<h2>New Research and Reports</h2>
														<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10580" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-20-at-10.50.18-AM-300x186.png" alt="" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-20-at-10.50.18-AM-300x186.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-20-at-10.50.18-AM.png 488w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ranked Choice Voting</strong>: Ranked choice voting has measurable positive impacts for voters and candidates of color, a<a href="https://mailtrack.io/link/0b12532bf7cb3142cbafa9c69cfdf78fcd32b388?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffairvote.org%2Freport%2Fcommunities-of-color-2024%2F&amp;userId=7869864&amp;signature=57473ac08fb22816"> new FairVote report</a> finds. The report examines 448 ranked choice voting elections across 20 years and finds that: 1) Candidates of color benefit from the RCV counting process, gaining more support as lower-performing candidates are eliminated; and 2) RCV allows several candidates of color to run in the same race without “splitting the vote.”  The report also includes case studies about historic candidates elected in RCV races, including majority-people of color city councils in New York City, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, and St. Paul, and the first Alaska Native elected to Congress. Its findings build on research and election data showing that candidates of color are more likely to win RCV contests, and several previous<a href="https://mailtrack.io/link/a8b2ac57825119d154634b3201fd64235a0bc21b?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffairvote.org%2Fresources%2Fdata-on-rcv%2F%23voter-support-and-understanding&amp;userId=7869864&amp;signature=b6ea6552352457af"> surveys</a> showing high support for RCV among Black and Latino voters. &#8220;As ranked choice voting grows across the country, it is delivering on its promises of representation,”  said Deb Otis, FairVote’s Director of Research and Policy and co-author of the report. “Candidates of color are running and winning in RCV elections. Candidates are building majority coalitions through positive campaigning, and consolidating – rather than splitting – the power of their community. Voters of color are taking advantage of the opportunity to rank, and don’t feel forced to vote for the ‘lesser of two evils.’” The report also includes two additional case studies: One covers Alaska Native Mary Peltola’s election to Congress and the behavior of Alaska Native voters in that RCV contest. The other covers the impact of “cross-endorsements” – candidates encouraging voters to rank them first and a specific opponent second – in a Harlem city council district.

The report,<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=b637748d57&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> A Silenced Generation: How the Power of the Youth Vote Collides with Barriers to Voting</a> authored by Movement Advancement Project (MAP) and released in partnership with <a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=e9896ffa17&amp;e=284d5ebbe2">The Civics Center</a>, creates a framework for evaluating states’ policy climate for youth voting. The report also details policy solutions to remove obstacles that impact youth voter turnout. Analysis in the report finds that nearly one in ten young voters live in a state with a low Youth Democracy Score. Included in the report is a foreword by Laura W. Brill, Executive Director of The Civics Center. “Young voters are a formidable voting demographic and engaging them now is vital to creating a new generation of active, lifetime voters. However young voters face a range of obstacles in registering to vote and casting their ballot,” said Brian Hinkle, Senior Voting Policy Researcher at MAP.  An estimated 53 million voters under 30 will be eligible to vote this year, including an estimated 8 million young people who have become newly eligible to vote since the 2022 midterm elections. That young people are less likely to vote isn’t surprising considering the core obstacles they face, which are detailed in the report. The lack of voting experience creates an information gap about where, when, and how to register and vote.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Moving frequently creates challenges for registration and voting.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Fewer resources and unpredictable work schedules make it hard to get to the polls to vote.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Targeted efforts by lawmakers to suppress turnout and disenfranchise young voters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Included in the report is a series of policy recommendations for how states can remove barriers and engage young voters. Lawmakers can take concrete steps to streamline voter registration and improve access to the ballot, including in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Voter pre-registration:<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=87bbf9b41f&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> Twenty states and D.C. allow pre-registration</a> at age 16, so long as the person will be 18 when they cast their vote. An additional four states allow pre-registration at age 17. Research shows that pre-registration results in higher voter turnout among young voters and is growing in popularity. From 2014 to 2020, the number of pre-registered young people more than doubled to nearly 1 million young voters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Election Day voter registration: Allowing voters to register the same day that they cast their vote is a fail-safe, especially for young voters and others who move more frequently and may face challenges with registration as a result. Only<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=4f3fab5107&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> 22 states allow voters to register on the same day they vote</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Voter ID and allowing student IDs: Most states ask voters to show some form of ID to vote. However, young people are less likely to have a driver&#8217;s license, the most common form of ID, and may only have a student ID. Nine states explicitly do not allow a student ID to be used for voting, including several states with the<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=9b57ca2238&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> most restrictive photo ID laws</a>. Restrictive photo ID laws are particularly harmful to young people of color.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Vote by mail: In<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=dd84460e6d&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> 36 states, voters can request an absentee ballot without having to provide a reason</a>. This makes voter participation easier for young voters, among other voters who may not be able to make it to a polling place. In states with the most restrictive mail voting policies, youth turnout is as much as 15 percentage points lower.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Early voting availability: Young voters often work unpredictable schedules at hourly jobs where they may be forced to choose between wages and voting. Early voting increases the opportunities to vote, and youth voters are among the populations who benefit. In 2022,<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=61753c757c&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> more than half</a> of young voters cast their ballots before Election Day. While<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=2d85d1df73&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> most states offer some form of in-person early voting, the length of availability varies widely</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional recommendations in the report address policies that include online voter registration, automatic voter registration, increasing polling locations, paid time off to vote, and recruiting young voters as poll workers, among other policies. The full list of policy recommendations is<a href="https://lgbtmap.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dccdb6f1f425fbfc51cf53f41&amp;id=9ad54eee20&amp;e=284d5ebbe2"> available in the report</a>.</p>

Kenyatté Hassell, D-Montgomery, would remove the list of reasons for voting by absentee ballot. Currently, voters must check their reason for voting absentee on the absentee ballot application, then again on the absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.legislature.state.al.us/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/SB1-int.pdf">SB 1</a>, introduced by state Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, will make it illegal for individuals to pay or be paid for assisting others in completing absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications. Meanwhile, Rep. Adline Clarke, D- Mobile, filed<a href="https://www.legislature.state.al.us/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/HB12-int.pdf"> HB 12</a>, a bill designed to allow a disabled voter to designate an individual to deliver the voter&#8217;s application for an absentee ballot to the absentee election manager.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5170" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AlaskaCapitol-300x194.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="194" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AlaskaCapitol-300x194.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AlaskaCapitol-768x497.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AlaskaCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alaska:</strong> The Alaska House Judiciary Committee voted to advance a bill that would <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2024/01/17/alaska-house-committee-advances-legislation-to-repeal-ranked-choice-voting/">repeal ranked choice voting and open primaries</a>. The bill was first proposed last year by Homer Republican Rep. Sarah Vance to undo changes to Alaska’s voting laws, which were instituted through a 2020 ballot measure narrowly approved by Alaska voters. The committee voted to advance the bill in a 5-2 vote, with all five Republicans in favor and the committee’s two Democrats opposed. The measure heads next to the House Finance Committee. The bill has yet to be considered in the Senate and is likely to face headwinds there, where members of the majority have said they oppose efforts to repeal the voting method. Opponents of the changes adopted through the 2020 ballot measure say the new voting laws disadvantage conservative Republicans. Proponents of the new system say it leads to electing politicians who appeal to a wider swath of voters and are more willing to work across party lines. The original bill brought by Vance would have repealed ranked choice voting and open primaries. Vance proposed an amendment Wednesday — adopted in a 5-2 vote along party lines — to repeal the campaign reporting requirements, as well.</p>

The General Assembly passed legislation in 2019 providing for a paper backup to electronic ballots, a move aimed at giving Georgians more confidence their votes are being recorded accurately. But some voters have complained that the QR codes are confusing and impose a barrier on transparency. The other potential change to election laws would shift investigations of voter complaints of election fraud from the secretary of state’s office to the State Election Board. Burns said such a move would help make the board more independent.</p>
<p>A Republican-sponsored bill introduced would <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/bill-allows-georgia-election-board-investigations-of-raffensperger/H2GDBN2VWNA3LJ7MTCSUZIJDP4/">empower the State Election Board to investigate Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger</a>, a response to the board’s decision last month not to open an inquiry. The measure would also remove Raffensperger, a Republican, as a nonvoting member of the State Election Board and require him to cooperate with investigations. The legislation, Senate Bill 358, comes after the board deadlocked on whether to pursue complaints by conservative activists who blame Raffensperger for human errors in Fulton County’s manual audit of the 2020 election. The problems, including over 3,000 double-counted and misallocated votes, didn’t change the overall outcome of the statewide audit, which confirmed Democrat Joe Biden’s win over Republican Donald Trump. “It is time for the secretary of state to be held reasonably accountable, like all other elected officials,” said Senate Ethics Chairman Max Burns, a Republican from Sylvania whose committee handles election bills.</p>

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Karl Rhoads held an educational panel at the Hawaii Capitol to speak about his intention to bring the bill back to the Legislature during the upcoming session. The panel included moderator Colin Moore of the University of Hawai‘i Economic Research Organization, House sponsor Rep. Jeanne Kapela, Maui County Council member Keani Rawlins-Fernandez and Common Cause HI Program Director Camron Hurt. Senate Bill 1543 was introduced in 2023 to establish a comprehensive system of public financing for all candidates seeking election to state and county public offices. The final version of the bill stated in part “the common belief is that the current campaign finance system used in Hawai‘i (and most other states) unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors who use their donations to buy access to candidates and elected officials.</p>

It allows the state to compare information from credit agencies against voter registration records, in an effort to find out if someone has moved.

<p>Sen. Gary Byrne (R-Byrneville) has filed a bill to <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/indianapolis/2024/01/12/free-bus-rides-election-day">prohibit public transportation agencies</a> from offering free or reduced-fare rides on election days. For the past two years, the AARP of Indiana has sponsored free Election Day rides on public transit in Indianapolis, Gary, Fort Wayne and Evansville. Byrne told Axios the bill is about fairness for Hoosiers, like those who live in rural areas, who don&#8217;t have access to public transportation. &#8220;The rural parts of those counties can&#8217;t get a free ride,&#8221; he said. Byrne said early voting and vote by mail give people who may struggle to reach the polls on Election Day other opportunities to vote.</p>

The bill,<a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB1014/2024"> HB 1014</a>, would require high schools to develop programs to assist students in the voter registration process. State Rep. Mark Paige, D-Exeter, introduced the measure after hearing from constituents who commented on the close relationship between civic engagement and voting. Voter registration efforts, he said, vary across state high schools. Paige believes the bill&#8217;s goal to improve participation among young people bolsters existing aims of state civic education and government requirements passed in the last legislative session. “A goal of our civics curriculum is to ensure students leave our schools and enter the world prepared to be engaged citizens as participants in the electoral process, and this bill helps make good on that promise,” said Paige. “Young people want to be engaged, hold elective officials accountable, and determine their future; if we can better position schools to help them do that with measures like this, we should not hesitate.”</p>

Kathleen C. Hochul just weeks ago. Under the new law, most elections at the County and municipal levels, outside New York City, are now moved from odd years to even years. Supporters of the legislation say this shift will increase voter turnout. However, those against the effort contend the opposite would occur. With longer ballots, it would take more time to complete a ballot, causing longer wait times. Both Walczyk and Walsh voted against the bill earlier this year.  In a bill introduced in the last week of 2023, Walczyk, R-Watertown, and Walsh, R-Ballston Spa, put forward a plan that would return the elections for local seats like county legislator, town supervisor or council member and some local department supervisor positions to odd years, when they have historically occurred.</p>

SB 17: An Act to modify the residency requirements for voter registration and declare an emergency. Last year the Legislature amended SDCL 12-4-1 to state that in order to register to vote a person needs to maintain a residence in South Dakota for at least 30 days prior to registering.  The problem is that there is no time frame for when the 30 days is calculated. Is it 30 days immediately prior to registering or is it 30 days in the person’s lifetime?  The proposed amendment places an identifiable and easily calculated 365-day time frame. SB 18: An Act to allow the secretary of state to share information from the statewide voter registration file.  If passed, this would allow the secretary of state to share voter registration information with other states in order to try and identify any voter who, for whatever reason, is registered in more than one jurisdiction. Currently, information is shared but on a limited basis. <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/17/threatening-election-poll-workers-in-south-dakota-could-become-illegal-south-dakota-legislature/72256897007/">SB 20</a>: An Act to establish the crime of threatening or intimidating an election official or election worker and declare an emergency.

SB 48:  An Act to provide for the disclosure of a cast vote record and ballot images as a public record and declare an emergency. A cast vote record (CVR) is an electronic record of a voter’s ballot contest selections that is created when the paper ballot is run through a tabulator. A CVR can then be compared to the ballot image to ensure that the tabulating machine read the ballot correctly. Presently there is litigation concerning this issue. This bill would clear up the issue for 2024 and into the future. Only counties who have purchased the required software would be able to produce a cast vote record.</p>

Kera Birkeland has proposed a bill that would require Utahns to <a href="https://www.kpcw.org/summit-county/2024-01-13/summit-county-representative-will-try-again-to-end-universal-mail-in-voting">opt-in to mail-in voting</a>. Starting in 2026, instead of automatically sending ballots to all registered voters, the bill would require citizens to opt-in online or on their ballot during this year’s election. “For everyone who either isn&#8217;t returning their ballots, throwing away their ballots or goes to the election polling location to vote, they can just, you know, not check a box and no longer worry about ballots,” Birkeland said. According to Birkeland, this would clean up voter rolls by preventing ballots from going to people who don’t want to vote or would prefer to vote in person. However, Summit County Clerk Eve Furse said most Utahns vote by mail. Almost 94% of people who voted in the General Election in 2022 voted by mail. In 2023 in Summit County, 99% of the votes were by mail.</p>
<p>Another proposal would require that <a href="https://kslnewsradio.com/2072398/on-the-first-day-of-the-utah-legislative-session-talk-of-changes-to-mail-in-ballots/">mail-in ballots arrive</a> at the clerk’s office by Election Day.  Right now, they must simply be post-marked on election day. <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0214.html">H.B. 214, Election Modifications</a> is sponsored by Rep.

The state House of Representatives, on an 86-11 vote, approved House Bill 1241 to make it a class C felony for a person to threaten election officials with injury through words or conduct. Today, such behavior carries a lesser penalty of a gross misdemeanor. The same bill cleared the House on a 90-7 vote last session but lapsed in the Senate. It is expected to receive a hearing in the Senate in early February. “Our election workers are the heroes of democracy,” said Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place, the bill’s prime sponsor, in a floor speech. In addition to stiffer penalties, the bill allows election officials and family members living with them to enroll in the state’s address confidentiality program. State Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen voted against the bill. He said no one in Washington should be harassed but he disagreed with making the crime a felony when the penalty for possession of fentanyl is a gross misdemeanor. It should be a felony, he said.</p>

Boulee upheld Georgia’s <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-upholds-short-turnaround-for-georgia-runoffs-under-voting-law/HYZ7LTLHORGBDNV2LGBJ7A6G3M/">shortened four-week runoff period</a> mandated by the state’s 2021 voting law, ruling that there wasn’t evidence to prove discrimination against Black voters. Boulee’s decision keeps in place quick runoffs after general elections and fewer early voting days before runoffs. The ruling also maintains a voter registration deadline 29 days before elections, preventing new voters from being able to sign up ahead of runoffs. “Plaintiffs presented evidence that Black voters are more likely to vote early. Plaintiffs did not present any evidence, however, which would show why Black voters would disproportionately struggle to vote during the new early voting period,” Boulee wrote in a 31-page order. “&#8230; All of the factors weigh against a discriminatory intent finding.” Before the law was passed, runoffs were held nine weeks after the general election. “This ruling affirms what we have maintained all along — that Georgia’s Election Integrity Act is designed to ensure fair and secure elections for all citizens,” Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. “We will continue to stand firm in defending the principles of this legislation.”</p>

Murphy ordered the secretary of state to issue a new decision on Trump once the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in on a related case. Trump had appealed the ruling by the Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, urging Maine courts to overturn her decision. Bellows had suspended the effect of her ruling, giving state courts the chance to hear an appeal. In her ruling, Murphy stayed Bellows&#8217; decision and &#8220;remands this matter to the Secretary for further proceedings as necessary in light of the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s forthcoming decision in Trump v. Anderson [the Colorado case].&#8221; Murphy ordered that Bellows&#8217; new ruling, &#8220;modifying, withdrawing, or confirming&#8221; her initial ruling, come no later than 30 days after the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision.</p>

Jones targeted Monica Palmer, the Republican chairwoman of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, and her family, the FBI said in a court filing. Investigators say Jones sent photos of a dead body and threatened Palmer on Nov. 18, 2020, apparently because she was upset that Palmer and another Republican on the four-member Board of Canvassers initially refused to certify Wayne County&#8217;s election results on Nov. 17. The certification is typically a routine step on the way to statewide certification. The two members subsequently certified the totals in favor of Joe Biden after people watching the public meeting on video conference criticized them during a comment period. Jones pleaded guilty to two counts of threats of violence through interstate commerce.</p>

In an order issued Jan. 16 by Chief Justice Natalie Hudson, the court said it would decide the fate of the law. It permits people with felony convictions to vote as long as they’re not behind bars. Justices scheduled oral arguments for April 1. A conservative group known as the Minnesota Voters Alliance sued over the law’s 2023 enactment, saying the Legislature overstepped its authority. Late last year, a judge ruled against the challenge that could affect eligibility for tens of thousands of voters. The alliance asked to skip straight to the Supreme Court, bypassing the Court of Appeals. In its petition, the group’s attorney said the case needs final resolution by Minnesota’s highest court soon.</p>

The Republican groups are asking to become parties in the case to defend<a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NH-SB-418.pdf"> New Hampshire Senate Bill 418</a>, an election law requiring those who register to vote without a photo ID on election day to send in qualifying documentation within seven days to keep their ballot from being thrown out. The DNC sued New Hampshire officials over the law last month, arguing it will disenfranchise voters in the state — including young people, working families and other key voting groups. The Republican groups argue in their new filing that the relief sought by the DNC would “directly harm the legal rights and interests”of the RNC and NHRSC, as well as their registered members and voters.</p>

The bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission deadlocked in June 2023 on a vote to reappoint Meagan Wolfe as the administrator of elections in the presidential battleground state. The three Republican commissioners voted in favor, but the three Democrats abstained to block the nomination from going before the state Senate because that would have then allowed Republicans there to fire her. Actions by the commission require a four vote majority. “I agree with WEC that the public expects stability in its elections system and this injunction will provide stability to protect against any further legally unsupported removal attempts,” Peacock wrote in her Jan. 12 order saying that Wolfe holds her position legally. Peacock, in her Jan. 12 ruling, said Wolfe is legally serving as administrator of the elections commission as a holdover given that the commission deadlocked on whether to reappoint her. The Senate’s vote to remove her had no legal effect, Peacock ruled for the second time, and the commission has no duty to appoint a new leader while Wolfe is serving as a holdover. “I hope this will put an end to attempts by some to target nonpartisan election officials and fabricate reasons to disrupt Wisconsin elections,” Wolfe said in a Jan. 12 statement. “The effort to undermine me was especially cruel given that the defendant legislators themselves admitted in court that I remain the lawful administrator.”</p>
