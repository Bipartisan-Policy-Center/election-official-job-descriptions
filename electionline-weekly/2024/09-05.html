							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advocates, Not Adversaries </strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing for Meaningful Observation </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Rokey Suleman and Michele Forney </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters across the country expect and are entitled to fair, transparent and accurate elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s up to election officials and observers to work together to make this happen. While some see these groups as adversaries, in truth, their distinct roles are mutually supportive. And at their best, they can even be advocates for one another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year after year, election after election, officials demonstrate that election processes are transparent, bipartisan and administered by professionals. Observers want to ensure that election officials and workers are doing their jobs correctly, complying with the law and administering trustworthy elections. Their first-hand observation validates each election process and amplifies the transparency, bipartisanship and professionalism that officials bring to each election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By following three pillars, election officials and observers can ensure they successfully perform their roles and fulfill their responsibilities. The </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are hosting a two-part webinar series at 12 p.m. EDT on </span><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_DrA5QYzhTo2xglCkcwOrLw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 26</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YhHPeptZS86UD50EyC8lFg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to discuss the pillars and introduce observer management resources to help achieve them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pillar One: Managing and Providing Opportunities for Meaningful Observation</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When observers, voters and election officials understand how elections work and their roles in the process, they create an effective environment for </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/election-observer-resources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaningful observation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Election officials need to put themselves in the observers’ shoes and help explain processes with useful signage and handouts and staff liaisons. Clear communications about </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/shared-expectations-for-meaningful-election-observation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mutual expectations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help ensure that observers understand the value of their role and the value of allowing election workers to perform their duties without disruption or harassment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pillar Two: Managing Physical Safety and Operational Security</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond providing meaningful observation opportunities for observers, election administrators must</span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/secure-hq-checklist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensure that their facilities and staff are safe and secure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for both observers and officials. They must also protect significant amounts of sensitive information, from security protocols to personally identifiable information. This balance is critical to election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pillar Three: Managing Conflicts</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite providing an effective environment for observation, conflict can still arise. Training in de-escalation skills and strategies can help defuse an uncomfortable situation and prevent it from getting worse. The Elections Group, in partnership with the </span><a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging Divides Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Princeton University, has developed several </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/de-escalation-resources-for-election-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a self-paced de-escalation course intended for permanent and temporary election workers. </span></p>

According to The Associated Press, the Postal Service has been undergoing rapid changes, including the opening of large hubs, but some of those changes are being paused before the election to ensure they don’t interfere with performance, DeJoy said. And it will be all hands on deck to ensure the millions of mail-in ballots are delivered swiftly to their destinations. “We’re going to be in great shape for the election. I’m pretty confident about everything that were doing,” DeJoy told The Associated Press ahead of an official rundown of election mail practices. “The American people should be confident.” U.S. Postal Service officials briefed reporters last week on measures that are being taken to ensure election mail reaches its destinations, building on its performance in 2020, when 97.9% of ballots were returned to election officials within three days, and in 2022, when 98.9% of election mail was delivered within three days. DeJoy said he’d like to inch closer to 100% this election cycle. “We have to be louder than the noise in communicating how well we’re going to do and that things are going to be OK. Things are going to be good. We’re in a better operating position than we ever have been,” DeJoy said. Adrienne Marshall, director of election and government mail services, highlighted </span><a href="https://www.parcelandpostaltechnologyinternational.com/news/mail/usps-readies-640000-postal-workers-for-election-mail-deliveries.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USPS’s efforts to provide ongoing communications to election officials across the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and expanded on her team’s continuous efforts to prepare for elections. “Since late last year, the Postal Service has met regularly with stakeholders across the election mail landscape, including state and local election administrators, postal unions and management associations, federal agencies and congress, the mailing industry and non-governmental organizations,” she explained. “We have good working relationships with these organizations, and we greatly appreciate their partnership. “Our dedicated election preparedness team will remain closely engaged with state and local election officials and other stakeholders through November to ensure we are acting quickly to address any election mail-related issue that may arise in the delivery of a ballot to and from a voter.”</span></p>

According to a report the EAC released in partnership with Rutgers University, the gap in voter turnout of people with disabilities compared to voters without disabilities has shrunk from 16.8% in 2000 to 11.3% in 2020. In support of further closing this gap ahead of this November, the EAC has released accessibility research, highlighted best practices, and created a video training series for election officials over the past year. During the meeting, the EAC voted to adopt a recommendation that allows election offices to fully allocate the cost of allowable, reasonable, and necessary for the implementation of Federal requirements, including accessibility requirements to Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funds. With this new policy, election offices may now fully apply HAVA funds to upgrades that previously may have been cost prohibitive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Ben Hovland, Vice Chairman Donald Palmer, Commissioner Thomas Hicks, and Commissioner Christy McCormick issued the following joint statement on the new policy: “The EAC is committed to helping all eligible voters, including the more than 40.2 million Americans with disabilities, cast their vote privately and independently. This new funding policy is an important step forward to implementing the EAC’s best practices and training resources in both current and future HAVA Security Grant Funding. However, through our frequent visits with state and local election officials nationwide, we realize this is not enough. It is imperative for election offices to secure more and consistent accessibility funding to fully support a better voting experience for all.” The four EAC Commissioners unanimously approved the recommendation that the Commission consider the cost to implement Federal requirements pertaining to the administration of elections as direct costs when the costs are determined to be reasonable and necessary.

Bennett passed away in April 2018 at the age of 81. “What is more important than a Board of Elections?” said County Executive Kevin Byrne at the ribbon cutting for the redone space. “The facelift on our building includes more than signage but new landscaping, new equipment, a new roof as well as security upgrades including cameras.” Byrne thanked county employees for their dedicated work ensuring a “Presidential election that will be secure in Putnam County.” Elections Commissioners Kelly Primavera and Cathy Croft both praised the county’s work force indicating the “renovations and upgrades had to be done. The facility was rusted and rotted.” Also addressing the gathering was former Board of Elections Commissioner Anthony Scannapieco who recalled Bennett, “Bob and I got along like brothers. I loved the man and miss him daily.” The impetus behind the renaming came from Scannapieco, who worked side-by-side with Bennett for more than two decades. Scannapieco discussed the name change with former County Executive Mary Ellen Odell who was in favor of the renaming. “Bob served the voters of our county for nearly four decades as the Democratic commissioner. I worked with Bob for 23 of those years and he was always the consummate gentleman. It was sheer pleasure to work with him. Our Board of Elections was known throughout the state for being homogenous. Our current Democratic Commissioner Croft agreed that the county should name our building the Robert J. Bennett Board of Elections.” Bennett was the longest tenured elections commissioner in New York State history.</span></p>

Chad Vader has filmed other parody public service announcements on topics like how to vote absentee and new voter ID requirements. On August 29, crews started filming a new Chad Vader video, in partnership with the Dane County Clerk’s Office. It will highlight the security measures in place for the upcoming elections. “We are trying to tackle some of the common disinformation or misinformation that’s out there in a humorous way, and hopefully that will cut through some of the noise, make an impression on people and hopefully help with the confidence in our elections this fall,” said Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell. The creators of Chad Vader said they are firm believers that getting information to people in a unique way tends to make it stick, and that is where the humor in their videos comes into play. “We think that every voter deserves to not only vote, but know how their votes are counted, what the process is like, and if we can help do that in an entertaining way then we are all for it,” said Matt Sloan.</span></p>

Following public voting, </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/secretary-of-state-announces-winners-of-michigans-first-i-voted-sticker-design-contest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced the nine (9!!!) winners of the state’s inaugural “I Voted” sticker contest. The contest was launched in May with more than 480 designs submitted. Then, members of the Michigan Collegiate Student Advisory Task Force narrowed it down to 25 designs for the public to vote on. With more than 57,700 public votes cast for the winners, nine designs were selected across three categories: elementary/middle school or grades K-8, high school or grades 9-12 and general entry, which was open to submissions from Michiganders of all ages. The stickers will be available for clerks to order and give to voters this fall as the state’s official stickers for the 2024 Presidential Election. ““I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and creativity from the people of our great state. Now, let’s use the same energy in casting a vote this November. I encourage every eligible voter to make a plan now to have your voice heard — vote with an absentee ballot, at an early voting site, or on Election Day — and feel proud to wear a sticker designed by a fellow Michigander,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement.</span></p>

But he has signaled that such a measure would be </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/republicans-eyeing-budget-patch-look-to-tack-on-voter-id-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packaged alongside controversial voter ID legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy rider would mirror a bill — the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE, Act — which cleared the House in July. Texas Representative Chip Roy&#8217;s proposed SAVE Act would require people to present proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Republicans, especially those on Johnson’s right flank, have long pushed for the SAVE Act to become law and have applauded the move to tack it onto proposed budget legislation. With Congress still out of session during the last week of its summer recess, it’s unclear whether Johnson’s plan to couple a spending patch with voter ID legislation has the Republican support necessary to pass the House. But even if the measure clears the GOP-controlled lower chamber, it’s likely dead on arrival in the Senate.</span></p>

The bill, which passed 57-16, now moves to the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom. It was passed by the state Senate in May. The bill is directly at odds with Huntington Beach’s Measure A, which states the city could implement voter ID requirements beginning with the 2026 election. State Atty. General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber subsequently sued the city, after Measure A passed in March, stating that it conflicted with — and was preempted by — state law. In a statement, state Sen. David Min (D-Irvine) said SB 1174, which he authored, makes it clear that election integrity and voter identification requirements are exclusively up to the state. “We cannot have 100 different charter cities making up 100 different sets of voting rules, based on fringe conspiracy theories,” Min said. “I have repeatedly told the Huntington Beach City Council members pushing this issue that if they were to produce any evidence of widespread voter fraud, I would lead efforts to change California’s voter eligibility rules. They have not produced any such evidence. I am grateful to my colleagues for their overwhelming support for this bill, and I am hopeful that the governor will sign SB 1174 into law later this year.”</span></p>

I310 would </span><a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/08/29/colorado-to-vote-on-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally change both primary and general elections in Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for most state and federal races. It would create “all-candidate” primaries and switch many general elections to ranked-choice voting. State officials confirmed last week  that backers submitted enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. Initiative 310 would eliminate partisan primaries. Instead, all qualifying candidates would be listed on a single ballot for all voters. The four candidates who get the most votes in the all-candidate primary would then move on to the general election. The proposed new system would implement ranked-choice voting for the general election in November. It implements a specific model known as instant runoff voting. Instead of choosing a single candidate, voters could rank some or all of the four candidates based on their preference. All those rankings would then be processed together to determine a winner. The measure would apply to elections for the state House and Senate, state offices such as governor, and all Congressional elections. It would not apply to local or presidential elections. Leaders of both the major political parties warn Initiative 310 could have major consequences for Colorado’s politics. Some local election officials have warned I310 is pushing the state too far and too fast toward changes that could potentially confuse voters and may not be needed.  Among other concerns, they warn that the complexity of the ranked-choice voting process could undercut confidence in elections. In the new system, the vote tabulation would happen across several rounds. One by one, the least popular candidate would be eliminated; if your first choice gets knocked out, your vote would then flow to your next ranked choice, and so on. “It seems like when you get to a certain place, financially … you can just snap your fingers and think it gets done that easily,” said Matt Crane, a former Republican county clerk and the executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, in an earlier interview. “And that&#8217;s certainly not the case” with election system changes, he added.</span></p>

Although petitioners received sufficient signatures and turned those into the city office on time, Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum said the Ypsilanti clerk missed the Aug. 13 deadline to file with the county and petitioners didn’t take the matter to court in time. City Clerk Tracy Boudreau said the state law is unclear and she thought the deadline to be Aug. 15. She added that the state also allows clerks 45 days to check the signatures. Kestenbaum agreed that parts of the state election statute are in conflict with one another but that the deadline fell on Aug. 13. Boudreau said the county wouldn’t put the initiatives on the November ballot without a certified City Council resolution. However, the city disagreed, saying City Council did not need to do so. Regardless, petitioners could have immediately stormed into court, Kestenbaum said. A Washtenaw County Circuit judge could have waived those deadlines and pushed through the proposals since there were sufficient signatures. Now, he said, it’s too late. “They were sleeping on their rights,” Kestenbaum said.</span></p>

Using his own powers, he put more steps in place for voters to use drop boxes ahead of the November election. Nearly four million Ohioans voted last November, with 1 in 4 people voting absentee, according to state data. LaRose issued a directive Friday that requires someone delivering an absentee ballot for another person to sign an attestation that they are complying with state law — which means they must go into the board of elections to sign the form. “As a practical matter, this means that only a voter’s personal ballot may be returned via drop box,” LaRose ordered. The secretary also sent a letter to legislative leaders asking them to either drastically cut down who can submit an absentee ballot to a drop box or eliminate the use of drop boxes entirely. In his letter, LaRose explained his worry is about ballot harvesting — someone collecting a bunch of other people’s ballots and submitting them. But right now, there is a defined list of who can submit absentee ballots. In 2023, Ohio House Bill 458 changed state law so the only people allowed to deliver a sealed absentee ballot besides the voter are members of the postal service or specific relatives. This includes a spouse, a parent, grandparent, child, sibling, aunt or uncle, niece or nephew. It excludes caregivers, employees of a care facility, grandchildren, cousins, neighbors, friends and anyone else unrelated. If anyone not listed returns the ballot, that would be a fourth-degree felony. If a voter receives a felony conviction for helping their loved one, they would no longer be able to vote themselves. He also proposed two other ideas in his letter. He asked for lawmakers to adopt a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration and for changes on the ability to cast a provisional ballot.Ohio Capital Journal  reached out to both House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, and Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, for comment about the proposal they received from LaRose. “It’s an important issue we need to consider to ensure our elections are secure,” Stephens said. Huffman’s spokesperson John Fortney also said the Senate would consider it. Gov. Mike DeWine</span><a href="https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2024-09-03/dewine-ohio-lawmakers-should-revisit-foreign-contributions-ban-but-not-other-voting-law-changes"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not support additional legislation at this time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think anyone who wants to change what we do has a burden of proof of showing that there&#8217;s a there&#8217;s a problem with what we do now. There has to be some end to changing rules. We&#8217;ve done it. But we do a good job,&#8221; DeWine said. &#8220;We count our votes pretty quickly. We do it in an accurate way. And I&#8217;m satisfied with our system.&#8221;</span></p>

It would allow all legal South Burlington residents to participate in local elections. That would include Town Meeting Day and any other city, school, or bond votes. While the vote wasn&#8217;t unanimous, most of the city councilors felt the committee should be allowed to look at the recommendation. &#8220;All legal residents of the city being able to participate in elections is something the charter committee should consider,&#8221; said South Burlington City Councilor Andrew Chalnick. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why we should delay considering we&#8217;re not making a decision. We&#8217;re asking for the recommendation. They seem to be willing to look at it. I think they should.&#8221; The charter committee will have to bring a recommendation back forward to the city council on Nov. 4. If non-citizen voting eventually gets approved, South Burlington would become the fourth city in Vermont to allow it. Burlington, Winooski and Montpelier are the others. The measure was approved 4 to 1. </span></p>

On August 3, City Council voted 4-1 on an ordinance to use ranked-choice voting in its own June 2025 primary election. Councilor Lloyd Snook was the only vote against it. “What this has been framed as is an experiment,” Councilor Brian Pinkston said at Tuesday night’s meeting. “Maybe we come through this and we said this was terrible and we decided not to do it, or maybe we say it’s great.” “This system opens up our elections, giving every eligible voter the freedom to truly express their preferences without fears of wasting their vote,” Nick Co, a Charlottesville resident, said. “It’s non-partisan,” Cindy Cartwright, a Charlottesville resident, followed up with. In 2020, former delegate Sally Hudson cosponsored a bill allowing ranked-choice voting to be used in local elections. Now, four years later, she said she is immensely proud of her own locality for taking this step. Using a new voting method is not free. The city will have to spend money on an educational program to teach people how it works and new voting equipment. All of that is estimated to cost around $26,000.</span></p>

Brooks temporarily </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2024/08/29/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-wet-signature-rule-for-arkansas-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked the implementation of a new rule barring the use of electronic signatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Arkansas voter registration forms except at certain state agencies.  State lawmakers in May approved an emergency rule drafted by the Arkansas Board of Election Commissioners that requires a “wet signature,” meaning signing with a pen, on voter registration applications unless they’re completed at state agencies, like the DMV. In June, voter advocacy group Get Loud Arkansas challenged the rule with a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against Secretary of State John Thurston, the Arkansas State Board of Election Commissioners and the county clerks of Benton, Pulaski and Washington counties. Brooks said he issued a preliminary injunction Thursday because requiring that voter registration applications be signed with a “wet signature” likely violates the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and will cause plaintiffs irreparable harm.  The Materiality Provision prohibits any “person acting under color of law” from denying someone the right to vote in an election because of an error or omission on a record or paper related to an application or registration requisite to voting.  Brooks said the omission of a “wet signature” is not material to determining whether a person is qualified to vote under Arkansas law, which requires a voter to be a U.S. citizen, an Arkansas resident and at least 18 years old, among other things.</span></p>

Oltmann is named as a non-party in a defamation suit by Eric Coomer, the former director of product security and strategy for Dominion Voting Systems. He is also facing a defamation and conspiracy lawsuit from Coomer for claims Oltmann made back in 2020. In November 2020, Oltmann claimed to have heard an &#8220;Antifa conference call&#8221; where an employee of Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems suggested the election was rigged in favor of Joe Biden.  “I think this is a conspiracy to commit fraud against the American people,” Oltmann told KNUS host Peter Boyles on Nov. 18. “This is a massive, massive, massive putting your finger on the scales of the election.”  Oltmann hasn&#8217;t provided evidence to back up the accusation, despite being subpoenaed in Denver District Court. On September 4, the judge in the case ordered that Oltmann has to pay the attorney’s fees and costs Coomer incurred as a result of Oltmann&#8217;s noncompliance with the judge&#8217;s orders to present evidence.  Oltmann also has to pay Coomer $1,000 a day from Wednesday until he complies with the orders &#8220;fully and in good faith.&#8221; This is an increase from a prior suggested fine of $300 a day, which the court decided &#8220;will not likely get Oltmann’s full and complete attention.&#8221;</span></p>

The</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2024-08-30-Opinion.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the federal three-judge panel effectively bars former Hawaii residents who currently reside in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands or American Samoa from voting absentee in the 2024 presidential election. The decision was authored by Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr. and caps a nearly-four-year-long case that centered on the question of why former Hawaii or U.S. residents who moved abroad can vote absentee, but former residents who live in certain U.S. territories can’t.  In October of 2020, a group of former Hawaii residents who live in Guam and the Virgin Islands challenged a provision of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), and requirements under the Hawaii Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act (UMOVA) that don’t allow them to vote absentee in federal elections. Former Hawaii residents can vote absentee if they reside in the Northern Mariana Islands or live abroad, the plaintiffs noted, arguing the laws disenfranchise certain voters who live in territories where such voting is prohibited. The plaintiffs alleged the UOCAVA and UMOVA provisions violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses under the Fifth and 14th Amendments and violated a federal law protecting the rights of those living in U.S. territories by treating “similarly situated former state residents differently based on where they reside overseas.” A lower district court upheld the law in 2022. The 9th Circuit determined that while UOCAVA and UMOVA “discriminate between former residents based upon whether they move overseas or within the United States,” the laws don’t deprive residents in a “geographically defined governmental unit (Hawaii)” from voting in a nationwide election. In his dissent, Judge Richard A. Paez essentially concluded the courts didn’t rely on relevant precedent to properly evaluate the case. He questioned why the court didn’t apply the Anderson-Burdick framework, under which a court weighing an election-law challenge must examine the extent to which a challenged regulation “burdens First and (14th) Amendment rights.”</span></p>

Like in its original complaint to the Idaho Supreme Court, Attorney General Raúl Labrador is asking for an injunction that would prevent the open primaries initiative from making the November ballot. Miller denied the AG’s request for discovery, or more evidence, from Idahoans for Open Primaries, and called the situation “extraordinarily unusual.” However, the judge agreed to hold a hearing for arguments on September 4 on the motion for summary judgement, using his discretion to expedite the hearing. “My initial reaction is that you’ve got a real uphill battle to climb,” the judge told Solicitor General Alan Hurst. The AG is asking that the court grant all the signatures gathered in support of Proposition 1 to be “null and void,” which would either trigger the Secretary of State to remove the initiative from the ballot or force initiative sponsors to withdraw it from the ballot.</span></p>

District Judge Michael Huppert granted a temporary injunction of ballot certification after an expedited hearing. He found there was “a likelihood that the petitioners may prevail on the merits if afforded an opportunity for a full-blown presentation of the evidence and legal authorities.” The Iowa Secretary of State’s office was expected to certify ballots September 3 with candidates’ names for the November general election. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate and Attorney General Brenna Bird, both Republicans, voted to remove the candidates, arguing that the state Libertarian Party had violated Iowa law by holding its precinct caucuses and county conventions on the same day, despite state law stating that delegates selected at caucuses do not officially begin their roles until the following day. Huppert wrote in the decision that among the arguments made by the Libertarians challenging the decision, he found the most “potentially meritorious” challenge to be whether the Republican objectors’ complaint was appropriate, and if their objections were properly brought before the panel in accordance with Iowa Code on the subject. Ashley Hunt, the communications director for the Iowa Secretary of State’s office said that the office is not certifying any candidates or races Tuesday, and is awaiting further clarification from the courts on the timeline for certification. There is a deadline that requires ballots to be ready by Sept. 21 for overseas and military voters that will likely be part of discussions on how the challenges will proceed. Hunt said that the court’s quick turnaround for responding to the challenge means that the Secretary of State’s office is expecting to have a decision within the time constraints.</span></p>

The board is composed of two Democrats and two Republicans, appointed by the County Board of Commissioners to four-year terms. The county Board of Canvassers is responsible for collecting and certifying the votes cast within the county for local, state and national elections. Board members are also responsible for inspecting the county’s ballot containers every four years and conducting recounts for all units of government in the county. Froman told the Detroit News that he “most definitely” believes the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, and that he would not certify the 2024 presidential election “if it unfolded the same way the 2020 election did.” “And that’s why I’m there,” Froman told the Detroit News. The ACLU contacted Froman after the story came out, and Froman claimed to not make those statements, but he refused to request a retraction. Having not received a public retraction of the statement from Froman by Aug. 23, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against him in Kalamazoo County Circuit Court on Tuesday, Sept. 3.</span></p>

The St. Clair Shores voters likely hadn’t intended to commit a crime, Lucido said in a news release, and the fact that it was flagged so quickly “demonstrates that election safeguards are effective and maintain overall integrity.” “This situation highlights an opportunity for law enforcement and elections officials to review and train on this and other issues,” Lucido said in a short news release. “Macomb County clerks know the rules and follow them, they are diligent to safeguard our elections and keep the process tight.” Lucido told The Detroit News on that police determined the voters in question believed they had spoiled their absentee ballots before voting in person.</span></p>

The ruling bars the state from refusing to turn over voter data to Voter Reference Foundation, bolstering the group’s efforts to expand a free database of registered voters so that groups and individuals can take it upon themselves to try to find potential irregularities or fraud. Browning ruled that state election regulators engaged in viewpoint-based discrimination and free speech violations in denying the Voter Reference Foundation access to voter data and by referring the matter to state prosecutors. Browning previously ruled that New Mexico authorities violated public disclosure provisions of the National Voter Registration Act by refusing to provide voter rolls to the same foundation, overriding a provision of a state law that restricts the use of voter registration data. State prosecutors plan to appeal the ruling, said Lauren Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Justice. The VoteRef.com website recently restored New Mexico listings to its searchable database of registered voters — including street addresses, party affiliations and whether voters participated in recent elections. </span></p>

The appeal to the state Supreme Court was expected. It is being fast-tracked, like all elections cases this year. The appeal, filed September 3, challenges the findings of a 91-page opinion issued by a Commonwealth Court panel that found it </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2024/08/30/undated-mail-ballots-case-commonwealth-court-ruling-aclu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconstitutional under state law to refuse to count those ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The Commonwealth Court majority’s decision is unprecedented, rests on multiple reversible errors and threatens to unleash chaos, uncertainty and an erosion of public confidence in the imminent 2024 general election in which millions of Pennsylvanians will vote for president, U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative and scores of state and local offices,” the Republican Party brief opens. The filing accuses the appellate court of departing from precedent and ignoring defects in the underlying suit challenging the issue in the first place. “[I]n order to function properly, elections must have rules, including ballot-casting rules. The judiciary may not disregard those rules, rewrite them, or declare them unconstitutional simply because a voter failed to follow them and, accordingly, had his or her ballot rejected,” the Republican Party wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rural county that state courts said went rogue in permitting outside inspectors to examine voting machines as part of efforts to help former President Donald J. Trump’s election fraud claims has now been o</span><a href="https://www.pennlive.com/elections/2024/09/pa-county-attorney-ordered-to-pay-more-than-1-million-in-election-case.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rdered to pay the state and the machines’ owners more than $1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in related legal costs and attorneys’ fees. That’s the result of an accounting requested by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court after the majority Republican commissioners in Fulton, who initially allowed the examination, were held in contempt for “dilatory, obdurate and vexatious conduct” last year. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer was asked to tabulate costs and fees spent by the Pennsylvania Department of State and Dominion Voting Systems — which the county had leased the machines from — to protect the machines from further interference since December 2021. Jubelirer’s report — which still needs final adoption by the Supreme Court — calls for an award of $1.036 million, breaking down as follows: $711,252 to the Pennsylvania Department of State; and $324,673 to Dominion. Much of the penalty, if it stands, will be covered by tax dollars. Fulton County Commissioner Hervey Hann, a registered independent elected to the three-member board in November 2023, said the county intends to appeal Jubelirer’s order, and in the interim will see if it can reach a negotiated settlement for a reduced number.</span></p>

In his letter and lawsuit seeking an emergency order to halt the program, Paxton claims commissioners are without authority to mail unsolicited voter registration applications, which he says “will create confusion, facilitate fraud (and) undermine confidence in elections.” Commissioners who voted in favor of the voter registration push were undeterred, calling Paxton’s threats “false rhetoric,” and a misinterpretation of the election code. At one point during the lively three-hour meeting, Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai asked security to “ramp it up” and threatened to clear the meeting room.</span></p>
