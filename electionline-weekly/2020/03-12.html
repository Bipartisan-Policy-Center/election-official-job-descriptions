							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Day Command Centers: A National Snapshot</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Tammy Patrick, Democracy Fund Senior Advisor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5262" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CommandCenter-copy-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CommandCenter-copy-300x198.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CommandCenter-copy-768x506.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CommandCenter-copy.jpg 1010w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Calls in queue, busy signals, or, worse yet, the phones not ringing—Election Day hotlines and command centers serve as the nexus of all election administrative communication and logistics. In my decade as a local election official, I worked with colleagues to create a way of capturing real-time information from numerous sources, take action on what could be done to remedy situations, and document the resolution for post-election analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election offices take a variety of paths to improve their ability to keep tabs on polling locations and field efforts including homegrown reporting systems, existing government networks, commercial-off-the-shelf programs, and vendor solutions are some of the most common methods. While at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Senior Policy Analyst Michael Thorning and I spent quite a bit of time in the field interviewing election officials to identify strategies and issue a</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BPC-Election-Day-Command-Centers.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preliminary report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; this week the full white paper – <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/election-day-command-centers-a-national-snapshot/">Election Day Command Centers: A National Snapshot</a> – is being released with the hopes that there will be ideas in it that officials can leverage to improve their own data collection and responsiveness in this crucial election year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the primary season unfolds, election officials should contemplate how their own system operates and if it can withstand the pressures through November. Outlined below are my top five recommendations:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Expand Communications</strong><br />
</span>Expanding the number of ways workers can communicate increases productivity as it decreases time spent waiting on hold or being greeted by a busy signal. This could include providing more than a single phone number for use by voters and pollworkers, or allowing workers in the field to communicate via text messages and emails on Election Day.  Richland County, South Carolina, and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina are two examples of jurisdictions using practices like these. As a result, a simple text that includes the preset or predetermined polling location description – such as the precinct name or number – and “open” or “issue” can provide notice to the command center. Additional information such as “issue—long line” or “issue—equipment” help inform the appropriate actions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2. Triage and Prioritize Incoming Issues</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing different hotlines for the various reasons for calls coming in is another common practice. For example, jurisdictions like the City of Chicago have a designated line for language assistance, ensuring voters get their language of choice first. When establishing hotlines it is important to prioritize reports that are action items, particularly those that most impact voters, and provide notification to the individuals who are responsible for, and able to, take that action. One key element to keeping the critical elements in focus is to allow for the closure of issues that are resolved and can then be archived for post-election review.   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3. Create Troubleshooting Guide for Common Challenges</strong><br />
</span>Providing pollworkers and field rovers with troubleshooting guides, and walking through the use of those guides in training, can lower the number of calls coming in when the battery on the machine runs low because it was not ever plugged in, for example. Highlighting the most prevalent issues before they happen is your best defense.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>4. Test Your System to Gage Capacity</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate, and have seen, extreme enthusiasm resulting in increased turnout this year. We have experienced many changes in how elections are conducted with expansions in early voting, removal of need for excuses to vote by mail, and millions more voters on the rolls because of automatic voter registration. Yes, there is an increase in first-time voters, but even experienced voters and pollworkers may deal with new systems or processes this year. Call volumes increase from workers when they use new systems and protocols, and perform new tasks. Command centers need to adapt to accommodate as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5. Establish Mass Messaging Protocol</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring there is a strong messaging protocol in place is crucial—checking the messaging functions of electronic pollbooks, compiling a list of cell phone numbers, or providing phone and tablets for pollworkers and field rovers can provide much needed clarity in the field. Election officials make checklists, have contingency plans, and go through tabletop exercises to contemplate various injects of catastrophic proportions. Still, things happen that are missed or unforeseen. This could include sending a message to all polling locations that the provisional forms were packed in the blue bin instead of the red bin in error, sending a notice on how to handle a withdrawn candidate or that the courts have required the polls remain open an hour later—thus preventing separate phone calls from every polling place, and ensuring voters get uniform information in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I often say that every election has a story to tell, and we often don’t know that what story is until long after the last ballot is cast and counted. A robust command center operation serves to not only capture the data to tell the story accurately, but, when fully functioning can improve the American voting experience by remedying issues that arise in a timely manner. The good news is that there are resources to help. In addition to existing resources like</span><a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/project/defending-digital-democracy"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Defending Digital Democracy Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Battlestaff Bootcamps, a new paper – Election Day Command Centers: A National Snapshot – is available today in the electionline Training and Resources section.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weeks and days leading up to Michigan’s primary clerks and the secretary of state tried to temper expectations about when the results would be ready given that the state was offering no-excuse absentee voting and same day registration for the very first time in a presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About one million voters requested</span><a href="https://www.record-eagle.com/news/local_news/clerks-vote-counting-goes-smoothly/article_e9fdaa58-6320-11ea-9b85-4300de49b0cd.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even though results weren’t complete Tuesday night, 100 percent of precincts were reporting by</span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/11/michigan-election-day-absentee-ballots/5025741002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest story out of Michigan on primary day was that lines formed in places for those wishing to register and vote on that day. According to <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>,</span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/11/michigan-election-day-absentee-ballots/5025741002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13,503 people registered to vote at clerks’ offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the state. More than 6,000 of those people got in line after 4:30 p.m., said Jake Rollow, spokesman for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. About two-thirds of the people registering to vote on Election Day were between the ages of 18 and 29. In</span><a href="https://wwmt.com/news/local/kalamazoo-clerks-office-wasnt-expecting-hundreds-to-register-to-vote-on-election-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kalamazoo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> City Clerk Scott Borling said he was not expecting that many people to register that day. &#8220;We really didn&#8217;t know what to expect,&#8221; he told WWMT. &#8220;We thought maybe just a few people coming in who forgot. We were not aware of the volume of people we would be getting.&#8221; About 300 people registered in Kalamazoo on Tuesday. In</span><a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2020/03/11/east-lansing-releases-numbers-michigan-primary-after-long-waits/5020301002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> East Lansing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was more than 700 people who registered on election day.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While absentee voting and same-day registration were the big stories, primary day in Michigan, like it is everywhere, was also filled with odds and ends from the polls. In</span><a href="https://www.wnem.com/news/woman-arrested-at-genesee-county-voting-precinct/article_e3456da4-631b-11ea-a70a-930c11d48353.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Genesee County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a woman was arrested for circulating petitions inside a polling place. A polling place in</span><a href="https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/presque-isle-voters-held-up-after-polling-place-runs-out-of-ballots"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Presque Isle County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ran out of Democrat ballots around 4 p.m. and voters had to wait about 40 minutes for more ballots. Some voters in</span><a href="https://www.thetimesherald.com/story/news/2020/03/10/port-huron-township-hears-complaints-closed-polling-station/5015846002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Port Huron Twp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ran into problems when they went to their regular polling place only to discover that it had been consolidated into a new location. In</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/10/michigan-residents-vote-tent-after-polling-place-lockout/5016158002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lansing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about 12 voters cast their early morning ballots outside after poll workers setting up the polling place got locked out. And in</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2020/03/woman-crashes-car-into-polling-station-plans-to-return-to-vote.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coloma Twp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. a woman on her way to vote around mid-day accidentally crashed her car into the polling place. No one was hurt, voting was halted for about an hour and the driver said she would be back to vote after speaking to her insurance company.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary day in the Magnolia State was relatively quiet although the state did see a bump in</span><a href="https://yallpolitics.com/2020/03/10/more-than-20000-absentee-ballots-requested-for-2020-primary-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.wcbi.com/choctaw-county-residents-utilize-new-electronic-voting-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choctaw County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out a new voting system that was well-received by voters and poll workers. “Poll workers love them. They’re much easier to manage. They’re, as you saw, they’re in cases that are like little briefcases that just open up. Everything is there. It’s quick and easy,” district 5 election commissioner Wayne McLeod told WCBI. The convenience was key, but voters also appreciated that the process was much more private.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Show Me State saw two of the strangest stories from Big Tuesday.

No one was hurt, but voting was interrupted for several hours while the equipment was moved to another location. Electionline has anecdotally tracked the phenomena of cars crashing into polling places for a long time, but we’re pretty sure this is the first instance we can recall of it being done purposefully.

It turns out a poll worker had inadvertently reversed Lucas’ name when typing him into the e-poll book.

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While New Hampshire’s much ballyhooed first-in-the-nation primary was held a few weeks, voters in the Granite State went back to the polls this week for Town Meeting Day. The big news out of Town Meeting Day, and something all future primary states should keep in mind, is that the</span><a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/town_meeting/nh-voting-machines-jam-up-from-hand-sanitizer-wipe-moisture/article_4e0aa1fe-8584-5dc5-b4a1-1c12f006f9c0.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hand sanitizer and wipes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people were using to clean their hands was causing problems with feeding ballots into the ballot scanners. “Who would think that being health-conscious would gum up the works?” Atkinson Town Clerk Julianna Hale told the Union Leader.</span></p>

The county had previously said that it would conduct the upcoming election by paper ballot citing privacy concerns. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the board conceded that the Athens-Clarke officials raised some legitimate concerns about ballot secrecy, but that those concerns were not enough to reject the new system. “There are reasonable concerns about ballot secrecy in some limited number of precincts,” said David Worley, a member of the State Election Board. “The reasonable way to deal with that is not to make a wholesale change.”</span></p>

Since then, Allan Vietmeier has been serving as the interim auditor, but he has not plans to run for the position full time and the county has no record of anyone circulating petitions to run for auditor. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if somebody is out there circulating petitions, but we haven&#8217;t heard anything in our office,&#8221; County Elections Manager Erika White told the paper. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very important role. So we need somebody who will want to do the job and cares about Burleigh County.” There is the possibility of course for a write-in candidate if no one appears on the ballot but state elections officials say they are unaware of anyone every winning a countywide write-in vote. </span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) has introduced legislation that would provide</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/10/mail-voting-coronavirus-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $500 million in federal funding to help states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to conduct elections by mail in during to coronavirus pandemic. Wyden’s bill would give all Americans the right to vote by mail if 25 percent of states declared an emergency related to the coronavirus outbreak. The bill also would require state and local officials to prepare for possible coronavirus disruptions and to offer prepaid envelopes with self-sealing flaps to minimize the risk of contagion from voters’ licking envelopes. The bill would prohibit states from using the $500 million to implement mobile or other Internet-based voting technologies, though voters could still request their ballots through online means.</span></p>

The measure would make three main changes: It would eliminate party-run primary elections. The top four vote-getters in the late summer state primary would advance to the November general election, regardless of party. It would install ranked-choice voting in the general election. Voters would be asked to rank their top choices in the November election. Votes would be tallied, and if a candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, he or she would be named the winner. If no candidate receives half the vote, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Any ballots cast for that candidate would go to the voters’ second choices. The process repeats until a candidate has at least half the vote or until there is only one candidate left.  It would require disclosure for “dark money” political contributions. Groups donating to candidates or causes would be forced to say where they got their money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> The House has approved a bill to remember a 1920 event in which white Floridians killed and destroyed the property of black residents who organized a voter registration event.

Jason Nemes has introduced</span><a href="https://forwardky.com/adams-nemes-introduce-bill-to-expand-voting-lower-election-costs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 596</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which: Extends polling hours from 6 PM to 7 PM local time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extends the voter registration deadline so prospective voters have more time to register before an election; Makes voting by mail easier by permitting the choice of absentee voting in person or by mail; Permits additional reasons for early voting: employment as “essential service personnel” such as first responders; bereavement; serious injury or illness of a family member; Permits counties to establish “vote centers,” where any voter registered in a particular county may vote, rather than having to vote at his/her precinct. This benefits voters who may work on one side of the county and have a long commute home to the other side of the county; Allows counties who don’t adopt vote centers to more easily consolidate multi-precinct voting at one location; Allows voters more time to change party affiliation prior to a primary election so they can vote in their preferred party’s primary; Allows registered independents to serve as poll workers, addressing our poll worker crisis; Permits poll workers to sign up for half-day shifts, further addressing our poll worker crisis; Allows children and parents to obtain a medical-emergency absentee ballot, rather than just the voter and the voter’s spouse; and Reduces wait time for early voting by allowing a county clerk to place early-voting machines in any of the clerk’s office locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Louisiana</strong>: Rep. Mandie Landry of New Orleans has introduced a bill that would allow every Louisiana resident to</span><a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/louisiana/proposed-louisiana-legislation-addresses-redistricting-voting-by-mail-and-purging/article_4f946a98-631a-11ea-a459-2740838263bc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and require the state to provide pre-paid postage on absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Louisiana, Rep. Matthew Willard (D-New Orleans) has introduced legislation that would change</span><a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/louisiana/proposed-louisiana-legislation-addresses-redistricting-voting-by-mail-and-purging/article_4f946a98-631a-11ea-a459-2740838263bc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the state’s voter list is maintained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under Willard’s bill, residents would be removed from the rolls if they are inactive for four regularly scheduled federal general elections, rather than two such elections as under the current rules. Voters on the inactive list would not see their registrations cancelled within 120 days before an election in their jurisdiction.  </span></p>

The measure also would move the state to an open primary election system, where all candidates are listed on a single ballot.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington</strong>: House Bill 1251 has been approved by the senate. The bill requires the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the chief information officer to consult with county auditors to identify instances of</span><a href="https://washingtonstatewire.com/tarletons-election-security-bill-passes-both-chambers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> security breaches in elections systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and data and determine whether the source of any breaches are foreign or domestic entities.

This is the second attempt in as many years to limit voters to voting for their own party. HB209 (</span><a href="https://buckrail.com/bill-to-block-crossover-voting-fails-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change in Party Affiliation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) passed easily through committee 8-1 and at third reading of the House floor 44-14 on February 28. It failed to advance out of the Senate Corporations Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Wyoming, the Senate has approved a bill that would allow county clerks to accept</span><a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/senate-passes-bill-allow-tribal-ids-voter-registration#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tribal IDs as official identification for voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the ID includes the applicant’s driver’s license number or last four digits of their social security. The bill was approved unanimously and without debate. Both the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone Business Councils expressed support for the bill before it was introduced. However, some tribal leaders would prefer that the legislation go further. Eastern Shoshone Business Councilwoman Karen Snyder told Wyoming Public Radio that the default format for Eastern Shoshone Tribal IDs does not include a driver&#8217;s license number or last four digits of social security. &#8220;There were some opinions that felt like the bill, initially, was a slap in the face to tribal sovereignty,&#8221; Snyder said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be as aggressive as to say that. I&#8217;m going to say it&#8217;s a provisional win for us.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana</strong>: The U.S. attorney’s office has announced that will be</span><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2020/03/05/feds-inspect-indiana-polling-places-ada-compliance/4967802002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examining polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Southern District of Indiana to determine if the sites are compliant with the American with Disabilities Act. According to the <em>Indianapolis Star</em>, the Southern District encompasses 60 counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio</strong>: The groups seeking to put a ballot measure before voters are appealing a decision by the Ohio Ballot Board to split the</span><a href="https://www.wvxu.org/post/voter-rights-group-files-appeal-keep-measure-one-ballot-issue#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secure and Fair Elections Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into four separate ballot questions. The Amendment would, among other things, require 28 days of early voting, automatic voter registration and same day registration. According to WVXU, the Ohio Ballot Board said this measure did not follow the single-issue requirement and split the initiative four ways. Each petition would need 442,958 signatures. The petitioners are appealing to the state’s Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina:</strong> State Appeals Court Judge Chris Brook has</span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/article241050731.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recused himself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from participation in the voter ID case because of his previous work as an American Civil Liberties Union attorney fighting against a 2013 voter ID law in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The Texas Democratic Party, joined by national Democratic groups has sued the state elections officials in an attempt to stop a new ban on</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/05/us/ap-us-texas-voting-lawsuit.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> straight-ticket voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, The lawsuit was filed in federal court along the Texas border in Laredo, and points to long lines snaking out of polling places in Houston during this week&#8217;s election, when some voters waited more than an hour in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Texas, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s attorney general is able to prosecute a defendant indicted for</span><a href="https://smcorridornews.com/seventh-court-of-appeals-allows-texas-ag-to-prosecute-mail-ballot-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The trial court previously quashed part of the indictments, blocking the state from alleging and proving that the defendant committed multiple fraudulent acts during a single election. The court also lowered two election-fraud charges from felonies to misdemeanors. In its opinion, the Seventh Court of Appeals ruled that the trial court erred in quashing the allegations. It reversed the trial court’s order and remanded the cases for trial. Under Texas election laws, the State has a duty to prosecute each election violation, including repeated violations by the same offender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State District Judge Emily Tobowlowsky has approved a request from Dallas County to</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/10/judge-allows-dallas-county-recount-move-forward-include-missing-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> redo the tally of votes cast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the March 3 primary after it discovered that an unknown number of ballots from 44 tabulating machines were missed in the initial count. It is unclear how many ballots were missing, and if the missing ballots might affect the outcome of any races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty has filed a petition with the state’s Supreme Court to review the case over whether or not more than 200,000 people should be immediately removed from the</span><a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/wisconsin/wisconsin-group-wants-state-supreme-court-to-review-elections-lawsuit/article_9900bc82-6391-11ea-9600-ab7627f8230b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The petition is asking the court to review the case before the November election, but not the upcoming April primary.

The most recent issues found that around 1,000 people who had applied for new licenses should have been registered to vote but that they system opted them out. According to the Herald &amp; Review, the affected individuals have been registered and can vote in Tuesday&#8217;s primary, according to election officials. Rep. Tim Butler (R-Springfield) has filed legislation seeking an independent audit of the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nebraska:</strong> During in the May 12 primary election, several busy precincts in Lincoln County will have</span><a href="https://journalstar.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-hall-pilot-program-to-test-cellphone-counters-at-lincoln/article_4b3f3281-a7c2-5dd2-8813-20a29963ef32.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sensors that can detect the number of cell phones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the precinct. Election Commissioner Dave Shively said that information will then used to help the county determine what additional resources may be needed at the polling sites. &#8220;It’s just basically counting numbers,&#8221; Shively told the <em>Lincoln Journal-Star</em>. The technology comes from Election Tek LLC. The pilot would begin April 13 at the Lancaster County Election Commission Office, when early voting begins, and then two sites would be tested on primary election day, Shively said. By using the sensors, the county elections office will know in real-time if a site needs more resources instead of relying on call from a poll worker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington:</strong> According to data gathered from King County, turnout for King Conservation District’s Board of Supervisors, which was conducted by the county elections department using a</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/486161-turnout-almost-doubles-in-seattle-area-election-after-mobile-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile voting system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly doubled from the last election. According to <em>The Hill</em>, An analysis of the votes conducted by the National Cybersecurity Center indicated that 94 percent of voters in 2020 elected to use the new electronic submission method for their ballots, even when presented with the option of verifying the ballot by printing it out and mailing it. “Best practices and standards can and do exist for mobile voting, just as they do for casting a paper ballot; when vendors and jurisdictions embrace those standards, the voter wins,” Forrest Senti, the National Cybersecurity Center&#8217;s director of business and government initiatives said in a statement.</span></p>
