														<p><strong>CTCL COVID-19 Response Grant Program Update</strong><br />
<em>Program exceeds 2,100 applications</em></p>
<p>By Keegan Hughes, impact &amp; learning manager<br />
Center for Tech and Civic Life</p>
<p>We’ve heard repeatedly about the desperate<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/07/30/were-worried-republican-election-officials-387055"> need for election administration funding</a>. We’ve heard this from countless election officials, from across the political spectrum, geographic boundaries, and jurisdiction sizes. The COVID-19 pandemic brings unprecedented challenges that most election budgets aren’t equipped to handle.</p>
<p>That’s why we recently launched our<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/open-call/"> CTCL COVID-19 Response Grant Program</a>. It provides funding to U.S. local election offices to help ensure they have the critical resources they need to safely serve every voter in 2020. The grant program is an open call to every local election office in the country, and we’re thrilled to announce we’ve received over 2,100 applications (and counting!).</p>
<p>The program has been so well received that we extended the application deadline. All U.S. local election offices that have not previously applied are<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/our-work/election-officials/grants/"> invited to apply by Thursday, October 15th.</a></p>
<p>All local election offices responsible for administering election activities covered by the CTCL COVID-19 Response grant program are eligible to apply for grant funds. Every eligible election department that is verified as legitimate will be approved for a grant. The minimum CTCL COVID-19 Response Grant amount awarded is $5,000.</p>
<p><strong>Which election offices have applied for funds<br />
</strong>The pin-map below speaks to the sheer volume of applications we’ve received, as well as the geographic diversity. While we haven’t hit all 50 states yet, we’re so close.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6138" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL1.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="451" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL1.jpg 936w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL1-768x433.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /></p>
<p>In most states, elections are run at the county level. Texas has 254 counties, and nearly half of them have applied. States like Michigan, on the other hand,<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/I_Structure_of_MI_Elections_System_265982_7.pdf"> administer most election duties at the city and township levels</a>. This explains why Michigan looks more heavily-dotted than Texas, even though less than 30% of election offices in Michigan have applied for grants, compared to ~50% in Texas.</p>
<p>Beyond geographic diversity, we’re seeing a wide range in jurisdiction size. As you can see in the chart below, the vast majority of applications are coming from jurisdictions with less than 25,000 registered voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6139" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL2.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="343" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL2.jpg 936w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL2-300x184.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL2-768x471.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>Funding shortages hit low-budget offices hardest, and rural jurisdictions are often overlooked in the national landscape. That’s why the previous iteration of our grant program — before the $250 million contribution allowed us to scale up nationwide — included grants explicitly for rural jurisdictions. While we encourage every election office, large and small, to apply for these open-call grants, we especially love getting applications from particularly under-resourced election offices.</p>
<p><strong>What local election officials are saying about the grants<br />
</strong>One of the most rewarding parts of the process has been hearing the excitement, energy, and gratitude from election officials after they receive funding. We’d like to share a few of our favorite messages:</p>
<p><em>“The pressure these funds take off the shoulders of the front line people trying to implement the law during this pandemic cannot be overemphasized.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I can’t tell you enough how thrilled I am to receive this grant. We are a small community struggling to find ways to handle unfunded mandates, especially during a pandemic. It means a lot to us to ensure our election process is done in all the right ways.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Election officials have worked tirelessly this cycle&#8230; We love what we do and the public we serve so this is in no way a complaint. Still, to have this cushion at a time when it’s needed is fantastic.”</em></p>
<p><strong>How election offices anticipate spending the funds</strong><br />
Our job is to get funding into the hands of local election officials, then get out of their way. Election officials know what’s best for their communities and know exactly how to address budget shortfalls in this challenging election cycle. We leave spending decisions to the discretion of each grantee jurisdiction, as long as the election activity falls under these 4 broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure Safe, Efficient Election Day Administration</li>
<li>Expand Voter Education &amp; Outreach Efforts</li>
<li>Launch Poll Worker Recruitment, Training &amp; Safety Efforts</li>
<li>Support Early In-Person Voting and Vote by Mail</li>
</ul>
<p>We asked jurisdictions for a preview of how they intend to spend the money, and the following chart summarizes their responses. The most common expenses include personal protective equipment, poll worker recruitment and training, temporary staffing, and mail/absentee equipment and supplies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6140" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL3.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="499" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL3.jpg 936w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL3-272x300.jpg 272w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL3-927x1024.jpg 927w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL3-768x848.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<p>We will continue connecting election offices with the funding they need, and promoting the opportunity to offices who haven’t yet applied. Our goal is to provide funding to every election office that wants it — large and small, in all 50 states.</p>
<p><strong>What other resources are available?</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6141" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL4-235x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL4-235x300.jpg 235w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL4-768x982.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CTCL4.jpg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" />We&#8217;re thrilled to launch a new website,<a href="http://resources.techandciviclife.org"> resources.techandciviclife.org</a>, a collection of free, curated, and practical election resources for safe elections!</p>
<p>Why this website, and why now? We&#8217;ve heard from grantee jurisdictions that there are so many resources, recommendations, and tools available that it can be difficult to quickly locate what you need. Right now, time is the most important resource! That&#8217;s why we curated the most relevant, actionable material on 6 topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public health</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>In-person voting</li>
<li>Poll workers</li>
<li>Mail / absentee voting</li>
<li>Drop boxes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still can&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for, the website also includes a dedicated<a href="https://resources.techandciviclife.org/elections-it-support-desk"> Elections IT Support Desk</a> to field technical questions, large and small.</p>
<p>Election officials make democracy happen. Through our work at the Center for Tech and Civic Life, we are grateful to witness the incredible public service of our country’s election officials year round. This year we’ve seen election offices already move mountains to provide a safe, secure, and inclusive process for voters. CTCL is honored to support their work by providing funding and additional resources.</p>

<em>Bipartisan Policy Center and Cleveland Clinic provide guidance</em></p>

Although voting may look very different in 2020 than in past presidential elections, we can work together to ensure that voters can safely cast their ballots while limiting the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center partnered with the Cleveland Clinic to <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-19-safe-voting-guide.pdf">provide guidance on precautions voters, election officials, and poll workers</a> can take to protect themselves, their loved ones and their community from further spread while exercising the right to vote.</p>
<p>The recommendations for voters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding wearing gloves at the polls</li>
<li>Leveraging early voting or vote by mail options to avoid crowded polling places, congestion and lines on election day</li>
<li>Voting at off-peak times of day</li>
<li>Bringing your own supplies, such as hand sanitizer, an ink pen for paper ballots, or a stylus for touchscreen machines. Verify with an election official before using your own supplies</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations for election officials and poll workers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring cloth face coverings for poll workers</li>
<li>Using engineered controls such as plexiglass partitions at check-in</li>
<li>Minimizing the handoff of personal items like pens and driver’s licenses</li>
<li>Avoiding communal foods for poll workers during breaks</li>
<li>Disinfecting pens, touch screens, folders, headphones between voters</li>
</ul>
<p>Voting in the middle of a pandemic will be unlike anything we’ve experienced in the past century. By understanding your rights and being prepared ahead of time, you can ensure your voice is heard.</p>

<p>The how-to paper draws on best practices across the United States, offering simple steps election officials can take as they prepare for November, followed by case studies of four counties implementing some of these practices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6137" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-300x191.png" alt="" width="300" height="191" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-300x191.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter-768x489.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CarterCenter.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />NVAHI and The Carter Center are hosting an<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_T6_LCfxWQ1yzcthXrkRsXg"> event</a> Thursday, October 8, 2-3pm MT to walk through some of the key recommendations and hear firsthand from election officials in Boulder County, Colorado, Orange County, California and Weber County, Utah on transparency in action.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Top Tips for Transparency</strong></span></p>
<p>1) <strong>Commit to transparent operations.</strong> Recognize that building trust through transparency requires commitment, resources and time.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Create and share content on social media and your website.</strong> Use videos, infographics and clear, simple messages about how to vote and what happens behind the scenes when ballots are printed, processed and counted.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Proactively engage the media.</strong> Issue frequent press releases and invite the media in to view different stages of the process, establishing your office as an accessible, trusted source of information.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Invite people in to see for themselves – this year, virtually</strong>. Host tours of ballot printing and processing facilities for the public and community groups, the media and candidates and campaigns. Broadcast tours on your website, and allow for both remote and physically distanced public observation of Election Day processes.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Be transparent, even when there are issues.</strong> Be accessible to the media and the public, and keep everyone informed.  What happened? Who is impacted? How is your office responding, and when will the issue be resolved?</p>
<p>6) <strong>Facilitate participation of authorized poll watchers and monitors.</strong> Authorized engagement by representatives of competing parties and nonpartisan civic groups increases access to how elections are conducted, and further builds trust.</p>

According to USA Today,<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/06/election-2020-fueled-democrats-early-voting-way-up/3623292001/"> more than 5.6 million people have already voted</a>, far exceeding 2016 numbers at this time.

While there were lines voters seemed pretty darn pleased with getting an actual<a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2020/10/1/21497934/i-voted-stickers-early-polling-election-loop-super-site-trump-biden"> “I Voted” sticker</a>, something Chicago hasn’t handed in several election cycles.<a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/local/vote/record-number-of-absentee-voters-show-up-to-the-polls-in-lexington-county/101-ca018e7f-3dff-4780-88a2-e519de7f6d4e"> Lexington County, South Carolina</a> saw record breaking numbers for the first day of early in-person absentee voting. &#8220;Today&#8217;s been crazy,&#8221; said Mary Brack, director of Registration and Elections for Lexington County. &#8220;This is normally like the last day of absentee voting, but this is the first day.&#8221; Voters in<a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/politics/2020/10/06/early-voting-starts-with-large-crowd-in-toledo/stories/20201006086"> Lucas County, Ohio</a> waited for two hours just to get inside the building where voting was happening. “People need to<a href="https://www.13abc.com/2020/10/06/early-voting-opens-in-lucas-county/"> take the time out and understand</a> that it’s not going to be a five-minute thing,” Lucas County Board of Elections director Lavera Scott said. “We have to follow certain protocols. So there may be a line. And the line may look longer than it is because, as you know, if you pull up somewhere and they have a six-foot line spacing outside, there may actually be only ten people standing outside.” In<a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/election/indiana-counties-set-records-on-1st-day-of-early-voting/"> Indiana</a>, counties set first-day records. “I pretty much always come on Day 1, but it’s never been like this before,” voter Steve Igleski said. “I was in the Army for six years, never seen a line like this.” In Marion County, Russell Hollis, deputy director of the county clerk’s office, said election officials adjusted midday to cut down on two chokepoints inside: the electronic poll books needed to sign in, and the staff required to sign out. The pandemic has slowed down the process. “That did contribute to longer lines because people were spaced further apart,” Hollis said. “We were cleaning voting equipment in between uses.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6136" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DOJ.png" alt="" width="247" height="240" />According to multiple news sources</strong> and first reported by <em>ProPublica</em>, a memo to Justice Department prosecutors said that they could<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/politics/justice-department-election-fraud.html"> investigate suspicions of election fraud</a> before votes are tabulated. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, that reversed a<a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/file/1029066/download"> decades-long policy</a> that largely forbade aggressively conducting such inquiries during campaigns to keep their existence from becoming public and possibly “chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities” or “interjecting the investigation itself as an issue” for voters. The memo creates “an exception to the general non-interference with elections policy” for suspicions of election fraud, particularly misconduct by federal government workers, including postal workers or military employees; both groups transport mail-in ballots. The exception allows investigators to take overt investigative steps, like questioning witnesses, that were<a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/file/1029066/download"> previously off limits</a> in such inquiries until after election results were certified. Justice Department spokesman Matt Lloyd told <em>ProPublica</em> in a statement: “Career prosecutors in the Public Integrity Section of the Department’s Criminal Division routinely send out guidance to the field during election season. This email was<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doj-frees-federal-prosecutors-to-take-steps-that-could-interfere-with-elections-weakening-long-standing-policy"> simply part of that ongoing process</a> of providing routine guidance regarding election-related matters.” He added that “no political appointee had any role in directing, preparing or sending this email.” According to <em>ProPublica</em>, experts who reviewed the revision said they were concerned it could be exploited to help the DOJ bolster president’s campaign. “It’s unusual that they’re carving out this exception,” said<a href="https://civilrights.org/about/our-staff/vanita-gupta/"> Vanita Gupta</a>, the former head of the DOJ Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama. “It may be creating a predicate for the Justice Department to make inflated announcements about mail-in vote fraud and the like in the run-up to the election.”</p>

According to a local paper, the move comes six days after the county elections board voted 4-1 to oust senior deputy director Amy Simpson from the already short-staffed office. Hand-delivered to the Raleigh-based North Carolina State Board of Elections, the letter reads: &#8220;This letter serves as notice of our request for the NC State Board of Elections to take over the operations of the Rockingham County Board of Elections immediately. We ask that the NC State Board of Elections provide oversight and ensure that competent, experienced and qualified people will manage the office and the upcoming election. This is critical in order to provide for a fair and trusted election. We have lost trust in the current board to do so.&#8221; The candidates go on to explain how the move to terminate Simpson leaves an already-skeletal staff crippled less than two weeks before early voting begins on Oct. 15. The local office lost its director Tina Cardwell when she retired in April. With Simpson&#8217;s departure, a single deputy director, hired in June, remains.</p>

The video takes on a county council race in fictional Animal County and explains how ranked choice works with second place candidate Sally Salmon defeating initial first-place vote getter Frieda Tree Frog when no candidate gets 50 plus one. [We were SHOCKED that Olivia Otter got the least amount of votes and was the first candidate out of the race. SHOCKED!] In addition to the video, the Benton Better Ballot website allows visitors to practice voting with an interactive mock voting simulation. Mock voters receive a virtual “sticker” after submitting their online practice ballot. Benton County voters approved “Ranked Choice Voting” during the November 2016 election with the passage of ballot measure 2-100. It applies when at least three candidates run for the office of Benton County Commissioner.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>In a video message, senior national security officers</strong> provided<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-virus-outbreak-donald-trump-politics-elections-b28083c7d0c65aa80d23e23c50c75687"> new assurances about the integrity of the upcoming election</a>. “I’m here to tell you that my confidence in the security of your vote has never been higher,” Chris Krebs, the director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in the video message. “That’s because of an all-of-nation, unprecedented election security effort over the last several years.” According to The Associated Press, The video appeared to be aimed at soothing jangled nerves of voters ahead of an election made unique by an expected surge in mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic. Though Trump was not mentioned during the nine-minute video, the message from the speakers served as a tacit counter to his repeated efforts, including in last week’s presidential debate, to allege widespread fraud in the mail ballot process and to preemptively cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election. In addition to Krebs, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and FBI Director Chris Wray also appeared in the video. “No matter which method you choose, your voice is important,” said Wray. “Rest assured that the security of the election, and safeguarding your vote is, and will continue to be one of our highest priorities.”</p>
<p><strong>The National Council on Election Integrity announced</strong> that it plans to<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/07/921163075/former-public-officials-group-to-spend-20-million-to-highlight-secure-elections"> spend $20 million on a public education campaign</a> to stress the security of the election and that &#8220;all citizens&#8217; votes must be counted, regardless of whom they vote for.&#8221; Part of the $20M includes a $4 million ad buy set to run in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Digital ads will begin running in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Among the former officials behind the effort is the president’s one-time Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats. &#8220;The most urgent task American leaders face is to ensure that the election&#8217;s results are accepted as legitimate,&#8221; Coats, who served in the administration until last year, said in a statement. &#8220;Electoral legitimacy is the essential linchpin of our entire political culture.&#8221;</p>

Previously, they were not permitted to open the envelope until 6 a.m. on Election Day. The new rules would be optional and at the discretion of town clerks working in concert with registrars of voters. The bill did not give local officials the ability to begin tallying absentee votes early. The votes are contained in an inner envelope, which cannot be opened until Election Day.</p>

The commission would be chaired by the Secretary of State and consist of nine other members including the chairs of the legislative committees overseeing such plans now, the Speaker of the House and Senate President plus the heads of the party delegations in each chamber and the governor.

Two bills filed by Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, and three members of the House would allow no-excuse early voting in circuit clerks offices for people who want to avoid going to what are expected to be crowded precincts on Election Day. The three House members jointly filing the legislation were Reps. Jansen Owen, R-Poplarville; Kent McCarty, R-Hattiesburg; and Shanda Yates, D-Jackson. “This year’s election is incredibly important, and likely to be one of the highest turnout elections in the history of the state. With that said, we are also in the midst of an incredibly dangerous health crisis that is the COVID-19 pandemic,” Owen said. “This bill aims to reduce the number of voters at the precincts on Election Day, stymy the potential spread of the coronavirus, and allow voters the option to vote safely, while keeping the integrity of our election secure.”</p>

The bills would require photo identification for voters. Another measure is designed to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting illegally by requiring any application to vote made be through applying for a driver&#8217;s license, and including a Social Security number. They also want to do away with publicly financed campaigns and instead redirect the money to aid elections officials with expenses for personal protective equipment, poll worker wages, pre-paid postage for absentee ballots, and other measures to smooth absentee voting.</p>

Alabama is the only state in the country that requires voters to register on a form mandating they swear “so help me God,” without allowing any option of a secular affirmation, the Madison, Wisconsin-based group said. The foundation is filing on behalf of four Alabama citizens who have encountered and objected to the religious test when trying to register to vote. The defendant is Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill. “The Alabama secretary of state excludes Alabama citizens from being able to vote if they are unable to swear a religious oath,” the lawsuit states. “The secretary of state’s official policy is to hinder the registration of voters who are unable to swear ‘so help me God.’ This policy violates the rights of the plaintiffs and others under the First and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution.”</p>

Crosby gave the parties until late Tuesday to propose how the Division of Elections should communicate the message and said she would later issue an order “specifying how to implement elimination” of the requirement for the Nov. 3 election. She noted the state might appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court. Maria Bahr, a Department of Law spokesperson, said Crosby’s decision “makes it clear that the injunction is not yet in effect &#8211; meaning the requirement for signature witnesses is still in place.” The department, in consultation with the division, “is evaluating the decision and considering possible options,” Bahr said by email. Natalie Landreth, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said what Crosby ordered “and what we have argued is the most practical, common sense way to make sure that everybody can vote in the pandemic. The case is really that simple.”</p>

One provision concerns an &#8220;out of precinct policy&#8221; that does not count provisional ballots cast in person on Election Day outside of the voter&#8217;s designated precinct. Another concerns the &#8220;ballot collection law&#8221; which permits only certain persons — family and household members, caregivers, mail carriers and elections officials — to handle another person&#8217;s completed ballot. The dispute will not be resolved before the election because the argument calendar is already full through December.</p>
<p>Judge, Steven P. Logan issued a ruling on this week that extends the<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/politics/election_headquarters/judge-rules-arizona-must-extend-voter-registration-deadline-to-oct-23/article_0f682060-0787-11eb-9f5a-1b5f47b061e1.html"> voter registration deadline</a> for the November general election to Oct. 23 at 5 p.m. Mi Familia Vota and the Arizona Coalition for Change filed the lawsuit on Sept. 30, claiming the original Oct. 5 voter registration would violate their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The two nonprofits wanted to extend the voter registration to Oct. 27. However, with early ballots going out on Oct. 23, Logan, decided that day would have to be the deadline.  The two plaintiffs argued that because of the coronavirus pandemic, they couldn&#8217;t help register as many voters as they usually would. Also, the lack of internet access made it harder for potential voters to register. Logan noted in the court documents that 31 other states had later voter deadlines than Arizona. The defendant, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, said the Oct. 5 deadline was necessary to enforce the state&#8217;s 29-day residency rule. But Logan said that argument was &#8220;unpersuasive,&#8221; since voters need to have proof of residency at the polls. Hobbs indicated she will not appeal the court order extending voter registration deadline to Oct. 23. An<a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/judge-extends-arizonas-voter-registration-deadline-but-gop-groups-file-appeal/article_987039bd-4c09-5c04-8720-db522e154867.html"> appeal</a> has been filed.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Randall H. Warner has ruled that election officials in Arizona can use<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/05/voting-video-allowed-some-circumstances-arizona-judge-rules/3627215001/"> videoconferencing to help some voters</a> confined to hospitals, nursing homes or living with severe disabilities cast their ballots. Attorney General Mark Brnovich asked the court to strike down plans adopted by the Maricopa County Recorder&#8217;s Office and Arizona Secretary of State&#8217;s Office for limited &#8220;virtual&#8221; voting assistance, arguing that state law does not allow anyone to cast a ballot by video. Gov. Doug Ducey also opposed the policies, contending that state law requires officials provide such services in person. But in a ruling that reflected how unusual this election year is, found that videoconferencing may be necessary for some voters with very particular circumstances who would otherwise have to choose between protecting themselves from COVID-19 or forgoing their right to participate in the electoral process.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would have given Arizona voters five days past Election Day to<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2020/10/06/court-blocks-order-giving-voters-more-time-to-fix-unsigned-mail-ballots/"> fix early ballots</a> that were accidentally filed without a signature. The ruling means current law stands – for now – and any unsigned ballots not corrected by 7 p.m. on Election Day will be discarded. The circuit court Tuesday said that, with less than a month to Election Day, the public interest is best served by keeping current election laws instead of “sending the State scrambling to implement and to administer a new procedure for curing unsigned ballots at the eleventh hour.”</p>

Holmes III has denied a motion to expedite the schedule in a case regarding<a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2020/oct/08/judge-declines-to-speed-up-absentee-vote-case/"> absentee ballots</a> for the Nov. 3 election. Holmes ruled that Secretary of State John Thurston and six members of the state Board of Election Commissioners have until Oct. 13 to respond to a motion for a preliminary injunction. The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and three other plaintiffs wanted the schedule fast-tracked to make sure county election commissioners begin the process of comparing absentee ballot signatures to registration signatures 15 days before the Nov. 3 election, said Susan Inman, a member of the League and former state election commissioner. The plaintiffs also want absentee voters to have the opportunity to correct any discrepancies before Election Day to make sure their ballots aren&#8217;t discarded over a technicality or poor penmanship.</p>

The lawsuit contends that the counties removed comparatively low numbers of voters from the rolls even though the Census Bureau suggests a greater number of people had changed addresses. Additionally, the plaintiffs state that county clerks failed to send adequate numbers of address verification forms to voters as is required by the National Voter Registration Act. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office rebuffed the lawsuit as a partisan attempt to undermine the election and asserted that Judicial Watch relied on bad data.  &#8220;By misinterpreting data, this blatantly partisan group seeks to undermine the election,&#8221; Communications Director Betsy Hart said in a statement. &#8220;The claims made by this group are based solely on a comparison between real-time voter registration information and outdated census data. The population of our state has grown considerably over the last several years and the number of registered voters has predictably increased as well. We are confident the State of Colorado will win this lawsuit.&#8221;</p>

Georgia law says absentee ballots must be received by the close of polls on Election Day. U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross on Aug. 31 issued a preliminary injunction ordering that absentee ballots that are postmarked by Election Day and arrive at county election offices by 7 p.m. three business days later be counted. The state appealed and a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to stay the injunction pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<p>Judge William M. Ray II has dismissed requests from a civil rights group to require Gwinnett County and the state to send<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/judge-dismisses-request-for-more-spanish-ballot-access-in-georgia/NZCLPDCS4ZESJMNA7OF7RFK77I/"> absentee ballot applications in Spanish</a>. Ray dismissed the case  saying that the secretary of state’s office and the Gwinnett elections board didn’t violate the federal Voting Rights Act, as the lawsuit claimed. “Nonetheless, this Court recognizes that Plaintiffs&#8217; end goal of ensuring that Spanish-speaking Gwinnett voters receive bilingual absentee ballot applications is a reasonable and desirable outcome,” Ray wrote. He said, though, that GALEO and the other groups lacked the standing to make the case. Ray said in his order that the individuals who said they weren’t sent Spanish-language ballot applications were able to get them from the county, and did vote. He added that a Spanish-language ballot application was accessible on the county website.</p>

The temporary halt will give time for a federal appeals court to consider the case. In a new order, Barker said she doesn’t want Hoosier voters to have a “false sense of security” about getting their ballot in on time.

Minnesota Voter Alliance and political activists filed the lawsuit, seeking a restraining order against Gov. Tim Walz to prevent enforcement of the statewide mask mandate at the polls on Nov. 3. An attorney for the group, Erick Kaardal, argued that the mask requirement violates constitutional free-speech rights. Kaardal also cited that the mandate conflicts with a state law created in 1963 that makes it illegal to wear a mask in a public place. However Schiltz said in a hearing last week that the rarely enforced law is only intended to prevent people from disguising themselves when committing a crime. In his order of denial, Schlitz cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend face coverings be worn in public to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Schlitz added that the 1963 state law does not make wearing masks unlawful, but wearing disguises unlawful. Additionally, Schlitz said extending the law to this situation would mean that doctors, manicurists and construction workers could not wear masks while performing their jobs.</p>

<p>On Oct. 2, Wake County Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins approved the settlement of a lawsuit that would change<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article246161740.html"> how absentee ballots are handled</a> in North Carolina for the 2020 election. Collins said the settlement was fair and reasonable and not illegal or a product of collusion. But a federal judge held a hearing later Friday in a lawsuit seeking to block the settlement, and he said he’ll issue a ruling “in due course.” Collins said the agreement was a compromise between two parties — the State Board of Elections and a political group representing retirees that filed suit Aug. 18 over the state’s various rules for mail-in voting. The agreement would allow the board of elections to accept mail-in ballots up to nine days after the general election, as long as they are postmarked before 5 p.m. Election Day, Nov. 3.  The settlement also would allow North Carolina voters who are missing a witness signature or address on their mail-in ballot to fix the problem without filling out a new ballot. Judge James Dever placed a<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article246197280.html"> temporary restraining order</a> on the Settlement on Oct. 3. The restraining order is in place until Oct. 16 and the case will be transferred to U.S. District Court Judge William Osteen in the Middle District of North Carolina.</p>

Those rights, they say, are limited to certified campaign representatives to observe voting at a polling place on Election Day or the opening of absentee and mail-in ballots in an election office.</p>
<p>Luzerne County Director of Elections Shelby Watchilla has sued county Councilman Walter Griffith for<a href="https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/election-director-watchilla-sues-county-councilman-griffith-for-defamation/article_583215ef-2caa-5194-a030-fa415036e410.html"> defamation</a> in a suit that also names the county as a defendant. The suit alleges that Griffith repeatedly made defamatory statements against Watchilla and criticized her qualifications and job performance, even though county council has no supervisory role over the election bureau or its director. Griffith made “knowingly false” statements about Watchilla and violated county regulations that forbid council members from interfering in personnel matters, which are the purview of county administration, the suit alleges.</p>

The court’s most conservative members, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, said they would have reinstated the requirement for all ballots. Only one member of the court provided reasons. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote that the majority’s approach was warranted because state election laws should not ordinarily be second-guessed by federal judges and because the Supreme Court frowns on changes to election procedures made close to Election Day.</p>
<p>Also in South Carolina, the SC Progressive Network Education Fund has sued to extend the state’s<a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/local-group-seeks-to-extend-voter-registration-deadline-in-southcarolina/101-cb5ce5a7-4c39-4412-bb6c-6086cb74be46"> voter registration deadline</a>. The complaint notes that the State Election Commission (SEC) in the past has supported moving the registration period closer to the elections, citing extensions the SEC has provided due to hurricanes. &#8220;There is no doubt that pandemic safety measures and government restrictions have prevented some citizens from registering and participating in the next election,” Network Director Brett Bursey said. A<a href="https://abcnews4.com/news/local/hope-for-extending-sc-voter-registration-deadline-wanes-after-canceled-hearing"> hearing</a> before U.S. District Court Judge Mary Geiger Lewis that could have extended the deadline was cancelled Tuesday morning and had not been rescheduled at press time.</p>

<p>MOVE Texas and The Texas Organizing Project sued the Bexar County Elections Department in state court over the<a href="https://www.tpr.org/news/2020-10-06/bexar-county-sued-over-number-of-election-day-polling-sites"> number of Election Day polling sites</a>. Bexar County has 284 polling sites reserved for Election Day. asked a judge to increase the number of voting sites to handle anticipated record turnout expected on Nov. 3. The lawsuit also included a claim that Bexar County did not accept additional deputy voter registrars who could help people register to vote within the few remaining days before the voter registration deadline. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs asked a judge to order the county to open at least 311 polling sites on Election Day, an increase of 27 sites.</p>
<p>The Texas Supreme Court handed down two elections-related rulings this week. In one ruling, the court ruled that Harris County may not send out<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/07/harris-county-mail-in-ballot-applications/"> mail ballot applications</a> to all registered voters. The court ruled that County Clerk Chris Hollins may not put the applications in the mail. The documents can be accessed online and are often distributed by political campaigns, parties and other private organizations. But for a government official to proactively send them oversteps his authority, the court ruled. “We conclude that the Election Code does not authorize the mailing proposed by the Harris County Clerk,” the court wrote in an unsigned per curiam opinion. The Republican justices sent the case back to a lower court in Harris County to issue an injunction blocking Hollins from sending the mailers. In the other ruling the state’s high court rejected a request from several top Texas Republicans to limit the number of days for<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/07/texas-early-voting-october-13/"> early voting</a>. In July, Gov. Gregg Abbot ordered that early voting begin six days earlier on October 13. The high court cited the timing of the suit. “To disrupt the long-planned election procedures as relators would have us do would threaten voter confusion,” Chief Justice Nathan Hecht  wrote<a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1449868/200739.pdf"> in the court&#8217;s majority opinion</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-768x524.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wisconsin:</strong> Five voters have asked Dane County Circuit Judge Mario White to declare that the<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/30/voters-ask-judge-back-madisons-democracy-park-events/5873721002/"> Democracy in the Park</a> events were a valid way for voters to return their ballots. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl scheduled the events to help deal with a flood of absentee ballots that voters have requested because of the coronavirus pandemic. An attorney for Republican lawmakers raised objections to the events, claimed they were illegal and argued absentee ballots submitted at them could be invalidated. The voters who brought Wednesday&#8217;s lawsuit dispute those claims and want the judge to assure voters that their absentee ballots will be counted.  More than 10,000 absentee ballots were returned at the first event, according to the city. During  hearing last week, White questioned whether he can rule since no one involved in the suit opposes the collection program. He asked the voters to<a href="https://fox11online.com/news/election/judge-delays-decision-on-collecting-ballots-in-parks"> file briefs</a> on whether a controversy exists by Oct. 9.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court told federal judges this week that Republican lawmakers have the<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-gives-gop-win-mail-ballots-case/5902636002/"> power to pursue an appeal</a> as they try to prevent an expanded absentee voting counting period.  The 4-3 ruling is a victory for Republicans, but they still face obstacles as they try to undo a court order that would allow the counting of absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day if they are postmarked by then.  The decision sends the case back to the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, which must decide whether the lawmakers can continue the appeal and, if so, whether to throw out the absentee balloting extension.</p>
