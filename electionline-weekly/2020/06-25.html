<em>Redistricting and elections management using GIS</em></p>
<p>By Jamie Chesser, director of programs<br />
<a href="https://www.nsgic.org/">National States Geographic Information</a></p>
<p>Long before COVID-19 hurled elections management onto center stage, the National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) was busily collaborating with election administrators and geographic information officers (GIOs) to develop best practices and tools to help make elections more accurate and efficient.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5674" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GIS-Photo-1-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GIS-Photo-1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GIS-Photo-1-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GIS-Photo-1-768x994.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GIS-Photo-1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />And &#8211; for anyone who has the bandwidth to think beyond November 2020 &#8211; the organization is also providing education on how the next redistricting, in 2021, can be made much easier using geographic information systems (GIS).</p>
<p>“There’s a degree of uncertainty surrounding redistricting, now that the Census Bureau has requested an additional 120 days to deliver apportionment counts to the President. This delays state and local government from beginning their redistricting process by potentially up to four months, compared to the usual date of April 1, 2021,” says Shelby Johnson, GIO for Arkansas. “That will undoubtedly hamper the work to accomplish redistricting in most states. The critical work for every state to redraw boundaries, review public comment, and adopt new election geographies for congressional, state, county, and municipal districts takes a lot of time. Delaying the Census schedule is going to compress the timeline for redistricting and for election administrators to adjust new possible voting districts. I don’t see how they can do it without GIS. GIS technology makes that work so much easier and more time-efficient than using the old, list-based system,” he adds.</p>
<p>Just how GIS makes the work of redistricting easier is explained in this short “GIS 101” webinar from NSGIC:<a href="https://nsgic.zoom.us/rec/play/6MAvI-qvrWo3Gt3A5ASDC_4vW420LKushihP8qdcnR63BnZRNFGuZLQSN7RqD8NluKZjl7Vdlwg6HWog?continueMode=true&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=of00Qz9sQTSAlKR2MXzRnA.1593006233067.c459e7689b026d37cee82e039c460a19&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=600"> GIS 101- Redistricting with Shelby Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>The bigger topic of Geo-Enabled Elections is covered in a similar webinar,<a href="https://nsgic.zoom.us/rec/play/78crIrr5qDw3H9SW5ASDBaB8W47ufausgCIWrPsMzEayWnUBMwH0M7VANrd2ujHaTV4_HODKGktLP4x6?continueMode=true&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=0oZsjymIQk67DWSD_P-p1Q.1588613428616.3413bc66efbf2b5aad3e272fa4279bf0&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=182"> GIS 101 &#8211; Geo-Enabled Elections with Jamie Chesser</a>.</p>
<p>So, are most states “geo-enabled” and ready to take advantage of the benefits of GIS in the upcoming election, and during the coming redistricting process? Here, the answer becomes more nuanced. In a<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/nsgic-releases-groundbreaking-survey-of-election-directors-take-on-their-progress-towards-implementing-gis-in-elections/"> survey of state election directors around the country</a> conducted by NSGIC in 2018, less than one-third of election directors were confident that their voter registration system supported the use of GIS. This means that many states won’t be able to take advantage of some GIS functionality that might be particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic, like for example managing voting center locations based on at-risk populations, wait times, and other situations on the ground.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shelby Johnson believes that most – if not all &#8211; election administrators will be using GIS in some form or another to aid in the 2021 redistricting.</p>
<p>A third and very valuable application of GIS technology in elections – especially ahead of an election where more voters are expected to use mail-in ballots – is the ability to conduct spatial audits ahead of election day. The goal of these audits is to ensure that every voter is assigned to the correct precinct and allowed to vote in the right contests. A GIS-enabled audit translates all voter addresses to pinpoints on a map, over which digital representations of district boundaries can be placed, which in turn highlights any cases where a voter has been assigned to the wrong voting district by mistake.</p>
<p>What are states and counties to do who already know they need to better integrate GIS in elections in order to be ready to tackle upcoming elections or redistricting?</p>
<p>“There’s still time to start the process and make significant headway,” says Molly Schar, NSGIC Executive Director. “GIS technology significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of elections, first and foremost by making it easier to ensure that every voter is assigned to the right voting districts and is allowed to vote in all the right races. It also allows election directors to better match resources with needs, for instance when it comes to locating voter services within reach of those who most need them. So for any state or county that isn’t currently using GIS to manage their elections or their redistricting process, I would encourage them to create a path to geo-enabling their elections as soon as possible,” she adds.</p>
<p>To help with this process, NSGIC in 2019 issued a<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/best-practices-gis-in-elections/"> Best Practice Guidance, Improving America’s Elections with GIS</a> following a two-year collaborative project involving election administrators and GIOs from across the United States. It provides step-by-step help and can be<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/best-practices-gis-in-elections/"> downloaded here.</a></p>

The hearing featured dozens of public witnesses, including some who served as poll workers, staff and the head of the D.C. Board of Elections and several expert witnesses. During the hearing it was revealed that at least 1,100 requests for absentee ballots were lost by the DCBOE ahead of  the primary, forcing hundreds of voters to cast ballots in-person while others apparently did not vote at all. “There is a lot of planning going on now to make sure November is as smooth as operation as possible,” said Michael Bennett, chair of the DCBOE, highlighting a new vendor to build another app, new IT hires to help address existing problems, and a broader communications campaign to let voters know of how the November election will run. The board also said this week that it will double the number of in-person polling places for early and day-of voting.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5521" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GA-Welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> A review of the state’s disastrous June 9 primary continued this week with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/election-officials-grilled-over-lines-and-problems-georgia-primary/ShcyPo2D7kaByOymzFITuI/"> answering questioning from members of the House</a>. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Raffensperger acknowledged that long lines in Georgia’s June 9 primary were “unacceptable” but downplayed problems with the state’s new voting system. He said most difficulties in the election occurred in Fulton County, which had some of the most extreme wait times. “It’s not going to work and it’s not going to be good enough for you to just keep saying it’s in Fulton County and not my issue,” said Rep. Renitta Shannon (D- Decatur. “What specific policies are you going to put in place?” Raffensperger, a Republican, responded that election officials<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/changes-georgia-elections-proposed-avoid-repeat-november/Uf9Lwi0tNz3QkGvfqY89RI/"> need to</a> add voting locations, improve hands-on training and encourage early voting. He said he’s reaching out to community groups such as Rotary Clubs, Boy Scouts and sororities to ask whether they can host precincts.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5678" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KY-welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Kentucky:</strong> With much of the nation watching the commonwealth’s vote on Tuesday, the response from state and local elections officials was, “<a href="https://www.wtvq.com/2020/06/24/adams-praises-election-blasts-clinton-critics/">we got this</a>”. Although Kentucky’s primary plans — early voting, expanded absentee, one vote center per county — had been in place for months, it was only in the waning days before the primary that those outside of the state took notice and began to<a href="https://www.wtvq.com/2020/06/23/despite-social-media-outrage-kentucky-secretary-state-calls-primary-election-national-success/"> express concerns</a> on social media and in the mainstream media. In the end, while there were lines on primary day, especially in<a href="https://www.lex18.com/news/election-2020/fayette-co-clerk-says-confusion-over-mail-in-ballots-held-up-lines-at-kroger-field"> Lexington</a>, the fears about widespread voter suppression were largely unfounded and when all is said and done, the state will most likely have its largest primary turnout ever. Elections officials in<a href="https://www.herald-dispatch.com/elections/boyd-county-sees-historic-voter-turnout/article_fe7202c7-575f-5c4c-8ade-8bfe68b28add.html"> Boyd County</a>,<a href="https://hoptownchronicle.org/election-official-says-christian-countys-in-person-primary-voting-was-successful-absentee-tabulations-continue-to-determine-outcome/"> Christian County</a>,<a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2020/06/23/good-turnout-for-in-person-voting-in-clark-county/"> Clark County</a>,<a href="https://www.owensborotimes.com/news/2020/06/in-person-voting-at-sportscenter-went-surprisingly-smooth/"> Daviess County</a>,  <a href="https://www.state-journal.com/election_2020/franklin-county-voters-turn-out-for-unusual-primary-election/article_6c1cc260-b58a-11ea-b1a4-43869d8d13aa.html">Franklin County</a>,<a href="https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/2020/06/23/henderson-county-primary-has-new-look-but-no-problems/3239935001/"> Henderson County</a>,<a href="https://www.wymt.com/2020/06/23/knox-county-voting-goes-smoothly-with-despite-just-two-polling-locations/"> Knox County</a>,  <a href="https://www.wymt.com/2020/06/23/voters-in-perry-county-head-to-the-polls-happy-with-precautions-in-place/">Perry County</a>,<a href="https://www.sentinelnews.com/content/unorthodox-election-runs-smoothly"> Shelby County</a>, and<a href="https://www.bgdailynews.com/news/few-problems-reported-at-single-polling-site-in-warren-county/article_8ad55d60-3b70-5166-b1c8-129045c76c34.html"> Warren County</a> all reported that in-person voting ran smoothly on Tuesday. Many of those officials and others statewide are<a href="https://www.owensborotimes.com/news/2020/06/thousands-of-absentee-ballots-still-to-be-processed-for-primary-election/"> still processing</a> absentee ballots of course. As mentioned, there were issues wait-times of about 90 minutes at<a href="https://www.wave3.com/2020/06/23/long-wait-times-lexingtons-only-in-person-voting-site/"> Fayette County’s</a> one vote center. Elections officials did open additional check-in stations, which is where the hold-up seemed to be occurring. While polls closed on time, the last voter cast their ballot around 8pm. Although there was a lot of pre-election concern around<a href="https://wfpl.org/how-an-election-worker-helped-voters-get-around-the-expo-centers-cavernous-space/"> Jefferson County</a>’s use of one polling site, the longest lines that day were at the food trucks providing free food outside the Expo Center. There was some controversy at 6pm when Kentucky’s polls close though. There were no lines outside the Expo Center in Jefferson County as the clock approached 6pm but, there was an issue in the<a href="https://www.wdrb.com/politics/traffic-delays-around-expo-center-prompt-request-for-extended-voting-in-jefferson-county/article_88ddb728-b59f-11ea-9b59-bfd2e243c18e.html"> parking lot</a> and so initially, voters who were dealing with parking issues were<a href="https://twitter.com/joesonka/status/1275551754080391170?s=20"> locked out</a> of the polling center. However, a judge’s<a href="https://twitter.com/dctello/status/1275581285776461826?s=20"> hand-written order</a> reopened the doors until 6:30pm and “anyone on the pavement” at 6:30pm was allowed to vote. Images shared widely on social media showed voters outside to the Expo Center<a href="https://twitter.com/joesonka/status/1275553817350856706?s=20"> pounding on the doors</a> to be let it. Shared less widely on social media were the images of poll workers standing at the doors just before 6pm yelling at people to<a href="https://twitter.com/joesonka/status/1275548678888009728?s=20"> get in the polling place</a> before 6pm as well the county clerk’s spokesperson explaining that they were telling people to<a href="https://twitter.com/joesonka/status/1275553022425403394?s=20"> get into any line</a> upon<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5677" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KY-Dogs-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /> arrival because the law is they have to be in line. The challenges faced by Jefferson County with social media and the outside looking in will surely plague many elections officials in the coming months as all eyes turn toward November. Hopefully the<a href="https://www.wmot.org/post/kentucky-shows-tennessee-what-universal-vote-mail-option-election-might-look"> lessons learned</a> from Kentucky can help some other states as well. And finally, some genuinely controversial news from Kentucky primary. In Lexington, two voters had to make a stop at the county clerk’s office before heading to the vote center to vote because their<a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2020/06/24/candidate-for-lexington-council-says-dog-ate-her-absentee-ballot/"> dogs had eaten their absentee ballots</a> (ALLEGEDLY) and those ballots needed to be canceled. They were able to get that done and cast their ballots. No comment from Athena, Starbuck and Apollo, but we think they look pretty darn innocent!</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5682" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MD-Welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Maryland:</strong> Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore), and Sen. Paul Pinsky (D-Prince Georges County), made a variety of<a href="https://martinsvillebulletin.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/maryland-senators-recommend-ways-to-avoid-election-problems/article_6c0c32ff-67a4-5a04-aa58-61f02cb4966a.html"> recommendations to state election officials</a> in a letter Tuesday for a smoother election during the coronavirus pandemic. While the senators noted that the decision on how to conduct the election is up to Gov. Larry Hogan and the Maryland State Board of Elections, the senators called for four “critical&#8221; improvements. The senators are calling for an expansion of the number of ballot drop-off boxes, additional in-person voting sites on Election Day and the use of early voting centers statewide. They also are calling for an enhanced communication plan to better coordinate state and local board engagement with the voting public, particularly within historically disenfranchised communities.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5679" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MA-Welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Massachusetts:</strong> While much of the media was focused on voters in Louisville, Kentucky trying to gain access to the polls after the official 6pm closing time, at least two voters in<a href="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2020/06/24/tisburytown-clerk-confirms-mishap-wiith-clock-closed-polls-minute-early-shutting-out"> Tisbury, Massachusetts</a> were unable to vote in the annual town elections because the polls were mistakenly closed a minute too early. According to the Vineyard Gazette, town officials in Tisbury use the clock on the ballot box as the official timepiece for the election and it seems like that time was off by a couple of minutes because several voters showed up 7:58pm but the ballot box was already closed because it read 8pm. “What I am now aware of is that the clock on the machine was one minute ahead,” Town Clerk J. Hilary Conklin told the paper. “So we are changing our practice, we are changing our time keeping method going forward to eliminate this issue.”</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> About 6,700 ballots were not counted in this month&#8217;s Nevada primary election after officials<a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/about-6700-nevada-primary-ballots-rejected-over-signatures"> could not match signatures</a> on the ballots, according to the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office. The 6,749 uncounted ballots represented less than 1% of all ballots mailed to voters ahead of the June 9 primary, which was conducted mostly by mail.</p>

While many New York voters faced few problems and short lines if they chose to vote in-person on Tuesday, once again New York City’s voters were<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-primary-pandemic-voting-state-legislative-congress-races-20200623-bhl7eaqhijhv3l5fmotiheixti-story.html"> faced with a host of problems</a> on an election day. There were some issues outside of the New York City boroughs though. Voters stood in<a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/06/23/primary-election-lines-polling-sites/3240830001/"> long lines</a> in Rockland and Westchester counties on Tuesday. The lines were caused by consolidated polling places and at the Greenburgh Town Hall polling place, a machine malfunction forced voters to cast provisional ballots for a while. Some voters in<a href="https://buffalonews.com/2020/06/23/the-word-of-the-day-for-voters-confused/"> Niagara County</a> complained about the lack of outreach prior to the election. “It wasn’t until this week that I figured out what was going on with the election,&#8221; Steve Kennedy, 64, a retired teacher told The Buffalo News. &#8220;I didn’t feel it was explained well enough. I guess I didn’t pay attention.” Voters in<a href="https://www.wxxinews.org/post/monroe-county-elections-officials-say-concerns-about-polling-places-are-being-addressed"> Monroe County</a>, that were faced with multiple ballots to fill out, complained about the lack of social distancing. The biggest complaint for poll workers in<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/slow-day-at-the-polls-election-officials-say/32950112"> Clinton County</a> was that it was a slow day because so many voters opted to vote-by-mail. It was also slow going in<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2020/06/voter-turnout-light-in-onondaga-county-for-todays-ny-primary-election.html"> Onondaga County</a> which averaged less than 1,000 voters an hour. A record 32,764 voters in the county had requested absentee ballots by election day, and 22,964 ballots had been returned by this morning. In<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/primary-day-live-updates-voters-report-problems-get-go"> New York City</a>, the problems were<a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/06/23/new-york-primary-2020-problems/"> numerous</a>. Long lines snaked out and around many polling places. Polling places in some areas failed to open on time. There were also issues with the ballot scanning machines not functioning properly at some voting locations. There were reports on social media that poll workers were not allowing voters to drop off their absentee ballots which is actually permitted under the law. Many voters complained about only receiving one ballot—for the presidential preference primary—and not two as they should have. A polling place in Queens did not have the promised COVID-19<a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/national-politics/the-race-2020/queens-polling-site-lacks-promised-covid-19-safety-measure-on-primary-day"> safety measures</a> in place when polls opened. Also in Queens, a<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/24/nyc-poll-snafus-caused-hundreds-of-democrats-to-vote-in-3rd-party-primary/"> ballot issue</a> had voters casting ballots for the wrong party. Following Tuesday’s vote,<a href="https://www.amny.com/politics/we-have-always-made-it-difficult-for-people-to-vote-public-advocate-seeks-election-reforms-after-primary-day-miscues/"> Public Advocate Jumaane Williams</a> is calling for reform of the process. Williams acknowledged that there were extenuating circumstances with Tuesday’s vote because of the global pandemic but said those circumstances only exacerbated pre-existing conditions with the city’s voting system. “We have always made it difficult for people to vote and we should make it as easy as possible including using absentee ballot – let’s keep whatever we have here now and allow people to vote again with absentee and make it permanent,” Williams told AMNY.  “Let’s get in the process of used to it, whether it is early voting, absentee voting, same-day registration – these are things we have to stop resisting. Things will get better, but we also have to get more funding into the system for training.”</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Voters headed back to the polls two weeks after a bumpy June 9 primary for a<a href="https://www.goupstate.com/news/20200623/turnout-light-in-spartanburg-county-runoff-elections"> runoff</a> and while things were much smoother this time around, there were some issues.<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/election/article243730257.html"> Richland County</a>, which seems to be plagued with problems at every election faced some glitches but there were no long lines. The county’s interim elections director was not on hand Tuesday because he was out sick and waiting on the results of a<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/election/article243733457.html"> COVID-19 test</a> that would not be back until later this week. A printer malfunction in<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/election/article243730257.html"> Union County</a> caused issues with absentee ballots.</p>

Overall things went well, especially on the pandemic front, but there were some technical issues. In<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/elections/vp-nw-voting-machines-20200623-otbbklsnanhuvjmwfu6ctryiry-story.html"> Virginia Beach</a>, voters had to cast provisional ballots when the city’s e-poll books were not functioning properly when polls opened at 6 a.m. By 2:30 p.m., all electronic pollbooks had been updated and were working properly again, Registrar Donna Patterson told The Virginia Pilot. All 100 polling locations were affected, and Patterson wasn’t sure how many provisional ballots were cast while the pollbooks were going through updates. Voting precincts in Henrico, Franklin, and Loudoun counties faced some technical difficulties Tuesday morning as<a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/power-problems-reported-at-some-virginia-voting-precincts"> power outages</a> caused a disturbance in voters&#8217; ability to cast their ballots for the primary election. Provisional ballots were provided and Department of Elections Commissioner Christopher Piper noted that the power outage was not a security issue. Drive-thru voting was available once again in places like<a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/voters-cast-ballots-through-drive-thru-in-williamsburg"> Williamsburg</a> and voters really seem to appreciate that feature. Absentee voting once again proved popular and some counties like<a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/42281214/absentee-voting-breaks-record-in-albemarle"> Albemarle</a> saw record-breaking numbers.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5378" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WV-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Last week, the West Virginia Supreme Court ruled</strong> that four provisional ballot from a 2019 Harpers Ferry municipal election must be counted. Now the question remains<a href="http://www.spiritofjefferson.com/news/article_58c93000-b629-11ea-92c1-afe5a2db9faa.html"> when those ballots will actually be counted and the election finally officially certified</a>. According to the Spirit of Jefferson that may not be for some time. The Supreme Court, after receiving the case on appeal Dec. 6 and hearing oral arguments May 19, issued its 4-0 opinion in the case on June 15 supporting a previous order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Debra McLaughlin to count the votes. Under the procedural rules for appellate cases, a legal party to a Supreme Court case decision has 30 days to file a petition to request a rehearing after the court issues an opinion. Once the period to file a petition ends, if no petition is filed, then a “mandate” would be issued that ends the matter before the Supreme Court. According to the paper, there has been no comment from the losing side as to whether or not they will file the petition.  Six candidates have a mathematical chance of either taking over or retaining a Town Council seat in Harpers Ferry—including a chance to win a possible vote tie-breaking process—if all of the potential votes on the four provisional ballots are counted.</p>

The Postal Service provided the clerk’s office with a list of addresses that may have been affected and any registered Democrat or Republican voter who may reside at the affected  addresses and did not receive a vote by mail ballot or an unaffiliated voter who did not receive a vote by mail application were urged to contact the clerk&#8217;s office immediately</p>

Former inmates, in a collaboration between Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office and the Michigan Department of Corrections, are being issued a driver’s license or state ID upon completion of their sentences. Michigan began automatic voter registration for anyone who signs up for an ID in September of last year. The MDOC will obtain required documents for identification verification and photos from prisoners who are designated for parole “and will send that info directly to (the Secretary of State), where either a driver’s license or state ID will be processed,” Benson’s office said in statement issued Tuesday. “Once someone has been paroled, they will be provided their driver’s license or ID and registered to vote unless they choose not to be, along with a workforce development packet that includes information outlining the restoration of their voting rights.”</p>

It uses images of black protesters from the 1950s and &#8217;60s demanding voting rights, alongside those of current protests over police violence, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. A narrator says, &#8220;white supremacy does not endure on its own. It is propped up by suppressing black voices and votes.&#8221; “Modern-day voter suppression policies may no longer include poll taxes and literacy tests, but the disproportionate adverse impact of voter ID laws, purging of voter rolls, and felony disenfranchisement on communities of color is no coincidence,&#8221; said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla who leads the group.</p>

Macomb County Clerk/Register of Deeds Fred Miller said a total of 525 entries were submitted from students in 14 Macomb County school districts, as well as private and home-schooled students. A total of 64 entries were selected as finalists, ultimately reviewed remotely by a panel of judges that included judges from the Macomb County Circuit Court, members of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, city and township clerks, and representatives from the Macomb Intermediate School District and the county arts community. Student designs were evaluated on the interpretation of the theme, “Your Vote, Your Future,” along with clarity, artistic creativity and the ability to create a design that would look good on a 2-inch diameter sticker. “We wanted to do something to help teachers start a conversation with students about civic responsibility and the different ways people can participate in our democratic process,” Miller told C&amp;G Newspapers. “This seemed like a cool way to engage students. The fact that we had 525 entries from 14 school districts, plus charter schools and home schools, was very encouraging.”</p>

Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that will require county officials to<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-Legislature-OKs-bill-to-mail-ballot-to-15350344.php"> mail a ballot</a> to every registered voter for the November election, cementing into law the Democratic governor’s earlier order to mail out ballots statewide in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>On a 28-9 initial vote, the state Senate sent Assembly<a href="https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/nation/initiative-to-restore-voting-rights-to-californians-on-parole-heads-to-november-ballot/article_11599e7d-ed4e-5b60-9517-022dc4198328.html"> Constitutional Amendment 6</a> to the Nov. 3 ballot, opening a possibility for more than 40,000 formerly incarcerated residents to regain their voting ability before they finish their probationary period. State Sen. Steven Bradford, D-Gardena, said ACA 6 would allow people on parole to reintegrate into and become a “contributing member to society.” “People on parole are our family members, our colleagues, our neighbors, our friends,” Bradford said. “They go to work every day. They pay taxes. They do their part to successfully reintegrate themselves back into society, yet the stigma exists for them.”</p>
<p>Also in California, the Albany city council unanimously approved a ballot measure for the November ball that is approved by voter would allow residents to<a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/06/19/ranked-choice-voting-albany-residents-will-decide-this-november/"> rank candidates</a> in order of preference in local elections.</p>

The measure has received preliminary approvals from council’s Rules Committee. The deadline for the full council to formally place the measures on the November ballot is early August.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> During a virtual session, the House approved legislation that that gives all voters the ability to cast a ballot in any election this year without compromising their health or safety. The measure passed along party lines in a vote 25-13. The process to<a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/delaware-house-expands-vote-by-mail-option-for-all-elections-in-2020/article_dc953be0-b1c9-11ea-80a3-a7b418dbf8c4.html"> vote by mail</a> mirrors the absentee ballot system that&#8217;s been used for decades in the state.  The measure now heads to the state Senate for a vote, where it must pass before session ends on June 30, 2020.</p>

The legislation also loosens restrictions on ballot signature-matching requirements and provides for the division of large precincts under certain conditions. The bill could receive a vote in the Georgia House before the Legislature ends its current session Friday. If the measure passes and is signed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp, it could take effect before the November general election.</p>

The bills (H 4778/S 2764) largely do the same things: instruct Secretary of State William Galvin to mail every voter an application for the primaries on Sept. 1 and the general election on Nov. 3. Residents would have three voting options under either bill — showing up to the polls in-person, taking advantage of early voting periods, or voting-by-mail — which both officials and advocates alike say helps address public health concerns regarding physical distancing. The House bill proposes sending registered voters two separate applications by mail, one on July 15 for the primaries, and another in October for the general election. The Senate bill sends out one mailing on July 15 that includes paperwork for both elections, and also calls for a general election application to be included in the October voter guide.</p>

She said it would also be a felony to complete applications with the intent to receive multiple ballots. The plan has been referred to the House Elections and Ethics Committee for consideration.</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law this week a measure that should<a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/new-law-intended-help-local-clerks-process-absentee-ballots-november"> help speed up results in November</a>. The new law allows city or township clerks to create an &#8220;absent voting counting board&#8221; with other local clerks to join forces to count absentee ballots. “There are a lot of smaller jurisdictions in Ingham County and across the state that this will benefit greatly,” Lansing city clerk Chris Swope told Michigan Public Radio. Swope says processing ballots with an absent voting counting board rather than in a precinct will speed up the count.</p>

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s desk. The House initially rejected Senate Bill 4 38-32 but a subsequent vote to “reconsider” the legislation passed, and after hours of closed-door caucus meetings, a second vote on the legislation cleared the House floor 44-26 without any amendments. The temporary election changes would allow clerks to automatically send absentee ballot applications to all registered voters ahead of the presidential election. It also makes other changes supporters say will streamline the next election following mail delays that led to problems with people receiving their ballots and a prolonged delay in election results in Santa Fe County. Many people complained about receiving their ballots so late they had to turn them in last-minute, in person.</p>

Ohioans for Secure and Fair Elections said despite earlier legal victories at the state and federal level, an appellate court’s ruling that blocked them from collecting the signatures electronically has made their campaign for the November ballot unworkable. “While this is certainly not the outcome we hoped, planned, organized, fundraised, or campaigned for, we come to this decision with pride in our work, appreciation for our coalition partners, and a clear vision for the future,” Ohioans for Secure and Fair Elections Campaign Manager Toni Webb said in a statement.</p>

<p>Also in Pennsylvania, lawmakers in the General Assembly are reviewing potential legislation that would allow election officials to<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/06/pa-lawmakers-review-legislation-to-allow-counting-of-mail-in-ballots-before-election-day.html"> begin counting mail-in ballots</a> before 7 a.m. on Election Day, a provision that advocates say will be crucial in getting timely election results in November.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: An effort to<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article243761887.html"> expand absentee voting</a> ahead of the November general election failed on Wednesday as the S.C. House agreed to spend more than $1.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief. After a roughly three-hour debate on Wednesday, lawmakers adopted the legislation in a 109-2 vote, agreeing to changes made and adopted by the Senate on Tuesday and sent the bill to the governor with no provisions to adjust absentee voting for the general election. Democrats have said they will<a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/sc-dems-prep-more-lawsuits-as-legislature-punts-on-absentee-voting-expansion-amid-pandemic/article_823643fc-b650-11ea-b500-239ee5e63c0d.html"> file suit</a> to expand absentee voting.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The Parker County commissioners court approved the<a href="https://www.weatherforddemocrat.com/news/commissioners-approve-termination-of-elections-administrator/article_fab5a7f6-b4ce-11ea-976e-d3bcae55ef72.html"> termination of Elections Administrator Don Markum</a> Monday afternoon in a 3-2 vote. The commissioners met in executive session for about two hours and reconvened in open session at about 4:15 p.m. Monday. Precinct 1 Commissioner George Conley, Precinct 4 Commissioner Steve Dugan and Parker County Judge Pat Deen voted in favor of terminating Markum while Precinct 2 Commissioner Craig Peacock and Precinct 3 Commissioner Larry Walden voted against the motion. “Parker County appreciates all Don Markum’s contributions to the county’s election process, and wishes him the best in his future endeavors,” Deen according to the Weatherford Democrat.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona:</strong> Secretary of State Katie Hobbs announced last week that a<a href="https://ktar.com/story/3316968/arizona-lawsuit-over-early-ballot-return-deadline-settled/"> settlement was reached</a> with a nonprofit organization in a lawsuit over the deadline to return early ballots. Voto Latino, an organization aimed at encouraging young Hispanic and Latino people to register to vote, filed a complaint with Priorities USA in November 2019 against Hobbs. The law requires ballots to be received by county election officials by 7 p.m. on Election Day. While the settlement between Hobbs and the groups will leave the current deadline in place, the Secretary of State’s office will attempt to address items contributing to the late returns. The Secretary of State’s office in the settlement is committing to conducting voter outreach and education about Election Day deadline in multiple languages, launching a webpage with information about voting by mail and ballot-drop options and allocating funding for counties to increase early voting opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> A lawsuit has been filed in Pulaski Circuit Court seeking to require<a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2020/06/23/lawsuit-seeks-order-for-to-ease-mail-absentee-voting-during-covid-19-crisis"> no-excuse absentee voting</a> in the November election. The lawsuit, by three people who say they fear exposure to coronavirus through in-person voting, says the current restrictions on absentee ballots are unconstitutional but, even if a constitutional challenge fails, rules should be modified as other states have done because of coronavirus. Under current law, absentee ballots are allowed for military, people who are abroad and for people “unavoidably absent or unable to attend an election due to illness or physical disability.” A question remains about what “unavoidably absent” means. The lawsuit says Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has so far not responded to a two-month-old request for an opinion by legislators. Voters can be prosecuted for perjury for being found in violation of the rule</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> A group of Connecticut Republicans are<a href="https://www.fox61.com/article/news/politics/lawsuit-filed-by-ct-republicans-challenges-expanded-absentee-voting-in-upcoming-election/520-44d8b4c9-847f-45e4-8fd8-0d760689e281"> challenging the state&#8217;s push</a> for expanding absentee voting ballots. The 13-page suit was filed in New Britain Superior Court by Dominic Rapini, Linda Szynkowicz, State Senator Eric Berthel(R -Watertown), and State Representative Jason Perillo (R-Shelton). The plaintiffs argue for the removal of Secretary of State Denise Merrill&#8217;s plan to people to vote in absentee due to concerns over COVID-19. Recently, Governor Ned Lamont signed an executive order to expand the qualifications of absentee voting for the August primary. The suit calls Merrill&#8217;s plan is &#8220;unlawful and unconstitutional.&#8221; It also claims the plan is vulnerable to voter fraud.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3346" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Florida:</strong> U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle denied most portions of plaintiffs requests for preliminary injunctions in a case seeking to<a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/judge-rejects-injunction-requests-in-vote-by-mail-fight"> expand vote by mail</a>, which is a consolidation of three lawsuits, saying the plaintiffs lack “a substantial likelihood of succeeding” on the vast majority of the issues. In one of the lawsuits, the group Priorities USA and other plaintiffs want the judge to extend a deadline for mail-in ballots to be returned and require free postage for the ballots. They’re also challenging a provision in Florida law restricting paid workers from collecting mail-in ballots. But Hinkle rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that requiring voters to pick up the tab for stamps amounts to an unconstitutional “poll tax.” “Postage charged by the United States Postal Service &#8212; like the fee charged by any other courier or the bus fare for getting to the polls to vote in person &#8212; is not a tax prohibited by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. And the requirement to pay postage also does not violate any other federal provision,” Hinkle wrote in Wednesday’s five-page order, referring to the U.S constitutional amendment that bars poll taxes. The judge also swatted down plaintiffs’ attempt at extending the deadline for supervisors of elections to receive mail-in ballots. Under current law, the ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. The plaintiffs want ballots postmarked by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be valid, as some states allow.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5591" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IN-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Indiana:</strong> Marion County Superior Court Judge Heather Welch has ordered Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson to<a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/judge-orders-lawson-to-produce-documents-on-voting-machine-security"> produce documents</a> to back up her claim that the public should not see emails and other communications about the reliability and security of voting machines because they could jeopardize cyberterrorism security. Welch ruled Tuesday that Lawson did not provide adequate justification for withholding the materials and ordered her to produce some of the documents for inspection in chambers. In a 27-page ruling, the judge ordered Lawson to submit the materials that she had withheld based on the counterterrorism exception so that she may examine them in private.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas sued Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab in Shawnee County District Court seeking a court order that would force him to release the<a href="https://www.kctv5.com/suit-kansas-official-must-disclose-uncounted-ballot-names/article_463e9be3-fa5f-555e-a0f4-d7226efde86d.html"> names of people who cast provisional ballots or say whether their votes were counted</a>. The ACLU wants the provisional voter information from the 2018 general election to be released so it can help Kansas voters correct defects on their ballots, the suit says. The group intends to submit similar requests for the 2020 primary and general elections. “The law requires open records and transparency, and that applies to the public being able to figure out the reason people’s votes are not being counted,” said Lauren Bonds, legal director for the ACLU of Kansas</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3623" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LouisianaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Louisiana:</strong> U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, of Baton Rouge has<a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_02e15914-b58f-11ea-97a7-83184b759d6f.html"> thrown out a lawsuit</a> challenging Louisiana&#8217;s emergency plan for its July presidential primary and August municipal elections, a plan written in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Two separate lawsuits filed in Baton Rouge federal court argued the plan didn&#8217;t go far enough to protect people from the virus. U.S. &#8220;The court rejects plaintiffs&#8217; contention that they are being &#8216;forced to choose&#8217; between their health and voting,&#8221; Dick wrote. The judge wrote in her decision that the lawsuits&#8217; plaintiffs &#8220;fail to adequately allege that there has been, or will be, an impairment of the right to vote attributable to state action.&#8221; &#8220;The potential presence of the virus in their polling place is not a legal impairment of their right; it is an epidemiological reality to which state officials have responded, not by impairing voting rights, but by expanding them,&#8221; Dick wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Michigan Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/18/judge-wont-immediately-stop-bensons-mailing-ballot-applications/3216721001/"> denied a request</a> to halt Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson&#8217;s mailing of absentee ballot applications to all registered voters ahead of August primary and November general elections. Nevin Cooper-Keel, Yvonne Black and serial litigant Robert Davis argued Benson was barred from sending the applications by state law and court precedent prohibiting elected officials from mailing unsolicited absentee ballot applications.  But Stephens argued those rules don&#8217;t reflect the loosened voting restrictions enacted under a voting rights initiative approved by voters in 2018. And those cases, Stephen said, only spoke to &#8220;local elections officials,&#8221; not the secretary of state.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Minnesota-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Minnesota:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Eric Tostrud<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/federal-judge-wont-sign-off-on-relaxed-minnesota-absentee-ballot-rules/"> declined to give his blessing to a consent decree</a> temporarily waiving Minnesota’s requirement that absentee voters get a witness to sign their ballots, less than a week after a state judge approved a similar agreement. The decision from the bench was hailed by Republicans, who raised alarms when Ramsey County Judge Sara Grewing<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ret.-Amer.-v.-Simon-order.pdf"> approved</a> a separate consent decree waiving the requirement last Wednesday. That order remains intact and it’s unclear whether Tostrud’s decision will impact it. According to Courthouse News Service, Tostrud’s refusal to sign a similar consent decree is the latest development in a fast-paced case brought by the League of Women Voters of Minnesota seeking to overturn the witness requirement, which requires would-be absentee voters to get another Minnesota voter or a notary public to sign their ballot. The voting rights group has argued the provision could prevent immunocompromised voters or others worried about Covid-19 from safely voting.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> The Missouri Supreme Court issued a decision on Tuesday involving<a href="https://www.missourinet.com/2020/06/23/missouri-supreme-court-sending-absentee-voting-case-back-to-cole-county-circuit-court/"> absentee voting</a>, ruling that a lawsuit that aims to allow all Missourians to cast absentee ballots without notarization in 2020 can proceed. The Supreme Court is sending the case back to Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem. The decision means the lawsuit from the NAACP of Missouri and the ACLU of Missouri can proceed. The circuit court dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The Supreme Court reversed that decision, finding the plaintiffs had stated a claim and remanded the case to the circuit court so the parties can proceed.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: U.S. District Court Judge Michael A. Shipp instructed county boards of elections statewide to &#8220;presume&#8221; that ballots received for the July 7 primary with questionable<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2020/06/19/nj-primary-election-2020-key-ruling-signatures-mail-ins/3215166001/"> signatures</a> came from the correct person. No ballot should be rejected &#8220;unless there is a clear discrepancy that cannot be reasonably explained.&#8221;  &#8220;When verifying signatures, evaluators should keep in mind that everyone writes differently and no one signs their name exactly the same way twice,&#8221; Shipp said in a ruling issued on Wednesday. &#8220;Some variation in signatures is to be expected.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Pennsylvania:</strong> The Pennsylvania NAACP sued the state demanding an<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-naacp-lawsuit-2020-election-coronavirus-20200618.html"> overhaul of the electoral system</a> before November because, it said, the system in place for the June 2 primary was not equally accessible and disenfranchised black and Hispanic voters. Among the changes the civil rights group seeks are stricter limitations on how many polling places a county can close, better notice of changes to locations, in-person early voting, automatic sending of mail ballot applications to all voters, and universal use of hand-marked paper ballots at polling places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that it will<a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/tennessee-high-court-keeps-mail-voting-expansion-amid-appeal"> not block a judge&#8217;s order</a> offering a by-mail voting option to all eligible voters during the coronavirus pandemic while the state continues to appeal. The Tennessee high court did agree with the state&#8217;s wish to fast-track the appeal without a lower appellate court considering it. But a majority of justices voted against stopping the absentee voting expansion pending appeal, dealing a blow to the state&#8217;s efforts to unravel the expansion as the Aug. 6 primary approaches.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3609" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TexasFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Texas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Marina Garcia Marmolejo on Wednesday threw out Democrats’ effort to reinstate the<a href="https://www.kxxv.com/hometown/texas/federal-court-tosses-suit-brought-by-texas-democrats-seeking-to-revive-straight-ticket-voting"> straight-ticket voting option</a> in Texas. Siding with the state, Garcia Marmolejo found that Democrats lacked standing to challenge Texas Republicans’ decision to kill straight-ticket voting ahead of the November general election. The judge dismissed the federal lawsuit after ruling that Democrats’ claims of the electoral fallout that could come from eliminating straight-ticket voting were too speculative.</p>

The League of Women Voters and Open Austin, a group that works on the technology side of civic engagement and advocates for open government and open data have come up with simple online form that people can fill out and that goes directly to Travis county elections officials. “It’s a very, very streamlined process that someone can basically just do on their phone,&#8221; Daniel Roesler, a volunteer with the LWV told KKUT. &#8220;You can be out and about or tell people about it and you just click on the link, fill out the process and all of a sudden you have applied to be a poll worker on Election Day.&#8221;</p>
