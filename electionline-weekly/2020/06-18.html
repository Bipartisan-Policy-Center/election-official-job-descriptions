														<p><strong>Bringing a national training tour to your home</strong><br />
<em>Defending Digital Democracy offers a virtual election prep bootcamp</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/person/bo-julie-crowley">Bo Julie Crowley</a><br />
Defending Digital Democracy</p>
<p>The 2020 election will look different from any election before, but unfortunately, many threats &#8211; such as targeted disinformation campaigns and cyber attacks &#8211; remain the same. While some of these risks have persisted for years, widespread social media use and sophisticated attack tools have amplified their reach and increased scrutiny on the state and local officials working to secure and operate our elections. COVID-19 has compounded these challenges by upending normal ways of working, communicating, and voting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5644" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D3P-300x154.png" alt="" width="300" height="154" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D3P-300x154.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D3P.png 398w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To support local election officials in responding to these changes, the bipartisan Defending Digital Democracy Project (D3P) has launched a<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/D3P#!2020-training-tour"> free national training program</a> that delivers best practices for crisis communications, operations management, and disinformation, as well as special topics like cybersecurity and how to proactively address the impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>D3P’s mission is to identify and recommend strategies to protect democratic processes and systems from cyber and information attacks. Since D3P was launched in 2017, we have met with numerous state and local election officials across the country to determine election needs and vulnerabilities. We have provided detailed security advice for officials through a series of playbooks such as the<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/state-and-local-election-cybersecurity-playbook"> State and Local Election Cybersecurity Playbook</a> and the<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/elections-battle-staff-playbook"> Elections Battle Staff Playbook</a>. We also have hosted hundreds of officials from more than 40 states at in-person trainings to reinforce new tools and best practices for securing elections. Our efforts have benefited tremendously from the many officials who provided feedback on our content and participated in our events.</p>
<p>This summer, we have developed a new, highly interactive training program that aims to bring D3P’s Battle Staff approach to local officials around the country. These virtual sessions highlight the following key topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations Management and Incident Tracking (e.g., Frameworks from the Elections Battle Staff Playbook)</li>
<li>Incident Response / Crisis Communications (e.g., Cyber and Mis/Disinformation Incident Communications Response)</li>
<li>Information Operations (e.g., Tools and frameworks for identifying, responding, and reporting disinformation and misinformation incidents)</li>
<li>Insight around COVID-19 and how different states are adapting their election processes  to combat related cybersecurity and disinformation threats</li>
</ul>
<p>Local and state officials can request a training session or more information through D3P’s<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdT3qEFGz9FihK2TekZ4L2YZzcBB9mo2QZG3jkJ9Xxt54oAA/viewform"> signup form</a>. The training content, timing, and format can be adapted to fit attendees’ preferences, with delivery formats that allow participants to concentrate the training into one day or, alternatively, spread out sessions over the course of a week. Regardless of format or number of participants, the training is designed to take advantage of virtual breakout sessions and small-group discussions, and includes a live election day tabletop simulation to test classroom concepts in real-time. Mindful of “video call fatigue,” we have developed an agenda that emphasizes active participation and minimizes the amount of time spent in listening mode alone. After the training, all participants will receive existing and new D3P playbooks, other printable deliverables, and an invitation to engage D3P on your post-training action plan or for other support requests.</p>
<p>Several states and election teams have signed up for training blocks within the next few weeks. We encourage any interested officials to<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdT3qEFGz9FihK2TekZ4L2YZzcBB9mo2QZG3jkJ9Xxt54oAA/viewform"> reach out</a> soon so we can reserve a week for your county or state. D3P aims to deliver this training to as many officials as possible, so there is no cap on the number of participants in any given session &#8211; and we hope to work with as many states and jurisdictions as possible. Just as you continue your work to serve the American people, we continue our work to serve you.</p>
<p>Interested officials can sign up for a training session or request more information via<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/D3P#!2020-training-tour"> D3P’s website</a> or the training signup form<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdT3qEFGz9FihK2TekZ4L2YZzcBB9mo2QZG3jkJ9Xxt54oAA/viewform"> here</a>.</p>

According to <em>Politico</em>, The report concludes that these devices and not the county’s new $300 million voting machines were the source of those delays. Although the voting machines also had problems, the report faults inadequate planning, testing and programming of the poll books that workers used to check in voters and verify that they’re registered. Because Los Angeles County did not have backup paper copies of the voter list, poll workers were not able to check in voters when the devices failed, leading to long lines.</p>

Jared Polis (D) recently signed an executive order activating the Colorado National Guard to assist with election cybersecurity defense efforts during the 2020 state primary election on June 30.   Cybersecurity support for the election had been requested by the Colorado Secretary of State. The order states that because Colorado uses online voter registration systems that allow eligible citizens to access and update their voter registration information, those systems, while protected by various security features that maintain confidentiality and prevent data tampering or interference with data, “could provide an avenue for cyber actors to gain unlawful access to voter registration databases.” The order notes that voter registration databases outside of the state have been compromised by cyber actors hacking into various systems. And while cyber actors are unable to modify voter records, breaches could result in the release of voters’ personal information.</p>

In<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/pitts-names-members-fulton-task-force-examine-rough-election/TprwMBkB4V07PvL06UT7bO/"> Fulton County</a>, Commission Chairman Robb Pitts announced the formation of a 19-person task force that will be analyzing the election to determine what went wrong and how to fix it. The task force will dig into six areas: facilities, equipment, personnel, logistics, communications and absentee ballots. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) announced a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/changes-georgia-elections-proposed-avoid-repeat-november/Uf9Lwi0tNz3QkGvfqY89RI/"> series of proposals</a> to make the November election run more smoothly including legislation to give the State Election Board, the power to intervene in county elections management. He also plans to provide far more tech support in voting places to avoid the kind of difficulties with the state’s $104 million voting system that delayed some poll openings last week. Raffensperger said the state will not mail absentee ballot applications to every voter, but it will create a website so residents can request a ballot. Additionally, the secretary of state’s office gave voters more time to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-voters-given-more-time-correct-absentee-ballot-problems/mE6LYLKpjOmAzniWAj8UnK/"> cure their ballot signatures</a>. Voters will have three business days after they’re notified of issues with their absentee ballots to fix problems, according to a bulletin from the secretary of state’s office. Voters can submit photo ID or other documentation to validate their identities.</p>

Michael Cogan, chairman of the state elections board, said the coronavirus pandemic forced elections officials to focus on safety at a time when there was a scarcity of personal protection equipment amid scary predictions of dire illnesses and death. Lawmakers said they understood the challenges, but they also expressed serious concerns about the depth of the problems. State election administrator Linda Lamone Lamone said elections officials are working to build more accountability for vendors into the process. But Sen. Cory McCray, a Baltimore Democrat, said he hasn’t heard anyone in senior leadership on the elections board accept responsibility. “At what point does the senior leadership team of the State Board of Elections bear some point of responsibility in the delayed ballots?” McCray asked.</p>

According to WPDE, Last week, Sandy Martin, the director of Horry County Voter Registration and Elections, said that &#8220;some voters were given the wrong ballot.&#8221; She added that &#8220;It stems from the workers not selecting the correct ballot on the machine.&#8221; Several of the protesting candidates say they heard from voters in their districts that their names weren&#8217;t even on their ballots.</p>

First, the county’s optical scan machine had difficulty dealing with absentee ballots that had been folded. Then, at 4:15 in the morning with only seven precincts left to count a sensor on the machines stopped working and a tech had to come the next day to fix it. Results were finally posted around 9 a.m. on Wednesday. However, County Clerk Lauren Ellifritz, discovered an error in the totals Thursday afternoon as she reviewed paperwork from the election. “On Election Night, the early and absentee ballots were processed first, and the results were downloaded to generate a report to distribute to those in the audience,” she explained. “In the process, the Election Night Management program was not reset to zero before the next report was generated. This resulted in a duplication of those votes only,” Ellifritz said before apologizing to candidates and their families. The new vote totals did not alter any race outcomes.</p>

(CIS®) to pilot a technology verification program focused on non-voting election technology including electronic poll books, election night reporting websites, and electronic ballot delivery systems. The proposed program is entitled “Rapid Architecture-Based Election Technology Verification,” or RABET-V, and it relies on a risk-based approach that allows rapid verification of manufacturers&#8217; security claims.</p>
<p>“Congress created the EAC to serve as a national leader on election technology issues. This pilot program is an important part of a broader effort by the EAC to expand our technical program in a direction that will better serve election officials across the country,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “We are excited to play an integral role in the development of the CIS RABET-V pilot program and contribute our expertise toward its success.”</p>
<p>As the sole federal agency dedicated to the administration of U.S. elections, the EAC is uniquely qualified to assist states and organizations such as CIS in the development of innovative evaluation techniques and processes outside of and separate from federal certification and the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.</p>
<p>“The EAC joined the project’s steering committee from the start as we see a need for jurisdictions across the U.S. to have a consistent way to evaluate the capabilities and security of manufacturers’ non-voting election technology. This program will inform the EAC on ways to complement the existing testing and certification of voting systems,” remarked EAC Vice-Chairman Don Palmer. “The current ecosystem of non-voting election technology vendors is healthy, diverse, and represents the innovative spirit of small business across our nation,” continued Vice-Chairman Palmer. “Our hope is that this pilot program will identify methods to better reduce vulnerabilities of non-voting technology, and will be a service to state and local election officials as we provide and disclose the results.”</p>
<p>The RABET-V pilot program supports agile software development with a verification process that anticipates and supports rapid product changes. Goals of the pilot program include incentivizing high-quality, modern design of IT systems updated in smaller, more manageable cycles at reduced cost of verification and re-verification with more reliable and consistent outcomes for purchasers of these systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;CIS is looking forward to working with the EAC, alongside our state, local, and industry colleagues on this pilot,&#8221; said Aaron<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-5640" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png" alt="" width="366" height="94" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-768x197.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo.png 820w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /> Wilson, CIS Senior Director of Election Security. &#8220;RABET-V is a unique approach that relies on each system&#8217;s architecture and each provider&#8217;s processes to inform risks and verify security. It is consistent with modern software development, testing, and deployment practices and will allow for changes to be verified rapidly without sacrificing security assurances.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the EAC, state election leaders from Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) will participate in the pilot program. The program is supported by technical expertise from Carnegie Mellon University, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Four non-voting election system manufacturers have already signed up for the pilot: Scytl, VR Systems, KNOWiNK, and Voting Works. The project forecasts being able to provide a preliminary report to stakeholders this fall.</p>

							<h2>COVID-19 Updates</h2>
														<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5532" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DC-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: The D.C. Board of Elections announced this week that it<a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/06/17/dc-plans-mail-ballot-2020-election-day-president/"> plans to mail a ballot</a> to each of the city’s 500,000 registered voters ahead of the November election, as well as expand in-person voting opportunities and take other steps to prepare for what officials say could be twin challenges of “record-shattering turnout” and a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases. For the November election, election officials say they plan on doubling the number of vote centers across the city for early and day-of voting. They say they will also revamp the app, hire additional IT experts, increase staffing in a call center to field voter calls, and launch a wider communications campaign on voting by mail. They’ve also starting talking to the U.S. Postal Service, to determine whether mail-delivery problems may have contributed to some absentee ballots and other election materials never being delivered.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3346" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Florida:</strong> This week, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) granted limited flexibility under state law to elections supervisors. In an<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/06/17/desantis-issues-emergency-elections-order-ahead-of-florida-primary/"> emergency order</a> that fell short of granting supervisors the leeway they’d requested months ago, DeSantis gave the state’s 67 local elections officials the ability to begin processing mail ballots earlier than otherwise allowed under Florida law. He also established administrative policies encouraging state employees to work as poll workers in their home counties — potentially alleviating concerns about Election Day staffing shortages — and encouraged officials to create protocols for keeping polling places sanitized and voters socially distanced. According to <em>The Tampa Bay Times</em>, the emergency order is too little, too late for many of the state’s elections officials.  “It comes at a point when many of the state’s Supervisors of Elections have already solidified their plans for the August primary election,” stated a news release issued by a spokeswoman for the Florida Supervisors of Elections association president, Hillsborough County Supervisor Craig Latimer. The association also noted that DeSantis’ executive order was “substantially different” from its request to DeSantis in early April. Supervisors had also hoped that the governor would allow for extra days of early voting and allow them to establish regional early voting centers on Election Day to alleviate concerns about staffing and skittish landlords unwilling to act as polling places.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced this week that<a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional/funding-approved-send-each-registered-ohio-voter-absentee-ballot-request-form/fjxu4VC8zvRmMT7Es4m68J/"> funding has been approved</a> to send an absentee ballot request to every registered voter.

No one will be sent an actual absentee ballot unless they specifically ask for one. The letters that accompany the form will also include instructions about how to request absentee ballots in person or with the state&#8217;s online portal. The mailing will be sent by Sept. 1.</p>

Since about 2012, the building has been leaking due to issues with the HVAC. According the Tallahassee Democrat, things are so bad elections employees have brought in large fans to blow-dry drenched drywall and they&#8217;ve wrapped equipment with plastic tarps. Elections staff only uses 45,000 square feet of the building, Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley said. But that space is constrained even further because of water damage to the building. That makes it difficult for workers to adhere to social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic, he added. County Commission Chairman Bryan Desloge recently took a tour of the elections office and said the county would make fixing the building a priority. &#8220;We take that stuff pretty seriously,&#8221; Desloge said. &#8220;On the eve of elections &#8230; our take is, we&#8217;ll fix it and work out the (financial) details later.&#8221;</p>

We don’t know. But we feel like we’re getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference.” The organization, called<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/lebron-james-voting-rights.html"> More Than a Vote</a>, will partly be aimed at inspiring African-Americans to register and to cast a ballot in November. According to The Times, James said he would use his high-profile platform on social media to combat voter suppression and would be vocal about drawing attention to any attempts to restrict the franchise of racial minorities.</p>

Winners were chosen in three categories—K-6; 7-12 and citywide. Winners were chosen by public voting after contest judges selected finalists. Judges included Mayor Christopher Taylor and representatives from the clerk’s office, the city’s citizens academy, Public Art Commission, Ann Arbor Public Schools and the University of Michigan’s Stamps School of Art and Design. While physical stickers will be available to those who head to the polls in November, City Clerk Jackie Beaudry said digital versions will be shared with absentee voters via email. Those then can be shared on social media. The city is considering other opportunities for distributing stickers via mail, such as including a sticker with an outgoing ballot, if the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a primarily vote-by-mail election, Beaudry said.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>California</strong>: The California Senate last week approved a measure that would guarantee<a href="https://www.ncadvertiser.com/news/article/California-Senate-OKs-bill-to-mail-ballots-for-15334334.php"> all registered voters get a ballot in the mail</a> before the November election. The bill would also extend the deadline for those ballots to make it back into the elections office to 20 days after the general election. The Senate passed the bill with a 31-7 vote. It still must be approved by the state Assembly before it can become law.</p>
<p>The San Diego city’s Rules Committee voted 3-2 to send a proposal to the full council to consider whether or not to put a measure on the ballot that would move city elections to<a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/ranked-choice-voting-ballot-measure-heads-for-full-council-vote"> ranked choice voting</a> system. The city would be required to also hold a voter awareness campaign to familiarize voters with the change.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5199" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia</strong>: Rep. Josh McLaurin (D-Sandy Springs), has introduced<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/bill-proposes-remaking-fulton-elections-board-after-litany-problems/iIupz4ujuBhiyWUhwwdgQP/"> two pieces of election reform legislation</a> that he hopes will address some of the problems encountered during the June 9 primary. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, under on proposal, the Fulton Board of Registration and Elections would be reborn on Aug. 1 — which would be during early voting for the Aug. 11 runoff. The board and the county’s elections department work together to plan the election, doing things as granular as select polling sites. McLaurin proposes evaluating the elections board chair every year, staggering the other four board member term limits, appointment power going back to the Fulton delegation instead of the Fulton Board of Commissioners.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong>: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed SB 1863 and HB 2238 into law to<a href="https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Pritzker-signs-vote-by-mail-legislation-15344460.php"> provide vote by mail applications to all recent voters</a> in Illinois. The legislation also expands early voting hours at permanent polling places, improves the signature verification process and makes election day a state holiday.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3569" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IowaStateHouse-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Iowa</strong>: Republicans in the legislature voted to<a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2020/06/14/unprecedented-ending-to-2020-iowa-legislative-session/"> cut the state budget for conducting elections</a> by a quarter of a million dollars and to force the state’s top election official to get permission from legislative leaders if he intends to send absentee ballot request forms to voters. GOP lawmakers also voted to create new voter verification steps for casting an absentee ballot. Senator Roby Smith, a Republican from Davenport, said if a ballot request form has the wrong voter ID number on it, a county auditor cannot use voter registration data to correct it and send a ballot out, but must contact the voter by phone, email or letter to verify the person is a qualified voter.</p>
<p>With bipartisan support the House amended an elections bill remove language that would<a href="https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/iowa-house-amends-controversial-election-bill-limiting-secretary-of-states-power"> prevent elections officials from sending mail-in ballot request forms</a> to all registered voters. Instead, the Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate is allowed to take such action, as he did this most recent primary amid the pandemic, if he gets approval from a cohort of lawmakers in both parties. The bill now says the secretary of state can make changes to the procedure of an election with approval from the Legislative Council and the proposal allows the council to proposal its own alternative or take no action.</p>
<p>The Senate adjourned without passing HJR14, a proposed amendment to<a href="https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Iowa-Senate-fails-to-pass-felon-voting-rights-amendment-571258111.html"> restore felon voting rights</a> in the state. According to the <em>Des Moines Register,</em> Senate Republicans declined to pass the measure, citing the belief Governor Kim Reynolds (R-IA) may sign an executive order immediately restoring voting eligibility for people with felony convictions after serving their sentence.</p>

S. 2755  would offer registered voters three options to cast a ballot: during extended early voting periods, voting in-person on election day, or voting-by-mail. Between early voting and vote-by-mail, the reforms could substantially reduce lines on Nov. 3 and increase interest in sometimes lower-turnout primary contests, supporters said.</p>

<p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: The Minnetonka City Council on June 8 adopted an ordinance to amend the city charter requiring the use of<a href="https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_sailor/community/minnetonka/ranked-choice-voting-moves-to-the-minnetonka-charter-commission-for-review/article_4937aa8a-af3b-11ea-8150-270d33b07e2f.html"> ranked-choice voting for municipal elections</a> and removes all references to primaries from the charter. The Charter Commission has now been tasked with further study of the ranked-choice voting amendment, which begins the process under state law. The commission needs at least 60 days, or until Aug. 7, to review a proposed amendment, though it could potentially take up to 150 days, or until Nov. 5, if more information is requested. After the study is completed, the council will decide if, when and how to put the issue on the ballot for voters to decide if they want the ranked-choice voting method.</p>

Roy Cooper signed into law on Friday legislation providing money to help run North Carolina<a href="https://www.thecoastlandtimes.com/2020/06/13/cooper-signs-bill-addressing-fall-election-under-covid-19/"> elections during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and making it easier to cast mail-in absentee ballots this fall. The House and Senate gave final legislative approval on Thursday to the bipartisan measure and sent it to Cooper’s desk. The measure is designed to prepare for a spike in demand for absentee ballots from people at higher risk of developing complications from the coronavirus. Voters would need only one witness signature on the envelope holding a completed ballot, not two.</p>

The state of Alaska had argued that the measure violated a constitutional requirement that ballot measures be limited to one subject. Backers of the initiative sued the state after the measure was rejected, and in October, Superior Court Judge Yvonne Lamoureaux ruled that all three components fall under the single subject of “election reform.”</p>

<p><strong>Alabama</strong>: In a 77-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Abdul Kallon<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-waives-vote-by-mail-rules-ahead-of-alabama-senate-runoff/"> waived some of the requirements to vote absentee</a> in Alabama ahead of the Republican runoff primary. “Because the plaintiffs have shown that the challenged laws will likely dissuade some citizens from voting … the court finds that the burdens imposed by the challenged election laws on voters at high risk of severe complications or death from Covid-19 are not justified by the state’s interests in enforcing the laws,” Kallon wrote. In the opinion, Kallon issued a preliminary injunction waiving the requirements that an Alabama voter seeking to cast a ballot by mail must submit a copy of their photo ID and have a notary or two witnesses sign the ballot. The injunction also prevents the state from shutting down attempts by county election officials to allow voters to drive up to a polling location and cast a ballot via “curbside voting” in next month’s runoff race. Secretary of State John Merrill has said he will<a href="https://www.wbrc.com/2020/06/16/al-sec-state-plans-appeal-ruling-that-would-loosen-absentee-ballot-restrictions/"> appeal</a> the ruling.</p>

The Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office has charged Canciamilla with 30 counts of perjury involving campaign disclosure statements and four counts of personal grand theft of campaign funds spent on a vacation in Asia, airfare, restaurants and other personal expenses. According to the complaint, Canciamilla illegally spent $261,800.68 of his campaign funds in all. The charges stem from conduct starting in 2010</p>

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday granted Gov. Ron DeSantis’ request to expedite the appeal. The Atlanta-based court also scheduled oral arguments in the case during the week of Aug. 10.

The motion said many voters won’t be notified whether their ballots were rejected until it’s too late. Counties are still counting tens of thousands of absentee ballots. The normal deadline to verify ballot discrepancies, such as signature mismatches or missing photo ID, is three days after Tuesday’s election. “Voters deserve to know that their vote is counted and have the chance to correct any errors,” said Democratic Party of Georgia Chairwoman Nikema Williams. “Georgians still don’t know whether their vote was counted in this primary.”</p>

Senate Bill 631, passed last month by Missouri’s GOP-dominated Legislature, expanded mail-in voting options and narrowed the legal grounds for the ACLU’s case. But Lakin argued it fell short of giving all Missourians concerned about Covid-19 to ability to submit an absentee ballot.</p>

The LWV and the state agreed to a<a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/agreement-new-jersey-lawsuit-will-establish-fair-ballot-signature-match?utm_source=PressRelease&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=06172020"> “notice and cure” process</a> for mail-in ballots for the July 7 primary. Voters who cast their ballot by mail will be notified of any issues and offered the option to fix the problem. The agreement only applies to the July 7 primary, not subsequent elections. Last month, Gov. Murphy announced that mail-in ballots would be sent to all registered voters in the Garden State. As a result, a surge in mail-in ballots is expected for the delayed primary, which means that a surge of ballots would be subject to a signature match. The agreement must still be accepted by the district court judge in Newark.</p>

<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: U.S. District Judge Peter Welte says he will not waive North Dakota’s ban on<a href="https://www.kxnet.com/news/state-news/judge-rejects-north-dakota-groups-call-for-online-petition-signatures/"> electronic signature gathering</a> for a group attempting to get a wide-ranging measure on the November ballot.  North Dakota Voters First asked to allow online signature gathering because of the coronavirus pandemic. The group argued that the COVID-19 outbreak “creates an environment that is impossible to comply” with the laws. In denying a motion for a preliminary injunction, Welte noted that the state did not issue a stay-at-home order and Gov. Doug Burgum on May 1 “revoked nearly all the previously imposed pandemic-related restrictions.”</p>

The move came after the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals declined Tuesday to reconsider its decision to block the campaigns from proceeding under less restrictive signature-gathering rules they&#8217;d been granted by a lower court. U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. set guidelines that would have allowed campaigns promoting minimum wage, voting rights and marijuana issues to collect signatures electronically. Sargus had also extended the deadline for submitting signatures by about a month, to July 31. But he stopped short of reducing the overall number of signatures Ohio requires.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle ordered<a href="https://apnews.com/7501631ba6e79ee48d04af8d9319abd0"> changes to the state absentee form</a> but stopped short of ordering sanctions against the state for not complying, citing tough budget times for the state during the pandemic. But she warned “there always is the specter of criminal contempt if after today’s orders there’s still noncompliance and there’s disobedience.” “Shame on you for not following that procedure and just taking matters into your own hands,” Lyle said at a hearing last week. “So, I’m calling the state out on that, for not adhering to the standards of legal process, and not adhering to the order.” In addition, the attorney general’s office has filed a motion seeking to<a href="https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Tennessee-officials-want-mail-voting-appeal-15341353.php"> fast-track</a> the appeal of Hobbs Lyle’s original ruling.</p>

Early voting for the July 14 primary runoff election begins June 29. Earlier this month, a panel of the 5th Circuit extended its block on a preliminary injunction by U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ordering that all state voters, regardless of age, qualify for mail-in ballots during the pandemic. Biery agreed with plaintiffs, including the Texas Democratic Party, that voters would face irreparable harm if existing age eligibility rules for voting by mail remain in place for elections held while the coronavirus remains in wide circulation. Under his order, voters under the age of 65 who would ordinarily not qualify for mail-in ballots would now be eligible. But after Attorney General Ken Paxton appealed that ruling, the 5th Circuit put it on hold</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has settled a yearlong debate over<a href="https://www.wvpublic.org/post/wva-supreme-court-votes-unanimously-harpers-ferry-count-votes-2019-municipal-election#stream/0"> four provisional ballots in Harpers Ferry</a>.  The state’s highest court voted unanimously on Monday for the Harpers Ferry Town Council to count four provisional ballots from last June’s municipal election. The council had thrown out those ballots over typographical errors. Secretary of State Mac Warner said he’s pleased the Supreme Court upheld state code that says technical errors shall be disregarded and the votes would be required to be counted.</p>

<p><a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/democracyworks/view/P_AAAAAAGAAFGOaKqIU0ChF9?trackingTag=electionLine">Research Fellow</a>, Democracy Works— The Research team collects and standardizes information on how voting works—how to register, how to vote, and when and where elections are happening. Streamlining democracy in this way requires quite a bit of knowledge: what form you use to register to vote in Wyoming, to whom you mail your absentee ballot application in Maine, and whether there’s an election taking place in Oklahoma RIGHT NOW (there probably is!). This information is used by various consumers, both internal and external. The Voting Information Project (VIP) coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally standardized information about where and how to vote—data that powers everything from Google’s polling place search to our text and email reminders to TurboVote users. As a part of the team, you will work with the Data Project Manager and Director of Election Research to conduct research outreach for the Voting Information Project, contacting thousands of state and local election officials. You will: Conduct phone and email outreach to local election administrators to get accurate, up-to-date information on elections; Compile the election information into a detailed spreadsheet; Perform quality assurance checks on the information to assure accuracy and completeness of the data; Research user-reported errors; and assist the election research team with other tasks, as they arise. <strong>Salary:</strong> $13,000 for 13 week fellowship (paid in semi-monthly installments). <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/democracyworks/view/P_AAAAAAGAAFGOaKqIU0ChF9?trackingTag=electionLine"> click here</a>.</p>
