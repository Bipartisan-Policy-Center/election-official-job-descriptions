</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study finds non-voters have less faith in electoral system</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5164" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.12.35-AM-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.12.35-AM-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.12.35-AM-787x1024.png 787w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.12.35-AM-768x999.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.12.35-AM.png 964w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" />As primary season heats up and voters cast their ballots during this presidential election year, the largest bloc of the electorate is a group of Americans that no politician has polled and who have seldom exercised their basic civic act – those who chronically do not vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to better understand citizens who don’t vote and the challenges of political engagement, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation today released a landmark study that looks at the 100 million Americans who are eligible to vote but don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of its kind, the study,</span><a href="https://knightfoundation.org/reports/the-100-million-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The 100 Million Project: The Untold Story of American Non-Voters,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examines 12,000 people who chronically do not vote – those who are not registered to vote or voted only once in the last six national elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study examined non-voters throughout the country and across the political spectrum, at every level of education and income, and from every walk of life in terms of age, race, gender and religious affiliation, with separate samples in key battleground states. For comparative purposes, 1,000 active voters and 1,000 18- to 24-year-old eligible citizens were also surveyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study busts commonly held myths about non-voters and provides insights on why they don’t vote, their positions on platform issues and President Trump, and how they engage with news and politics. The findings reveal important insights on non-voters and factors behind their disengagement:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-voters have less faith in the electoral system than voters. Non-voters say they don’t vote for many reasons, including not liking the candidates and feeling their vote doesn’t matter. Compared with voters, they have less faith in the electoral system, don’t feel they have enough information, and are less likely to think increased participation in elections is good for the country. They are more likely to think “the system is rigged.”</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splitting the vote in 2020. If non-voters all turned out in 2020, non-voter candidate preferences show they would add nearly equal share to Democratic and Republican candidates (33 percent versus 30 percent, respectively), while 18 percent said they would vote for a third party.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evenly divided on Trump. They are more evenly divided on current political issues and President Trump than previously thought. Fifty-one percent have a negative opinion of Trump, versus 40 percent positive. While non-voters skew center-left on some key issues like health care, they are slightly more conservative than active voters on immigration and abortion.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-voters are less engaged with news and information. They consume less news, are more likely to accidentally “bump into” news rather than seeking it out actively, and more likely to say they don’t feel informed enough to decide who to vote for.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible Gen Z voters say they are less interested in politics and 2020 election than non-voters. Americans aged 18 to 24 are less interested in politics and less informed. They are the age cohort least likely to say they will vote in 2020, and 38 percent say they don’t have enough information to decide who to vote for.</span></li>
</ul>

We shouldn’t judge them; we should understand them,” said</span><a href="https://knightfoundation.org/employee/sam-gill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sam Gill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, senior vice president and chief program officer at Knight Foundation. “This study brings us face to face — for the first time — with those who feel disconnected from our political process. If we care about the future of our democracy, we have an obligation to better understand our friends, neighbors and family members who choose to sit out elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This national survey was conducted from July to August 2019. A representative sample of both registered and unregistered non-voters (4,000 total) was drawn and voting history verified using voter file data. A separate sample of 800 swing state non-voters — 8,000 total in each of 10 battleground states — was surveyed in Wisconsin, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Minnesota, Michigan, Georgia, Florida and Arizona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys and focus groups were conducted by the political polling firm Bendixen Amandi in collaboration with political scientists Yanna Krupnikov from Stony Brook University and Eitan Hersh from Tufts University. It is the largest survey of non-voters that has been conducted and provides the only reliable national dataset about non-voter political views, top issues and challenges with voting.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5166 alignnone" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.13.45-AM.png" alt="" width="876" height="256" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.13.45-AM.png 876w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.13.45-AM-300x88.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.13.45-AM-768x224.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study defines “non-voters” as those who have participated in one or fewer of the past six national elections, meaning they have voted a maximum of only once in the past 12 years. It found that non-voters are less educated, poorer, and more likely to be minorities, single and women. Sixty-two percent do not have a college degree, and 20 to 25 percent make less than $50,000 annually. Sixty-five percent are white – versus 15 percent Hispanic and 13 percent black – and 53 percent are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Non-voters are split down the middle, adding nearly equal shares to both the Democrats and Republicans. This sets up a scenario for 2020 in which the side that’s more effective at getting out the vote – and crucially turning out new voters – is likely to have the advantage in November,” Hersh said. “There are constituencies on both sides waiting to be activated.”</span></p>

According to the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>, the state’s</span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/02/18/wisconsin-primary-election-myvote-website-not-working-properly/4793723002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MyVote website experienced intermittent delays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the morning and afternoon and the site was unable to tell voters where their polling place was or what was on the ballot.

In the opinion piece, Barr, Wray et al urged the public to do their part to secure the 2020 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <em>The Hill,</em> the writers</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/19/protect-our-elections-attorney-general-barr-fbi-director-wray-column/4779980002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called on the public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist in identifying foreign interference, including through “seeking trustworthy sources of information” on elections to avoid disinformation campaigns, and through engaging with state and local election officials to learn more about the secure voting process. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5175" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-20-at-11.40.24-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also encouraged campaigns, technology companies and election officials to report any signs of hacking or other suspicious online activity around elections to the FBI and to CISA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot prevent all disinformation, foreign propaganda or cyberattacks on our infrastructure,” the officials wrote. “However, together, we can all help to mitigate these threats by exercising care when we share information and by maintaining good cyber hygiene to reduce the risks that malicious cyberattacks will succeed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3745" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MNCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Minnesota</strong>: According to the <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em>, lawmakers are again</span><a href="http://www.startribune.com/minn-lawmakers-set-for-round-two-of-debate-over-election-security-funding/567949122/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set to debate federal election security funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is $7.4 in HAVA2 funding available to the state, but Senate Republicans want to tie that funding to a provisional balloting system that Senate Dems oppose. Under a new GOP bill, election officials must provide provisional ballots to voters who cannot verify their eligibility. That differs from existing law, under which voters are given regular ballots which can be counted unless otherwise successfully challenged.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Well this is some good news.</strong> According to a new PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist poll, 72 percent of Americans said they are</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/despite-iowa-missteps-most-americans-not-worried-about-election-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> confident that their state and local election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be fair and accurate this November. According to the poll, when asked about their confidence in election security, political affiliation did not seem to factor significantly in how respondents answered. Democrats, Republicans and independents responded to the question roughly the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4166" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />The California Assembly has passed, and</strong> Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law a bill that will allow voters to change their party preference and update their addresses at the polls when they go to vote. While this is great for voters and local elections officials are hopeful it will speed up the process at the polling place, they are also</span><a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/02/19/california-made-it-easier-for-voters-to-switch-parties-but-retraining-election-staff-could-pose-challenges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerned about the learning curve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for elections workers. “We’re hoping this new process will keep already-registered voters who are just changing their address or party in a faster-moving line,” John Tuteur, registrar of voters in Napa County told Capital Public Radio. “The challenge is for us to get our vote center workers who are going to be handling these changes up to speed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lost in the mail:</strong> Earlier this year, Solon High School in Cuyahoga County, Ohio held a voter registration drive but it seems that all 220 voter registration forms the school sent to the board of elections for processing have been</span><a href="https://fox8.com/news/200-voter-registration-forms-from-solon-high-school-go-missing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost in the mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this week marking the voter registration deadline for Ohio, the school said it would hand deliver any voter applications received directly to the BOE and it is also encouraging students to register online. According to Fox 8, the U.S. Postal Service and the BOE are investigating the missing package.</span></p>

The Benjamin Harrison Site will also host another special exhibit that concentrates solely on what it took to get women the right to vote. It’s called</span><a href="https://bhpsite.org/visit/exhibits/votesforwomen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Votes for Women: The Road to Suffrage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

According to a press release, by joining Time to Vote, CEOs and business owners commit to making accommodations for workers that help enable them to vote, such as paid time off on Election Day, making Election Day a day without meetings or providing resources for mail-in ballots and early voting. Time to Vote is nonpartisan and there is no cost for companies to join. To date, 383 companies employing workers in every state in the country have signed up for Time to Vote. The companies range from Walmart and Target to JPMorgan Chase to Kaiser Permanente.</span></p>

We have to dream big, but we have to be prepared to know that we&#8217;re being stepped upon — but to also continue to have these dreams.&#8221; The League of Women Voters will have voter registration tables set up at every Project 19 performance.</span></p>

While it is legal to post your ballot, the code does still prohibit showing that picture to anyone while within 200 feet of a polling location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Alaska, the House has approved House Bill 115 that will allow all eligible voters to sign up for a</span><a href="https://www.ktva.com/story/41698724/bill-opens-absentee-voting-by-mail-list"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permanent absentee voter list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill was approved 24-15. “Exercising the right to vote is key to a strong democracy,&#8221; Rep. Chris Tuck (D-Anchorage) wrote in a release. &#8220;House Bill 115 removes barriers to this right by making it more convenient to vote by mail in Alaska. Absentee voting is voting by mail. By simply adding a box to check on the absentee ballot application, Alaskans can routinely vote by mail, resulting in more participation and a stronger democracy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arizona:</strong> Debate over House Bill 2304 devolved into a shouting match this week in the House Elections Committee. Under House Bill 2304, voters would not be allowed to bring</span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2020/02/19/arizona-bill-change-voting-law-leads-shouting-match-hearing/4802950002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> translators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with them into the voting booth. The bill would also require regular checks of voter registration records against lists of jurors who had been disqualified for citizenship reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has signed Senate Bill 207 into law. Under the new law, which takes effect immediately, voters are able to</span><a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/02/14/new-california-law-aims-to-make-it-faster-for-voters-to-update-registration-on-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make last-minute changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their address or party affiliation. The new law allows those already registered to bypass filling out the full voter reg form and can instead fill out a shorter update form at the polls during early voting and on election day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Illinois:</strong> Under House Bill 5309, filed this week, voters would decide whether or not to</span><a href="https://www.commercial-news.com/news/house-bill-to-bring-question-to-voters-on-eliminating-danville/article_ca64c8de-5286-11ea-b73c-eb4afd2562fa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> merge the Danville election commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Vermillion County clerk’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Iowa:</strong> A Senate committee has approved a bill that would require returning citizens to prove they’ve repaid restitution to victims before their</span><a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2020/02/20/iowa-senate-panel-proposes-restrictions-on-felon-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting rights are restored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill, if approved by the full Legislature, would only take effect if voters in Iowa approve an amendment to a state constitution that will automatically restore voting rights to returning citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> The Senate has approved Senate Bill 62 that would</span><a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/politics/proposed-bill-to-restore-voting-rights-to-felons-headed-to-general-assembly/417-6a51a60a-1730-4227-b424-5e77979d4d24"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restore the right to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for formerly incarcerated residents after a designated amount of time.

And then, pull it out of it, and then be able to take the perf off with the number on it so that it can be accounted for? I think it will have substantial savings that will really make a difference,” said Sen. Ruth Johnson. The bills would also allow</span><a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/bills-targeting-absentee-ballot-processing-move-senate-floor"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counters and election inspectors to work in shifts. However, on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/19/shirkey-delays-michigan-election-results-better-than-early-vote-counting/4806493002/">put an end</a> to discussion on bills that might change the absentee voting process saying that security takes precedent over timeliness. &#8220;If I had to choose between early voting, early counting, versus late reporting, I&#8217;ll take late reporting all day long,&#8221; he said according to <em>The Detroit News. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Michigan, a bill sponsored by Re. Darrin Camilleri (D-Brownstown) would make regularly scheduled election days in May, August and November</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/02/michigan-secretary-of-state-urges-businesses-to-give-employees-election-day-off.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state holidays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think that we want to make it as broad as possible, as easy as possible for people to participate in our elections,” Camilleri told Michigan Live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> Under HB 1639 voters would be required to</span><a href="https://fox2now.com/2020/02/19/changes-to-the-missouri-primary-and-petition-initiative-process-proposed-by-lawmakers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> declare a party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weeks before a primary election. Rick Watson, president of the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities, testified against the bill. He said election officials are busy enough keeping track of current voter registration. “This will just add one more layer of expensive and unnecessary expenses,” Watson told lawmakers according to Fox 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> A bill that would classify party preference information as</span><a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/ballot-privacy-bill-clears-first-hurdle/89-4d3ee5bd-6ba6-4641-8d66-dd5c8d9beba2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> private data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on voter registration forms has cleared the House Government Operations Committee. The will would also penalize political parties if they sell the information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Lawmakers are considering legislation that could increase the</span><a href="https://www.wbtw.com/home/south-carolina-lawmakers-look-at-poll-worker-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> salaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for poll workers. The proposed legislation would create a committee to review the state’s poll worker salary and compare it to the salaries for poll workers in other jurisdictions before making a recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3859" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TN-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Tennessee:</strong> Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would require the state to offer voluntary training on</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/02/19/us/ap-us-voter-registration-tennessee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laws and require voter registration applications be submitted within 15 days of a voter registration drive. The measure would then prohibit the retention of voter information for non-political purposes, as well as require “cybersecurity to be considered” when certifying a voter registration system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utah:</strong> Legislators are considering a bill that would require state elections officials to explore statewide use of</span><a href="https://statescoop.com/utah-bill-looks-at-taking-mobile-voting-statewide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile-voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the software that is in use for certain voters in Utah County. The bill would order Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox to carry out a study “related to internet voting” and whether allowing it statewide would increase overall voter turnout. It also directs the study look into distributed-ledger encryption and multi-factor authentication, and evaluate existing vendors like Voatz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington:</strong> Senate Bill 6688 has been introduced in the Senate State Government, Tribal Relations &amp; Elections Committee. The bill would require certain counties, cities and towns to</span><a href="https://washingtonstatewire.com/voting-rights-bill-introduced-in-sessions-fourth-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get preclearance from the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to utilize new voting qualifications or other voting practices. The jurisdictions in question would have to prove in court that any new voting prerequisite, standard or practice does not deny anybody the right to vote or create a barrier to voting. The attorney general would also have to approve the new practice before it is instituted. Additionally, the attorney general would also be required to raise an objection in superior court if the new voting prerequisite is found to hinder someone’s right to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that would have</span><a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/feb/19/bill-to-allow-felons-to-get-voting-rights-back-soo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restored to voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to returning citizens as soon as they are released from incarceration even if the terms of their sentence were not complete was deferred this week meaning that it can’t be brought up again this session.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, Sen.

The state division of elections alleges the proposed initiative, which would, among other things, legalize ranked choice voting, has three parts which violates the state’s single subject rule for initiatives.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> Norman Hill, 62 of Los Angeles County, has</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-gets-1-year-los-angeles-skid-row-voter-fraud-n1139221"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plead guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to one count of circulating a petition with false names. Hill is one of nine people that’s been charged in a voter fraud scheme that had homeless people in Los Angeles’ Skid Row receiving cash and cigarettes in exchange for fraudulent signatures on ballot initiative petitions and voter registration forms. Hall was sentenced to three years of probation of 100 hours of community service.</span></p>

Although the ruling applied only to 17 felons who sued the state, supporters of Amendment 4 view the ruling as a victory for all returning citizens in the Sunshine State. “This ruling recognizes the gravity of elected officials trying to circumvent Amendment 4 to create roadblocks to voting based on wealth,” said Julie Ebenstein, one of the lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union representing several plaintiffs, in a statement according to <em>The Miami Herald</em>. In their opinion, judges Lanier Anderson, Stanley Marcus and Barbara Rothstein added that it was “undeniable” that the requirement punished poor felons, while wealthier felons wouldn’t be similarly denied the opportunity to vote because they can afford to pay their obligations.</span></p>

She also testified that certification of the ExpressVote XL touchscreen system had been well underway during talks to settle the lawsuit.</span></p>
