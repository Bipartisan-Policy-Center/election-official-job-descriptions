<em>CISA/EAC release new Election Risk Profile Tool</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>With less than two months to go until the November 3, 2020 general election state and local elections officials are up to their eyeballs in absentee ballot requests, fighting disinformation, media calls, poll worker recruitment and training, ballot proofing, and all the millions of other tasks that come with administering any election.</p>
<p>While election security has taken a backseat in the headlines, it is still front and center in the elections world and the <a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=zvQoTklr3wz9Xp3-2FnpJk3AgXbXcWAbif7JHTicd1Snw-3Da0g4_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpSvQ3c-2FG-2BFAk4J7QDF96sPxVrZn0G1qC0EW1Lfubf9c7DCoyuiyNGFxSYCD72dbGYBP2oO-2BBjhxpRyoUJL-2FJDnX2pr7QhRdBgIL9osdnU5UNt3bWEi5PgAxCSx7SKelqEPyZeqwqjsfmdTMHTjXUnHQMwv0a0dI6sBEVKCGWn9fReMHzk3pVG1KfiyqEUgluRb8tZDamD9oxEDvXHMswB49ZKFvM3pQpbbLBpCXIDKyDGky5kZCbD7WfegEdyhtKbkJmpfy6pv6YTJZKgAZnC6w-3D-3D">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA), in partnership with the<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDo9ohe8YZMjEki-2F7XyWwJIsk-3DSBp4_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpSvQ3c-2FG-2BFAk4J7QDF96sPxVrZn0G1qC0EW1Lfubf9c7DCoyuiyNGFxSYCD72dbGYBP2oO-2BBjhxpRyoUJL-2FJDnX2pr7QhRdBgIL9osdnU5UOuN7ec4VtVMfov0CP0oEOK7d40vlCTUHFa85i-2FUIeDCKT7vKV8w9-2FqygWXY3j1G314rZ7QbuSCihQDkf-2B00BXFo1Tu34l06ggvb6zNPiezygvyTE9-2BiVXQv3BzYdnLc8IzmGOOax4eR3OtjZLAr87lY2q3LLDNzLqDzAkuQRJylw-3D-3D"> Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC), have released the<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDo7IHZKsz-2BRnOVJdBhDZY2QUhbR74OK4Bl6fAaW3QCxdtQVls_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpSvQ3c-2FG-2BFAk4J7QDF96sPxVrZn0G1qC0EW1Lfubf9c7DCoyuiyNGFxSYCD72dbGYBP2oO-2BBjhxpRyoUJL-2FJDnX2pr7QhRdBgIL9osdnU5UN3-2BLTGypVzZeMY7mV8SI11pJuTsQp3IeKNS4srx0EosWwNo1U6X-2F-2FogPYBr8LSf-2F08OuSwEA7WWNbILAYZdrgaA2Six3v-2F8DdcER5ObThTpeCQ0CcrN-2Bm1SipSTNkDI5Yisp8JClXf-2FPMltpYPd1TOLmJAWrQirjzBMJus2oYEuw-3D-3D"> Election Risk Profile Tool</a>, a user-friendly assessment tool to equip election officials and federal agencies in prioritizing and managing cybersecurity risks to the Election Infrastructure Subsector.</p>
<p>The new tool is designed to help state and local election officials understand the range of risks they face and how to prioritize mitigation efforts. It also addresses areas of greatest risk, ensures technical cybersecurity assessments and services are meeting critical needs, and provides a sound analytic foundation for managing election security risk with partners at the federal, state and local level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5192" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Krebs-242x300.png" alt="" width="242" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Krebs-242x300.png 242w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Krebs.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" />“There is no question the security of our election systems has vastly improved, thanks in large part to our election officials’ capability to understand where the risks lie in their systems and determine the most effective way to manage those risks,” said CISA Director Christopher Krebs. “Together with our partners at the EAC, we are constantly looking for ways to make the process of mapping out these risks easier and widely available for all of our partners. This is yet another tool to help support election officials to protect the 2020 elections and beyond.”</p>
<p>The reports can be used on their own to identify risks, understand mitigative measures, and identify resources for building resilience on specific election technologies and processes. Election officials can also use it in conjunction with the Election Infrastructure Cyber Risk Assessment and Infographic to build a thorough understanding on the cyber risk to the broader election infrastructure. This will allow elections officials to prioritize their limited resources on those that pose the greatest risk and to go to the policymakers and those that control budgets to request additional resources to address the others.</p>
<p>“Election officials are natural risk managers. This tool provides them with key information they need to understand and address potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses,” explained Ryan Macias election security expert, Lafayette Group, Inc., providing support to CISA. “As importantly, it equips them with a list of questions that enables them to work with their IT and cybersecurity professionals to manage risks identified by the tool.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The tool is designed to be quick and easy for election officials to use. By working with IT and cybersecurity personnel who are familiar with the election infrastructure (i.e., staff, county IT, vendors/service providers, etc.), each of the ten election systems or processes within the tool can be completed in a few minutes (~5-10 mins each).</p>
<p>“The EAC has worked to expand our cybersecurity resources for election officials and the Risk Profile Tool serves as an important security enhancement for network protection,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “As federal partners, CISA and the EAC are committed to providing useful tools to assist election officials as they run secure, accessible and accurate elections.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Election Risk Profile Tool:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is a user-friendly assessment tool for state and local election officials to develop a high-level risk profile across a jurisdiction’s specific infrastructure components;</li>
<li>Provides election officials a method to gain insights into their cybersecurity risk and prioritize mitigations;</li>
<li>Accepts inputs of a jurisdiction’s specific election infrastructure configuration; and</li>
<li>Outputs a tailored risk profile for jurisdictions, which identifies specific areas of highest risk and recommends associated mitigation measures that the jurisdiction could implement to address the risk areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CIOs of several states, including Colorado, Ohio and West Virginia participated in some of early testing of the new assessment tool.</p>
<p>This tool arms election officials with a report on the things they are doing to protect their systems in non-technical and easy to understand format. The report provides mitigations for the non-cybersecurity professionals to understand. This allows election officials to take the report to policymakers, budgets holders, as well as voters to show what has been done, but also what more can be done to build resilience in the election infrastructure.</p>
<p>“This can help provide localized, customized guidance to jurisdictions about their risk profile, help them set their priorities, and direct them to services available from CISA that can help them reduce their risk,” said Trevor Timmons, chief information officer with the<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado Secretary of State’s Office</a>. “The goal, as I understand it, is to help election officials assess their risks without requiring them to be expert cybersecurity assessors and analysts.”</p>
<p>While taking on anything new at all right now might seem like a challenge for local elections officials, David Tackett,  chief information officer and director of the information technology division for the<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office</a> believes “…even one soul saved makes the sermon worthwhile.”</p>
<p>“In any industry or exercise, most would agree it is easier to expend preventive energy than to conduct a necessary post-mortem when an incident occurs. Any security posture should include adoption, testing, and revision. Somewhere in that cycle of self-assessment, improvements are found and mistakes avoided,” said Tackett. “In my limited test drive of the product, it is apparent that having all subject matter experts from each component area available to help answer is vital to making it a less time-consuming. Even if only basic mitigation steps can be taken, that could be enough to prevent a serious disruption.”</p>
<p>Timmons noted that whether or not an LEO could take on the risk assessment tool right now is really going to depend on the size of the jurisdiction and their depth of resources. If a local has dedicated IT or cybersecurity staff, it is possible they could use the tool to help inform their forward planning.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure who it was that initially coined the phrase “elections is like a marathon race without a finish line”, but it is apropos,” Timmons said. “Even if/when officials decide they do not have the capacity to use the tool today or in the next several weeks, it is a certainty that we will be running elections next year and the year after that… we will always be looking for risks, prioritizing them for action, and trying to improve our operations.”</p>
<p>This tool is funded through CISA’s National Risk Management Center’s Tech Transfer, which allows Federal investments to be used by partners to implement risk management programs. The tool is available on the EAC <a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=zvQoTklr3wz9Xp3-2FnpJk3NmSD4i4oJK7zB0oiPvTX-2F3a-2FlQTL3S-2BrXAQ1Fed84ZenNhQ_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpSvQ3c-2FG-2BFAk4J7QDF96sPxVrZn0G1qC0EW1Lfubf9c7DCoyuiyNGFxSYCD72dbGYBP2oO-2BBjhxpRyoUJL-2FJDnX2pr7QhRdBgIL9osdnU5UNcnZv4tmbj9xyWqVWD-2BQzBOSwhSEEWMGaYsfF3f9MQElads3gTG9nDZYpTCT3BhbB9IyQ9LzquGLZ19AyZbeaSKVokUsZmHhy2Uttx7FAJ753KMfRbUg0RWqOlZ58Qro2c5A81kkKl4nLyqJpOmSmu7A6AFCN-2Bot5L2Uuxu2wt5A-3D-3D">website</a>.

<p><strong>Additional Resources from the EAC</strong><b><br />
</b>The EAC is also set to release presentations and white papers to help state and local election officials navigate the creation of cybersecurity risk and crisis management plans. The materials aim to integrate the various tools and services that exist from federal and private partners within the election infrastructure sector.</p>
<p>These cybersecurity risk management modules describe best practice processes election officials can use to identify, prioritize, and mitigate risks to their election infrastructure assets. As part of the module, the related white paper describes using the Election System Risk Profile Tool or ESRPT to analyze the likelihood and consequences of identified risks. The election risk assessment tool created by CISA and hosted by the EAC utilizes the same methodologies in a user-friendly and automated manner to report risks using the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability or CIA triad and is backed by information collected from election security subject matter experts.</p>

							<h2>Safe Election Administration Grants</h2>
														<p><strong>CTCL issues open call for grants aimed at safe election administration during COVID-19</strong><br />
<em>Project will support poll worker training and recruitment, PPE for poll workers, early voting, and vote by mail</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5301" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png 526w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Backed by a<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/open-call/"> generous $250M contribution</a>, the nonpartisan Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), has announced a grant program to help local election officials administer elections this year in the midst of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The grants will help ensure the local election jurisdictions across the country have the staffing, training, and equipment necessary so this November every eligible voter can participate in a safe and timely way and have their vote counted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all depend on election officials to provide safe and secure voting options to the public. Unfortunately, election departments face unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to COVID-19”, said Center for Tech and Civic Life Executive Director Tiana Epps-Johnson. &#8220;This expansion of our COVID-19 Response Grant program provides our country&#8217;s election officials and poll workers with the critical resources they need to safely serve every voter&#8221;.</p>
<p>The minimum any local jurisdiction can receive is $5,000. The open call, along with additional information and the application can be found at<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/grants/"> https://www.techandciviclife.org/grants/</a></p>
<p>This grant program will enable localities to prepare for and administer safe elections by investing in priorities that would otherwise be challenging to accomplish &#8212; such as securely opening an adequate number of voting sites; setting up drive-thru and drop box locations; providing PPE for poll workers; and recruiting and training a sufficient number of poll workers.</p>
<p>Election offices can use the funds to cover certain 2020 expenses incurred between June 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020. These include the costs associated with the safe administration of the following election responsibilities. Program areas include:</p>
<p><strong>Ensure Safe, Efficient Election Day Administration</strong></p>

							<h2>Stewards of Democracy, Part II</h2>
														<p><strong>Stewards of Democracy, Part II</strong><br />
<em>The professional experience of America’s LEOs</em></p>
<p>By Paul Gronke and Jay Lee<br />
Early Voting Information Center at Reed College</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I think everyone knows that we won&#8217;t let the election fail &#8211; we will work ourselves to death before we let that happen.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8211;LEO from Midatlantic, Female, 50-64 years old, college degree, jurisdiction has between 25,001-100,000 registered voters</p>
<p>While they have a unique and valuable responsibility as<a href="https://democracyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2019_DemocracyFund_StewardsOfDemocracy.pdf"> &#8220;stewards of democracy&#8221;</a>, LEOs across the country are also career civil servants and elected officials working to implement a set of laws, administrative rules, and practices that are mostly assigned to them by state legislatures, state election directors, and county boards.</p>
<p>As we wrote<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/09-03/"> last week</a>, many LEOs are Clerks and Recorders with several responsibilities in addition to running elections. Their pay, opportunities for training, and years of experience vary substantially across states and local jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In this week’s post, we focus on the election official as a <strong>career path</strong>, with special attention given to the nature of the work environment, professional reward structure, and how LEOs feel about the &#8220;professional ethos&#8221; of local election administration.</p>
<p><strong>Day to Day</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6029" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.1-1024x726.png" alt="" width="640" height="454" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.1-1024x726.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.1-300x213.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.1-768x544.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.1.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The vast majority of LEOs serve in small jurisdictions – almost half work with under 3,000 registered voters. Most <strong>voters</strong> will have a LEO who works with lots of voters, but most <strong>LEOs</strong> do not.</p>
<p>We call this the “75:10” issue in election administration – 75% of LEOs serve just 10% of the electorate, while the other 10% of LEOs serve 75% of the electorate. This means that talking about the “average American LEO” and the “average voting experience provided by a LEO” are two very different things.</p>
<p>The <strong>average LEO</strong> is unlikely to have a large staff (or any staff at all). More than half of jurisdictions under 5,000 registered voters only have the LEO working on elections, with no additional staff (aside from seasonal poll workers, potentially). In jurisdictions greater than 250,000 registered voters, to contrast, over 75% of offices have more than 10 full-time staff members working on elections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6030" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.2.png" alt="" width="1014" height="728" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.2.png 1014w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.2-300x215.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.2-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" />This means that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the average LEO</span> may not do their own hiring, control over contracting and transportation, or their own IT staff. They are partners—or captives—of other parts of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We reported last week that only 17% of LEOs told us that elections took up &#8220;all or almost all&#8221; of their responsibilities, with over 60% saying it was &#8220;less than half&#8221; of their workload.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when we asked respondents to share what tasks they were responsible for as local election officials, most LEOs are responsible for most elections-related duties. From our list below, ordered by frequency of response, over 85% are responsible for counting ballots (86.8%) through voter registration (94.9%).</p>
<ul>
<li>Voter registration</li>
<li>Early voting (including absentee ballots)</li>
<li>Recruiting and managing poll workers</li>
<li>Election Day voting</li>
<li>Managing polling places</li>
<li>Counting ballots</li>
<li>Voter roll maintenance</li>
<li>Election recounts and audits</li>
<li>Canvassing and certifying the election</li>
<li>Selecting voting equipment</li>
<li>Designing and printing ballots</li>
</ul>
<p>Four tasks stand out as more common for larger jurisdictions when compared to smaller ones: recounts and audits; canvassing and certifying; selecting voting equipment; and design and printing of ballots. Less than half of the smallest jurisdictions (0-5,000 registered voters) told us that they selected equipment or designed and printed ballots. Most of these jurisdictions are township-level LEOs, and the tasks are carried out by county- or state-level administrators.</p>
<p><strong>Experience<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/26/782680291/as-2020-approaches-some-experienced-election-officials-head-to-the-exits">Concerns have been raised</a> that declining public trust and the demands of a polarized political environment may cause a wave of LEO retirements.  While this may yet occur, our data show that LEOs overall have extensive experience running elections. Twenty-percent have been administering elections at the LEO level since 2000 or earlier. At the same time, 20% have started their position since 2016, and 2020 will be their first presidential election.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6031" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.3.png" alt="" width="1040" height="836" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.3.png 1040w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.3-300x241.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.3-1024x823.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO2.3-768x617.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" /><strong>Job Satisfaction and Pay</strong><br />
Something must be keeping these LEOs on the job, and we hoped to learn more about this in the 2019 survey. Overall, we found a high level of satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment in their work. This is the good news.</p>
<p>More worrisome is that many LEOs, especially those in larger jurisdictions, reported tensions in their work-life balance.  Smaller jurisdictions told us that they were burdened by multiple demands on time and resources (recall that the smaller jurisdictions are the ones where LEOs are juggling responsibilities).</p>
<p>A quote from one LEO illustrates the difficult balancing act:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have many responsibilities other than elections. I also contract with other entities for their elections, so especially in even years, I feel like I am constantly doing elections and my regular duties suffer. I honestly wish that it would be mandatory to have an Election Administrator, someone that does only elections and voter registration.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>What about pay?  In 2019, 57% of LEOs in the smallest jurisdictions (under 5,000 registered voters) were paid less than $35,000 annually. By contrast, 78% of LEOs serving in the largest jurisdictions (over 250,000) reported pay of $100,000 or more. Among LEOs, men are more likely than women to have higher salaries.</p>
<p>But pay doesn’t seem to be a significant pain point. When asked, most LEOs in our survey expressed satisfaction with their pay, more so in the largest jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Despite general levels of satisfaction with the work and pay, it’s revealing that fewer than 40% of LEOs say that they would encourage their children to pursue a career in election administration.</p>
<p>The pinch points we have uncovered here &#8211; decisions made at other levels of government without sufficient consultation, and lack of sufficient budgets &#8211; are well-recognized in the election administration community.</p>
<p>Much more work needs to be done to understand recruitment and retention of America’s stewards of democracy. If, as is likely, we see another wave of retirements after the 2020 election, where will the next generation of administrators come from?</p>

							<h2>2020 Election Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6021" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />New Hampshire</strong>: While the Granite State holds the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, it holds one of the last-in-the-nation primaries to determine what, besides the presidential contest, goes on the November ballot. While thousands of voters chose to vote by mail, some did show up at the polls on Tuesday. Overall it went well, but it was not without problems. In<a href="https://www.fosters.com/news/20200908/portsmouth-police-called-for-maskless-voters"> Portsmouth</a>, the police were called when voters—including a 91-year-old—refused to wear a mask. Voters were required to wear a mask or cast a ballot outdoors. Dover, Rochester, Somersworth, Durham and Barrington officials reported mid-afternoon that there had been no conflicts with maskless voters. Officials in those communities said compliance with outdoor voting was successful. While Portsmouth dealt with maskless voters, in<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/09/topless-woman-votes-new-hampshire/5765056002/"> Exeter</a> it was topless voters. After being told she could not wear a t-shirt that featured the president on it, a woman removed her shirt and voted topless. Exeter Town Moderator Paul Scafidi said the woman asked him if he wanted her to take her shirt off, despite not wearing anything underneath. “I said, I’d rather she not,” Scafidi told the <em>Portsmouth Herald</em>. “But she took it off so fast, no one had time to react so the whole place just went, ‘Woah,’ and she walked away, and I let her vote. She could’ve just gone into the hallway and turned it inside-out.” In Manchester, it all seemed to go smoothly, if a bit slow, at the polls. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit slow turnout, but everybody seems very happy and social distancing, so it&#8217;s great,&#8221; Sharyn Kelley, the moderator at<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-september-primary-day-voting-2020/33949177"> Manchester</a> Ward 1, told WMUR. &#8220;Everybody gets individual pens. They got little place mats to put down on the booth so that nobody is touching any surface,&#8221; Kelley said. Kelley said that everyone is cooperating, practicing social distancing and so far Tuesday, things have gone smoothly. Although overall turnout in<a href="https://patch.com/new-hampshire/concord-nh/busy-day-concord-polls-despite-new-coronavirus-pandemic"> Concord</a> was up, it was mostly by mail. In<a href="https://www.fosters.com/news/20200908/voting-during-pandemic-herersquos-how-it-worked"> Durham</a> the town was able to gather enough poll workers to accommodate voters but Durham Town Administrator Todd Selig said they would definitely need more for November. In the<a href="https://www.conwaydailysun.com/berlin_sun/news/local/election-day-like-no-other-in-androscoggin-valley/article_ba6b0494-f2da-11ea-aaa9-470995bbd833.html"> Androscoggin Valley</a>, clerks reported unusually high numbers of people voting by absentee ballot with fears of the COVID-19 changing voting patterns. In Berlin, 368 chose to vote by absentee ballot in the safety of their residences or 23 percent of those voting. In a normal election, City Clerk Shelli Fortin said the city would handle about 600 absentee ballots. The number was similar in Gorham where 125 out of 572 votes were by absentee ballot. Voter turnout was up 159 percent compared to the 2016 state primaries, and absentee ballots comprised about a third of all votes in the<a href="https://www.ledgertranscript.com/Increase-in-absentee-ballots-among-COVID-19-changes-at-the-polls-36144517"> Monadnock region</a> this year, up from just 4.7 percent in 2016. Democrats used absentee ballots at substantially higher rates than Republican voters.Secretary of State Bill Gardner said he was not surprised the election had gone smoothly as local officials have been getting ready since April. &#8220;They&#8217;re prepared for it and it will be a good preparation for November,&#8221; Gardner said.</p>

In 2016, the board received a total of 3,626 mail ballots. Of course that doesn’t mean people didn’t show up at the polls on Tuesday either because according to early numbers, about 45,00 people went to the polls on<a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/more-than-33000-rhode-islanders-voted-by-mail-45000-voted-in-person-in-state-primary"> primary day</a> and 7,000 people voted early in-person. For those that did show up for in-person voting, lines were few and there was plenty of space to move about. Besides the masks and other health precautions, the day seemed like a normal voting day in<a href="https://warwickpost.com/warwick-2020-primary-voters-poll-workers-masked-careful/"> Warwick</a>, said Moderator Phil Page. Also, he said, “Everyone’s been very courteous.” In<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200909/equipment-failure-has-thus-far-kept-votes-from-being-counted-in-pawtucket-precinct"> Pawtucket</a>, the issues arose after the ballots were cast. The board of elections voted to “refeed″ ballots cast at 62 Lincoln Ave. in Pawtucket on primary day because the machine failed to record many if not all of the votes. The failure was blamed on a faulty USB drive.</p>

LaRose’s office is providing Ohioans with weekly poll worker updates as reported by the 88 county boards of elections. Sharing the data also allows Ohio counties to be held accountable as the fall election approaches. This is the first time such information has been collected from the counties prior to an election. Data from county boards of elections indicates that while Ohio counties are very close to meeting the very minimum required to run the election, many more poll workers are needed in order to account for potential cancellations and no-shows. On the site you’ll find a breakdown of the following poll worker data: The minimum number of poll workers required to run an election in the respective county, by total and by Party; The goal number of poll worker commitments counties should target in order to compensate for any cancellations; and Remaining number of poll workers needed for each county to reach their goal. “While our innovative recruitment campaigns appear to have put Ohio in a far better position than other states, we still have a long way to go,” said LaRose. “We still need more patriotic Ohioans to step up and serve our state as poll workers.”</p>

Shull said a preliminary investigation indicates absentee ballots cast while the election was still scheduled for May 12 had been counted twice. According to Shull, revised tallies did not change the outcome and in almost all the races, the change in the vote tally appears to be less than a half a percent. In <strong>Georgia</strong>, a hand-recount&#8211;the first for the state with it&#8217;s new voting system&#8211;was delayed when<a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/news/20200909/election-recount-delayed-by-around-1000-uncounted-ballots"> about 1,000 absentee ballots went &#8220;missing&#8221;</a>. Elections Supervisor Russell Bridges confirmed the recount snafu. The ballots initially missed during the recount were tabulated following the runoff, according to Bridges. “There is no mystery here,” Bridges told the <em>Savannah Morning News</em>. “We are the first in the state to go through this process and we are learning and improving as we go.” The news of the unprocessed ballots came after candidates had been told Tuesday that the recount was complete. “Then we discovered while reviewing a spreadsheet (of the recount details) that it did not tabulate and we had not selected all the (absentee) ballots,” Bridges said. “There is no one to blame here. I thought we were done, but in the review we did find the oversight.”</p>

Part of that has been the impact on traditions. So many traditions have had to be put on hold due to the pandemic. But thankfully that is not the case<a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/with-chad-vaders-help-even-rebel-scum-can-vote-absentee/article_2d05d70a-01fb-53fb-bb57-b3552fa5b645.html"> in Dane County, Wisconsin where Chad Vader is back</a> to help Dane County residents understand the ins and outs of voting absentee. According to<em> The Cap Times</em>, as COVID-19 restrictions have made voters more interested in voting early via absentee ballots, Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said bringing back Chad seemed like a fun way to easily answer people’s questions about navigating the process. McDonell told the paper he wanted the video to answer a lot of the common questions that voters have when they call into his office. Answering those questions in person or by phone can slow down the process, and election officials are urging voters to get their ballots submitted as early as possible. “Government public service announcements tend to be boring,” McDonell said. “Any time you can get more interest it’s a real success.

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Disinformation</strong>: Analysts with the Department of Homeland Security’s intelligence branch issued a warning last week to federal and state law enforcement partners after finding with “high confidence” that “Russian malign influence actors”<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-amplifying-claims-mail-voter-fraud-intel-bulletin/story?id=72799959"> have targeted the absentee voting process</a> “by spreading disinformation” since at least March. “Russian state media and proxy websites in mid-August 2020 criticized the integrity of expanded and universal vote-by-mail, claiming ineligible voters could receive ballots due to out-of-date voter rolls, leaving a vast amount of ballots unaccounted for and vulnerable to tampering,” the bulletin notes. “These websites also alleged that vote-by-mail processes would overburden the U.S. Postal Service and local boards of election,” it continues, “delaying vote tabulation and creating more opportunities for fraud and error.”<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/voting-by-mail-russia-trump-barr/2020/09/04/e3f0e500-ee60-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html"> Many of the claims</a> made by Russian sources are identical to repeated, unsupported public statements aired by President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr, who have said that mailed ballots aren’t trustworthy while warning of the potential for rampant fraud in November’s elections.</p>
<p><strong>Whistleblower</strong>: The House Intelligence Committee announced this week that it had received a<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/515710-whistleblower-alleges-top-dhs-officials-sought-to-alter-intelligence"> whistleblower reprisal complaint</a> from Brian Murphy, a career public servant and the former acting under secretary in DHS&#8217;s Office of Intelligence and Analysis. According to<em> The Hill</em>, The complaint states that in several protected disclosures over the past two years, Murphy raised concern about &#8220;a repeated pattern of abuse of authority, attempted censorship of intelligence analysis and improper administration of an intelligence program related to Russian efforts to influence and undermine United States interests.&#8221; The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations.</p>

While Merrill said she is confident in the state’s election security she is concerned about disinformation campaigns. Merrill said she is using some of the money, which comes from one of the stimulus bills approved by Congress this year, to hire an expert in disinformation campaigns to protect Connecticut voters from foreign attempts to influence their votes. “We are hoping we will be able to head this off at the pass,” she said. Gabe Rosenberg, spokesman for the secretary of state’s office, said the office has hired an  election information security analyst on a contract basis through the election “to identify mis- and disinformation related to Connecticut elections, reporting and correcting it in real-time, and identifying any other information threats in the planning stage.”</p>

Dan Moul, R-Adams, that advances the deadline for voters to request a<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/with-little-notice-pa-senate-panel-advances-voting-bill-that-wolf-dems-oppose/"> mail-in ballot</a> and bans ballot drop boxes ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. The 2:30 p.m. meeting was not on the Senate’s public schedule by Wednesday afternoon. According to the <em>Pennsylvania Capital-Star,</em> Democrats on the committee said the short notice did not allow them to prepare amendments to the bill, which could advance out of the Senate and land on Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk by the end of next week. Sen. Katie Muth, D-Montgomery, said Democrats hoped to amend the bill to extend the pre-canvassing timeline for counties, giving them three weeks to prepare mail-in ballots for tallying ahead of Election Day, and to preserve the Oct. 27 deadline for voters to request mail-in ballots. They also wanted to strike out language in the bill that prohibits counties from using drop-off receptacles to collect ballots on election day.</p>

Ralph Northam has signed a bill into law that allocates $2 million toward prepaid postage for the return of absentee ballots, adds drop-off boxes throughout the state, and allows voters to fix errors on their ballot before Nov. 3. Localities will front the money for postage and the Commonwealth will reimburse them. “Today, I signed important new<a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/09/04/virginia-voter-protections-bill-absentee-ballot-drop-off-boxes-general-election/"> voter protection laws</a> that will expand access to early voting, provide prepaid return postage on all absentee ballots, and allow for secure drop boxes and drop off locations,” Northam wrote on Twitter.</p>

Kindred said he was not convinced that any Alaskans’ rights had been diminished and called it “disingenuous” to suggest that state election officials “selected people age 65 and older arbitrarily, or that all other age groups are equally vulnerable.” He acknowledged concerns for those with underlying medical conditions but said election officials “are not in a position where they can readily, easily, or confidently identify Alaskans who might qualify under that criteria.” The Disability Law Center of Alaska, Native Peoples Action Community Fund, Alaska Public Interest Research Group and two individuals alleged the state’s action was discriminatory. They filed a notice of appeal Friday.</p>
<p>Also in Alaska, the tribal council for the Interior Alaska community of Arctic Village, the Alaska branch of the League of Women Voters and two elders are challenging the Alaska state law that<a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/09/08/new-suit-says-alaskas-absentee-ballot-witness-law-is-unconstitutional-during-the-pandemic/"> absentee ballots be signed by a witness</a>, saying it’s an unconstitutional burden on voting rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs say that vulnerable Alaskans should not have to risk contracting COVID-19 in the process of obtaining a witness signature. “What Lt. Gov. Meyer is doing is forcing Alaskans to choose between their health and their vote,” Josh Decker, the ACLU of Alaska’s executive director, said in an interview Tuesday. “For anyone in Alaska who does not have an adult who can witness their signature and wants to avoid risking COVID, they should be allowed to cast their ballot in November just like those Alaskans who live with someone.”</p>

Plaintiffs Darlene Yazzie, Caroline Begay, Irene Roy, Donna Williams, Leslie Begay and Alfred McRoye state in their suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Arizona, that the current requirement that votes be received — not postmarked — before 7 p.m. on election day places “unconstitutional burdens on plaintiffs’ right to vote at Navajo Nation during the COVID-19 pandemic and United State Postal Service reorganizational issues.” The voters ask that the deadline be changed to count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3, as many states do.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Superior Court Judge James Smith has ruled that County Recorder Adrian Fontes may continue to instruct voters<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2020/09/07/judge-wont-stop-democrat-county-recorder-from-telling-voters-how-to-correct-ballots/"> how to correct ballot mistakes</a>. Smith said although it appears that Fontes acted illegally in telling voters they can cross out the wrong vote they cast and then vote as they wanted, all without requesting a new ballot. But Smith said that Fontes already has printed up 2.5 million instructions with the legally suspect directions. And he said it makes no sense, either logistically or financially, to order new ones be printed now. So he refused to issue such an order. Alexander Kolodin said Smith got it wrong. And he told Capitol Media Services he will be filing an appeal. The Arizona Public Integrity Alliance is asking the<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2020/09/08/group-appeals-ruling-allowing-voter-instruction-to-cross-out-ballot-mistakes/"> Arizona Court of Appeals</a> to print new instructions.</p>

Right now, people voting by mail must have their ballot mailed to the department of elections by 8 p.m. on election day – November 3rd. But the ACLU is asking the Department of Elections to extend the deadline to election day, and have all votes received up until ten days after the election to be counted. The ACLU says that because of the unique challenge of voting amid COVID-19 and recent issues with the United States Postal Service, voters should have more time.</p>

Ross denied this week the county’s motion to dismiss the suit, which was<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dekalb-illegally-canceled-dozens-voter-registrations-lawsuit-says/8sWX3GCmZTDVeAMFLJCYUM/"> filed in February</a> by lawyers representing the Georgia NAACP and the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda.  The lawsuit accuses the DeKalb County Board of Registration and Elections of “purging” more than 50 registered voters between December 2018 and November 2019, thanks in part to a policy that allows residents to challenge the registration of a voter if they believe they are no longer living at their registered address.</p>
<p>Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-appeals-absentee-ballot-deadline-extension/FCAMGWH63NCYVJGQLHONX5BQCA/"> appealed a federal judge’s ruling</a> that absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day should be counted. The case will be considered by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross last week nullified a Georgia law requiring absentee ballots to be received at county election offices by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Attorneys for the state wrote that the coronavirus pandemic doesn’t justify altering election rules so near the time when voters will begin receiving absentee ballots late this month. “Changing the deadline to return absentee ballots will introduce delay and confusion in the election process. This, in turn, risks delaying the Electoral College process and disenfranchising voters in Georgia, including preventing voters from casting ballots in runoff elections,” the attorneys wrote in a motion Friday to stay Ross’ preliminary injunction while the appeal is pending.</p>

Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap contends the GOP fell short of collecting 63,068 valid signatures for the November ballot. But the threshold was surpassed when a judge allowed 988 signatures from two people who didn’t register to vote until after they began collecting signatures. Dunlap contends signature-gatherers must be registered to vote before they start collecting signatures from voters. On Tuesday, Maine’s<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2020/09/08/states-high-court-puts-brakes-on-decision-to-allow-ranked-choice-veto-question-in-november/"> Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday blocked a Cumberland County Superior Court ruling</a> that would have allowed a people’s veto question on ranked-choice voting in the presidential election to go on the November ballot. Tuesday’s decision means Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap will prepare ballots that include a ranked-choice voting format in the presidential contest but no veto question. However, it’s still not clear whether the system will be used, as the high court will now consider an appeal of the lower court’s ruling on the issue.</p>

The statutes at issue allow Minnesota residents with disabilities or an inability to read English to seek help with filling out their ballot and, if they vote absentee, delivering it. The caveat, which the Democratic Senate and Congressional Campaign Committees have challenged, is that any one person can only assist three people. That restriction, Democrats argued, is preempted by a 1982<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10508"> amendment</a> to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which grants disabled and illiterate voters the right to receive assistance in voting. Republicans, who<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dscc-simon-order.pdf"> intervened</a> in the Democratic committees’ case against Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, argued that removing the provisions – prohibiting what they called “ballot harvesting,” and Democrats referred to as “ballot collection” – would lead to election fraud.In an expedited four-page ruling, Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea affirmed a July order by Ramsey County District Judge Thomas Gilligan that sided with the legal challenge to the law and therefore the law<a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-supreme-court-suspends-limit-on-helping-others-vote-in-person/572362602/"> will remain unenforceable</a>  this election.</p>

However, the Owens rejected an argument that people without pre-existing conditions should be allowed to vote absentee if they are following public health guidelines to avoid large social gatherings. Secretary of State Michael Watson said Thursday that he is<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2020/09/03/elections-chief-to-appeal-ruling-that-allows-early-voting-for-some-during-pandemic/"> appealing</a> Owens&#8217; order to the state Supreme Court.

In July, a Montana court granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the law. BIPA also institutes a fine of up to $500 for bringing ballots to the post office on behalf of relatives or neighbors, according to the plaintiffs&#8217; news release. BIPA defines a “family member” as “an individual who is related to the voter by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship,” but that definition is incompatible with Indigenous family structures, which include extended family and community members, the plaintiffs said.</p>

In a motion for summary judgment filed on Friday, attorneys for the president’s re-election campaign narrowed their legal challenge against AB4, the law approved during the late summer special session of the Legislature. The measure requires a mail-in ballot be sent to all active registered voters for the 2020 election, sets mandatory minimum numbers of polling places in Clark and Washoe counties, makes changes to the signature verification process and allows for non-family members to turn in ballots on behalf of voters.</p>

The ruling isn’t final, so it’s possible that it could still change between now and November. But on last week, a panel of three judges from different areas of the state ruled that part of the state’s felon disenfranchisement law appears to be unconstitutional. The judges issued a 2-1 ruling stopping the state from enforcing that part of the law, at least temporarily. They wrote that the people who challenged it — calling it essentially a poll tax and a relic of the Jim Crow era — appear to have a winning argument. The judges didn’t extend voting rights to everyone on probation or parole for a felony, as the challengers including Durham’s Community Success Initiative had asked. But they did rule in favor of people who would have already finished their time under supervision, except for not paying court costs and fees. The judges wrote that “our Constitution is clear: no property qualification shall affect the right to vote.”</p>

The court granted the motions to intervene by the Senate GOP — represented by President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and Majority Leader Jake Corman — and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, but denied motions by the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and several voting rights and voting accessibility advocacy groups. In the suit, Democrats are urging the court to order that mail-in and absentee ballots postmarked by 8 p.m. on Election Day and received by county boards by 5 p.m. the following Tuesday should be officially tallied.</p>
<p>Also in Pennsylvania, Glenys S. Karpavich, 68, has pleaded guilty to a summary offense of<a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/801005/woman-pleads-guilty-to-spitting-on-election-worker"> disorderly conduct after spitting on an election worker</a> in the June 2 primary election. According to the Times Leader, Luzerne County Deputy Sheriff Joseph Coddington accused Karpavich of spitting on Jessica Vu after being told to wear a mask when she entered the polling location at Pittston Area High School. Karpavich yelled about how the pandemic is a hoax and that COVID-19 is fake, according to the criminal complaint. Karpavich asked Vu a question and in response, Vu said she was sorry but was not sure what Karpavich was asking. Karpavich began to scream at Vu and complained about “how uneducated the younger generation is,” the complaint says. Vu asked a worker at another poll registration table to sign in Karpavich. Karpavich continued to yell at Vu, who instructed Karpavich to vote and leave. Karpavich began to walk away but turned around, pulled down her mask and spat at Vu, the complaint says.</p>

Richardson ordered the preliminary injunction in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, assuring that he did so without concern “about how his decisions could aid one side or the other on the political front.” The judge wrote that the state argued for its law, which plaintiffs say affected an estimated 128,000 newly registered voters last election cycle, through “a non-existent&#8221; congressional requirement and congressional intent. Tennessee has about 4.1 million registered voters.</p>

Additionally, to &#8220;protect voters&#8217; rights&#8221; in the upcoming election, Garcia said the Texas secretary of state must either advise local election officials that mail-in ballots may not be rejected using the existing signature comparison process, or notify them that they are required to set up a rejection notification system that would allow voters to challenge a rejection.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jason Pulliam dismissed a legal challenge Monday from Mi Familia Vota, the Texas NAACP and two Texas voters who claimed the state’s<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/08/texas-voting-rules-lawsuit/"> current polling place procedures</a> — including rules for early voting, the likelihood of long lines and Gov. Greg Abbott&#8217;s decision to not require voters to wear masks — would place an unconstitutional burden on voters while the novel coronavirus remains in circulation. In his order, Pulliam noted that the requests were not unreasonable and could &#8220;easily be implemented to ensure all citizens in the State of Texas feel safe and are provided the opportunity to cast their vote in the 2020 election.&#8221; But he ultimately decided the court lacked jurisdiction to order the changes requested — an authority, he wrote, left to the state. &#8220;This Court is cognizant of the urgency of Plaintiffs’ concerns and does respect the importance of protecting all citizens’ right to vote,&#8221; Pulliam wrote. &#8220;Within its authority to do so, this Court firmly resolves to prevent any measure designed or disguised to deter this most important fundamental civil right. At the same time, the Court equally respects and must adhere to the Constitution’s distribution and separation of power.&#8221;</p>

The plaintiffs argue that Vermont’s voter checklist hasn’t been sufficiently purged of people who have died, moved or are otherwise ineligible to vote in Vermont. And they say plans to send general election ballots to every registered voter in the state later this month threaten the integrity of election results. “… (M)any castable ballots will inevitably fall into the hands of persons other than the voter to whom the mail-in ballot was directed,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote. “Some or many of these misdirected or misreceived ballots can and will be cast by a person other than the voter to which the ballots were addressed or by an otherwise ineligible voter. Each such miscast ballot will directly impact and dilute the individual vote of each legitimate plaintiff voter, for which each plaintiff will have no remedy once such miscast ballots are received and counted.”</p>

A great deal of misinformation is spreading, and voters do not know where to look for trusted information. Increases in by-mail voting and safety concerns about voting in polling places have led to confusion about the best options to vote.
