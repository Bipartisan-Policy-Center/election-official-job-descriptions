							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A bipartisan plan for better elections</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Policy Center releases new report</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Policy Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Task Force on Elections today released its long-awaited</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/logical-election-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on ways to ensure the American voting process is more secure, accessible, and accurate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4999" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-16-at-11.40.15-AM-261x300.png" alt="" width="261" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-16-at-11.40.15-AM-261x300.png 261w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-16-at-11.40.15-AM-768x882.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-16-at-11.40.15-AM.png 866w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" />Called <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bipartison_Elections-Task-Force_R01_crops.pdf"><em>Logical Election Policy</em></a>, the report is a roadmap for legislators—particularly at the state level—to understand their policy options and highlight the upstream and downstream effects of policy reforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the task force, we assembled 21 key election officials from 17 states—including Ohio, Georgia, Michigan, Florida, Nevada, Virginia, and others—to analyze the current election ecosystem and to work together to develop innovative ways to improve the voting experience,” says Matthew Weil, Director of BPC’s Election Project and one of the report’s lead authors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommendations include: ways to meet voter expectations for more modern, integrated, and secure voter rolls; updated and more efficient methods of casting ballots; and better ways to count votes that increase public confidence in the integrity of elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“American elections are complex,” Weil says. “They involve many federal and state laws administered by over 8,000 local administrators who have to be everything from logistics managers to cybersecurity experts. Getting registered, casting your ballot, and having confidence in the vote count is not as easy as it could be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the task force members included Democrats and Republicans across a wide political spectrum, they unanimously endorsed a package of reforms to improve U.S. elections that they believe are implementable on realistic timeframes and under tight budget deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there’s a pretty remarkable thing about the process,” said Judd Choate, </span><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/main.html?menuheaders=5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado director of elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “There are Democrats and Republicans [on this stage]. There are people with a lot of experience, there are people with less experience. There are people from more rural states, more urban states. States that sort of have that Eastern model which is based more in polling places, the Western model which is based more in vote at home. And we were able to come up with 30-plus recommendations that we could all agree to, every one of us in the room could buy into those recommendations and I think that is an amazing thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommendations are broken into three sections: Voter registration, casting a ballot and counting the vote. There are five recommendations under voter registration including that all states should become a member of </span><a href="https://ericstates.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that states should set voter registration deadlines to the fewest days necessary to prepare for the election to provide constituents a reasonable opportunity to register to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the heading of casting a ballot, the Task Force has 10 recommendations including a number of recommendations related to vote-by-mail, early voting and accessibility. With regard to early voting, the Task Force recommends that voters should have the option of voting early and in-person for a period of at least seven days in advance of a federal election, that states should set a minimum standard for the number of early voting sites and most interestingly, that smaller, municipality-based election jurisdictions should be allowed to join together to offer shared, convenient early voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are six recommendations under the counting the vote heading are all issues that have very much been in the news of late. Those recommendations include that election administrators should be permitted to process vote-by-mail ballots beginning at least seven days prior to Election Day but must be prohibited from producing results, that state election certification deadlines should be set no earlier than 14 days after a general election to provide time to complete pre-certification tasks and that states should allow sufficient time for voters to cure eligibility deficiencies in vote-by-mail ballots, even if this period extends beyond Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an event releasing the recommendations, Chris Thomas, former Michigan director of elections and a fellow at the BPC’s Elections Projected noted how different these recommendations are from how they would have been not that long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a report by election officials that is voter centric,” Thomas said. “There was a time if you put that many elections officials together you would have had an elections officials view of the world. Election officials today are very voter centric which is where they need to be.”</span></p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>Improving data quality<br />
</strong><em>2018 Policy Survey</em></p>
<p>Dr. Nichelle Williams, PhD</p>
<p>The most recent EAVS introduced the 2018 Policy Survey, a research tool with close-ended questions that enables standardized data collection and more precise analysis of states’ policies.</p>
<p>The Policy Survey replaced the Statutory Overview, an open-ended questionnaire. Using fixed responses in the Policy Survey reduces many of the problems associated with trying to categorize and analyze election laws and administrative procedures for states and territories.</p>
<p>Data collection through the Policy Survey supplements EAVS data by providing a contextual understanding of laws and administrative procedures that govern election activities.</p>
<p>The Policy Survey is geared toward state-level officials and can be used to capture any anomalies in EAVS data reported by local jurisdictions. When it was reported through state-level data in the Policy Survey that their state does not have an online portal in which individuals can register to vote, EAC staff was able to conduct a quality check of data submitted by local jurisdictions that report individual voters submitting registration forms via a web-based online system.</p>
<p>An interesting topic captured in a series of close-ended questions in the newly administered 2018 Policy Survey is <em>Criminal Convictions and Voting</em>.</p>
<p>Through the three questions in the Criminal Convictions and Voting section of the Policy Survey, 52 percent of states and territories (N=28) reported that individuals who are convicted of any felony are required to be removed from the voter rolls and in two-thirds of these states and territories (n=19), the person with a felony conviction loses his or her right to vote during the period of incarceration and any period of probation and parole. Thirty-one percent of states and territories (N=17) require individuals who are convicted and incarcerated be removed from voter rolls and a person with a conviction loses his or her right to vote during the period of incarceration in more than 75 percent of these states and territories (n=13).</p>
<p>The Policy Survey also provides some clarity around what is required for a person with a felony conviction to become an eligible vote again after losing the right to vote due to criminal activity.</p>
<p>Sixty-one percent of states and territories (N=31) reported that a person is automatically eligible to register to vote again. Eighteen percent of states and territories (N=9) reported that a person must present documentation showing that he or she has completed the requirements for registering to vote. Sixteen percent of states and territories (N=8) report that a person must have his or her voting rights restored by the state through a formal administrative process such as gubernatorial restoration or action by the state pardons and paroles board. Six percent of states and territories (N=3) report that a person’s previous registration is automatically restored.</p>
<p>While 2018 was the first data collection period for the Policy Survey, as this survey tool continues to be deployed alongside the biennial EAVS, researchers and data analysts, like myself, will benefit from access to publicly available data that captures and somewhat categorizes election law and administrative procedures for our diverse mix of states and territories.</p>
<p>The Policy Survey will allow trend analysis of several topics such as Voter Registration, By-Mail Voting, In-Person Voting Prior to Election Day, Vote Centers, Voter Identification, Election Recounts and Audits and, Criminal Convictions and Voting.  It provides valuable contextual information that may enable stakeholders to draw meaningful conclusions about election administration and develop tailored policy interventions.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shelby Pierson, the election security threats executive</strong> at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said this week that the federal government is</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-election-czar-says-attempts-hack-2020-election-will-n1115346"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> geared up as never before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect the</span><a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/states-intelligence-briefing-iran-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2020 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but there are still limits as to what can be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The threats as we go into 2020 are more sophisticated,&#8221; Pierson said the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s 2020 Elections Summit. &#8220;This is not a Russia-only problem. Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, non-state hacktivists all have opportunity, means and potentially motive to come after the United States in the 2020 election to accomplish their goals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the threats are real, Pierson also noted that it was important not to undermine the trust people have in the election system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re uniquely cognizant that as we share information on election threats, we don&#8217;t want to undermine American confidence in our democratic process,&#8221; Pierson said. &#8220;What I want for the American voting public is that they understand these threats, that they&#8217;ve heard about it so frequently that they have availed themselves of the resources to them, that they can know where to vote, know how to vote if they&#8217;re not on the voter rolls, know where to seek authoritative information on candidates and ballot measures, so it&#8217;s with the confidence of knowing these threats that they&#8217;re empowered to participate in the process.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Last week, executives from</strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/voting-machine-makers-face-questions-house-lawmakers-more-remain-n1113181"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three voting machine vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — ES&amp;S, Hart InterCivic and Dominion Voting Systems — testified before Congress. According to NBC News, The hearing touched on a wide range of issues from the security of the machines and the prospect of independent review to lobbying and voter registration databases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vendors agreed to support future legislation that would require additional disclosures around their supply chain, cybersecurity practices, cyber incident reports, employee background checks and screening, and corporate ownership.</span></p>

							<h2>2020 Candidates on Voting Issues</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>During an event organized by</strong> Stacey Abrams’ Fair Fight Action Group, former New York City Mayor</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-2020-bloomberg-unveils-voting-rights-policy-atlanta/Q9W8CiGB1c7GgHsH3rsOIK/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michael Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out his plans for voting rights if elected president. According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, his plan centers on a national Voting Rights Act that requires states to conduct automatic voter registration. It would block states from purging voters on the basis of inactivity, restore voting rights to people with felony convictions and add more federal observers at polling sites.  Another part of the proposal would require states to establish independent redistricting commissions to draw political maps. And it would mandate that all states allow early voting and adopt new standards for convenient polling place locations. </span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voters in Las Cruces, New Mexico used ranked choice voting</strong> for the first time during the November municipal election and an exit poll conducted on Election Day found that</span><a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2020/01/14/las-cruces-vote-ranked-choice-election/2798219001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 53 percent of voters would support using ranked choice voting in future elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that 60 percent of voters were confident their voters were counted as they intended them to be. The results also showed that 85 percent of voters understood how ranked choice voting worked. According to the <em>Las Cruces Sun News</em>, 41 percent of voters liked ranked choice at least somewhat, 35 percent disliked it at least somewhat and 24 percent said they felt neutral. The Dona Ana county clerk’s office said it saved about $100,000 using ranked choice instead of holding runoff elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The devil is in the details</strong>. Although a new state law allows Kansas counties to move to vote centers, this week Secretary of State Scott Schwab told the Senate elections committee that technical considerations, including cellphone coverage problems, in the state’s 105 counties</span><a href="https://www.cjonline.com/news/20200114/kansas-wont-be-ready-to-implement-voting-freedom-law-for-2020-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made the process of drafting rules complex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the program won’t be finalized until 2021. “They are not going to be ready by this year simply because we don’t want to screw up,” the secretary of state said according to <em>The Topeka Capital-Journal.</em> “If we rushed it through for this year, I promise you there would be a lot of mistakes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Although you won’t need to show your AARP card</strong> to get in, the Douglas County, Georgia board of elections and registration is</span><a href="https://patch.com/georgia/douglasville/douglas-county-establishes-advance-voting-site-older-adults"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hoping to make voting a bit more convenient for the 55 and older crowd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The county will provide a sixth early voting location geared towards older voters. It will be located at the Woodie Fite Senior Center and the county will run shuttle buses from several locations to the voting site. “We are trying to accommodate all our voting citizens but also increase our customer service focusing on Douglas County&#8217;s older adult population,&#8221; County Elections Director Milton Kidd told <em>The Patch.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The long-standing (about 60 years) tradition</strong> of</span><a href="https://www.necn.com/news/politics/dixville-notch-finds-enough-people-to-keep-first-in-the-nation-voting-title/2216654/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting at midnight in Dixville Notch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, New Hampshire will continue for the February 11 presidential preference primary. Earlier this year, when the town’s population dipped to just four, the state warmed the hamlet that if they couldn’t come up with a fifth resident by the beginning of 2020, they would no longer be able to host a polling site. A local developer, who owns numerous properties in Dixville Notch, but resides in Maine has agreed to move to the town and register to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Color us surprised</strong>, but the League of Women Voters is set to open the very</span><a href="https://www.collegian.psu.edu/news/campus/article_45bf3a66-3728-11ea-8087-73c593584a31.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first chapter on a college campus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new chapter will be on the Penn State campus. The chapter is scheduled to be up and running by the end of the spring semester. “Penn State is a massive university but only a very low number actually vote [36 percent in 2016], so we’re trying to encourage student voting, especially because what we vote for is really important for us since we’ll be the ones most affected,” Sarabeth Bowmaster, president of the Penn State chapter told the <em>Daily Collegian</em>. “Our goal is to try and raise voter turnout and voter knowledge on campus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vote At Home recently released</strong> its</span><a href="https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/VAH-Annual-report-2019-v-1.0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Annual Report 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only does the Annual Report detail the work of the Vote At Home organization, but it also covers the movement itself and includes lots of interesting numbers and details about who’s voting at home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shoe News</strong>: Beginning this month, customers in Steve Madden stores will be able to buy a new pair of shoes and register to vote while doing it. Eighty-one Steve Madden locations will encourage customers to register with a unique text code that will be displayed in stores. The text code then prompts an online voter registration page powered by Voto Latino. For a chance to be featured on @stevemadden social, newly registered voters can grab an “I registered” sticker, take a selfie and post it using #GenSteveVotes.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alaska:</strong> Supporters of an election reform initiative that would include allowing</span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/01/09/ranked-choice-voting-supporters-turn-in-signatures-moving-measure-closer-to-statewide-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have turned in 41,000 petition signatures. To earn a spot on the ballot this fall, a measure needs the support of 28,501 registered Alaska voters from at least 30 of the state’s 40 House districts. The names submitted will be verified by the Division of Elections, and the measure’s backers told the <em>Alaska Daily News</em> they are confident they will have enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana:</strong> The House is considering a bill that would keep</span><a href="https://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/local-news/new-bill-may-allow-hoosier-polling-locations-to-stay-open-longer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polling locations open until 8 p.m.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Polls currently close at 6pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Iowa:</strong> The Des Moines City Council will consider</span><a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/01/13/des-moines-consider-doing-away-city-council-runoff-elections/4460805002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doing away with the city’s runoff elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after three such races cost the city $86,603 in 2019. According to the <em>Des Moines Register</em>, instead, the council could change the rules so the candidate with the most votes on the day of the general election would be the winner, regardless of whether the contender secured more than 50%. There would be no runoff contest. The city council will consider changing its election process at a later workshop meeting.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> A Senate committee has approved a bill that move the state’s</span><a href="https://wfpl.org/bill-eliminating-odd-year-elections-in-ky-passes-legislative-committee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections to even-numbered years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The proposal would go into effect after the 2023 election and make the first even-numbered election take place in 2028, putting Kentucky gubernatorial election years in line with presidential ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland</strong>: A bill that would allow Montgomery County to add an additional</span><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/blog/bill-on-extra-early-voting-site-for-montgomery-co-advances/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early voting site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a diverse area of the county is moving forward after the Education, Elections and Housing Committee voting unanimously in support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nebraska</strong>: Legislators will once again consider a constitutional amendment (LR292CA) that would require a voter to show a</span><a href="https://journalstar.com/legislature/after-brief-hiatus-lawmakers-will-again-consider-voter-id-proposal/article_992a0702-7ce6-5a99-bb5a-76b77bcc695f.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> photo ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to vote. According to the <em>Lincoln Journal Star</em>, the proposal requires poll workers to &#8220;review a photograph or a digital image of each voter to verify the identity of the voter.&#8221; The specifics on how those reviews would take place, as well as any exemptions for specific situations, would be up to future Legislatures to decide. This is the ninth time in 10 years that the Legislature has considered a voter photo ID proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Democrats on the Fiscal Committee voted to cut $477,000 from the Department of Justice’s litigation budget, arguing that the state should</span><a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/State-House-Democrats-target-funding-for-voting-law-defense-31914901"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stop funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its ongoing defense of Senate Bill 3 and House Bill 1264.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The Legislature sent a couple piece of elections-related legislation to Phil Murphy this week. One bill, if signed, would allow New Jersey to offer</span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/two-landmark-voting-rights-bills-pass-nj-legislature-move-murphys-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The second bill fixes issues with 2019’s</span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/jones-measure-creates-fund-reimburse-certain-vote-mail-application-costs-heads-governors-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote-by-mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation which was rendered moot by an obscure state committee on unfunded mandates. The new bill would require an annual appropriation each year to cover the costs associated with vote-by-mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: By a 40 to 20 vote, the Senate has approved a bill that will introduce</span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-senate-democrats-automatic-voter-registration-20200109-hiujfywttvhlzh3bsmzkzhr72y-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Empire State. The bill had previously been approved by both chambers in 2019, but was scrapped before being sent to the governor because it was discovered that a typo in the legislation would have allowed noncitizens to register to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> There are two</span><a href="https://www.wvxu.org/post/two-bills-would-create-automatic-voter-registration-different-ways#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills pending in the Ohio Legislature. Under the House bill, voters would still have the option to opt-out of registering at the BMV, but those who choose to register would not be able to choose their party affiliation at that time, they would have to wait to do that at the polls. The bill would also use high school enrollment records to register new voters. The Senate bill</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>South Dakota</strong>: House Bill 1050, which would allow for</span><a href="https://www.kotatv.com/content/news/House-bill-for-online-voter-registration-566954431.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has been introduced. It is sponsored by the Committee on Local Government at the request of the State Board of Elections. According KOTA, ff passed, the county auditors will still be in charge of maintaining voter registration records in their respective counties and any eligible voter with a valid driver’s license or state-issued ID card can register to vote through the online system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington:</strong> Legislation has been introduced that would make the state’s recently implemented</span><a href="https://mynorthwest.com/1671270/vote-act-washington-state-automatic-voter-registration/?"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatic voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to an opt-out system similar to Oregon’s. Currently voters at DMVs and government agencies are given the opportunity to opt-in. Titled the “VOTE Act,” the bill would also create “Voter Empowerment Centers” at all of the state’s public four-year colleges, with the stated goal to “make it easier for college students to cast their ballots if they have last-minute challenges that would otherwise be a barrier to voting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia:</strong> The Senate Privileges and Elections Committee have advanced a bill that would allow for</span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/senate-panel-backs-early-voting-bill-disclosure-of-pre-general/article_8a4b8dcd-a378-5402-b5e7-b001efed62a2.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in any election. The committee voted 11-4, with two Republicans joining the majority Democrats. The bill heads to the Senate floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The General Assembly is considering a bill that would have the state reimburse local clerks for the</span><a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/special-election-reimbursement-bill-has-support-of-gop-led-senate/article_7427ca92-2389-5c8a-ba78-70b82e8ec0a2.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cost of conducting special elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill was approved by the Senate several months ago and has the support of the governor.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The Minnesota Supreme Court has denied a request by another Republican candidate for president to be featured on the ballot meaning that elections officials could go ahead with the</span><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/01/09/mn-supreme-court-grapples-with-primary-ballot-choices"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> printing of the ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for absentee voting which is set to begin this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> In a 5-2 ruling the Missouri Supreme Court eliminated portions of the state’s</span><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article239290138.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter photo ID law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, voters can once again bring non-photo identification — like a voter ID card, a college ID or a utility bill — to the polls without having to sign an affidavit stating they don’t have “a form of personal identification approved for voting.” This ruling returns state statute to where it was in 2016. “Although the State has an interest in combating voter fraud, requiring individuals voting under option two to sign a contradictory, misleading affidavit is not a reasonable means to accomplish that goal,” Judge Mary Russell wrote</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: District Judge Alison J. Nathan has ruled that the New York State Board of Elections is violating the Constitution and federal election law when it</span><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/federal-judge-orders-names-of-inactive-new-york-voters-to-be-at-poll-sites"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designates certain registered voters as “inactive” and keeps those names out of poll books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used on Election Day and during early voting. In her ruling, Nathan said the state must make those lists available to poll workers. In her 60-page ruling Nathan blamed the U.S. Postal Service and the national change of address registry for providing unreliable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> Judge George D. Gilles has ordered that a</span><a href="https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/Hearing-held-for-contest-of-Midland-ISD-bond-election-566875061.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot box found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after a recount seeking to solve an 832-vote discrepancy in a Midland County bond election, be opened and the ballots inside counted. The judge ordered that a ballot found at the bottom of a voting machine also be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Texas, voter Jarrod Stringer has filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the state is disenfranchising an unknown number of voters by</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/01/14/fight-over-online-voter-registration-texas-drivers-reaches-federal-cou/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violating the motor voter law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state allows driver&#8217;s licenses applicants to complete their voter registration when they physically appear at a Texas Department of Public Safety office, but does not allow the same result when residents update or renew licenses online. Stringer filed a similar suit in 2014 which was eventually tossed but not without a sharp rebuke from the judge to the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> On Monday, Ozaukee County Circuit Court Judge Paul Malloy found the Wisconsin Elections Commission in</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wisconsin-elections-board-in-contempt-for-inaction-on-voter-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contempt of court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for failing to purge more than 200,000 voters from the rolls after he ordered that the commission do so following his ruling earlier this year. However, on Tuesday, the Wisconsin Appeals Court</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wisconsin-appeals-court-blocks-voter-purge-for-now/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stayed the rulings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ordering the elections officials to purge the voters in question. Also on Monday, the Wisconsin</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-supreme-court-wont-hear-immediate-appeal-voter-purge-ruling"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> split 3-3 on whether to hear an expedited appeal of the lower court’s ruling. &#8220;The court&#8217;s decision to take a pass on this case irreparably denies the citizens of Wisconsin a timely resolution of issues that impact voter rights and the integrity of our elections,&#8221; wrote conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley. &#8220;The court disregards its duty to decide significant issues of statewide importance.&#8221;</span></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Five  years ago, the state Legislature approved a bill directing the state to create a way for Oklahomans to</span><a href="https://www.kgou.org/post/five-years-and-counting-online-voter-registration-won-t-be-ready-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> register online to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently voters can update their registration online, but they cannot register for the first time. While state elections officials had hoped to have the system finally ready for 2020, unfortunately it won’t be. State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax told KGOU election officials are waiting for the Department of Public Safety to complete computer upgrades that would allow online voter registrations to be cross-referenced with applicants’ driver’s licenses or state-issued ID cards. Ziriax hopes that the system will be able to launch in 2021. “As Oklahoma’s chief election official, I strongly support online voter registration,” he said. “However, online voter registration should only launch when it is both technically feasible and secure, and not before.”</span></p>
