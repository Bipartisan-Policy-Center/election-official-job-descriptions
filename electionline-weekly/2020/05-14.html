							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Supporting election officials in a pandemic</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTCL launches a new 12-part webinar series</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/team/josh-simon-goldman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Josh Goldman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, program manager<br />
</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Tech and Civic Life</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometime in early March, we started asking questions. At the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), we work with state and local officials across the country, so we wanted to understand what COVID-19 might mean for running elections. We had some guesses, to be sure, but knew the best insights would come from conversations with administrators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what did folks say? You talked about increased mail balloting, scared poll workers, apprehensive (but committed) voters, and more. While reactions varied depending on the size of the jurisdiction and other factors, some common themes came through loud and clear.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone indicated that the pandemic meant:</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enormous implementation challenges for increased mail balloting</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter outreach efforts at an unprecedented scale</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profound uncertainty about voter behavior, preferences, and trust in the system.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something else we heard a lot?  “There’s so much new information! I could use some help sorting through it to find what’s useful for my community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s one thing we love at CTCL, it’s sorting through emerging election guidance and sharing what we find. So, we got to work. Today we’re excited to share more about what we’ve put together along with our guest presenters&#8211; respected election officials and sector experts committed to making 2020 go smoothly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting on Tuesday, May 19, CTCL is pleased to offer “</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/covid-19-webinars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 and Election Administration: Approaches for Election Officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a set of 12 no-cost, 60-minute webinars highlighting top approaches to prepare for inclusive, safe, and secure elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series runs Tuesdays and Thursdays between May 19th through the end of June (with a brief pause on June 2 for a busy election day!). 2:00-3:00pm ET each time, presenters will cover topics like the specifics of mail balloting, voter outreach and communication, and adapting in-person voting locations to keep everyone healthy. The focus is on clear information you can apply directly to your office. And, they’re will be plenty of time to ask questions of experienced presenters and fellow participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These webinars build on COVID-19 response</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/covid-19-election-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FAQs &amp; consideration documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produced by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council and Sector Coordinating Council’s Joint COVID Working Group. The orientation webinar next Tuesday (May 19) features CISA’s Matthew Masterson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each session stands alone, so you can register for the ones most useful to you and your team. Use</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/covid-19-webinars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the registration page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sign up for the webinars, which are organized into the four themes described next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Making sense of the moment</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting policies, preferences, and best practices are shifting from day to day. So, the series starts off with a set of webinars designed to help you take stock of your 2020 plans and think through the big challenges ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Supporting election officials” (Thursday, May 21) covers the basics of how to keep you and your team healthy and well equipped for a hectic year&#8211; a fundamental, if often overlooked, part of election preparation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior estimates for mail balloting, election staffing, and poll location distribution could use some updating. “Planning 2020 workload &amp; resource allocation” (Tuesday, May 26) helps make sure you’re putting resources in the right places, avoiding long lines at polling places and unexpected delays processing mail ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anytime you shift resources, different groups will feel disparate effects&#8211; from traditional in-person voters, to medical professionals quarantining away from their families, to community members that depend on translated election materials. “Ensuring access, equity, and inclusion” (Thursday, May 28) highlights these disparate effects and offers concrete steps you can take to make sure everyone can exercise their right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, everyone from first-time voters to every-election-stalwarts, will need updated information about when, where, and how to vote. “Educating voters about their options” (Thursday, June 4) offers best practices for helping voters understand and trust their voting method choices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Getting ballots to voters</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant increase in mail balloting is a serious logistical challenge. Even if your state isn’t promoting voting by mail, you can still expect to see an increase in requests from nervous voters, stressing your existing practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maintaining voter lists” (Tuesday, June 9) and “Managing mail ballot request forms” (Thursday, June 11) focus on practical approaches for increasing voter list accuracy, streamlining voter registration and ballot request processes, and implementing</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/covid-19-responses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creative approaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’re seeing across the country.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Receiving and processing ballots </strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stakes here are painful to think about: overstuffed drop boxes, misplaced ballots, long delays, and dubious chains of custody. Setting up clear, efficient procedures for receiving, processing, and organizing returned ballots can make a big difference when it comes to staying on top of things this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Organizing ballot dropoff locations” (Tuesday, June 16) helps you think through your options, whether you’re considering sites open 24 hours a day or supervised locations in the election office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Streamlining the inbound ballot process” (Thursday, June 18) is designed to help jurisdictions that will likely see a significant increase in mail ballots plan for an efficient and secure chain of custody. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with voters’ signatures serving as a key security feature on returned ballot envelopes, “Verifying and curing signatures” (Tuesday, June 23) focuses on best practices for checking the signatures&#8211; plus options for how to alert voters when ballots are missing verifiable jane hancocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Conducting in-person voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even where most voters opt for mail balloting, in-person voting will remain a crucial option for many folks. And a fair election is one where voters know you’re doing everything possible to keep them safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recruiting and training election workers” (Thursday, June 25) covers how to recruit folks from less vulnerable populations, train them online, and ensure they’re prepared to handle frequently asked pandemic-related voting questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those election workers will be supporting voters in reconfigured voting locations. “Implementing public health guidelines for voting locations” (Tuesday, June 30) is all about how to keep everyone safe while they fulfill their civic duty.</span></p>

Despite the worries over COVID-19, Election Commissioner Dave Shively told the Journal Star, the participation in this year&#8217;s primary was &#8220;kind of extraordinary,&#8221; even if the scene at several polling places Tuesday didn&#8217;t make it look that way. &#8220;It was pretty light turnout from what we understand,&#8221; he said Tuesday shortly before polling places closed at 8 p.m. &#8220;I think things went kind of the way we hoped they would.&#8221; In</span><a href="https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Adams-County-voters-turn-out-in-force-through-mail-in-ballots-570418651.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Adams County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, election official Ramona Thomas told KSNB it was like holding two elections. “It&#8217;s crazy. Essentially we were running two elections,” Ramona Thomas said. “We were dealing with the massive quantity of mail out ballots and then having to have everything ready for election day.” The state relied on</span><a href="https://www.wowt.com/content/news/Younger-poll-workers-volunteer-for-Nebraskas-primary-election-570414921.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> young poll workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill the void left by older poll workers who had concerns about working during the pandemic.

Vahle told Nebraska TV that she and her mom, who she recruited to serve as a poll worker as well, value all the voters, even when they were averaging five or six an hour, with a memorable first election. “I don&#8217;t think I could forget this.”</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Online Voting</strong>: In an 8-page report co-authored by four federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and issued to states last week, the federal government said it considers</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/11/853759878/feds-warn-states-that-online-voting-experiments-are-high-risk"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online voting to be a “high-risk”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> way of running elections, even if all the security protocols are followed. &#8220;We recommend paper ballot return as electronic ballot return technologies are high-risk even with controls in place,&#8221; says the</span><a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/Final_%20Risk_Management_for_Electronic-Ballot_05082020.pdf?mod=article_inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a copy obtained by The Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California</strong>: A 2019-2020 Napa County grand jury investigated he county election division and how it handles ballots.

The grand jury did issue a warning about the county’s use of social media. “Napa County’s Election Division has no policy in place regarding access, logging or accountability for their social media accounts,” the report stated. “I’m very pleased with the report,” Registrar of Voters John Tuteur told the Napa Valley Register. “I’m working with the Board of Supervisors and the county public information office on the issue of security on the county social media sites.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Native American Voters</strong>: While many—most—states are pushing full-steam ahead to expand vote-by-mail for not only their yet-to-be-held primaries, but also the general election, some advocate are sounding the alarm about the</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/experts-worry-push-2020-mail-voting-leave-native/story?id=70411683"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impacts expanded vote by mail could have on Native American voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As outlined by the Native American Rights Fund, an organization that provides legal assistance to tribes and Native American individuals, the potential obstacles range from issues with access to traditional mail services, to a lack of broadband connectivity, and in some cases, cultural communication barriers. Experts also point out that high poverty rates and some states’ voter identification requirements create even more potential roadblocks for Native Americans seeking to cast their ballots. “We&#8217;ve tried to point out to people &#8212; you got to stack all of these things on top of each other,” Natalie Landreth, a senior staff attorney with Native American Rights Fund said in an interview with ABC News. “Having a rural, non-traditional address, no home mail delivery and being forced into a situation where you have to use a P.O. box causes all of these practical hurdles that people seem unaware of as they&#8217;re advocating universally that vote by mail is so rad,” Landreth said.</span></p>

In March, Israel conducted national elections, with precautions instituted to ensure voting and safeguarding of Israel’s election sites, voters and poll workers. Special &#8220;pop up&#8221; poll­ing locations were staffed by paramedics wearing protective suits and masks. Voters and polling station staff were physically separated. Israel&#8217;s Health Ministry allowed those under quarantine who were asymptomatic to vote, so long as they wore face masks and gloves, did not use public transportation and followed other directives. As a result, voter turnout on March 2 was the highest since 1999. “As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, election officials both here in the U.S. and around the world are working day and night to keep our elections, voters and poll workers safe. During this unprecedented time, it is hugely important to work with our allies like Israel to ask questions and learn from one another. Today’s briefing was an excellent conversation and I look forward to continued dialogue,” said Paul Pate, NASS President and Iowa Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed an executive order requiring that</span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-08/all-california-voters-will-be-asked-to-vote-by-mail-in-november-2020-coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballots be mailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the state’s 20.6 million voters for the November general election. “It’s great for public health, it’s great for voting rights, it’s gonna be great for participation,” said Secretary of State Alex Padilla. California is the first state to make the switch to all-mail voting for the November 3 election.</span></p>

Under the new procedures, county clerks must test their poll workers with infrared thermometers prior to them reporting to voting locations. Election judges and other staff will need to wear face masks and personal protective equipment at all times, as will any observers or media present. For the latter category of people, counties must also take their temperatures if they plan to remain at a polling site for an hour or longer. Workers must clean all voting equipment after each use. If additional public health guidelines emerge close to Election Day, counties must follow whichever directive provides the most protection. The secretary of state’s office must sign off on any changes that counties want to make for which the revised rules do not provide guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Delaware:</strong> Gov. John Carney signed the fifteenth modification to his State of Emergency declaration, rescheduling Delaware’s</span><a href="http://firststateupdate.com/2020/05/governor-moves-election-day-again-state-to-send-vote-by-mail-applications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presidential primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for July 7. The Delaware Department of Elections will mail absentee ballot applications to all registered Democrats and Republicans in the State of Delaware, providing all eligible registered Delaware voters the opportunity to vote by absentee ballot in the presidential primary election.</span></p>

Ron DeSantis this week urging him to take</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article242699171.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $20 million in funds awarded to Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill that became law in March. Florida is just one of four states that have yet to accept the federal funds. According to the <em>Miami Herald</em>, the letter is a follow-up to one the group sent a month ago, asking DeSantis to help supervisors prepare for the coming August and November elections by granting them some flexibility under the law — a request that has gone unanswered.  “I &#8230; want to express my concern that Florida is lagging behind nearly every other state in securing CARES Act funding for elections,” Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Craig Latimer wrote Wednesday. “While we wait, the goods and services we need are becoming scarce.” Through a spokesman, Secretary of State Laurel Lee responded: “We will be assisting our 67 county supervisors of elections to make these funds available in the most expeditious manner possible and to maximize the full benefit of these funds to meet identified areas of specific county and collective critical need and support consistent with the intent and purpose of the CARES Act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana:</strong> While some states have been relying on members of the National Guard to serve as poll workers, Indiana is turning to the Guard for something different. The Guard is partnering with the secretary of state’s office to</span><a href="https://www.wboi.org/post/indiana-national-guard-provide-ppe-polling-places-ahead-primary-election#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distribute PPE for polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the primary. According to Indiana Public Radio, Brig. Gen. Dale Lyles said the Guard worked with Republicans and Democrats to get an idea of how much PPE is needed at sites. “And over the course of the next five to 10 days we will be delivering enough PPE for all the workers at those sites to be protected,” Lyles says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5259" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MO-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Missouri:</strong> Phelps County, Missouri Clerk Pamela Grow has turned down $42,696 in funding stating that she was living up to a campaign promise to</span><a href="https://www.therolladailynews.com/news/20200507/phelps-county-clerk-declines-federal-grant-citing-burden-outweighs-benefit"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> never take federal funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I was quoted very publicly in local newspapers about my commitment to avoid taking federal money for the operation of my office,” Grow told the Rolla Daily News. In addition to her campaign promise not to take federal funding—the money was part of the granting program established by the CARES Act—Grow also city the reporting and accounting burdens that come with accepting federal funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nevada:</strong> The Board of Examiners  approved a $1 million contract with KPS3 to provide</span><a href="https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/state-approves-1-million-contract-to-help-voters-through-upcoming-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “full service voter education marketing campaign”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help voters through the upcoming primary election. Funding for the project was provided by the federal government through the Help America Vote Act. The company will develop and implement a marketing plan including creation and maintenance of a website, creation of marketing materials and media access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee:</strong> According to a document obtained by the Associated Press and confirmed by state elections officials,</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/12/us/ap-us-virus-voting-tennessee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fear of contracting the coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t meet medical criteria for voting absentee in Tennessee. “In consultation with the Attorney General’s office the fear of getting ill does not fall under the definition of ill,” Elections Coordinator Mark Goins told The Associated Press in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> In a proclamation issued this week, Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/11/texas-2020-july-primary-runoffs-coronavirus-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early voting for the July 14 runoffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to begin June 29 instead of on July 6. He noted that sticking with the truncated early voting window that’s typical for runoff elections “would prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the COVID-19 disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utah:</strong> Although the June 30 primary will be conducted entirely by mail, seven counties will provide</span><a href="https://www.kuer.org/post/7-utah-counties-will-open-new-kind-drive-thru-june-elections#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drive-thru voting on election day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Salt Lake County will have 10 to 11 drive-up spots, according to County Clerk Sherrie Swensen. Voters will pull up, tell a poll worker their name, and drive away with a mail in ballot they can drop off later that day. “I know there&#8217;s individuals out there who would have done everything they needed to do and for whatever reason, don&#8217;t receive their ballot,” Swensen told KUER. “So I decided that it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to the voters for them not to have an option to get a ballot.”</span></p>

For several weeks, three employees at the Central Library have helped prepare absentee ballot packets, stuffing each with two pages of voting instructions and a self-addressed, stamped return envelope. Another three to five are at the registrar daily, placing ballots in those packets to seal and send, sorting submitted ballots into one of 63 precincts, and answering phones. “They are priceless to us,” general registrar Mary Lynn Pinkerman told the <em>Virginia Pilot</em>. “We absolutely could not have done this without them.” “Librarians love serving the public, and this is another way we can do it,” Zachary Elder, Central Library manager told the paper. “It’s been exciting and a bit challenging, but every absentee ballot that comes in is one person who is a little safer. We’re also protecting our election poll workers — really all of our residents.”</span></p>

In 1965, 130,991 young men were inducted in the military service; a year later, the number ballooned to 382,010. Many of them were ages 18-20 and therefore unable to vote. The article notes that while it was the Vietnam War that spurred the change, the fight to lower the voting age began much earlier, during World War II, which is when the slogan “Old Enough to Fight, Old Enough to Vote.” West Virginia Rep. Jennings Randolph proposed a constitutional amendment. In his 1954 State of the Union address President Dwight D. Eisenhower encouraged lawmakers to take up the issue. But it was Vietnam that really got the ball rolling with President Lyndon B. Johnson asking Congress in 1968 to move on the voting age.</span></p>

Reed College Professor of Political Science</span><a href="https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2020/gronkewinscarnegie.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paul Gronke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was selected as part of the 2020 class of Andrew Carnegie Fellows. The award supports high-caliber scholarship in the social sciences and humanities, making it possible for recipients to continue their research on pressing issues and cultural transitions affecting U.S. citizens at home and abroad. Gronke was recognized for his scholarship on election security and accessibility. “We are at a critical moment in American democracy. Democratic institutions are at risk when politicians are increasingly willing to subvert these institutions for political gain,” Gronke told Reed Magazine. “I am honored and humbled to be selected for such a prestigious fellowship, which will allow me to pursue important research regarding the integrity of these institutions at a vital moment of rapid political and social change.”</span></p>

According to the Press &amp; Guide, he didn’t give an exact date for when the resignation would take place, but offered to stay on in an advisory role for the August and November elections. Prusiewicz said he isn’t comfortable working on-site during an election. He said election workers would be compelled to accept absentee ballots that were hand-delivered on election day, and he isn’t comfortable handling those without leaving them quarantined for at least a day like he currently does with mail both at his house and in the office. He said that he would consider staying on, if the administration can work out a plan to let him work from home as long as he feels it not safe be in the office. Prusiewicz has been clerk since 2011.</span></p>

He was 91. Carter, born in New Orleans on June 30, 1928, enlisted in the Army and was in the Air Corps, the precursor of the Air Force. He was among the nation’s first black airmen. “I was a crew chief and gunner. Whatever they needed,” said Carter, who was involved during the pivotal final months of fighting in the Pacific that led to Japan’s surrender in August 1945. After the war, Carter became a member of the newly formed Air Force and rose to the level of staff sergeant. He is survived by his wife Odessa; a daughter, Paula (Dylan) Barrett; a daughter-in law, Beverly Carter; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Richard Carter, and a brother, Daniel.</span></p>

The funding is meant to assist states in addressing new challenges posed by holding elections during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as expanding mail-in and early in-person voting. At least 50 percent of the funds would be required to go to local governments to help administer elections, and states would have until late next year to access the funds. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Gavin Newsom backing the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials’ request to expand vote-by-mail services for the election due to concerns related to novel coronavirus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In San Francisco, Several San Francisco supervisors are supporting a charter amendment that would</span><a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/05/11/sf-16-17-year-olds-vote-municipal-elections-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give voting rights to 16- and 17-year-old city residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for municipal elections. The measure is planned for the November ballot. The young voters would have to meet all of the qualifications for voter registration under state law besides the 18-year-old age minimum, and would have to register to vote with the city’s Department of Elections, according to the language in the proposed charter amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3745" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MNCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Minnesota:</strong> The Senate, by a 66 to 1 vote has followed in the House’s footsteps by approving legislation that permits candidates to file electronically, extends the counting period for absentee ballots and</span><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/05/07/legislature-agrees-on-measures-to-make-voting-safer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> releases $17 million in federal election money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill also allows elections officials to relocate polling places away from sites such as nursing homes or assisted living facilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> The House has approved a bill that would allow for</span><a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-moving-to-allow-mail-in-voting-during-pandemic/article_fb64e84a-b8af-5d95-8bdf-2ef5133ec992.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If signed into law it would only apply to the August and November 2020 statewide elections. The proposed change, which still needs Senate approval, comes after county clerks and voting rights groups have said people shouldn’t have to risk going to polling places during a global pandemic. Currently voters most provide a valid excuse for not voting in-person. Illegally casting an absentee ballot is a feloyn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> The Senate approved and the governor quickly signed into law a bill that would reinstate the need for a</span><a href="https://www.wiltonbulletin.com/news/article/Oklahoma-Senate-gives-final-OK-to-absentee-voter-15254320.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notary witness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to cast an absentee ballot except during a state of emergency. Under the bill, for the duration of the COVID-19 state of emergency, voters who wish to submit absentee ballots by mail will need to include a photocopy of their voter registration card or photo identification. Once the emergency declaration is over, absentee voters would then be required to have their ballots notarized by a notary public.</span></p>

The measure would allow all South Carolinians to request an absentee ballot and mail in their vote, rather than going to a polling location. If the bill is signed into law voters must list the coronavirus pandemic as they reason for voting absentee. It will also only apply to the June primaries and run-offs. Gov.

The agreement is aimed at resolving claims that Arkansas didn’t provide certain opportunities to update voter-registration records as required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The law requires states to update voter records when the address on the driver’s license or other IDs is changed, unless the person chooses otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> The Long Beach Reform Coalition has filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles County Clerk/Recorder Dean Logan over the</span><a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2020/05/11/long-beach-reform-coalition-files-suit-against-la-county-registrar-over-measure-a-recount/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> county’s new voting system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and an aborted recount of the city’s Measure A ballot initiative. The lawsuit, filed Monday, May 11, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, seeks to have the Registrar’s Office restart the Measure A recount “at a reasonable cost,” said Ian Patton, director of the coalition.</span></p>

Gwinnett County is the only county in the state required to provide bilingual polling materials and a suit was filed by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law arguing that the county must also send absentee ballot materials in Spanish. In his decision, Ray said he thought their request represented a “reasonable and desirable outcome” and “may very well be the best public policy.” But, he wrote, it was not the law. Ray noted that the Voting Rights Act applies to the county and that it was the secretary of state’s office sending out the materials and that office has “no duty” to provide bilingual materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Georgia Project, a voter registration group, has filed a lawsuit challenging a Georgia law that</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-says-georgia-ballots-postmarked-election-day-should-count/ZcbqDAVZTF0VASq8JdmVKI/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires absentee ballots to arrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in county election offices by 7 p.m. on election day. The lawsuit also asks a judge to order free ballot postage, allow groups like the New Georgia Project to turn in ballots for voters, and require better notification of voters whose absentee ballot requests are rejected.</span></p>

The suit says the plan falls short in protecting voters from the coronavirus and call the plan “unduly restrictive” and seeks to repeal the requirements that voters present an excuse to receive an absentee ballot, thereby expanding them to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong>  A group of older Minnesota voters is suing the secretary of state over concerns that the state&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/older-minnesota-voters-file-suit-to-change-absentee-voting-rules/570446392/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee voting rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could put their vote — and their health — at risk this year. The suit argues that many older voters who are self-quarantining to avoid contracting the COVID-19 virus won&#8217;t be able to get the required witness signatures on their mail-in ballots. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Ramsey County District Court by the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund, looks to stop the state from enforcing that requirement and also to adopt a postmark deadline on mail-in ballots.</span></p>

Judge David Anderson ruled on April 8 that the law known as Senate Bill 3 violates the New Hampshire Constitution by “burdening the fundamental right to vote” and because it has an unequal impact on certain people in the state, primarily young people, college students and people who frequently relocate to different communities. The Supreme Court justices will now prescreen the appeal and will decide whether to accept or decline the case, a court spokesperson said. If it is accepted, a briefing schedule will be issued. After the briefs are filed, the court will decide whether to hold oral arguments or whether to decide the case based on the written briefs.</span></p>

The appeal by board Commissioner Andrew Spano and other members came a day after the June 23 primary was reinstated by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan, who said canceling it would be unconstitutional and deprive withdrawn presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang of proper representation at the Democratic convention. Torres said there was enough time before the primary to plan how to carry it out safely.</span></p>

On Wednesday, lawyers representing GOP lawmakers on one side and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice on the other side argued over whether that “legislative privilege” is absolute, or if there are instances when it can be broken.</span></p>

Olivia Thorne, president of the League of Women Voters of Delaware County, told the <em>DelCo Times</em> that the decision to intervene was based in part on the league trying to ensure no legitimate, eligible voters are wrongly removed. “Why do this right before a presidential election?” she asked. “We work very hard all the time trying to register voters, and the idea that people would be taken off the list when they registered for the last presidential (election), it’s sort of frustrating in some ways. … This is what we’re really trying to avoid, is having people disenfranchised.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked the</span><a href="https://www.hppr.org/post/texas-attorney-general-asks-state-supreme-court-weigh-ballot-mail-fight"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Texas Supreme Court to weigh in on the state&#8217;s vote-by-mail laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bypassing a state appeals court. The Texas Democratic Party sued state and local election officials in March to get clarification on whether state law allows voters who don&#8217;t want to risk exposure to the coronavirus to use mail-in ballots during elections in July and November. A Travis County district judge sided with the plaintiffs.

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>VoteAmerica</strong>: Debra Cleaver, who first launched Vote.org  in 2008 but parted ways with the organization last year has launched a new get out the vote effort called</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/voteamerica-launch-debra-cleaver-vote-org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VoteAmerica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Tech Crunch, VoteAmerica’s goal is to boost voter turnout by helping people vote by mail. “It seems at this point that Americans are either going to be unable or unwilling to vote in person in the November election, which could lead to catastrophically low turnout,” Cleaver said in an interview with TechCrunch. “But if we have our way, there will be no perceivable dip in turnout in November.” Cleaver describes VoteAmerica as a lean team with deep experience—and one ready to hit the ground running. According to TechCrunch, using fax APIs, VoteAmerica is building out a system that allows voters to request a vote-by-mail application just by taking a photo of their signature. VoteAmerica’s tool then uses code to put the signature in the right spot on the form and then programmatically faxes it to the relevant local election official. “This is kind of wonky because we’re using truly antiquated technology to modernize the vote-by-mail process,” Cleaver said. “But if you have a mobile device—and 87% of Americans have a smartphone—we’re building technology that lets you sign up directly from your mobile device without printing and mailing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Montana</strong>: Four Montana organizations launched an online portal to encourage voter registration. The Forward Montana Foundation, Montana Women Vote, MontPIRG, and Western Native Voice hove a long history of registering eligible Montanans to vote at events, in local businesses, and on college campuses. The groups are now collaborating on an</span><a href="http://www.charkoosta.com/news/groups-launch-online-voter-portal/article_83d5a1ae-9557-11ea-8027-3f232b31ba19.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help Montanans register to vote. “With the drastic reduction of in-person voter registration efforts, Montanans needed a creative solution to make voter registration more accessible,” said Kelly Armington, Board Choir of MontPIRG. “This safe, secure, and non-partisan website will ensure that every eligible resident is able to get registered to vote even during this pandemic.”</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</span></p>
