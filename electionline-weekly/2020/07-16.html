Perhaps you have; perhaps you keep meaning to get around to browsing its resources—there’s so much happening all at once this election year. It can seem like every hour brings a new problem, a different news cycle to digest and adjust for.</p>
<p>This year’s roller coaster primary season has brought into sharp relief the potentially catastrophic impact of COVID-19 this fall, if appropriate precautions are not taken. Several states delayed their primaries, with the hope the virus would be more manageable later on; others took steps to expand mail balloting, often without the necessary infrastructure to handle it. Still others forged ahead with in-person voting, leading voters to risk their lives to cast a ballot and endangering the poll workers assisting them. Each of these springtime experiments in democracy under unprecedented conditions provides valuable data that can be used to ensure similar mistakes are not repeated in the fall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5780" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-11.32.52-AM-300x65.png" alt="" width="300" height="65" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-11.32.52-AM-300x65.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-11.32.52-AM-1024x222.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-11.32.52-AM-768x166.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-11.32.52-AM.png 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This spring, scholars at MIT and Stanford initiated a program to address the unprecedented and ongoing threat that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to the 2020 Election. The<a href="http://healthyelections.org"> Stanford-MIT Project on a Healthy Election</a> will bring academics and election administration experts together to assess and promote best practices to ensure the 2020 election can proceed with integrity, safety, and equal access.</p>
<p>“The nation’s election administrators know what steps are necessary to ensure a successful election in November,” said<a href="http://www.persily.com"> Nathaniel Persily</a>, the James B. McClatchy Professor Law at Stanford and former Senior Research Director of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration.  “They simply need the resources and the assistance to make the transition to mail balloting and safe polling-place voting.”  The Stanford-MIT Project seeks to draw on the extensive knowledge of those in the trenches administering elections to establish best practices necessary to run an election under pandemic conditions.</p>

<p>“In the next few weeks and months, states and localities will be finalizing their plans to implement safe and secure voting environments for the upcoming primaries, and ultimately the November general elections,” said Charles Stewart III, Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science at MIT, Director of the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, and Co-Director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project.  “Lessons brought together from the private sector and the academy will help ensure that this planning results in a safe environment that ensures access to the polls for all.”</p>
<p>Professors Stewart and Persily direct the new Stanford-MIT initiative.  They worked together previously on the Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA) in 2013, which produced a set of recommendations to deal, in particular, with long polling place lines evident in the 2012 election, as well as other problems, such as running elections during natural disasters.</p>
<p>Most recently, the project launched a new <a href="https://healthyelections.org/">website</a>, featuring tools, research, and other resources to address the ongoing threat that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to the 2020 elections. The resources available on the site are expanding every week, as teams at all of the partners in the project produce analysis of state primary elections, tools for calculating resources needed at polling places with new COVID-19 restrictions, and thorough resource guides on important topics like voting by mail.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone committed to safe, healthy elections to explore the research, data, and other resources on the website, and to contribute to the new “Idea Bank,” which encourages contribution and dialogue from academics, non-profits, the public, and election officials in the trenches. Learn more and browse the site at: <a href="http://healthyelections.org/">healthyelections.org</a>.</p>

Voters in<a href="https://www.waaytv.com/content/news/Madison-Co-voters-571769771.html"> Madison County</a> who cast in-person ballots said they felt completely safe on Tuesday. &#8220;Quick and easy and I felt 100% safe,&#8221; Jonathan Grizzard, a voter, told WAAY. &#8220;I think it shows how much they [elections officials and poll workers] care about the process themselves because I know it takes a lot of work to do this all day and I think it&#8217;s just as important to them as it is to us to make sure people get their voices heard through their vote.” Voters in<a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/polling-locations-in-mobile-take-precautions-against-covid-19-but-masks-not-mandatory"> Mobile County</a> also appreciated the safety measures the county had taken for Tuesday. “Everyone had masks on. They had shields, they had the distancing, and so it was very good,” Cynthia Williams, a voter, shared.<a href="https://whnt.com/news/voter-claims-they-were-turned-away-from-polling-place-in-madison-county-for-not-wearing-a-mask/"> Masks</a> were not required to vote on Tuesday in Alabama and there was one reported incident in Madison County where a voter claimed they were turned away for not wearing a mask. Madison County Probate Judge Frank Barger confirmed to WHTN that he was notified and took immediate action to ensure the couple could vote. He says he will review the incident and ensure this does not happen again. He emphasized this was an isolated incident and this did not occur anywhere else in the county on Tuesday. And it wouldn’t be an election day without something weird happening and on Tuesday that happened in the<a href="https://www.annistonstar.com/news/man-charged-with-terrorist-threat-at-oxford-polling-place/article_11891a2a-c6be-11ea-a0d6-1b61cef50213.html"> City of Oxford</a> where a man was charged with making a terrorist threat after he allegedly threatened to start shooting up a polling place.</p>

Before polls opened for Saturday’s primary,<a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/orleans-registrar-4000-mail-in-ballot-requests-sat-at-post-office/33279835"> Orleans Parish</a> was reporting that around 4,000 mail-in ballot requests sat in a local postal facility for an undetermined amount of time because of “short-paid postage.” The registrar’s office worked overtime to fulfill the requests and a regional spokesman for the Postal Service said employees were “brought up to speed” on the agencies policies for delivering election mail. Equipment problems caused a reporting delay in<a href="https://www.wafb.com/2020/07/11/ebr-election-results-delayed/"> East Baton Rouge Parish</a>. In<a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/politics/article_1a57bb8a-c546-11ea-84ee-c370fe710d22.html"> Lafayette Parish</a>, elections officials said they receive about 250 calls on primary day mostly from people complaining that they couldn&#8217;t vote for the candidate of their choice in the closed-primary presidential preference election. All of the problems were because the individuals were registered with one political party and wanted to vote for a candidate in the other political party, Lafayette Parish Registrar of Voters Charlene Menard said Monday.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5777" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MEWelcome-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MEWelcome-199x300.jpg 199w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MEWelcome.jpg 662w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" />Maine:</strong> It was a quiet day at the polls for Maine’s delayed primary with an “<a href="https://martinsvillebulletin.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/primary-voters-use-unprecedented-number-of-absentee-ballots/article_db35c441-709a-523a-822c-9db75d858db7.html">unprecedented</a>” number of people choosing to cast their ballots by mail instead of in-person. For those voters that did show up on Tuesday, they reported finding<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/post/poll-workers-report-low-person-turnout-maine-s-primary-election"> well-spaced polling places with clean conditions</a>. “Having some reservations about going into a crowded area, especially since I share a household with other housemates who are trying to avoid crowds,” Sam Mansfield told Maine Public Radio. “It felt like there were fewer than 15 people in that building and a lot of space between us, so I feel very comfortable.” Social distancing and the morning rush did cause some lines in York. “Between 9 and 9:15, we had more people lined up to vote than we could accommodate,” said Town Moderator Russell Osgood. By 11 a.m., the<a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200714/maine-voters-navigate-first-pandemic-primary"> morning rush</a> had passed, but turnout was steady. “We have about 15 people working the polls,” Town Clerk Mary-Anne Szeniawski told York Weekly “And there is a 50-person limit under the state guidelines.” “Everyone was cooperative,” said Szeniawski. There were no reports of issues with voters wearing<a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/07/14/politics/pandemic-curbs-maines-in-person-primary-election-turnout-but-many-already-voted-absentee/"> masks</a> as have occurred in some other primaries. “I’ve voted in every election since I’ve been eligible when I turned 18. To me, this is no different,” Fred Grooms, 60, of Presque Isle told the Bangor Daily News. “Yeah, you have the mask and stuff, but you know what, if wearing this can save even one person, I’m more than happy to do it.”<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maine-secretary-state-talks-voter-turnout-election-safety-during-pandemic"> Secretary of State Matt Dunlap</a> spent most of Tuesday driving around visiting polling sites. “It&#8217;s going very smoothly. You know, we spent the last three months trying to figure out what this election was going to look like, and thinking about how do you conduct an election at the time of a pandemic, something that we&#8217;ve never had to do — we haven&#8217;t had to do this in over 100 years. And the time that we&#8217;ve devoted to this, and working with the clerks, and listening to what people&#8217;s concerns were, and what we had to do to protect people, I think it&#8217;s really paid off today,” Dunlap told Maine Public Radio.</p>

While there were some technical issues, there were few reports of problems with lines. Voters were not required to wear masks in polling places, although many did there were no reports of issues between voters and poll workers over mask wearing as has been reported elsewhere this election season. In<a href="https://theleadernews.com/in-person-voting-goes-more-smoothly-than-expected/"> Harris County</a>, there were plexiglass dividers between voters and election workers, and everyone inside the voting room was wearing a mask. Voters also received rubber finger covers so their skin did not make contact with the voting machines. “It felt very safe to be in there,” voter Kari Noser told the <em>Leader News.</em> “It was not as scary or bad as I thought it would be.” In<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2020/07/14/north-texas-voters-find-sanitized-process-at-polls-in-mostly-smooth-trial-run-for-november/"> Dallas County</a>, there were concerns about a lack of poll workers, but things went relatively smoothly on Tuesday.  “The biggest issue occurred prior to the election when 10% of the election judges withdrew due to the post-opening flare-up of COVID-19,” Dallas County Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Donovan told the <em>Dallas News</em>. “We have taken great precautions to protect our voters and election workers, including sanitizing vote centers and providing masks and gloves.”<a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/your-local-election-hq/election-day-travis-county-spends-1-million-in-response-to-covid-19-to-keep-voters-safe/"> Travis County</a> spent about $1 million to enhance safety at the polling places and that seems to have paid off based on initial reports. Voters in<a href="https://www.keranews.org/post/polling-places-voters-take-precautions-election-day"> Fort Worth</a> were pleased with the efforts elections officials took to keep them safe. “I came prepared with my own hand sanitizer and wipes, just to be on the safe side. I figured, couldn’t be any worse than going to the grocery store, and sure enough it wasn’t,” voter Malcolm Beaty told KERA.<a href="https://www.gainesvilleregister.com/news/local_news/clerk-runoff-election-went-smoothly/article_33413746-c6e7-11ea-bdcd-6bcde1cb3dce.html"> Cooke County</a> Clerk Pam Harrison said her election night may have been on the fastest ever. “I’m very proud of all the voters…” Harrison said. “We only had to resolve four ballots last night [July 14]. That’s probably the quickest we’ve ever been done.” There were some non-COVID related issues that popped up Tuesday. In<a href="https://www.reporternews.com/story/news/2020/07/15/results-tuesdays-joint-primary-election-suffered-slight-delays/5443878002/"> Taylor County</a>, a delay in receiving results from an Abilene voting center, plus website issues, pushed the first results of the runoff to just before 9 p.m. Tuesday, said Freda Raga, elections administrator for Taylor County. But there were no glitches with any of the county&#8217;s voting equipment itself, and results were processed quickly once information from election judges was received, Ragan said. In<a href="https://www.easttexasmatters.com/news/your-local-election-hq/check-in-machine-briefly-down-at-chapel-hill-voting-location-no-votes-affected/"> Smith County</a>, an e-poll book at one voting location briefly experienced some problems. According to Smith County Elections Coordinator Karen Nelson, there were no problems with the voting machines themselves, and no ballots were affected. Voters were asked to wait patiently or advised that they could go to another location if they were pressed for time.

A<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/14/texas-coronavirus-mail-in-ballot/"> Travis County couple who had been diagnosed with COVID</a> the week before the election and wanted to still cast their ballots discovered at a positive diagnosis was not enough to provide them with an emergency absentee ballot. They would need a doctor’s note for that. Linda Harrison was able to get a note in time before the polls closed, but her husband was not and he was unable to cast a ballot on Tuesday. According to Texas Public Radio, about 68,000 other Texans were diagnosed with the disease since July 2.<a href="https://www.tpr.org/post/texas-problems-polls-covid-positive-voters"> Elections advocates</a> said they heard from about a half dozen but suspect many more. “The state of Texas has thrown up roadblock after roadblock to make voting more difficult,” said Mimi Marziani, Texas Civil Rights Project resident. “This is what voter suppression looks like in the year 2020. It is death by 1000 cuts.” And it wouldn’t be an election day in America without at least one feel-good story and this Tuesday’s story came from Tarrant County where<a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/after-114-days-in-hospital-covid-19-survivor-votes-on-way-home-drinks-bourbon/2406672/"> COVID survivor Billy Szendrey</a>, 64, was released from the hospital on Tuesday after 114 days including eight weeks on a ventilator and on the way home, he stopped to vote and showed off an “I Voted” sticker on his mask. Well done Billy, well done.</p>

According to The Post, analysts say the documents present a stark reimagining of the USPS that could chase away customers — especially if the Administration gets the steep package rate increases it wants — and put the already beleaguered agency in deeper financial peril as private-sector competitors embark on hiring sprees to build out their own delivery networks. The Postal Service said in a statement that it was “developing a business plan to ensure that we will be financially stable and able to continue to provide reliable, affordable, safe and secure delivery of mail, packages and other communications to all Americans as a vital part of the nation’s critical infrastructure.” The Post also has a story this week about some of the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/scattered-problems-with-mail-in-ballots-this-year-signal-potential-november-challenges-for-postal-service/2020/07/15/0dfb8b42-c216-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues the Postal Service has faced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with vote by mail during the 2020 primary season. “As we anticipate that many voters may choose to use the mail to participate in the upcoming elections due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are conducting . . . outreach with state, county and local election officials and Secretaries of State so that they can make informed decisions and educate the public about what they can expect when using the mail to vote,” the statement said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stories from the Post comes the same week that an analysis from National Public Radio found that in the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arrived past the deadline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often through no fault of the voter. Also this week, the U.S. Postal Service’s internal watchdog released a report on the</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/report-wisconsin-election-officials-sent-absentee-ballots-out-last-minute"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wisconsin primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and found that hundreds of absentee ballots never made it to voters or went uncounted because of postmark problems. And in a speech in Georgia this week, the president</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-tells-ups-workers-to-be-careful-with-mail-in-ballots/2020/07/15/1389aa21-f636-448c-835c-030035379cff_video.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continued his campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against mail-in ballots and even seemed to imply in his speech that UPS delivered mail ballots.</span></p>

According to The Houston Chronicle, tax Assessor-Collector Ann Harris Bennett and former Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman, who are both Democrats, opposed the move. Bennett in a letter to court members said her office successfully was registering voters, and she expressed doubt an independent administrator would be an improvement. “Checks and balances will be lost with elections and voter registration managed by one office only,” Bennett wrote. “In counties with election administrators, the lack of accountability between voter registrars and election clerks has caused the type of problem that erodes public trust.” The court plans to hire an elections administrator as soon as next month, though the office would not begin official operations until Nov. 18. County Clerk Chris Hollins, who supports the adoption of the elections administrator model, will remain in charge of the Nov. 3 general election.</span></p>

The changes adjust the administration of vote centers and help clerks account for the emergency closure of polling places. Among the changes, county clerks would be able to close or alter the hours of any polling site, but would need to relocate operations to a backup facility if the closure would drop the number of polling places below the minimum required by law. Clerks must also notify tribal nations that border their jurisdictions of their right to have a voter service and polling location within their borders. There is guidance for verifying the registration status of voters, and instructions for clerks to maintain a supply of provisional ballots equal to 10% of the turnout in the previous election where similar offices were on the ballot. Finally, the rules contain provisions related to the testing of equipment and the risk-limiting audit, which validates the accuracy of election results.</span></p>

The Raise a Glass to Democracy voter registration campaign began as a brainstorm between the secretary of state’s office and Rhinegeist Brewery. With their creative support, more than 30 Ohio breweries have signed up to create a beer using a universal label designed to encourage civic engagement and boost voter registration. Most breweries are expected to have their beers ready for sale at their respective locations by early September, well ahead of the October 5th registration deadline. The label promotes the VoteOhio.gov website while also allowing each brewer to include their own branding. “It is widely thought that many of the ideas for the American Revolution began in pubs with people getting together and talking about how they didn’t want to be under the oppression of the monarch anymore. The idea of democracy going together with beer drinking is very compatible,” said LaRose. “You can have your opinion, state you opinion, you can share it on social media, or you can go to public demonstrations, but unless you register and vote you are missing an important part of the civic process.” Apologies to everyone who may now have</span><a href="https://youtu.be/3vqwrepaMR0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Story of Tonight”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Hamilton stuck in their heads.</span></p>

They now have to process new voter registration and changes that require a new ballot within two days, then get a ballot out within one business day. Replacement ballots also have to go out within a day. Within 11 days of an election, ballots must be sent by first class mail to help ensure they get there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The Bolton Charter Review Commission has been meeting since the beginning of the year on a variety of issues including</span><a href="https://www.journalinquirer.com/towns/bolton/charter-review-body-could-endorse-coin-toss-for-tied-elections-among-other-reforms/article_d321e4fa-c50b-11ea-87f3-036fa5add7f7.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how to break ties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in elections. Currently tied elections may be settled either through special election, or a coin toss, whichever the candidates decide. However the charter review commission is considering making coin tosses the default solution to tied elections. In addition to the fun nature of such a tiebreaker, commission member Jim Aldrich said the coin toss could save taxpayers between $3,000 to $5,000 for the cost of holding a special election.</span></p>

The voting bill would, among other things, allow for no-excuse absentee voting and would set up online voter registration next year. Democrats say the changes would modernize the state voting system and make elections more secure. In his veto message, Sununu noted that the secretary of state has already said people can vote absentee this year if they have concerns about COVID-19.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

The legislation was passed by the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday evening with the two Republican members of the committee voting in opposition. One bill, would allow voters to cast ballots up to 20 days before the election in a regular vote-counting machine at their city or town hall. The second bill would send a mail ballot application to every registered voter, as Rhode Island did for the June presidential primary, to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus at polling places.</span></p>

The League of Women Voters sued the state in May, arguing that absentee ballots should be allowed to be received after Election Day as long as they are postmarked on or before Election Day. The Court found the restriction was not “a severe burden on the right to vote” and therefore was constitutional. “&#8230;[A] voter is not required to mail his or her absentee ballot. Rather, the voter or an immediate family member may deliver the ballot in person to the city or township clerk, or, if requested, the clerk must pick up the ballot or send an election assistant to pick up the ballot,” the Court said in its opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri</strong>: Cole County Judge Jon Beetem denied the motion for a preliminary injunction sought by the Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters that would have immediately made it easier for Missourians to</span><a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/missouri-judge-denies-injunction-in-mail-in-ballot-case/article_0626da0b-594a-541b-a725-7d26d8ae6a42.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote with a mail-in ballot during the coronavirus pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The lawsuit seeks to allow all Missourians to cast absentee ballots without notarization in 2020. The Missouri Supreme Court sent the lawsuit back for further review, ruling last month that Beetem was wrong to dismiss it. Beetem said Friday the groups presented no new arguments. “Absent evidence that the ‘consistently effective social distancing and related strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19’ could not be employed in the notary circumstances, the court concludes that plaintiffs have not made a convincing showing of irreparable harm from the notarization requirement for mail-in ballots,” he wrote.</span></p>

That lawsuit is meant to entail “the court to rule on the validity of the casting or canvassing, or refusal to cast or canvass, any such ballots,” in efforts to modify the anticipated result of the ongoing recount, which began July 8 at the headquarters on the Bronx’s Grand Concourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in New York, the League of Women Voters of New York State and the League of Women Voters of the United States joined a federal lawsuit in order to limit the number of</span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/ny-state-of-politics/2020/07/09/lawsuit-filed-over-absentee-ballot-rejections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot rejections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the complaint, New York rejected 14 percent of absentee ballots in 2018 and for the past two election cycles. The state&#8217;s ballot rejection rate has been among the highest in the country. The lawsuit asks that the state provide a way for voters who have their ballots rejected to have enough time to fix a signature error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Legislative Republicans have called on the courts to lift an injunction and require voter to present</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/republicans-press-again-to-require-photo-id-at-nc-polls-this-year/19181945/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> photo identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the polls this November, saying a bill they passed earlier this year should satisfy the last arguments against the rule. There are two lawsuits seeking – so far, successfully – to block the state&#8217;s voter ID requirement: one state and one federal. Republican lawmakers filed</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/news/state/nccapitol/document/19181947/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a motion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state case last week, asking judges to drop their injunction against the state&#8217;s voter ID law. They argued that a provision included in House Bill 1169 earlier this year should satisfy the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in North Carolina, the ACLU and the organization’s North Carolina chapter have sued state lawmakers in an effort to eliminate the</span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article244146932.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> witness requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for voting by mail. “No one should be forced to choose between their health and their vote,” said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “Removing the witness requirements in the middle of a deadly pandemic just makes sense. It is an obvious and common-sense solution that protects people’s health and their right to vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Pennsylvania</strong>: The Pennsylvania Democratic Party is suing the state’s top elections agency and all 67 county election boards over the commonwealth’s</span><a href="https://papost.org/2020/07/13/pa-democrats-file-suit-in-state-court-to-counter-election-rules-case-filed-by-trump-campaign/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote-by-mail process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The case focuses on ballot return deadlines, ballot drop off procedures and other mail-in voting issues. But it also seeks a court order that would essentially counter claims made in the federal lawsuit initiated two weeks ago by President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. The Democrats’ suit, for example, seeks to maintain the current requirement that poll watchers reside in the county where they’re working. The Trump campaign’s lawsuit argues that Pennsylvania residents should be able to serve as poll watchers anywhere in the state. Democrats also are asking the court to clarify that counties can come up with their own ballot collection plans and require counties to accept mail-in ballots submitted without a secrecy envelope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>South Carolina</strong>: In a joint agreement filed last week, state Election Commission officials said they intend to</span><a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/sc-election-officials-agree-to-provide-prepaid-postage-for-absentee-ballots/article_5fbc3fc2-c1ed-11ea-a66c-835742fd1988.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide prepaid postage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all absentee ballot return envelopes this year, regardless of the number of voters who qualify and take advantage of absentee voting by mail, eliminating the need for any further legal action on the issue. Several Democratic Party organizations and individual voters complained in federal court earlier this year about the requirement that voters pay for postage to return their absentee ballots by mail, arguing it presents an undue burden on the right to vote and effectively serves as a poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee</strong>: Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle ruled this week that state officials are</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2020-07-14/groups-absentee-ruling-didnt-exclude-new-tennessee-voters"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not in contempt of court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they keep enforcing a Tennessee law barring many first-time voters from casting absentee ballots, despite her decision that all eligible voters can vote by mail during the coronavirus pandemic. In her ruling, Lyle said voting rights groups that sued for the absentee expansion did not explicitly ask her to block the separate law, which requires voters who register by mail to appear in person during their first election. She allowed the groups to request to amend her ruling that has temporarily expanded by-mail voting, but cautioned not to interpret that as a decision whether or not those voters are eligible under her ruling.</span></p>

Cooper pleaded guilty to one count of attempt to defraud the residents of West Virginia of a fair election and one count of injury to the mail. The Pendleton County clerk noticed that party affiliations seem to have been altered on eight absentee ballot request forms. The clerk reported that to the secretary of state which began an investigation. “In West Virginia, every vote counts and those that attempt to disrupt our democratic processes will be held accountable for their actions,” Secretary of State Mac Warner said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in West Virginia, Tess Bishop, daughter of the Harpers Ferry mayor Wayne Bishop, has pleaded guilty to</span><a href="https://www.localdvm.com/news/daughter-of-harpers-ferry-mayor-commits-voter-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illegal voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tess Bishop, who registered to vote in Utah in March of 2019, was charged with “unlawfully and knowingly” voting in the June 2019 Harpers Ferry election where her father was up for re-election.</span></p>

States are scored on dimensions such as requesting, completing, and submitting a mail-in ballot, resulting in grades from A-F. Only seven states received an A grade. These include deep blue states such as California, purple states such as Colorado, and red states such as Utah. Except for California and D.C., these are all states that have used universal vote-by-mail successfully in past major elections. The remaining states allow for absentee voting—but there are huge variations in the ease of applying for, receiving, and submitting a valid absentee ballot. While the report maintains that the safest way to vote in an election is by mail, it acknowledges that in-person voting will take place. In order to preserve the integrity of the November elections, the authors recommend coupling reforms that make it easier to vote from home with reforms that keep as many in-person polling places as possible open and safe this November.   Lead researcher and founding director of CEPM<a href="http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=EwmB7COBsaS8lxNUfdBIH0UzMH1lLXNHEipymcoMceB505o-2FUV7YGE8-2B-2Fol-2BvjfPIAf2RgDcHP9lTUQ8fvRKW9Xmc0Fbk9ZimhK1-2FaNOr0UM53FR22Pv-2B-2Brh25CwdszqaKFJbwur6bASXIfcJqmm67z6KhtN3U82-2Bu-2Fn8AW8tN4-3D6LP5_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMBika2X1civNqZGheaL3a7XCFpWLIl53YDCIjVUkb3A9LpZ4LMsUOj7Wc0V7yt0CJ-2Bzm5Yzvy7I-2BgyELIwNsj3dCIQEQUr-2FcLQxDmRwdI3haHq6uyqE75jgDgQCuoSjol8hsJGbRYkMsaXhTsEtgZOjZgfTb7qLqKpOJRuR4VkEH-2FHTl8oct4mlLfIA57uJvEu7m638e9bR6dJqGNSiSe1eTfQK44iBlXmCv9ZfoinFmZan4TnNOybmHtO73Y1-2FV9wOKcxtb4vS2vU4XW9Sd93o1Cy911P9L6TR5Pf3knPTPT7jDNN9U3Gf5bCmOqhKQemdQAswbg80-2FHic0PDDE189g-3D-3D"> Elaine Kamarck writes</a> that, “The integrity of in-person voting in November requires recruiting and training new poll workers&#8230;It means keeping as many polling places open as possible and letting people know that they are open to reduce wait times.

The training consists of both video and written materials separated into three modules, Cybersecurity 101, 201, and 301.</p>
<p>The training was developed by the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) and is delivered through their online platform. The training is designed specifically for election administrators and provides foundational knowledge on cybersecurity terminology, best practices in election offices, practical application, and communication.</p>

The EAC is currently engaged in an agency-wide effort to update, collect, and produce new materials in support of the EAC mission.</p>

This partnership with the Center for Tech and Civic Life allows us to offer quality training and resources in direct support of local election officials and their critical mission,” said EAC Vice Chair Donald Palmer.</p>
