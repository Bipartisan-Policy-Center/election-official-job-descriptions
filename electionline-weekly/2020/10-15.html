							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Countdown to November 3: Voting on voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administration-related ballot measures in 2020</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in 32 states will decide 120 statewide ballot measures on November 3, 2020. In nine of those states, voters will make decisions on 11 elections-related ballot measures including ranked choice voting, felon re-enfranchisement and suffrage for 17-year-olds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also a handful of local elections-related on the ballot including suffrage for 16-year-olds in certain contests in Oakland and San Francisco and ranked choice in Boulder, Colorado and the fate of the City of Denver elections director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts kept some measures off the ballot this year including an attempt to repeal ranked choice voting in</span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2020/09/22/maine-high-court-clears-way-for-ranked-choice-voting-in-presidential-contest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a plan to implement ranked choice in</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/north-dakota-high-court-blocks-election-reform-measure-from-november-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, with the decennial Census count currently taking place, many had anticipated that redistricting ballot measures would lead the way, but there are only three this year, in</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_3,_Redistricting_Process_and_Criteria,_Lobbying,_and_Campaign_Finance_Amendment_(2020)"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia_Question_1,_Redistricting_Commission_Amendment_(2020)"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New Jersey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia_Question_1,_Redistricting_Commission_Amendment_(2020)"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Missouri proposal would eliminate the nonpartisan state demographer and use a bipartisan commission appointed by the governor again for legislative redistricting and alter the criteria used to draw district maps. The New Jersey proposal would postpone the state legislative redistricting process until after the election on November 2, 2021, if the state receives federal census data after February 15, 2021, keep the current state legislative districts in place until 2023; and use the delayed timeline in future redistricting cycles if the census data is received after February 15. And Virginia’s measure would transfer the power to draw the state&#8217;s congressional and legislative districts from the state legislature to a redistricting commission composed of state legislators and citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alabama<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5775" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ALWelcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><br />
</strong></span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alabama_Amendment_1,_Citizenship_Requirement_for_Voting_Measure_(2020)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would amend the Alabama Constitution to state that “only a citizen” of the U.S. who is  18 years old or older can vote in Alabama. Sen. Del Marsh (R-12) introduced the constitutional amendment as Senate Bill 313 (SB 313) during the 2019 legislative session. On May 8, 2019, the Alabama State Senate approved SB 313 in a vote of 27-0 with eight members (three Democrats and five Republicans) absent or not voting. On May 30, 2019, the state House passed the measure in a vote of 87-0 with 14 Democratic members abstaining and 3 members (two Democrats and one Republican) absent or not voting.</span></p>

Ballot Measure 2 would also require persons and entities that contribute more than $2,000 that were themselves derived from donations, contributions, dues, or gifts to disclose the true sources, as defined in the law, of the political contributions. It took a</span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/06/12/alaska-supreme-court-approves-election-reform-ballot-measure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the state’s Supreme Court to get the measure on the ballot after the state had argued that the measure should be split into</span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/02/20/state-challenges-ballot-measure-that-would-install-ranked-choice-voting-statewide/?clearUserState=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two separate issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

As of 2020, the California Constitution disqualifies people with felonies from voting until their imprisonment and parole are completed. Numerous city councils including</span><a href="https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-city-council-supports-restoring-voting-rights-to-parolees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> San Jose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Los Angeles have come out in support of Prop. 17.</span></p>

About one-third of all states allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 at the time of the general election to vote in the primary.</span></p>

Currently in Colorado, 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the time of the general election are permitted to vote the primary. This amendment would end that.</span></p>

On November 3, voters will decide whether to uphold or repeal the law.</span></p>

Currently, council members pick the mayor, similar to the way leadership is chosen in Congress. Residents vote in council members, and the mayor is selected via majority vote of his or her peers. This measure, if passed, would allow voters to elect the mayor themselves using ranked choice voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver 2I: If voters approve Initiative 2I the</span><a href="https://denverite.com/2020/10/08/elections-ballot-measure-director-of-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director of elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will no longer be guaranteed in the city’s seminal legal document. But according to Denverite, doesn’t mean the position would cease to exist, at least under the watch of Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López. “That position isn’t going away,” López told Denverite. “That position will continue to exist in our organization. It’s just won’t be spelled out by charter.” If approved the initiative would give the city clerk six appointees although only one—deputy clerk—would be guaranteed.</span></p>

The current constitution says “Every citizen…” and the new language would say “Only a citizen…” Citizen Voters, Inc. a Florida-based 501(C)4 is behind the amendment while it’s opposed by such groups as the League of Women Voter and the ACLU.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_3,_Top-Two_Open_Primaries_for_State_Offices_Initiative_(2020)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if approved would establish a top-two primary system in the Sunshine state. The top-two primary would apply to state legislators, governor and cabinet.  Amendment 3 would replace closed primaries with top-two primaries in which all candidates would be placed on one ballot regardless of political affiliation and the top two candidates with the most votes would advance to the general election. A candidate’s party affiliation may appear on the ballot as provided by law. The primaries would also be open, meaning any registered voter, regardless of their political affiliation, could vote in the primary election</span></p>

Ranked-choice voting would be used in primary and general elections for all Massachusetts statewide offices, state legislative offices, federal congressional offices, and certain other offices beginning in 2022. Ranked-choice voting would not be used in elections for president, county commissioner, or regional district school committee member. If approved this would make Massachusetts the largest state (population-wise) to use ranked choice. Many media outlets have covered the issue and it proponents and opponents. WBUR in Boston recently held a</span><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/10/14/wbur-debate-question-2-ranked-choice-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the topic.</span></p>

It also guarantees voters can have their ballots recorded accurately based on a uniform, statewide standard, among other rights. First introduced as a joint resolution in 2017, Question 4 passed the state Senate and Assembly that year and again in 2019 when it was then referred to the 2020 general election ballot.

No statewide elective office would be subject to adjustment. The proposed amendment also clarifies that officers elected to fill a vacancy in office shall take office on the first day of January following their election.</span></p>

Exacerbating the difficulty is a lack of public awareness of how this year’s conditions may affect the tempo of Election Night, the time it takes to tabulate ballots, and when results can be declared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These realities provide fodder for disinformation to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election process and results. We know influence operations are occurring before, during, and after election day. </span></p>

Turnout numbers have been huge, even record-breaking in some places. Lines have been long in many places. But other than volume there have been relatively few issues. In</span><a href="https://abc13.com/politics/fort-bend-co-officials-launch-voting-machine-investigation/6994610/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fort Bend County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, things got off to a rocky start after a voting system programming problem left all the polling places closed for a couple of hours on the first day of early voting. The county kept polls open till 7pm that day and increased early voting times through the week. In</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/13/texas-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tarrant County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the county was forced to temporarily shutter three early voting sites after a poll worker tested positive for COVID-19. All the poll workers who had trained with the affected poll worker had to be replaced and it took time to find those replacements.  In</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/voter-check-in-system-to-blame-for-slow-moving-lines-in-georgia/Z6BVSDEIQBDHVHDPDJ5I3OPDRQ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> officials are citing the statewide voter check-in system for causing some of the long lines witnessed throughout the state. Some early voting sites reported checking in just 10 voters per hour at each poll book. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger initially attributed the lines to high turnout, which is part of the reason for delays. But it became clear from interviews with poll workers, election officials and voters this week that technical difficulties contributed to severe waits. Raffensperger said Wednesday that he’s working with the state’s election software company to improve speeds and process voters more quickly. We’ve had our first reports dustups among people at the polls.

Our staff is trained to address the needs of the public and to provide good public service. We as a Board cannot let people disrupt this process nor create an unsafe atmosphere at the Board and/or for other potential voters.”</span></p>

Company chairman, Anthony Caudle, posted a message through a defense industry jobs site this week calling for former Special Operations forces to staff “security positions in Minnesota during the November Election and beyond to protect election polls, local businesses and residences from looting and destruction.” He said in an interview with <em>The Washington Post</em> he is planning to send a “large contingent” to Minnesota but did not specify the numbers. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) said in a statement Friday that he joined election officials in “strongly discouraging this unnecessary interference in Minnesota’s elections, which we have not asked for and do not welcome.” “Federal law and state law are both clear: No one may interfere with or intimidate a voter at a polling place,” he said. “The presence of armed outside contractors at polling places would constitute intimidation and violate the law. I request this company cease and desist any planning and stop making any statements about engaging in this activity.” In a statement, Secretary of State Steve Simon said, in part, “Any outside effort to supplement election judges or local law enforcement is counterproductive, unwelcome, and possibly unlawful.” Between this and the president’s call for an “army” of poll watchers to show up on Election Day, elections officials across the country are</span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/10/15/election-officials-prepare-for-voter-intimidation-threat"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preparing for potential problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Election Day. &#8220;My biggest concern, and both sides do this, is</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/14/2020-election-trump-army-poll-watchers-stirs-fears-violence/5908264002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> undermining confidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in elections across the board,&#8221; Trey Grayson,  former Kentucky secretary of state, told USA Today. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have people trust the outcome.

City Clerk Beth McEwen and assistant Lacy Davis even flew to Anchorage with two “suitcases” filled with more than a thousand ballots after voting had ended. McEwen said the city does plan to buy some of the equipment Anchorage has, like ballot scanners. The money has already been set aside for that. But there wasn’t enough time to buy them and set them up before the election. </span></p>

Depending on where you live, not everyone who votes by mail will get an “I Voted” sticker this year and even some folks who are voting in-person won’t get one either. Just chalk it up to one more thing 2020 has ruined. But into every darkness comes light and this week that light is Greg Sarafan, who</span><a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/10/12/new-jersey-man-making-sure-voters-dont-miss-out-on-i-voted-stickers-during-unique-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will send you an “I Voted” sticker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you don’t get one. “People have been saying the first time in 20 years I wasn’t going to get a sticker, or this is my first election and I was so disappointed that I had to do it by mail because I was excited to get a sticker,” Sarafan told CBS. So Sarafan created the Voting Sticker Project and if you message him after you vote he’ll send you a sticker. And not only do you get a sticker, but you also get some GOTV advocacy tools. “When I send a sticker, I send it with a letter. It has a QR code on it and it brings them to a voting resources website, that encourages them to get their friends and family to the polls,” Sarafan said. “The Voter Sticker Project is not about who you vote for, it’s about that you vote, and that you’re engaged.” Hats off to you Greg! And thank you for your service!</span></p>

The division is proud of the stickers and hope that the voters of Alaska enjoy them.” The stickers will be available in English, Spanish, Koyukon, Gwich’in, Aleut, Tagalog, Alutiiq, Northern Inupiaq, Nunivak Cup’ig and Yup’ik. For those who are voting by mail and still would like a sticker, digital versions are available on the Department of Elections web site. We’re not gonna lie, we LOVE them.</span></p>

The company obtained an order from a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia last week that gave Microsoft control of the Trickbot botnet, a global network it describes as the largest in the world. The company wants to disrupt hackers’ ability to operate with the election barely three weeks away. Run by Russian-speaking criminals, the botnet poses a “theoretical but real” threat to election integrity by launching ransomware attacks, in which data is rendered inaccessible unless the victim pays a ransom, said Tom Burt, Microsoft’s vice president of customer security and trust. While there is little fear that a botnet could alter the results, it could further erode voter confidence.</span></p>

A record number of Alaskans are voting absentee this year, and “improper or insufficient witnessing” has consistently been the top reason for rejected absentee ballots during the past few primary elections, according to Division of Elections statistics. State law ordinarily requires absentee voters to sign their ballots and get the signature of a witness who is at least 18 years old, but a group of Alaskans sued last month to pause the witness requirement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The witness requirement will not be enforced this year, though ballots&#8217; written instructions will still say that a second signature is required.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said voter registration will end on Thursday, instead of Oct. 23, concluding the extension posed a significant administrative burden on election officials who are now dealing with early voting. The court also said Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs would likely succeed in her appeal of the court order that extended the deadline. Arizona has recorded more than 43,000 new registrations in the week since the deadline was extended. People who have already completed registrations during the extension period will be allowed to vote in the Nov. 3 general election.

The tribal government&#8217;s immediate goal is to reopen the early in-person voting site that the Pima County Recorder&#8217;s Office closed in 2018 and a ballot drop-off site to operate October 26 &#8211; November 2. According to the lawsuit, the recorder&#8217;s office has closed an additional three early voting sites within the Tohono O&#8217;odham Nation since 2018. Though the Pascua Yaqui Tribe&#8217;s reservation is urban, the Tohono O&#8217;odham Nation is rural. It&#8217;s approximately the size of Connecticut and has one early in-person voting site in it.</span></p>

The suit alleges that Padilla violated the law in executing the contract for a voter outreach campaign. The contract for the campaign, dubbed “Vote Safe California” went to the political consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker. The scope of work from the Secretary of State’s Office said the campaign team “must include a (get-out-the-vote) targeting expert.” In its suit, the taxpayer association claims such a targeted effort could unfairly affect the result of the elections. “By focusing (i.e. ‘targeting’) the voter outreach, the political consulting firm can and will necessarily affect voter turnout of certain types of voters more than others and in some parts of the state more than others,” the suit said. “This can and will affect the outcomes of elections – indeed that is what targeted GOTV is intended to achieve.”</span></p>

Delaware law has long required that absentee ballots be received by the time polls close at 8 p.m. on Election Day. The same deadline applies to ballots cast under a universal vote-by-mail law enacted by the General Assembly specifically for this year’s elections because of the coronavirus. The League of Women Voters, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and a Wilmington attorney, did not argue that the deadline as applied in past elections was facially unconstitutional. They claimed instead that the new law is unconstitutional as applied to the November election because, even though it makes voting much easier, voting by mail is a burden for some people. “At the time the Vote-by-Mail statute was enacted, the absentee ballot deadline, which the plaintiffs agree was constitutional with respect to the law as it then existed, already required Election-Day ballot receipt,” the judge wrote. “I find nothing about the liberalization of the ability to mail ballots in the Act that created a constitutional violation. Those choosing to mail ballots have always had to vote sufficiently early to ensure delivery by Election Day.”</span></p>

Walker ruled that it was “an incredibly close call&#8221; but “the state’s interest in preventing chaos in its already precarious — and perennially chaotic — election outweighs the substantial burden imposed on the right to vote.” Walker cited testimony from Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley, who stated in an affidavit that a further extension would “serve to reinforce the confusion and mistrust voters have surrounding this election.&#8221; The additional time meant some supervisors would struggle to get new people on the rolls in time, meaning any voter who registered at the last minute would have to cast a provisional ballot when they showed up at the polls. Provisional ballots are not automatically counted, and voters must provide additional proof after the election to show they were eligible to vote.</span></p>

The activists argued that the system places an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote because voters cannot be confident their vote is accurately counted. The activists&#8217; challenge &#8220;presents serious system security vulnerability and operational issues that may place Plaintiffs and other voters at risk of deprivation of their fundamental right to cast an effective vote that is accurately counted,&#8221; Totenberg wrote in a 147-page order issued Sunday night. &#8220;The Court&#8217;s Order has delved deep into the true risks posed by the new BMD voting system as well as its manner of implementation,&#8221; Totenberg wrote. &#8220;These risks are neither hypothetical nor remote under the current circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

Brown said he disagreed with the plaintiffs’ contention that lines are “all but certain” to occur Nov. 3 after election officials made improvements since Georgia’s primary election. Brown wrote that election officials have recruited more poll workers, added tech support staff, increased voting locations and improved absentee voting options. “The evidence shows defendants have taken extensive measures to address the issues that caused long lines in the past,” Brown wrote in a 78-page order. “It is possible, of course, these measures will ultimately prove insufficient and long lines will still arise. But that is not the point; no one, including this court, can guarantee short lines.”</span></p>

Veterans, lawyers and a radio talk-show host living in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands filed a lawsuit Thursday because they can’t get access to absentee ballots for the Nov. 3 general election. “Disparate treatment with respect to voting is an especially grievous constitutional violation because voting is a fundamental right,” the lawsuit says. Lawyers for the plaintiffs are challenging the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act as well as a similar Hawaii law called the Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act. They argue that provisions in the UOCAVA and UMOVA, as the laws are known, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. If not for their current place of residence, the plaintiffs would otherwise be eligible to vote under the overseas voting laws. The lawsuit asks that the former Hawaii residents be allowed to participate in the presidential election by absentee ballot.  </span></p>

The decision from the 7th Circuit  means absentee ballots must once again be received by noon on Nov. 3 to be counted. U.S. Appeals Court Judge Frank Easterbrook in the decision said that, as long as Indiana allows in-person voting, &#8220;there is no constitutional right to vote by mail.&#8221; &#8220;It is rational to require absentee votes to be received by Election Day, just as in-person voting ends on Election Day,&#8221; Easterbrook wrote in the decision. Easterbrook added that &#8220;people who worry that mail will be delayed during the pandemic can protect themselves by using early in-person voting or posting their ballots early.&#8221; &#8220;Deadlines are essential to elections, as to other endeavors such as filing notices of appeal or tax returns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That some ballots are bound to arrive after any deadline does not justify judicial extensions of statutory time limits.&#8221;</span></p>

In Orleans Parish, that limits drop-off locations to City Hall and the Algiers courthouse. The Council and Orleans Parish Registrar’s Office planned to add locations across the city that would be staffed by the registrar’s employees. “The law requires the ballots be dropped off at the registrar&#8217;s office, so those curbside locations have to be at a registrar&#8217;s office,” Ardoin said on Oct. 8.

The race had been moved to a February special election under state law, following the sudden death of a candidate. In the ruling Wright questioned the language of the state law triggering the special election, noting it was created following the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone prior to the November 2002 election. In that case, the death of the incumbent also created a vacancy in the seat, as opposed to the death of an unelected nominee. The judge&#8217;s ruling also suggested that federal law would preempt the Minnesota statute in this case.</span></p>

Brasel ruled that the plaintiffs in the case — state Rep.

She said giving voters conflicting information after absentee ballots have gone out would create confusion. “This is a difficult genie to put back in the lamp,” Brasel ruled.</span></p>

The ruling has its roots in an April lawsuit filed by the Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters. They argued the Missouri law allowing individuals to cast an absentee ballot if they cannot vote in person due to “incapacity or confinement due to illness or physical disability” should apply to individuals who wished to stay home to avoid contracting COVID-19. Individuals who are eligible for an absentee ballot because of illness do not have to have their signature validated by a notary.</span></p>

Wimes’ initial ruling on Friday would have tweaked a controversial requirement for casting mail-in ballots by allowing voters to return mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 election in person. The current statute, enacted earlier this year by the Legislature, required that the ballots be sent by mail and that the ballot envelope be notarized. Wimes’ order did not address the notarization requirement. The state argued in its emergency motion seeking a stay that voting under the current process “is already in full swing,” and that almost 60,000 Missourians had already voted by absentee ballot as of Sept. 30. Local election authorities “lack the staff and resources to implement a new process midway through voting-by-mail,” the state argued. “This attempt to change the rules for voting-by-mail weeks after it started is like asking the Court to change the rules for in-person voting at noon on Election Day, after hundreds of thousands of voters have already cast their ballots. The relief far exceeds the proper role and authority of the federal courts.”</span></p>

Osteen criticized the NC State Board of Elections, saying it had misconstrued or misinterpreted findings he made in August in a way that changed election rules from what had been decided by the state lawmakers who hold authority under the U.S. Constitution to do so. Osteen told the board of elections Wednesday that it cannot accept ballots without witness signatures. He said the board can still allow voters to fix minor problems like addresses or signatures written on the wrong lines. The two other rule changes made by the settlement allows for the board for elections to continue collecting ballots through Nov. 9 if they are postmarked by 5 p.m. Nov. 3, Election Day. The other allows ballots to be counted if they are left in drop boxes at early-voting sites and elections offices.</span></p>

U.S. District Judge Dan Polster</span><a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/federal-court-ohio-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-ballot-drop-box-judge-dan-polster/5930499002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose&#8217;s order, which prohibited off-site drop boxes.   Polster found that limiting each county to one drop box location had a &#8220;disproportionate effect on people of color&#8221; living in more populous counties, imposing a &#8220;significant burden&#8221; on their right to vote.  &#8220;While it may be said that the 7,903 registered voters in Noble County may find a single drop box location sufficient, the record demonstrates that the 858,041 registered voters in Cuyahoga County will likely not,&#8221; wrote Polster, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton. Polster pointed out that limiting &#8220;outside&#8221; collection to board premises would ban Hamilton County election officials from doing what they did during the primary: going out with plastic trays to collect ballots from voters in vehicles waiting to deposit their ballots. LaRose appealed Polster’s ruling to the U.S.</span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/10/federal-appeals-court-keeps-ohio-drop-box-limit-in-place-while-case-is-reviewed.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which agreed to temporarily reinstate the limits. Judges Richard Griffin and Amul Thapar in an order Friday night sharply criticized Polster’s ruling. Griffin and Thapar said Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s decision to limit ballot drop boxes, used to store completed absentee ballots, to one site per county was reasonable, and sided with LaRose’s arguments that making a change during an election would pose a security risk. They also said legal precedent weighs against making late-stage changes to election procedures through the courts. “And these state interests, taken together, justify the burden that it places on this one method of voting in Ohio. Accordingly, we conclude that LaRose has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on appeal,” they wrote. (Scroll to the bottom of this post to read the full ruling.)</span></p>

The campaign sued earlier this month so poll watchers could be allowed inside Philly’s satellite election centers, like at City Hall. But the judge essentially said in his opinion these centers really are offices and not polling places, so the judge decided poll watchers should not be allowed. In his opinion, Common Pleas Judge Gary Glazer wrote: “The satellite offices where these activities, and only these activities, occur are true offices of the Board of Elections and are not polling places.” The campaign has</span><a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/10/12/trump-campaign-appeals-after-judge-denies-poll-watchers-access-to-philadelphia-satellite-election-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Court Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan has thrown out a lawsuit by the president’s campaign that tried to limit the swing state&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/10/922673818/judge-blocks-trump-campaign-attempt-to-limit-use-of-drop-boxes-in-pennsylvania"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use of drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the current presidential election. The lawsuit also challenged the Pennsylvania secretary of state&#8217;s guidance that mail-in ballots shouldn&#8217;t be rejected if the voter&#8217;s signature doesn&#8217;t match the one on file, and a state restriction that poll watchers be residents of the county where they are assigned. Ranjan, who wrote the opinion, was reluctant to second-guess the judgment of the state legislature and election officials. &#8220;Perhaps Plaintiffs are right that guards should be placed near drop boxes, signature-analysis experts should examine every mail-in ballot, poll watchers should be able to man any poll regardless of location, and other security improvements should be made,&#8221; Ranjan wrote. &#8220;But the job of an unelected federal judge isn&#8217;t to suggest election improvements, especially when those improvements contradict the reasoned judgment of democratically elected officials.&#8221; In his 138-page</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/08/show_temp.pl2_.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the also noted that the campaign had offered no hard evidence that voter fraud would actually occur. Instead, Ranjan wrote, the campaign had simply provided a series of &#8220;speculative&#8221; assumptions: They assume that &#8220;potential fraudsters&#8221; might try to fill drop boxes with forged ballots, and that the election security measures in place won&#8217;t work to prevent that fraud.</span></p>

Gregg Abbott’s order preventing counties from having more than one</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/11/texas-ballot-drop-off-locations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot drop-off sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On Saturday, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary stay of Pittman’s order meaning counties are currently still limited to one ballot drop-off site. In his ruling, Pitman said the governor&#8217;s directive confused voters and restricted voter access. “By limiting ballot return centers to one per county,” Pitman wrote, “older and disabled voters living in Texas&#8217;s largest and most populous counties must travel further distances to more crowded ballot return centers where they would be at an increased risk of being infected by the coronavirus in order to exercise their right to vote and have it counted.” In the appeal, Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Abbott’s order applied to a “small subset of voters who are eligible to vote by mail and could rely on the postal service yet simply prefer to hand-deliver their marked ballot.” On Monday the 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circuit ruled that the state</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/13/923216392/u-s-appeals-court-sides-with-texas-on-one-per-county-ballot-drop-off?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_source=twitter.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the drop-off sites to one per county. &#8220;These methods for remote voting outstrip what Texas law previously permitted in a pre-COVID world,&#8221; the court said. &#8220;The October 1 Proclamation abridges no one&#8217;s right to vote.&#8221; The court agreed with the state&#8217;s assertion that Abbott&#8217;s rule is a refinement of an expansion of voting options, not a restriction of rights.</span></p>

The state GOP had filed suit Monday night asking the court to place limits on curbside voting and halt drive-thru voting. The appellate judges said the party and a voter who filed the suit did so too late, and did not show how they specifically might be injured by the voting practices. The lawsuit was filed just hours before early voting polls opened and more than a month after the Harris County Clerk announced his plan for drive-thru voting. &#8220;The election is currently in progress and the relators delayed filing this mandamus until over a month after learning of the actions of the Harris County Clerk’s Office,&#8221; the panel of three judges on Texas&#8217; 14th Court of Appeals</span><a href="http://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=dfd554d7-10f8-4134-a32a-4310e96157c3&amp;coa=coa14&amp;DT=Opinion&amp;MediaID=1ba31b2b-ccdd-435c-9d7e-47049960ed6b"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote in their ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dismissing the case.</span></p>

Pozza said the county must add 18 voting centers and publicize the Election Day sites 21 days before the election, according to the Texas Civil Rights Project. The order has not been formally signed as of Wednesday afternoon. The lawsuit was filed by progressive organizations MOVE Texas and the Texas Organizing Project. The order requires that Bexar County must increase its number of Election Day voting centers from 284 sites to 302 — the same number used in the 2018 midterm elections. The plaintiffs had asked for 311 voting sites but amended their request.</span></p>

U.S. District Judge John A. Gibney, Jr. extended the deadline through Oct. 15. Lawyers for a trio of voter advocacy groups who sought the deadline extension argued that people who wait until the last day to register tend to be minorities and younger adults. Gov. Ralph Northam (D), Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) and several state lawmakers readily agreed to the deadline extension. During Wednesday’s hearing, the judge gently chastised the workers who failed to take preventive measures that would have kept the fiber-optic cable safe. He also noted that Virginians who were most affected by the accident had waited until the last day to register. “Maybe people will learn two lessons from this case,” Gibney said. “One is to call Mr. Utility, and the other is to not let things go until the last minute.”</span></p>

A district court last month had ruled for the Democratic National Committee in extending online voter registration until October 21 and extending the deadline for absentee ballots to be received from the night of Election Day to up until November 9 &#8212; as long as they are postmarked before Election Day. &#8220;The State Legislature offers two principal arguments in support of a stay: first, that a federal court should not change the rules so close to an election; second, that political rather than judicial officials are entitled to decide when a pandemic justifies changes to rules that are otherwise valid. We agree with both of those arguments, which means that a stay is appropriate,&#8221; the two judges said. Plaintiffs have appealed the case to</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/voting-rights-group-asks-supreme-court-let-late-mail-ballots-n1243273"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge William Griesbach has denied a petition from the Wisconsin Voters Alliance that argued that</span><a href="https://fox11online.com/news/election/judge-upholds-election-grant-to-green-bay-5-other-cities"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from The Center for Tech and Civic Life to five cities totaling $6.3 violated federal law. “Plaintiffs have presented at most a policy argument for prohibiting municipalities from accepting funds from private parties to help pay the increased costs of conducting safe and efficient elections. The risk of skewing an election by providing additional private funding for conducting the election in certain areas of the State may be real. The record before the Court, however, does not provide the support needed for the Court to make such a determination, especially in light of the fact that over 100 additional Wisconsin municipalities received grants as well. These are all matters that may merit a legislative response but the Court finds nothing in the statutes Plaintiffs cite, either directly or indirectly, that can be fairly construed as prohibiting the defendant Cities from accepting funds from CTCL. Absent such a prohibition, the Court lacks the authority to enjoin them from accepting such assistance. To do so would also run afoul of the Supreme Court’s admonition that courts should not change electoral rules close to an election date.” Griesbach wrote. The case remains open. The judge has not ruled on the municipalities&#8217; request for the case to be dismissed.</span></p>
