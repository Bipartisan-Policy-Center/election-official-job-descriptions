														<p><strong>CISA COVID working group releases FAQs on expanding absentee/VBM</strong><br />
<em>Collaborative effort moved quickly to help elections officials during pandemic<br />
</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5380" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="221" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" />According to the<a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-583.html"> U.S. Census</a>, in 2018, just 6.2 percent of the voters who cast a ballot in the Northeast part of the country did so by mail/via absentee. In the South, it was 9.7 percent. Overall, just 23.1 percent of the 2018 ballots were cast by mail/absentee.</p>
<p>Now with the nation in the grips of a global pandemic and the November 3 general election less than seven months away, many states are figuring out how to expand the ability to vote absentee/by mail.</p>
<p>For states like Arizona, where the majority of residents are on the state’s<a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/earlyvotingballot/permanentevlistinfo.aspx"> Permanent Early Voting List</a>, which means they get a ballot in the mail, the lift to go to an all/mostly mail election for November, if they choose to, would be relatively “simple”. For places like the District of Columbia where only about<a href="https://electionresults.dcboe.org/election_statistics/2016-General-Election"> 8 percent</a> of the 2016 general election ballots were cast by absentee, the move to greatly expand voting by mail will be a big lift, but not impossible.</p>
<p>This week the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) Elections Infrastructure<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/government-coordinating-councils"> Government Coordinating Council</a> (GCC) and<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sector-coordinating-councils"> Sector Coordinating Council</a>’s (SCC) Joint COVID Working Group have put out <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/vote-mail">six FAQ/ consideration documents</a> on how to increase absentee or vote by mail in time for November. The purpose of the COVID working group is to support state and local officials and their private sector partners run elections during this pandemic by looking at everything from expanded mail voting to in-person voting in a social distancing environment.</p>
<p>“These are unprecedented times for everyone, especially election officials.  These documents provide state and local election offices with answers to some of the questions they might have as well as some they might not have thought of yet but need to be aware of,” said Lori Augino, director of elections for the State of Washington and president of the<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Election Directors</a>. “I’m proud of how our community is working together to help Americans cast their ballots this year.”</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>, as an executive committee member agreed to chair the working group. The group started with calls focusing on general responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, but much of the requests for information centered on how to expand absentee/ voting by mail along a realistic spectrum in each state.</p>
<p>In order to not get bogged down in issues pertaining to each jurisdiction the group considered how to create a slightly different governing approach that could address the risks and concerns that the election community as a whole will need to consider. The working group further divided into smaller groups — or what they liked to call “swim lanes” — that focused on a specific area.</p>
<p>“With election officials around the country reexamining their 2020 election plans to account for the impact of COVID-19, I am confident this series of documents can help with the tough decisions they face,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “This group effort represents input from all aspects of the elections community including state and local election officials, federal partners, and industry professionals. The ability to pull people together and create these documents so quickly would not have been possible without the critical infrastructure governance being in place for elections.”</p>
<p>The goal was to expedite the collection of existing best practices and assist in the efficient development of tools and <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5381" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM2-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />resources. Each subgroup was assigned a lead and worked through which elections officials and organizations would be contacted about each topic so they didn’t overwhelm the same people, people who are also be contacted by individual elections officials and the media.</p>
<p>According to Ryan Macias who served as a lead on several of the swim lanes, the support from both the GCC and SCC was great.</p>
<p>“We have to give a specific thanks to the SCC,” Macias said. “In addition to the assistance they provided us, they have collaborated to provide assistance to the election community by reaching out to external companies and associations- some of which may be competitors &#8211; to gather accurate and detailed information from the partners that will need to assist in the response.”</p>
<p>The working group recognized that state and local election officials needed information quickly but focused on creating a <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM-Project-Timeline.pdf">VBM Project Timeline</a> before diving into the FAQs. The timeline provides a realistic calendar of tasks, specific to each area of focus, to help give a sense of how soon purchasing and other decisions will need to be made.</p>
<p>In addition to creating these initial FAQs, each of the respective working groups gathered information (i.e. procedures, training material, production calendars, etc.) pertaining to their “swim lane” that may assist election officials building an expanded VBM program.</p>
<p>The subgroups goal was to drive collaboration so these resources are as useful as possible for the election officials that are currently making difficult decisions on how to best serve their voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-3427 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“I think everyone involved with this effort recognizes that if we’re going to solve the challenges facing election officials now and in November, we need collaboration &#8211; but we also need focus,” Jennifer Morrell, another subgroup leader, said. “We can’t have everyone trying to solve all of the problems. We need a way for subject matter experts, civic organizations, vendors, and other groups and organizations to provide the information and solutions that election administrators need now as well as an understanding of the considerations that will need to be made in preparation for November. In other words, we’re all in this together!”</p>
<p>The six FAQ/consideration documents cover outbound processes, ballot applications, inbound processes, signature verification and cure, electronic ballot delivery and ballot drop boxes. There will be four more FAQ/considerations on ensuring voters receive their ballots, education and outreach, in-person voting, and protecting staff to be published in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Each of these documents was built with collaboration from members of the GCC, government election officials donating expertise to assist, and importantly, members of the private sector and non-profit organizations who work in this arena.</p>
<p>“Elections are hard to administer in the best of times—and incredibly difficult during presidentials,” said Noah Praetz one of the subgroup leaders. “Now this pandemic, and the significant changes that are necessitated, inspired the community to quickly coalesce and provide guidance so that election officials across the country could fast track their information gathering efforts and move on to implementation. This is a community of heroes.”</p>

Every state is in a different place with respect to their current mail voting practices.  Each has different tolerances and capabilities for expansion, with some states currently using lots of mail voting considering going all VBM.  On the other side states with strict excuse requirements for absentee ballots are looking to open that process to no excuse, some even considering active outreach activities to help voters through the process, like direct mail of applications or allowing applications online.  These activities come with operational and security challenges as well that we hoped to help them think through.—Noah Praetz, team lead</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a665c98017db2b60bc22084/t/5e8f430052f1a1428efab940/1586447104416/Outbound_Mail-Ballots_final.pdf">Outbound Mail Ballots</a><br />
Ramping up operations to mail significantly more ballots to voters has tremendous logistical and security considerations. Rewriting contracts, finding vendors and materials, procuring equipment, reengineering manual processes, all take considerable thought and effort to be done securely with zero error tolerance. Our document isn’t prescriptive, but it does hope to position officials in a starting place where they see most of the field before them.—Noah Praetz, team lead</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a665c98017db2b60bc22084/t/5e8f42bb1907324a68d9cb1a/1586447035207/eBallot-Delivery_final.pdf">eBallot Delivery</a><br />
For many jurisdictions conducting vote by mail at scale may not be feasible with limited time between now and the November election. Also, voting by mail poses challenges for many voters, including those with specific needs and Native American populations. The key is to provide voters and election officials options to conduct a free and fair election during this pandemic, while identifying the considerations for managing the risks associated with expanding voting options at scale and under tight timelines.—Ryan Macias, team lead</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a665c98017db2b60bc22084/t/5e8f42d717ee5e7ee2db8c8b/1586447064805/Ballot_Drop-Box_final.pdf">Ballot Drop Box</a><br />
Ballot drop boxes provided a way for last-minute voters to return their mail ballot in time to be counted. Temporary indoor boxes and drive-through boxes can be set up quickly and the equipment and supplies are relatively cheap. The key is identifying locations that are convenient, secure and accessible.—Jennifer Morrell, team lead</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a665c98017db2b60bc22084/t/5e8f42e95ae63f66b3ab1a26/1586447081587/Inbound-Ballot_Process_final.pdf">Inbound Ballot Process</a><br />
The key to a successful inbound process is tracking and accounting for return ballot envelopes and ballots at each stage of the process and keeping them organized. In addition to tracking forms, color coding is a great practice to adopt. Colored mail trays, signs, and color indicators on mail carts ensure ballots are moved to the correct stage of the process and provide transparency.—Jennifer Morrell, team lead</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a665c98017db2b60bc22084/t/5e8f426bcc24e65fdc481b39/1586446955337/Signature-Verification_Cure_Process_final.pdf">Signature Verification</a><br />
Providing signature verification training is important for anyone involved in reviewing signatures. Fortunately, there are training programs from other states that can be borrowed. More importantly, election officials should think about meaningful ways to quickly notify voters of a discrepancy with their signature and provide them with an opportunity to cure the discrepancy.—Jennifer Morrell, team lead</p>

Even with more than a million absentee ballots requested and sent, some<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-democratic-voters.html"> voters still headed to the polls</a> on Tuesday and in some areas were forced to wait in lines for hours because of limited polling places, limited poll workers and social distancing. The fight to not hold the primary lasted until late in the day on Monday. Around mid-day Gov. Tony Evers issued an<a href="https://wtmj.com/news/2020/04/07/new-information-led-to-governor-evers-executive-order-despite-saying-last-week-he-couldnt-do-it/"> executive order</a> to push the primary to June. State GOP leaders went to court and the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/wisconsin-governor-delays-primary-scheduled-for-tuesday.html"> Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> ruled that the show must go on. Additionally, the state GOP appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court that all absentee ballots must be submitted by the close of polls on primary day. In a 5-4 decision, the<a href="https://www.wsaw.com/content/news/Wisconsin-Elections-Commission-to-convene-in-emergency-meeting-Monday-night--569423581.html"> US Supreme Court</a> agreed. So on Tuesday, poll workers across the state — including about 2,400 Wisconsin<a href="https://www.channel3000.com/2400-wisconsin-national-guard-members-train-to-work-polls-on-election-day/"> National Guard</a> members —<a href="https://www.wpr.org/local-clerks-use-masks-gowns-gloves-protect-poll-workers-voters-covid-19"> donned PPPE</a> and opened up voting sites. Although we cannot say that ALL Wisconsin election jurisdictions limited the number of polling places, most did. For instance,  <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/these-are-the-five-in-person-voting-centers-in-milwaukee-open-for-wisconsins-spring-primary-tuesday">Milwaukee</a> went from 140+ sites to just five,<a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/madison-has-66-polling-sites-on-election-day-milwaukee-has-five-whats-the-deal/article_8868bacf-6697-5cf4-aa4f-d85fb37cf846.html"> Madison</a> had only 66 instead of the normal 94.<a href="https://www.weau.com/content/news/La-Crosse-reduces-number-of-polling-sites-for-Tuesday-569425911.html"> La Crosse</a> was down to only eight. The reduced number of polling places and fewer poll workers forced voters in some places like<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/07/wisconsin-election-milwaukee-voters-brave-long-wait-lines-polls/2962228001/"> Milwaukee</a> and<a href="https://fox11online.com/news/election/green-bay-mayor-responds-to-election-day-lines"> Green Bay</a> to wait in line for hours to cast their vote. While local clerks and poll workers did their best to pull off the election, voters did face some issues. In<a href="https://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/2020/04/08/do-not-enter-sign-turns-voters-without-masks-away-ellington-polling-site/2970474001/"> Ellington</a>, a sign was posted on one polling place telling voters they could not enter without a mask. This was not true and the sign was removed. In<a href="https://www.wiscnews.com/juneaucountystartimes/news/local/access-denied-clerk-bars-media-from-pictures-at-lake-delton-polls/article_66cb6575-3b4e-57e0-a5bc-7687942cea86.html"> Lake Delton</a>, the deputy clerk barred the media from photography at a polling site. The clerk cited the fact that there were two poll workers under 18 at the site and she did not want them photographed without their parent’s permission. The troubles for the Wisconsin primary didn’t end when the polls closed on election night. Problems with undelivered absentee ballots surfaced almost as soon as they were no longer valid because the polls had closed. Apparently “<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/08/wisconsin-election-3-tubs-ballots-found-mail-processing-center/2971078001/">3 large tubs</a>” of ballots from Oshkosh and Appleton were located after the primary. The Milwaukee Election Commission is seeking a<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/08/milwaukee-election-commission-seeks-investigation-into-missing-ballots/2972382001/"> formal Postal Service investigation</a> into what happened to absentee ballots that never reached voters on time. At least 750 absentee ballots in Milwaukee had to be invalidated because they lacked the necessary<a href="https://www.channel3000.com/750-milwaukee-ballots-invalidated-over-witnesses/"> witness signatures</a>. And on an incredibly sad note, national experts say that in-person voting was likely a “disaster” for the state’s efforts to<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/08/coronavirus-wisconsin-election-likely-hurt-effort-flatten-curve/2961718001/"> flatten the coronavirus curve</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative and legal actions surrounding the elections and the coronavirus pandemic can be found in their respective sections of the newsletter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Funding:</strong> The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has announced that it is planning</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/491413-federal-agency-expedites-sending-congressional-election-funds-to-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> send funding to states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they can use for measures such as boosting mail-in and absentee voting, along with hiring more poll workers and buying sanitization supplies, by the end of next week. The agency noted</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/04/03/eac-expediting-distribution-400-million-cares-act-election-funding-coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it is “moving as quickly as possible” to provide exact guidance to states on how they can use these funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Citizens</strong>: According to NBC News, if ceremonies and interviews to become a new U.S. citizen remain shut down until October without remote alternative,</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/coronavirus-may-stop-hundreds-thousands-becoming-citizens-time-vote-november-n1178541"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 441,000 people who would have gained their voting eligibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in time to vote in November will be unable to do so. “USCIS did the right thing by pausing live oath ceremonies and live interviews, there’s no dispute about that,” Doug Rand, cofounder of Boundless Immigration told NBC. “The problem is USCIS hasn’t come up with a next step and come up with remote pathways for people to take the oath and do interviews.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: The D.C. Board of Elections was forced to fully close its offices after numerous board employees came down the</span><a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/03/30/coronavirus_latest_dc_maryland_virginia_week_of_april_1/#electionsboard"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coronavirus symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after interacting with a member of the public who later tested positive. Staff who are not ill will be working remotely for the foreseeable future. “All emailed and online requests will be processed as usual,” board spokesperson Rachel Coll told DCist. “A phone number has been provided for telephone requests to be made. These methods will be checked remotely. Mailed and faxed requests will be retrieved by staff when it is safe to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> On behalf of all 67 supervisors of elections, the Florida Supervisors of Elections (FSE) sent a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis calling on him to sign an executive order to</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article241809436.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> modify statutory procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the August 18 primary and the November general election. “There’s so much unknown at this point that it’s close to impossible to have any solid plans for August,” Polk County Supervisor Lori Edwards told the Miami Herald. “We need certainty and we need it soon so we can gather the resources and make our plans as needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> The back-and-forth over Georgia’s rescheduled May primary continued this week with both the secretary of state and the governor saying they</span><a href="https://www.wabe.org/kemp-raffensperger-both-say-they-cant-delay-may-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lack the authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to once again move the election. Finally on Thursday, after Gov. Brian Kemp extended the Georgia&#8217;s state of public health emergency, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger moved the primary to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-primary-delayed-again-june-during-coronavirus-emergency/W5ElsYWTsP5clpNAVTYXnO/">June 9</a>. “This decision allows our office and county election officials to continue to put in place contingency plans to ensure that voting can be safe,” Raffensperger said according to The <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>. “I certainly realize that every difficulty will not be completely solved by the time in-person voting begins for the June 9 election, but elections must happen in less than ideal circumstances.”<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Janet Mills said this week that the coronavirus will likely</span><a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/04/07/news/augusta/janet-mills-says-maine-likely-to-move-june-primaries-to-mid-july-due-to-virus-outbreak/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> force the state to delay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the congressional and legislative primaries that were scheduled for June 9 while eyeing July 14 as her preferred date for a rescheduled election. Mills comment was not coordinated with Secretary of State Matt Dunlap who said he would prefer an all-mail election. Mills has unilateral power to move the election or change the election process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland:</strong> The Maryland State Board of elections has reversed course and will now offer</span><a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2020/04/elections-board-recommends-limited-in-person-voting-for-june-2-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> limited in-person voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the June 2 primary. Each county and Baltimore City will have a minimum of one voting center. Despite the shift, board members expressed their concerns. “I’m very wary about subjecting workers to this virus,” board member Malcolm L. Funn said. “We have to recognize the seriousness of this situation that we’re in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> More towns in Massachusetts have chosen to postpone town elections including</span><a href="https://cohasset.wickedlocal.com/news/20200406/cohasset-moves-its-town-meeting-and-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cohasset</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://easton.wickedlocal.com/news/20200406/easton-town-election-to-be-postponed"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Easton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://capecodchronicle.com/en/5515/harwich/5705/Harwich-Town-Meeting-And-Elections-Moved-To-Late-June-Elections-Town-Meeting.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harwich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://needham.wickedlocal.com/news/20200407/statement-needham-election-postponed-to-may-26th"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Needham</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://maynard.wickedlocal.com/news/20200403/town-of-stow-reschedules-town-election-in-wake-of-coronavirus-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stowe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://westford.wickedlocal.com/news/20200402/westford-postpones-election-due-to-coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Westford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The City of</span><a href="https://www.djournal.com/monroe/news/aberdeen-aldermen-approve-delay-of-city-s-elections/article_cb54e4ce-9423-567c-92f0-0da0230041d7.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Aberdeen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has moved the city’s local elections. The primary will now be held May 5 and the general election June 2. A</span><a href="https://yallpolitics.com/2020/04/02/mississippi-house-district-88-special-election-moved-to-june/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> special election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Mississippi House District 88 has been moved to June 23. It was originally set for April 21.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Montana</strong>: All 56 of Montana’s counties will conduct their June</span><a href="https://missoulacurrent.com/government/2020/04/montana-june-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> primary by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Initially most of the counties with the largest populations said they would do it, but by the time Friday deadline rolled around, all counties had joined in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nevada</strong>: In news that’s surely happening everywhere, Nevada reported that while more than 20,000 people</span><a href="https://mynews4.com/news/local/voter-registrations-slow-with-virus-closing-dmv-offices"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registered to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March, those numbers decreased dramatically at the end of the month due to the closure of DMV offices. Although the state’s June 9 primary will now be by mail, the secretary of state’s office did confirm this week that there would be “extremely limited”</span><a href="https://carsonnow.org/story/04/08/2020/limited-early-voting-nevada-still-happen-during-all-mail-primary-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in-person early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the weeks leading up to primary day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Gov Phil Murphy has</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/no-decisions-yet-on-polling-places-workers-pre-election-holiday-hours-murphy-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moved the state’s primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from June 2 to July 7.</span><a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/hudson-county-clerk-maldonado-tests-positive-for-covid-19-struggling-with-the-symptoms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hudson County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk E. Junior Maldonado has revealed he tested positive for COVID-19, indicating that he’s “struggling with the symptoms” and is asking everyone for their prayers. In order to maintain social distancing,</span><a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/kenilworth/categories/press-releases/articles/union-county-clerk-will-livestream-april-9-ballot-drawing-on-facebook-12"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Union County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk Joanne Rajoppi accounted that the 2020 primary election ballot position drawing will be live-streamed on Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: <em>Gothamist</em> is reporting that New York City Board of Elections staff working in borough offices have</span><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/two-covid-19-deaths-nyc-board-elections-and-more-dozen-sickened"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died from the effects of COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another 15 people in the BOE’s main office in lower Manhattan have tested positive. Although BOE staff has not been explicitly deemed essential workers, BOE’s Executive Director Michael Ryan told Gothamist / WNYC that they had been given guidance by the State Board of Elections to continue operations. “We at the Board have a legal mandate to conduct our jobs. The continuity of government depends in part on some of the work that we&#8217;re doing,” Ryan said. This week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that all voters in the state will be allowed to</span><a href="https://www.waer.org/post/nys-allow-vote-mail-option-june-primary-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote-by-mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the June 23 primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Dakota</strong>: The</span><a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Standing-Rock-working-on-mail-in-ballots-569338801.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Standing Rock tribal community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is working with Sioux County to make sure that all voters can receive a mail ballot for the upcoming primary. “If they&#8217;re going to send them to their physical address, as you could look back in history we&#8217;ve been having trouble with that,” Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KFYR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio:</strong> Another great idea coming out of Ohio this week. The Dayton Daily News, Springfield News-Sun and Journal-News, in partnership with the secretary of state’s office created and printed an</span><a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/absentee-ballot-request-forms-printed-local-newspapers/Nw8P1F5Fm7pnKADDaHDeoL/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> form that ran in the Sunday edition of the three papers. The</span><a href="https://www.the-daily-record.com/news/20200402/wayne-county-boe-installs-24-hour-ballot-dropbox"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wayne County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> board of elections has installed a 24-hour ballot drop box in front of their offices. Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office will be sending</span><a href="https://www.wowktv.com/news/west-virginia/secretary-of-state-announces-absentee-ballot-application-postcards-being-sent-to-all-registered-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot application postcards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to every registered voter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The secretary of state’s office has instructed local officials to</span><a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article241732261.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immediately push back their May2 elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they had not already done so—many had. “If you don’t move your May 2nd election, you are subjecting voters to health risks and potential criminal violations,” Keith Ingram the director of the office’s Elections Division wrote in an email Thursday to local election officials. “Failure to postpone your election will put your election at severe risk for an election contest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia:</strong> Gov. Ralph Northam has announced that the</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/health/vp-nw-coronavirus-northam-updates-0408-20200408-lytwehdvxbch3ivwtqfv2fcjoi-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> June 9 congressional primaries will be postponed by two weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the May municipal elections could be moved to November. Northam used his executive power to postpone the June 9 primaries to the 23rd. However, he does not have the power to move the municipal primaries and so he’s asking the General Assembly to move them to coincide with the November general election. Lawmakers are set to return to the capitol on April 22.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The City of</span><a href="https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/City-of-Nitro-to-postpone-city-elections-569460631.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nitro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has postponed its elections from June 2 to July 9.</span></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vendors</strong>: Microsoft announced it is expanding its cybersecurity offerings to state and local election officials, including access to a free service that offers threat detection on email or other accounts, and specialized services from the company’s incident-response group. The first offering gives state and local officials — as well as members of Congress and their staffs — access to</span><a href="https://statescoop.com/microsoft-expands-security-offerings-election-officials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AccountGuard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a service that alerts users of Microsoft’s Outlook and Hotmail email platforms or its Office 365 suite of productivity applications if their accounts are threatened or compromised by hackers known to be associated with a foreign government.</span></p>

There’s a fight brewing in Prairie County, Montana — population 1,179, total area 1,743 square miles — over</span><a href="https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/prairie-county-election-administrators-failure-to-file-for-own-seat-incites-disputes/article_5c05f90f-d862-551e-ae4e-503373e5901e.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who will be the county’s next election administrator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After current election administrator Shari Robertson (who also serves as county clerk of the District Court, clerk and recorder) failed to file the paper to run for office, she must now run as a write-in. “I guess I missed it,” Robertson told <em>The Billings Gazette</em>, describing the realization as “numbing.” Robertson believed, as did others in the county government, that she had been elected to a four-year term two years ago. However one person has filed for the seat, Ruth Peck who Robertson defeated in the primary and general in 2018. Some have accused Peck of waiting till the 5pm filing deadline to file so as to not bring it to Robertson’s attention. “Apparently I stirred up a huge hornets&#8217; nest,” Peck told the paper. The county commission has looked into changing the filing deadline and the candidates have gotten legal representation. “Oh my goodness,” Todd Devlin, Prairie County Commission chairman, told the paper when asked about the situation. “Small town America, huh?” Devlin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do-over:</strong> The N.C. state board of elections has unanimously voted that Columbus County must</span><a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/04/07/state-board-orders-new-election-in-columbus-county-commissioner-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conduct a new Republican primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the county commissioner district 2. According to WWAY, audits by the county board of elections of the March 3 primary election results showed 10 voters received a ballot style with the District 2 contest on it on Election Day, but they were not eligible to vote in that district. Contest results show a margin of 4 votes between Mack Ward, the top vote-getter, and Chris Smith, the runner-up. The new election will be held on June 23, the same day as the 11th Congressional District second primary in the western part of North Carolina.</span></p>

It was quickly shut down by state officials though. “Gambling on elections has been illegal in West Virginia since 1868,” Secretary of State Mac Warner said in a statement. “Gambling on the outcome of an election has no place in our American democracy. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. This is a terrible idea. Let’s shut this down right now and be very clear about it.” West Virginia Lottery Director John Myers issued a statement Wednesday evening saying his office “screwed up.” “I thought it would be okay, but after review, it was clearly a mistake,” he said in the statement According to the <em>Daily Herald</em>. “We just screwed up. I didn’t have the authority to do it, it should have never happened and I apologize to everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Former 2020 Candidates on Elections Issues</strong>: This week former 2020 presidential candidates Sens Amy Klobuchar (DFL-Minnesota) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) both weighed in on the U.S. voting system this week. Not surprisingly,</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/07/829320440/sen-elizabeth-warren-calls-for-national-voting-overhaul"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Warren</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a plan for it. Warren’s proposed plan calls for $4 billion in new elections funding, 30 days of required early voting and a mail-in ballot to be sent to every registered voter in the country. &#8220;The chaos and the attempt to suppress the vote in Wisconsin should be a wake-up call for the United States Congress,&#8221; Warren said in an interview with NPR. &#8220;We need to act immediately.&#8221; For her part,</span><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/3162255/amy-klobuchar-wants-to-save-the-election-from-the-coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Klobuchar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who has a record of working on election administration issues spoke with MTV News about the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act that she is co-sponsoring with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon). “There are always efforts to make it hard for people to vote, and for the good of our democracy, we need to make it easier,” Klobuchar told MTV. “And when you have this situation where people have to choose between their health or voting, it makes no sense. That&#8217;s why we want to make it easier for people to vote and what this legislation would do is it makes it easier to vote by mail. And that&#8217;s great for everyone — no matter how old you are. You won&#8217;t have to go [to the polls] to vote and violate all these rules about not congregating together.”</span></p>

The registration drive led to death threats and threats of violence against McFerren and his fellow activists, but it also helped draw national attention as voter registration became a fight around the country. “Had it not been for him, I just hate to see what voting would have been like,’ Mark Stansbury, a radio host on WDIA told the paper.</span></p>

The measure, an amendment sponsored by Rep. David Bentz, would eliminate an enactment date on an existing vote-by-mail bill. Currently, House Bill 175, sponsored by Rep. Gerald Brady, would allow voters to vote-by-mail beginning in 2022. Removing the enactment date would mean the bill would take effect upon General Assembly passage and Governor John Carney signing the measure into law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a bill that would have required Kentuckians to show a</span><a href="https://wfpl.org/beshear-vetoes-voter-id-bill-legislature-has-chance-to-override/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> photo ID in order to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Voters could have also showed a social security card or credit card and then sign an affidavit. Beshear said that the law would create an obstacle for Kentuckians trying to vote, especially during the coronavirus pandemic when offices that provide ID cards are closed to in-person traffic. “Furthermore, no documented evidence of recent voter fraud in the form of impersonation in Kentucky has been presented in support of Senate Bill 2 and, therefore, the legislation would be attempting to resolve a problem does not exist,” Beshear wrote.”</span></p>

The proposal would make “temporary, one-time” changes that would automatically send registered voters mail-in ballots and allow extra time for election administrators to process the votes. Simon said the changes would be in effect only during the peacetime state of emergency declared by Gov. Tim Walz and that witnesses would be required for voting in order to combat fraud.</span></p>

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell L. Beckloff held that the CVPRA impermissibly intrudes upon the province of chartered cities in dictating when they may hold their elections. The appellate opinion, by Presiding Justice Dennis Perluss, neither agrees nor disagrees with the trial court judge’s conclusion. Rather, the opinion states, that the Legislature didn’t make it clear whether it intended the CVPR—which went into effect Jan. 1, 2018—to apply to chartered cities or not so, to avoid a constitutional controversy, it will be assumed there was no such intention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle has ruled that testimony and expert statements for the trial over a 2019 state law regarding felon voting will be</span><a href="https://news.wfsu.org/post/testimony-trial-over-felon-voting-rights-be-conducted-online"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted on a live web-based conferencing system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2018 Floridians approved a constitutional amendment that restored voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences. The legislature crafted a law that stops them from voting if they have unpaid fines, fees and restitution. The trial is set to begin April 27.</span></p>

In the order Tuesday on class certification, Hinkle rejected Secretary of State Laurel Lee’s arguments that a broad expansion of plaintiffs was unnecessary. “The plaintiffs’ Twenty-fourth Amendment and inability-to-pay claims turn on issues that can be properly resolved in a single action, once and for all. Class treatment is proper,” Hinkle wrote in the 18-page order, referring to the U.S. Constitution’s 24th Amendment barring poll taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A settlement has been reach in a 2019 lawsuit over a state law that essentially prevented supervisors of elections from placing</span><a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/politics/2020/04/03/supervisors-of-elections-in-florida-can-again-place-early-voting-sites-on-college-campuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early voting sites on college campuses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a directive this week from Secretary of State Laurel Lee says that supervisors need not ensure that a certain number of non-permitted parking sites are available at every single early voting site. Instead, the directive says that supervisors can use a number of factors to determine how adequate the parking is on a campus before deciding on whether to place such a polling place there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> The ACLU has filed suit against the state arguing that requiring voters to put a stamp on their absentee ballot is the equivalent of a</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/cost-of-postage-creates-a-problem-for-virus-cautious-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll tax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>, although the 55-cent cost of a first-class postage stamp may be small, the challengers say any financial barrier to voting is unconstitutional. Postage costs could be higher for longer and heavier ballots.</span></p>

In a response filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, state attorneys argued that changing the election again would sow more confusion among voters and that the lawsuit is built on the erroneous claim that Ohio’s election date had been changed. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson</span><a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/judge-denies-voter-groups-lawsuit-to-change-ohio-primary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied the suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The Constitution does not require the best plan, just a lawful one,” Watson wrote in his order. “As is apparent from the briefing in this lawsuit, every group has a different idea of what the best plan would be. But the Court will not declare the Ohio Legislature’s unanimous bill to be unconstitutional simply because other options may have been better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Ohio, the state Supreme Court has</span><a href="https://www.morningjournal.com/news/lorain-county/supreme-court-orders-response-in-lorain-county-voter-case/article_595c845c-7904-11ea-a880-c3b5302273bd.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ordered a response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by April 10 in a case alleging voter fraud in Lorain County. According to the <em>Morning Journal</em>, on March 9, former Lorain city councilman Dennis Flores filed a case at the state Supreme Court seeking an order for the county prosecutor to investigate alleged voter fraud in a 2015 race for city council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> In a 5-2 decision, the Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Secretary of State Steve Simon and that his office</span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/state-supreme-court-allows-voter-data-witheld-from-public/569474962/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not need to turn over information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sought by the Minnesota Voters Alliance regarding voters’ status, reasons for any challenges to their registrations and information on voters not currently registered. According to the <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em>, the Supreme Court said the additional information sought by the Voters Alliance was accessible only to public officials for specific purposes. In declining access to that information, the secretary of state followed the law, the court said.</span></p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0 Public Comment Period</h2>
														<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period, and scheduling a virtual public hearing for Friday, March 27.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"> unanimously voted</a> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</p>
<p>On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</p>
<p>The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</a>, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"> regulations.gov</a>.</p>
<p>EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</p>
<p>Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</p>
<p>The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</a> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</p>
<p>The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</p>
<p>The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>
<p>The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</p>
<p>The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</p>
