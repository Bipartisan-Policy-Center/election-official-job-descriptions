							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>What suffrage means to me</strong><br />
<em>Local elections officials talk suffrage on the 100th anniversary</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Next week, August 18th — a Tuesday appropriately enough — marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment.</p>
<p>After years of struggle, some of if bloody and violent, on<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/06-06/"> June 4, 1919, the Senate approved</a> the 19th Amendment. It took another 16 months to garner the support of three-fourths of the states to ratify it.</p>
<p>Wisconsin is credited with being first and it was Tennessee that pushed the needle over the line for ratification on August 19, 1920 with Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby certifying the ratification on August 26, 2020.</p>
<p>Several states — Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia — rejected the 19th Amendment initially, but eventually ratified the Amendment after it was law with Mississippi being last in 1984.</p>
<p>As many have rightly noted, the 19th Amendment did not expressly give women the right to vote, it merely prohibited states from denying anyone the right to vote<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/08/black-women-continued-fighting-for-vote-after-19th-amendment/"> based on gender</a>. Many women were still denied the right to vote based on the color of their skin and<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/06/voting-rights-act-55th-anniversary-how-black-women-led-movement/5535967002/"> their fight for suffrage continued</a>.</p>
<p>As part of our suffrage celebration we reached out to female local elections officials (LEOs) in all 50 states and asked them what suffrage means to them. The responses come from large and small jurisdictions, from both coasts and the Heartland. We heard from Democrats, Republicans and many whose party affiliation we have don’t even know! According to a 2018 survey by Reed College and the Democracy Fund, the typical local election official (LEO) is most likely a white female between 50–64 years of age, that being said, we did our very best to reach to LEOs of all races and ages.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4486" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-09-27-at-8.55.24-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Natalie Adona</strong>, Assistant Clerk-Recorder/Registrar of Voters,<a href="https://www.mynevadacounty.com/695/Registrar-of-Voters"> Nevada County, California</a>: When I think of the fight for women’s suffrage, I see it as a necessary remedy to correct a grave injustice. I also think this is a good opportunity for reflection&#8211;it’s not lost on me that the franchise wasn’t automatically available for women when the 19th Amendment was ratified, especially for women of color. Without the 19th Amendment, I imagine that the election administration profession, and my own career, would have looked very different. I’m eternally grateful to the women who helped clear that path for me. Voting is one of the best ways to honor their achievements.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5894" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tina-Barton-244x300.png" alt="" width="244" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tina-Barton-244x300.png 244w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tina-Barton.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" />Tina Barton</strong>, City Clerk,<a href="https://www.rochesterhills.org/index.aspx?nid=65&amp;MOBILE=OFF"> City of Rochester Hills, Michigan</a>: My first exposure to the women’s suffrage movement came by way of the mom of two kids that I adored as a young girl, Jane and Michael Banks. They lived at 17 Cherry Tree Lane and they had a practically perfect nanny. Their mom, Mrs. Banks, proudly marched and loudly sang the Sister Suffragette song, all while adorned in her sash that read, “Votes for Women.” While the Banks family lived in London, this scene introduced to me at a young age that other women had marched, protested, and fought for the right to vote. The “soldiers in petticoats and dauntless crusaders for women’s votes” valiantly paved a way for women to be heard, to have influence, and to bring change. She sang, “Our daughters’ daughters will adore us and they will sing in grateful chorus.” Yes, Mrs. Banks, I do adore you and every other woman who was part of the suffrage movement. I sing in grateful chorus, “Well done, Sister Suffragettes!”</p>

<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5903" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sara-Knotts-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Sara Knotts</strong>, Director,<a href="https://www.brunswickcountync.gov/elections/"> Brunswick County, North Carolina</a> Board of Elections: I remember as a small child going to vote with my mom.  We entered a curtained booth and I held her leg as she made her selections.  I got a sticker, so it was quite the memorable experience!  I also remember voting in my first election after I turned 18, walking into the polling place with my mom.  I was nervous and unsure of what I was supposed to do, so we went as a family.  Both of these trips to the polls were teaching moments.  A woman passing on a lesson about civic duty and democracy to her daughter.  It is hard to fathom that just 100 years before, those opportunities would not have been possible.  When those women fought for women&#8217;s suffrage, they were fighting for my right to have those experiences.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5898" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Julie-Stahl.OH_-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Julie Leathers Stahl</strong>, Director<a href="https://www.waynecountyoh.gov/"> Wayne County, Ohio</a> Board of Elections: The anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment reminds me of my grandmother, who grew up during the Suffrage Movement. I can remember her telling me about her very first voting experience. The entire family took the day off from farm work and donned their best garments to cast their vote on Election Day. She expressed to me that she and her mother felt very blessed to be able exercise their right to vote. Through her stories, Gram instilled in me the importance of voting and a civic responsibility that I carry with me every day.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5904" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TabithaLehman-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Tabitha Lehman</strong>, Election Commissioner,<a href="https://www.sedgwickcounty.org/elections/"> Sedgwick County, Kansas</a>: As a young child, my family was very politically active. I remember participating in demonstrations, door to door campaigning, and always, voting. As I aged, that love of politics stayed with me. Registering to vote as soon as I was eligible and never missing an election turned into being an election poll worker, going to work full time at the election office and eventually being the chief election officer for our county. In Kansas the vast majority of county election officers are women, the women’s suffrage movement has shaped politics all across the country but it is very real here in Kansas with one of the founding League of Women Voter’s organizations being right here in our back yard.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5907" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ShonaMack-Pollock-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Shona L. Mack-Pollock</strong>, Superintendent of Elections,<a href="https://www.passaiccountynj.org/government/elected_and_appointed_officials/passaic_county_superintendent_of_elections/index.php"> Passaic County, New Jersey</a>: As the Superintendent of Elections in Passaic County I have an opportunity to visit schools and speak to our youth about the importance of civic engagement.  I always emphasize the significant power that we wield in the voting booth.  I remind students that voting is a privilege, which cannot be taken lightly because of the sacrifices that were made to ensure that all Americans, regardless of race, gender, sex or religion are guaranteed this most fundamental right.</p>
<p>To be clear, the passage of the 15th Amendment in 1870 and the 19th Amendment in 1920 did not and does not prevent women, minorities, and other underrepresented, underserved populations from being disenfranchised.  It is only because of the ongoing, collective efforts of countless leaders, advocates and elections officials throughout the nation, that we have seen innumerable barriers to suffrage being shattered.  Yet, there is still much work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Today, my role as an election official is critically important as I work with others, not only to preserve, but to continue to strengthen the integrity of the democratic process for generations to come.  It is particularly inspiring to work with female leaders in our work to enhance and safeguard a system that empowers others.  We are LIVING history.</p>
<p>I am incredibly awed and humbled by the responsibilities and privileges that I have been given because of the tireless efforts of those that paved the way for me.  Thus, with the recognition that all eligible voters must be given the opportunity to fully, confidently and safely participate in the electoral process, I will continue to work to ensure access, equality and fairness for all citizens in every election.</p>

<p>The role of African American women played in the Suffrage movement was not highly recognized at that time, noting that while African Americans women were often excluded by the main Suffrage movement, that they did in fact play a vital role in Suffrage not only in the ratification of the 19th Amendment, but also moving forward through the civil rights fight of the 50s and early 60s. This struggle resulted to the enactment of Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
<p>Being an African American woman and the Election Administrator for Dallas County, I’m honored to be in this position to ensure that the right to cast a ballot unimpeded is maintained. During my election professional career of 33 years,  I have spent my time to ensure all citizens have the same opportunity to register to vote without unnecessary barriers, and sought to ensure we continue to have fair access to the ballot box.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the past struggles of those great women before me, that we would all enjoy the democracy as it is today.  However, we must continue our struggles to let our voices and actions be heard and seen to ensure that all continue to enjoy the democracy of tomorrow.</p>

History tells us that only white males who owned land or paid taxes were given the opportunity to vote when the Constitution was written. I am so thankful for the many women who fought for our freedom to vote and astounded when women (or anyone actually) choose not to. Voting is a privilege and our voice in democracy. August 18, 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment being passed in Tennessee making us the 36th state and deciding vote for ratification of the amendment to the U. S. Constitution. I am so proud to be a Tennessean!</p>

May the dream continue to grow.</p>

Wilcox</strong>, Director,<a href="https://www2.auglaizecounty.org/departments/board-of-elections"> Auglaize County, Ohio</a> Board of Elections: With the passage of the 19th Amendment 100 years ago giving women the right to vote helped all women move closer to equality in all aspects of American life. Being an elections leader, advocate, educator and having two daughters of my own, I recognize the importance and understand the legacy left by the early suffragists who paved the way for all women. Suffrage means not only can my voice be heard at the ballot box, but as a woman, I can be an example and continue to build upon those achievements for future generations.</p>

							<h2>Road to Suffrage</h2>
														<p><strong>“I desire you would Remember the Ladies…”</strong><br />
<em>Road to suffrage had its roots in revolution</em></p>
<p>By Hilary Rudy, deputy director of elections<br />
Colorado Department of State</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5888" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CO-Suffrage-300x193.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CO-Suffrage-300x193.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CO-Suffrage.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This month we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. This time last year, many of us were making plans to attend marches and celebrations to mark the centennial of women’s suffrage in the U.S. Our focus and our day-to-day lives have shifted dramatically over the last five months. But we must not let this important milestone get lost in the pandemic-driven chaos this summer.</p>
<p>The road to the women’s vote has its roots in the revolution. As early as the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, women requested inclusion. “I desire you would Remember the Ladies…” Abigail Adams beseeched of her husband as he travelled to the continental congress. But the request went unanswered and it would be more than 140 years before this right would be recognized for women across the country.</p>
<p>And it would not be won until women replaced the request with a demand and resolute action. The 72-year national battle began in earnest with the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. To be sure, women petitioned their representatives and the President. But they also organized. And protested. They took the fight to the front steps of the White House, leveraging the lessons from women in the western states who achieved suffrage earlier. For their efforts, they were arrested, jailed, beaten, and force-fed when they went on hunger strikes.</p>
<p>We’re all familiar with the names Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, leaders in the national movement. These leaders toured in the west where the movement saw early success in territorial constitutions in Utah and Wyoming. Then in 1890 when Wyoming gained its nickname the “Equality State” by enshrining the right in its state constitution. And in 1893 Coloradans voted to grant full suffrage to women. In Colorado, the fight for suffrage was far less bloody than the national fight. Western states were younger and more pragmatic, and suffrage had the support of many early governors.</p>
<p>It was the grassroots effort of local leaders that ultimately convinced Colorado men that the time had come. Local leaders like Elizabeth Piper Ensley, one of the original 28 members and Treasurer of the Non-Partisan Equal Suffrage Association of Colorado. Ensley was an educator and life-long activist who organized for women’s rights, particularly for African American women. Her leadership was key to the success of the Colorado movement. Ensley is only one leader in Colorado who fought for women’s rights. There are so many advocates who deserve recognition and appreciation. Many of whom later joined their sisters in the fight in the nation’s capital advocating for the passage 19th Amendment.</p>
<p>This summer, we may not gather in-person for marches and lectures to celebrate this important centennial. But it seems a profoundly appropriate time to remember and reflect on the struggle and sacrifice of women a century ago, and more, to ensure our rights today. As we remember the sacrifice and fight that led to the ratification of the women’s right to vote in 1920, let’s take a few moments to learn the story of a suffragette and share it with a friend. Visit<a href="https://www.2020centennial.org/"> 2020centennial.org</a> for resources and information about the suffrage movement across the country, and honor their sacrifice by helping a friend register and vote.</p>
<p><em>(Hilary Rudy is the Deputy Director of Elections for the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. She began her career in elections administration as an intern for the Secretary of State’s office in 2005 and joined the division full-time after graduation from law school in 2006. Over the course of her career, Hilary has worked closely with county election officials in implementing new processes and procedures. She was instrumental in implementing several statewide projects, including the rollout of the statewide voter registration system, the development and deployment of the military and overseas voter ballot delivery system, and the creation of the Eliza Pickrell Routt award developed in partnership with Inspire Colorado to recognize high school voter registration efforts. As a native of Western Colorado, Hilary enjoys traveling around the state to visit the counties in support of their election activities. In addition to partnering with the division’s training manager to develop and deliver county election certification and overseeing the division fellowship program to mentor future election administrators, she continues to expand her expertise and attained CERA certification in 2016. When the election schedule allows, Hilary enjoys captaining the Secretary’s softball team and enjoying the great Colorado outdoors.)</em></p>

Inspired by historic photographs, the stamp features a stylized illustration of suffragists marching in a parade or other public demonstration. The clothes they wear and the banners they bear display the official colors of the National Woman’s Party — purple, white and gold. Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamp with original art by Nancy Stahl.</p>
<p>The stamp will be released in a virtual First Day of Issue Ceremony for the 19th Amendment: Women Vote Forever Stamps at 11 a.m. on the 22nd. This virtual ceremony will be carried on the Postal Service’s social media channels, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/USPS/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/USPS">Twitter</a>.

<p><strong>&#8220;I Voted&#8221; Stickers</strong><br />
Many states and local jurisdictions are commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment by offering custom “I Voted” stickers. Here is a look at some of them.</p>

Although Wilton’s will be a bit different because they will be virtual stickers. A set of six stickers features the images of four Wilton women known to have registered to vote in Wilton  in 1920. A fifth sticker features a group of Connecticut suffragists and the sixth honors all Wilton women, known and unknown, who cast their first ballot 100 years ago. Although the pandemic eliminated actual stickers, designer Pamela Hovland pursued the idea of virtual ones that people could display on their social media sites or print out and display in their windows or elsewhere. “We were very lucky to have photographs in the Wilton history room of about 30 to 40 of the women who voted in that election,” Julie Hughes who works in the Wilton Library’s history room told The Wilton Bulletin.  “We were able to choose the best, sharpest photographs, and we were lucky those women were ones we happened to find historical information about.”</p>

Samantha Robson, a student at Kuna High School beat out more than 100 other entrants to have her artwork featured on the sticker. This started as a class project for me but it turned out to be a really exciting part of my year,” Robson said in a prepared statement. “Although it was pretty stressful at first, I am very grateful for the opportunity to put my work out there.”</p>

Negasi’s design celebrates the 100th anniversary of suffrage which gave women the right to vote  when Tennessee became the final state necessary to ratify the amendment in August of 1920. “It shows the importance of all women in the voting process, and how the inclusion of these voices is absolutely fundamental to initiating the representation people would like to see in political elections and pushing for the right changes in policy,” Negasi told the Metro Nashville Arts Commission. Metro Arts partnered with the Davidson County Election Commission to host the contest for middle and high school students to highlight Tennessee’s role in securing women’s right to vote. Negasi’s design was selected from among 75 contest entries.The new sticker will be available at all Davidson County early voting and Election Day voting locations for the August general and November presidential elections.</p>

<p><strong><u>Black Suffragettes<br />
</u></strong>Although largely a movement of white, wealthy women, the suffrage movement also included Black suffragettes. History.com has the story of <a href="https://www.history.com/news/black-suffragists-19th-amendment">5 Black suffragists</a> who fought for the 19th Amendment and so much more.</p>
<p>Six years before the final passage of the 19th Amendment, the 1913 parade in Washington, D.C. made a lot of headlines. In its special Battle for the Ballot section, The Washington Post has really interesting stories about the parade including: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/history/suffrage-racism-black-deltas-parade-washington/">The Black sorority that faced racism in the suffrage movement but refused to walk away</a></p>

</u></strong>And something to look forward to! On August 26, officials in New York City will unveil the first-ever statue to women in Central Park. Called the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/arts/design/suffragist-19th-amendment-central-park.html">Women’s Rights Pioneers Monument</a> the 14-foot-tall bronze monument features Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, three of the more prominent leaders in the nationwide fight for women’s right to vote.</p>
<p>According to <em>The New York Times</em>, the sculpture depicts the three figures gathered around a table for what seems to be a discussion or a strategy meeting. Anthony stands in the middle, holding a pamphlet that reads “Votes for Women”; Stanton, seated to her left, holds a pen, presumably taking notes; and Truth appears to be in midsentence.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show women working together,” said <a href="https://monumentalwomen.org/sculptors-page/">Meredith Bergmann</a>, the sculptor chosen from dozens of artists to create the statue. “I kept thinking of women now, working together in some kitchen on a laptop, trying to change the world.”</p>

I wanted to use it myself,” Daniel Dismukes, Haiku resident told the Maui News. In-person voting wasn’t without controversy though.

Poll workers were just as busy sanitizing polling places as they were handing out ballots. “We’ve been spraying down the voting booths, the tables here, door handles,” said Darci Karau a precinct captain in<a href="https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/pandemic-polling-places-well-prepared-but-sparsely-attended/article_b30d04bc-dc1f-11ea-9b51-c77585d84aa7.html"> Blue Earth County</a>.

I was wearing my mask, they had like little shields,&#8221; said Rochelle Goodrich, a Duluth resident.

The primaries for voting centers that had not received ballots by early afternoon are expected to be rescheduled, while voting would continue elsewhere, the commission said. “I have never seen on American soil something like what has just been done here in Puerto Rico. It’s an embarrassment to our government and our people,” said Pedro Pierluisi, who is running against Gov. Wanda Vázquez, to become the nominee for the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Meanwhile, Vázquez called the situation “a disaster” and demanded the resignation of the president of the elections commission. According to The Washington Post, the federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances issued a statement saying the “dysfunctional” voting process was unacceptable and blamed it on what it said was inefficiency by the elections commission. On Tuesday Vázquez<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/08/11/world/americas/ap-cb-puerto-rico-botched-primaries.html"> filed suit against the elections commission</a> seeking a re-do of voting at polling centers that opened late, not just those that ran out of ballots. The suit also seeks to stop the release of unconfirmed results from centers where voting did take place on Sunday. The island&#8217;s Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. “The uncertainty created since the process began in the morning hours caused thousands of voters to leave the voting centers where chaos and confusion reigned,” according Vazquez&#8217;s lawsuit, filed before the Court of First Instance. On Wednesday, the island’s Supreme Court ruled that the<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-ordered-resume-primary-after-ballot-shortage-suspension-n1236560"> primary must resume</a> on Sunday.</p>

She also thought most people voted early in a bid to avoid bigger crowds amid the ongoing pandemic. Booth’s Clarksville polling place averaged about 15 voters per hour.

Everyone was masked up, and there was plenty of space to move around, she said. When asked what brought her to the polls, Davis didn’t elaborate on specific issues, but instead told the Commercial Appeal, “I’m a voter, baby. I don’t miss an Election Day.” In<a href="https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20200806/election-day-safety-precautions-provide-no-issue-for-voters-in-maury-county"> Maury County</a>, 80-year-old poll worker Marlene Cannon was pleased with what election officials had done to make sure everyone was safe. “I would not have it any other way,” Cannon, wearing a face shield and sitting behind a clear plexiglass barrier told the Columbia Daily Herald. “I hope that I am encouragement for someone else. It is very important. We have to make sure this continues.” In<a href="https://wdef.com/2020/08/06/hamilton-county-voting-locations-see-decrease-lines/"> Hamilton County</a>, voters saw line-free polls and COVID safety precautions. “Things are a little bit spread out than what they normally are because of the social distancing.

That broke the primary record of 120K set in 2016. While the bulk of those votes did come via mail, people still did show up for<a href="https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2020/08/11/in-person-voting-is-light-but-turnout-high-for-pandemic-primary"> in-person voting</a> and there were few, if no reports of trouble. Social distancing requirements in some town voting sites did cause a few lines, but they seemed minimal. Those who did vote<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/08/11/in-person-voters-head-to-pandemic-tweaked-polls/"> in-person</a> did so for a variety of reasons including forgetting to mail back their ballots or simply because it’s tradition. “I still feel that there is something special about actually going to the polls and casting a vote,” Poll Worker Katrina VanTyne told Seven Days. “Voting by mail, it’s just not as ceremonious.” Williston Town Clerk Sarah Mason said voters really seemed to love the hybrid vote by mail/in-person system that was available. “People really, really, really liked this,” she said. “I mean, they sent love notes, thank yous on the outside of the [ballot] envelope.”<a href="https://vtdigger.org/election_brief/southwestern-town-clerks-report-smooth-new-process-high-voter-turnout/"> Drive-thru voting</a> has become very popular this year and that was no different in Manchester, Vermont. “It’s amazing,” poll worker Martha Heilemann said about manning the drive-thru location. “It’s not inconvenient — we didn’t know what to expect.”</p>

This year has been no different with elections officials from<a href="https://patch.com/florida/newportrichey/elections-supervisor-says-mailings-are-eroding-voter-confidence"> Florida</a> to<a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/ohioans-getting-random-absentee-ballot-applications-from-center-for-voter-information"> Ohio</a> to<a href="https://www.khq.com/regional/missoula-election-officials-clear-up-confusion-surrounding-third-party-ballot-request-forms/article_6e888cb5-40e6-5780-9f42-82efdcfa2ae7.html"> Montana</a> fielding calls about the mailers. In<a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/more-than-500000-virginia-voters-were-mailed-absentee-applications-with-incorrect-info"> Virginia</a>, more than 500,000 forms with incorrect information were sent to voters causing confusion for voters and more work and headaches for election officials. But the Center for Voter Information isn’t the only culprit. In<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/republican-voter-registration-mailer-goes-out-wrong-addresses"> New Hampshire</a>, the state GOP sent out mailers with incorrect information on where to send absentee voter registration forms. The group blamed a printing error. And sometimes, it’s not third-party organizations that have issues. In the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-board-of-elections-mailer-confusion/2020/08/12/580ed906-dca0-11ea-b205-ff838e15a9a6_story.html"> District of Columbia</a>, the D.C. Board of Elections—which will be mailing every registered voter a ballot for the November election — sent voters registration confirmation mailers, voters are complaining that poor design and instructions have prevented them from completing the forms. In<a href="https://www.wcia.com/news/clerks-office-addresses-error-on-vote-by-mail-application/"> Champaign County, Illinois</a> vote by mail applications have a transposed zip code on the application. The clerk’s office is encouraging voters to write in the correct zip code and the office has spoken with the local postmaster to ensure that the applications are delivered. In<a href="https://www.jamestownpress.com/articles/state-mailer-on-voting-causes-confusion-clerk-says/"> Rhode Island</a>, Jamestown Canvassing Clerk Karen Montoya said a mailer from the secretary of state’s office has had her phones ringing off the hook because it’s led to some confusion among voters about the 2020 voting process. Our best advice to advocates or election administrators doing mailings is probably read twice, mail once.</p>

County Clerk Shane Schoeller told KSMU the person with the illness was not an election judge and they do not work directly with the public. “And, per our contact with the Greene County Health Department, which I contacted immediately, they gave us the standard guideline in terms of, you know, exposure, and it had to be anyone who’s been in close contact with this individual for a total of 15 minutes cumulatively over a 24 hour period.” Despite being quarantined, Schoeller said they’ll be able to certify the results of the August 11 election.

The family owns the Alpine Creek Lodge at mile 68 on the Denali Highway. As residents of Mat-Su Borough, their closest polling place is 225 miles away in Sheep Mountain. According KTUU, to get to Sheep Mountain, they have to use a combination of dog sleds, snowmachines and vehicles. Despite the difficulty, Jennifer Bondy told KTUU her family votes in every election. They prefer to be at the polls in person, but they also register for an absentee ballot in case the weather prevents them from safely traveling. “Voting in person is important, it definitely shows for our son, it makes sure he realizes how important it is to make that journey out,” Jennifer told the station. Next time someone tells you they don’t have time to vote, please let them know about the Bondy family in Alaska.</p>

After years of no reward and then a couple of cycles with bracelets,<a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/08/06/i-voted-stickers-are-finally-coming-to-chicago-this-election-day/"> Chicagoans</a> who vote in the 2020 general election will finally not only be getting “I Voted” stickers but custom ones to boot! According to Book Club Chicago, The stickers will be given to people who vote in person, and they’ll be included in vote by mail ballots when they’re sent out. Like the wristbands, the stickers are blue and red and say, “I VOTED!” They also note this year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave some women the right to vote. Sticker lovers can actually thank the coronavirus for the switch from bracelets to stickers. “One reason for the change [to stickers] is the growth of vote by mail. We’re using an automated system to prepare the ballot envelopes, and the sticker works better in the insert process than a wristband,” election board Chairwoman Marisel Hernandez said in an emailed statement. “The second reason is that the sticker cards will be easier to hand out safely in early voting and Election Day voting.”</p>

The policy, common among larger private sector businesses, establishes procedures for outside researchers to inspect the Secretary of State’s website for vulnerabilities. Once those vulnerabilities are reported, it allows 120 calendar days for LaRose’s office to repair the vulnerability before the researcher may publicly announce its discovery. Having a defined time period provides assurances to the cybersecurity community that reporting of potential vulnerabilities will be treated with the seriousness they deserve. “We need to be vigilant and this smart approach ensures that Ohio continues to lead on election cybersecurity,”<a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/media-center/press-releases/2020/2020-08-11/"> said</a> LaRose. “Make no mistake, our nation’s enemies will be looking to disrupt our elections, and our websites &amp; databases are among their top targets. By putting this policy in place, we’ll be able to work with cybersecurity researchers to find our vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.” The policy describes what systems and types of research are covered, how to report vulnerabilities to the Secretary of State’s office, what is asked of cyber security researchers, and what researchers can expect from the office.</p>

Senate Bill 423 allows counties to merge precincts, as long as they keep the ratio of one precinct per 10,000 registered voters instead of the typical 1,000 voters. These consolidated polling places must be open from Saturday, Oct. 31, through Monday, Nov. 2, for at least eight hours each day and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day. Counties will also be required to open one ballot drop-off location for every 15,000 registered voters for 28 days before the election.</p>

The council said the threshold to get on the ballot—100 signatures—isn’t that difficult and the write-in process can be confusing to voters and election workers.</p>

Some council members’ reasons for opposing it were that it’s not currently allowed in Michigan, though there is legislation pending to allow it, and some said they didn’t want to layer ranked-choice voting on top of the city’s partisan elections and instead want to shift to elections without party labels.</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, voters in Grand Rapids will decide in November whether local elections, including races for city commission, will take place during<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2020/08/grand-rapids-voters-to-decide-if-they-want-even-year-elections-required-runoffs.html"> even years</a> as opposed to the current odd-year cycle.

Gaines has dismissed a lawsuit filed in May by the League of Women Voters and several elderly or sick Alabamians that had contended that provisions requiring<a href="https://www.al.com/politics/2020/08/absentee-voting-lawsuit-against-state-dismissed-by-judge.html"> absentee voters</a> to have photo IDs before getting their ballots and another requiring a notary public or two witnesses attest that the voter filled out the ballot violate Alabama’s constitution amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaines dismissed the lawsuit for several reasons. “For the reasons laid out in the defendants’ motions to dismiss, the court finds that it lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ complaint because Plaintiffs present a nonjusticiable political question, plaintiffs lack standing to sue defendants, and the claims against defendants are barred by sovereign immunity,” Gaines wrote in his order. “Additionally, the court notes that even if it had found that jurisdiction exists, it would have found that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, for the reasons laid out in the defendants’ motions to dismiss.”</p>
<p>Also in Alabama, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund have filed a petition asking that all of the judges on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reconsider the<a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2020/07/23/federal-appeals-court-upholds-alabamas-voter-id-law/"> July 21 decision</a> by a panel of three judges that fell 2-1 in favor of the state’s<a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2020/08/10/plaintiffs-ask-for-panel-of-judges-to-reconsider-ruling-on-alabama-voter-id-law/"> voter ID law</a>. The 2011 law requires voters in Alabama to show a valid, government-issued photo ID to vote. The NAACP, Greater Birmingham Ministries and several minority voters sued, arguing that lawmakers knowingly crafted the law to prevent Black people and other minorities, who are less likely to have such photo IDs, from voting. The three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the burden of Alabama’s voter ID law is minimal, and does not “violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the Constitution, nor does it violate the Voting Rights Act.”</p>

According to Courthouse News Service, the LA County Board of Supervisors asked the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk’s office to investigate the missteps and that 135-page internal report was released to the public, with recommendations on how the voting system could be improved by November. A separate, external audit conducted by Slalom Consulting was not released in its entirety, but only in summary form. Zetter twice requested the report including a formal request under the California Public Records Act. According to Zetter, the county said the records were exempt from disclosure. Zetter argues the county has not been able to make a proper “determination” as to why it is withholding public records as required by California law nor did it entertain the prospect of redacting portions of the document that could be withheld before they are released. Finally, Zetter says the records “contain information that is already public or is not subject to any basis for withholding” under California law.</p>

Walker last year issued a preliminary injunction ordering Lee to require 32 counties to take a series of steps, including providing Spanish-language ballots and materials, in time for the March 2020 presidential primary elections. The order Friday allowed the case to move forward with Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Kim Barton as a defendant.

The suit is seeking to have a judge require more polling places, better-trained poll workers and emergency paper ballots. “The issues we saw in Georgia in the primary cannot be repeated in November,” said U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “This is a problem with a clear solution, and there is no reason elections officials should not take the reasonable steps to make sure Georgians don’t stand in line for hours to vote.” Joining the DSCC in filing the suit were the Democratic Party of Georgia, two Fulton County voters and a Cobb County voter.</p>
<p>Also in Georgia, U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg denied an effort to convert Georgia elections to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-rules-against-switch-to-hand-marked-paper-ballots-in-georgia/MIF4XM3N7ZEBHG7HJNFR2PRHKE/"> paper ballots</a> filled out by hand, declining to throw out the state’s new voting system after its first statewide test in this spring’s primaries. Totenberg had allowed the suit to move forward based on problems with the state’s June primary however she ultimately ruled against the switch. The lawsuit argued that the state’s dependence on electronic voting made elections susceptible to manipulation or hacking. The plaintiffs said voters couldn’t truly confirm the accuracy of their printed ballots, which encode votes in bar codes for tabulation. “The court appreciates the plaintiffs’ central claim addresses the problem posed by tabulating votes based on a bar code that cannot be verified by voters in conjunction with the lack of meaningful, rigorous auditing,” Totenberg wrote. “However &#8230; the court finds that plaintiffs’ showing has been insufficient” because it was based on information presented before this year’s elections.</p>
<p>In another ruling, Totenberg rejected an argument that<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-news/judge-postage-requirement-for-mail-ballots-isnt-a-poll-tax/3GCBEHAKLZBENNE67BGCSB55NY/"> requiring voters to provide their own stamps</a> for mail-in ballots and ballot applications amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax. A lawsuit filed in April by the American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter alleged that the postage requirement effectively imposes a poll tax and is an unjustifiable burden on the right to vote. Totenberg acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during a pandemic, but said that its availability means that the postage requirement is not tantamount to an unconstitutional poll tax. “The fact that any registered voter may vote in Georgia on election day without purchasing a stamp, and without undertaking any ‘extra steps’ besides showing up at the voting precinct and complying with generally applicable election regulations, necessitates a conclusion that stamps are not poll taxes,” Totenberg wrote in her order.</p>

The 20-page complaint says Pritzker violated Illinoisans’ voting rights “by signing into law a partisan voting scheme that is designed to harvest Democratic ballots, dilute Republican ballots, and, if the election still doesn’t turn out the way he wants it, to generate enough Democratic ballots after election day to sway the result.”</p>

The suit is seeking to expand the state’s absentee voting laws. “In deciding whether to attend any public gathering, particularly a polling place on election day, voters are required to consider, and are permitted to follow, public health guidance,” the lawsuit says.

The motion asserts the campaign has singled out Nevada for litigation rather than letting the policy debate occur outside the courthouse. The motion notes that Utah, Colorado, Oregon, Hawaii and Washington have also adopted mail-in voting systems for the upcoming election. “Given the fears surrounding the pandemic, these vote-by-mail systems have great potential to prompt widespread voting by mail in the 2020 general election,” the motion states. “Yet President Donald J.

It is “certain that the burdens are much more unusual and substantial than those that voters are generally expected to bear,” the panel wrote. “Taking an unusual and in fact unnecessary chance with your life is a heavy burden to bear simply to vote.” The Rhode Island Republican Party and Republican National Committee filed an appeal to the<a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/elections/gop-appeals-ri-mail-ballot-signature-suspension-to-u-s-supreme-court/"> U.S. Supreme Court.</a></p>

House and Senate want the State Supreme Court to<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article244876462.html"> dismiss a voter petition</a> that seeks to expand the right to vote absentee in the upcoming November election. In papers filed Tuesday with the S.C. Supreme Court, House Speaker Jay Lucas and Senate President Harvey Peeler, both Republicans, urge the Supreme Court to dismiss the petition and say the right to seek changes in state election laws resides in the Legislature and not in the courts. “While the coronavirus certainly presents challenges to previously-routine parts of American life, it does not and cannot wipe out the separation-of-powers doctrine, nor can it render the entirety of the state’s Election Code unconstitutional, as urged by the Petitioners,” Peeler, of Cherokee County, said in his legal filing. “The case should be dismissed accordingly.” In his legal filing, Lucas, of Darlington, urged the Supreme Court to hear arguments on the matter — but only for the purposes of dismissing the petition.</p>

Kendra Lee, voter protection director for the Tennessee Democratic Party was listed as a plaintiff in the suit. &#8220;Because Ms. Lee has asthma and bronchitis,&#8221; the federal complaint read, &#8220;she cannot safely vote in person because in so doing, she would potentially expose herself to the risk of serious complications from COVID-19. If forced to choose between voting in person or not at all this Fall, Ms. Lee will likely choose not voting — despite her desire to do so — in order to protect her health and safety.&#8221; But Lee voted in person during the early voting period.</p>
<p>Also in Tennessee, U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson ruled Wednesday that he won’t block Tennessee’s<a href="https://apnews.com/e4fc7928b8cf79c525b26c10f5c9301a"> criminal restriction on some distribution of absentee voting-related forms</a> for the November election, saying the groups that challenged the law were confused over which forms are which and likely cited the wrong law. Richardson wrote that the plaintiffs cited examples related to a law that makes it a Class E felony for everyone outside of election officials to give an application for an absentee ballot to anyone who doesn’t first ask for one. “Plaintiffs plainly are confused to an extent about the difference between an application and a request for an application,” Richardson wrote.</p>

Facebook will use content authored by BPC to provide Facts About Voting dealing with the election date, voting by mail, how and where to check your registration status, and other critical topics as voters navigate this unprecedented election. The information will also be used to help counter the spread of misinformation in the run-up to the election. “The keys to a functioning democracy are that every eligible voter has the opportunity to participate and the election outcome is trusted and accepted by candidates and the general public,” said BPC President Jason Grumet. “In a moment of information overload, BPC welcomes the opportunity to provide voters with unbiased facts about the election process.”</p>

Twitter’s move will involve coming up with new policies “that emphasize accurate information about all available options to vote, including by mail and early voting.” “We’re focused on empowering every eligible person to register and vote through partnerships, tools and new policies,” Jessica Herrera-Flanigan, Twitter’s vice president for public policy in the Americas, told Reuters in an email.</p>

Snapchat said it plans to launch four new, election-related features by early September, according to a spokesperson. As part of this feature, a new &#8220;Voter Registration Mini&#8221; will allow users to register to vote directly in Snapchat, in a partnership with the online tool TurboVote that aims to streamline the process. It will also include a tracker to monitor how many users have registered to vote on Snapchat. A new “Voter Guide” will provide resources on topics like voting by mail, ballot education, voter registration, accessibility and voter suppression, in an effort to “help make voting more accessible for all groups who have been historically disenfranchised,” the company said. The guide is available by keyword search and will feature content from the NAACP, ACLU, BallotReady, DemocracyWorks, APIA Vote, I am a Voter, Vote Early Day, National Voter Registration Day and more.</p>

To verify the voter&#8217;s identity, the system will check the name, date of birth and Georgia driver&#8217;s license or state identification card number provided by the applicant against the information in the state voter registration system. If that information doesn&#8217;t match, the applicant will be redirected to fill out a form that can be printed out and sent in so the voter&#8217;s signature can be verified against the signature on file.</p>

The website, funded by a COVID-19 relief grant to the county, is expected to launch in mid-September, with the objective to train workers safely amid the coronavirus pandemic. For this past primary election, Nelson said they trained 325 people in a “jam-packed” room. But as the pandemic continues to hamper large gatherings, the elections board had to come up with some “creative solutions.”</p>
<p>Also in Texas,<a href="https://www.fox7austin.com/news/travis-county-offering-text2register-application-for-2020-election"> Travis County</a> is launching a text-2-register program. &#8220;In this age of COVID-19, we&#8217;ve got to find a safe and easy way to register to vote, participate in democracy, and that’s why we are so excited to unveil the text-2-register app,” said Bruce Elfant, Travis County’s Voter Registrar &amp; Tax Assessor-Collector. This new approach is actually a reboot and merging of two older out-reach programs from 2015 and 2016; each had limited success. A cartoon ad campaign explains how text-2-register works. Basic information from a resident is first sent through a text message request, which then provides a response with a link to an online form, which is filled out and printed at home. &#8220;They can&#8217;t even complete the application if not all of the information is not there and so we are not going to get any more incomplete applications anymore, which will be great,” Elfant told Fox 7. A bright yellow envelope sent to the resident is used to mail the form to the county office. Clerical processing data is already on the form to help eliminate errors later.</p>

							<h2>New Resources</h2>
														<p><em>An occasional round up of some of the new(ish) resources made available to elections officials in advance of the 2020 general election.</em></p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong><br />
<a href="https://voteathome.org/comms-toolkit/">Elections Officials Communication Toolkit</a>, National Vote At Home Institute: Getting voters the information they need about elections when they need it is a constant challenge. Clear and focused communication will be essential as election officials like you accommodate increased mail ballot requests from voters wanting to vote safely at home this November. Less than 5% of election offices have dedicated communications staff, though we think most of you would agree that getting these messages to voters as effectively and efficiently as possible is a high priority. This Election Official Communications Toolkit is for all election officials, but particularly those of you who are looking to add more tools to your box. Whether you have no communications capacity or a large budget, you can find something useful to include in your elections communications plan.</p>
<p><strong>Election Security</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/election-vulnerability-reporting-guide">Guide to Vulnerability Reporting for America’s Election Administrators</a>, CISA: This resource provides election administrators with a step-by-step guide, list of resources, and a template for establishing a successful vulnerability disclosure program to address possible vulnerabilities in their state and local election systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-security-preparedness#_2xqaqpmtaumr">EAC Online Cybersecurity Training</a>, U.S. Election Assistance Commission and Center for Tech and Civic Life: Self-paced, cybersecurity training specific to election officials at no cost to all State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial election offices. The training consists of both video and written materials separated into three modules, Cybersecurity 101, 201, and 301. The training was developed by the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) and is delivered through their online platform. The training is designed specifically for election administrators and provides foundational knowledge on cybersecurity terminology, best practices in election offices, practical application, and communication.</p>
<p><strong>Poll Workers</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/recruiting-election-workers/">50 Ideas for Recruiting and Retaining Election Workers</a>, Center for Tech and Civic Life:  Whether they’re staffing the polls, processing ballots, or fielding voter phone calls, your temporary election workers are invaluable. But many jurisdictions struggle to recruit enough, even without a global pandemic! That’s why we’re rounding up your success stories. Elections aren’t one-size-fits-all, so steal ideas you like and ignore the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Vote By Mail</strong><br />
<a href="https://voteathome.org/elections-officials-operational-toolkit/">Vote By Mail Planning Calculator</a>, Vote At Home Institute: The Voting by Mail Planning Calculator estimates the number of voters who choose mail ballots under a variety of scenarios and uses that information to model the likely costs and resource needs associated with supporting those mail voters. A<a href="https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-Vote-by-Mail-Resource-Planning-user-guide-1.pdf"> user guide</a> and<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GXLkpqnP6ZBL-CqXZ951rAQzFIWM-pUj?usp=sharing"> step by step demo videos</a> accompany it as well to make sure users can take full advantage of the capabilities.</p>
