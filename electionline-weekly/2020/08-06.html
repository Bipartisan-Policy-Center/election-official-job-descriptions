<em>CISA releases guide to vulnerability reporting, vendors follow suit</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) recently released the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/election-vulnerability-reporting-guide"> Guide to Vulnerability Reporting for America’s Election Administrators</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The guide walks election officials through the steps of establishing a vulnerability disclosure program. Vulnerability disclosures can be an effective way for organizations to benefit from cybersecurity expertise without having it resident to their organization.</p>
<p>“Election officials have spent years beefing up security to their systems and closing these vulnerability gaps to keep our elections safe and secure,” said CISA Director Christopher Krebs.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity researchers can be great and responsible partners in this effort and we are creating this guide as a way to help state and local election officials understand the support they can offer and how to work with them in our collective, whole of nation effort to protect our elections.”</p>
<p>The guide aims to help election officials understand the role that the cybersecurity research community can play in helping officials keep systems secure so that the American public’s voice can be clearly heard.</p>
<p>“Verified Voting applauds CISA on the publication of guidance for election officials on reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities in critical elections infrastructure,” said Marian K. Schneider, president of <a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/">Verified Voting</a>. “We hope that jurisdictions adopt such policies and follow this guidance so that election systems can become stronger and more resilient.”</p>
<p>The guide includes a number of best practices for improving and addressing vulnerabilities within election systems, and offers a step-by-step guide for election administrators who seek to establish a successful vulnerability disclosure program. The six steps include:</p>
<p>Step 1: Identify Systems Where You Would Accept Security Testing, and those Off-Limits<br />
Step 2: Draft an Easy-to-Read Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (See Appendix III)<br />
Step 3: Establish a Way to Receive Reports/Conduct Follow-On Communication<br />
Step 4: Assign Someone to Thank and Communicate with Researchers<br />
Step 5: Assign Someone to Vet and Fix the Vulnerabilities<br />
Step 6: Consider Sharing Information with Other Affected Parties</p>
<p>“The elections community has known since 2016 at least that cyberthreats are real; the new vulnerability reporting guidelines – and the private sector’s move to allow outside parties to probe their products – is a welcome sign that the field is taking the threat seriously by thinking about what’s next if a cybersecurity vulnerability emerges,” said<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/about/leadership/doug-chapin/"> Doug Chapin</a>, director of elections research at Fors Marsh Group and founder of electionline.org.</p>
<p>This week, following the release of guide, elections vendor <a href="https://www.essvote.com/">ES&amp;S</a> announced a policy to work more closely with researchers to find bugs and vulnerabilities in its networks and websites.</p>
<p>“Hackers are going to hack, researchers are going to research, whether or not there’s a policy in place,” Chris Wlaschin, ES&amp;S’s vice president of systems security,<a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/ess-election-security-vulnerability-disclosure-black-hat/"> told</a> CyberScoop. “We think it’s important to have that safe harbor language out there to set expectations.”</p>
<p>During a talk at <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/">Black Hat USA 2020 Virtual</a>, Wlaschin stressed that an open and collaborative relationship with independent researchers is integral to its work to help states and localities carry out the safest and most secure elections possible.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to expanding our Vulnerability Disclosure Program, further leveraging the expertise of independent researchers to help us find and address potential issues,” said Wlaschin, who helped establish the program more than 18 months ago. “We appreciate the researchers’ efforts, and we look forward to even more collaboration and greater protections for America’s elections.”</p>
<p>According to CyberScoop, the<a href="https://2l9u8tyqi4-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ESS_vulnerability_disclosure_policy.pdf"> policy</a> allows researchers to probe ES&amp;S’s corporate systems and public-facing websites. The ES&amp;S policy gives the company 90 days to fix vulnerabilities before researchers can report on them publicly — a standard timeline in the research community.</p>
<p>The move was praised by election and cybersecurity experts.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity researchers have been trying for years to have a deeper, more productive relationship with members of the election community, both vendors and public sector partners,” said Trevor Timmons, chief information officer at the<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado Department of State</a>. “As the voting system providers are moving to embrace vulnerability disclosure programs, such as ES&amp;S’ recent announcement, state and local jurisdictions should also be moving to adopt programs like this. CISA has been working over the past months with public and private sector experts to create a ‘how to’ guide and I expect we will start to see adoption even this year. The reality is that many cybersecurity researchers want to help. We need to engage with them to help us find and close security gaps.”</p>
<p>On<a href="https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1291130517212008449?s=20"> Twitter</a>, Jack Cable, a white hat hacker and coder said,  “Today, the nation&#8217;s largest voting vendor released a vulnerability disclosure policy giving hackers authorization to test their systems. This is a great step towards transparency for election security. I hope that other vendors follow suit and welcome hackers with open arms.”</p>
<p>According to Kay Stimson, vice president of government affairs at<a href="https://www.dominionvoting.com/"> Dominion Voting</a>, Dominion will be releasing its policy within the next few weeks. “Our company entered into a voluntary and cooperative agreement with other voting system providers to create a company policy as part of our membership in the EI-SIG (Election Industry Special Interest Group), which is part of the IT-ISAC.”</p>
<p>On Twitter, Cable said there are three things that make a good vulnerability disclosure: Safe harbor, clear scope and no strict non-disclosure provisions.</p>
<p>“The ES&amp;S policy hits all three, and I will praise any company that comes forward with a similar policy. Voting vendors do face a unique constraint that they cannot necessarily authorize testing on a majority of their systems (e.g. those in the hands of election officials),” Cable<a href="https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1291130521662230528?s=20"> said</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>Schneider, with Verified Voting, believes ES&amp;S&#8217; release is a step in the right direction, but with hopefully more to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;ES&amp;S’s publication of a vulnerability Disclosure Policy is an incremental step in the right direction, but needs much more clarity about what ES&amp;S systems are available for study, the freedom for researchers to examine them, and the actual disclosures of any findings,&#8221; Schneider said.</p>
<p><strong>Mail-in Voting 2020 Infrastructure Risk Assessment</strong><br />
CISA also recently released an infrastructure risk assessment for mail-in voting in 2020. The<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cisa-mail-in-voting-infrastructure-risk-assessment_508.pdf"> Mail-in Voting 2020 Infrastructure Risk Assessment</a> noted that while all forms of voting bring a variety of cyber and infrastructure risks, the risks to mail-in voting can be managed through various policies, procedures and controls.</p>
<p>“The outbound and inbound processing of mail-in ballots introduces additional infrastructure and technology, introducing new or additional potential vectors for cyber attacks and increasing the opportunity for cyber actors to impact the infrastructure at scale,” the assessment notes.</p>
<p>“Implementation of mail-in voting infrastructure and processes within a compressed timeline may also introduce new risk. To address this risk, election officials should focus on cyber risk management activities, including effective access controls and authentication best practices.”</p>

While there were no lines, there was some confusion because some polling sites had been forced to move due to the pandemic.<a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/primary-election-in-arizona-heres-everything-that-happened-on-aug-4/75-dde65f57-1858-488e-8437-ecd873aa954e"> Maricopa County’s</a> early voting ballot status webpage was down for bit just after polls opened at 6 a.m., but was back up and running by 7 a.m. For elections officials whose jurisdictions cover the Navajo Nation, the 2020 primary season meant changes to their normal process. Due to the closure of government buildings on tribal lands,<a href="https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Counties-navigate-restrictions-on-tribal-land-for-15455887.php"> Coconino County</a> set up tents for voting and the secretary of state’s office also sent portable hand-washing stations. Some county election workers in Tuba City had to shift their hours because they didn&#8217;t have the option of staying at hotels on the Navajo Nation that were closed because of the pandemic County Recorder Patty Hansen told the <em>Associated Press</em>. “It has been a challenge for us to determine what will be the safest locations and procedures for our Navajo Nation, Havasupai and Hopi voters, but I’m very pleased that we’ve had such good collaboration with the tribal governments,&#8221; Hansen said. And sadly, a proposed test of a drone to carry vote tallies from the Havasupai Reservation polling location in a gorge off the Grand Canyon had to be scrapped because there was no way for the pilot of the drone to maintain line of sight through the canyon or comply with other federal regulations, Hansen told the <em>AP</em>.</p>

It was pretty easy.”<a href="https://krcgtv.com/news/local/polling-locations-run-smoothly-in-boone-county"> Boone County</a> Clerk Brianna Lennon said about 18,000 voted in-person on Tuesday and there were no issues or glitches.  In<a href="https://www.kfvs12.com/2020/08/04/volunteers-voting-polls/"> Sikeston</a>, election officials relied on high school students to keep the polling places clean. “We’re wiping things down to make sure that we keep the spread of the virus as minimal as possible so that people feel safe to come and vote,” sophomore Zoie McDonald told KFVS. She said it was important to volunteer. “We’re getting community service hours but even if we weren’t, I probably would still do it,” senior Madeline Sherrod told the station, calling the experience “cool”. There was at least one election night issue.<a href="https://www.kctv5.com/politics/clay-county-conducting-vote-recount-for-some-races-after-machine-programming-error-tuesday/article_3691d05a-d767-11ea-8779-9f81766991f5.html"> Clay County</a> was forced to recount a county commission race after a voting machine error.

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5857" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/YellowSpringOhio.png" alt="" width="248" height="296" />Earlier this year, the residents of Yellow Springs, Ohio</strong> voted 727 to 571 to<a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/local/greene-co-board-of-elections-told-to-reject-non-us-citizen-voting-in-yellow-springs/W3ZOCCXCHJFL7OA2YWNI4M7USA/"> allow noncitizens to vote in village elections</a>. Now, Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose has ordered the Greene County board of elections to reject noncitizen voter registrations and to put measures in place to ensure only citizens may vote in Yellow Springs. According to the <em>Springfield News</em>, LaRose said the measure violates both the U.S. Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. LaRose cited the Ohio Revised Code in his order, saying “While it is true that Ohio’s Constitution confers “home rule” powers on Ohio’s municipalities, those municipalities may only exercise home rule powers “as are not in conflict with the general laws.” According to the paper Yellow Springs intends to fight the order, though Village Council President Brian Housh said the village also does not want to incur tax payer dollars in the process. Housh hopes Gov. DeWine steps-in before the issue moves to court. “I guess what it looks like, if they are really going to pursue this, then I guess it will go to the Ohio Supreme Court,” Housh said. As of March 2020, 12 municipalities in the U.S. allowed noncitizens to vote in some or all local elections.</p>

In an interview about a Facebook post, Lanier said that employees in her office had been contacted by people she declined to identify, who asked questions about Lanier&#8217;s personal life and her family. Lanier said that she called the Missouri Ethics Commission, the Missouri Secretary of State and the FBI to report her concerns about pressure on her office. “Contact was made with employees in my office and my family, asking personal questions about my life and slandering me in an effort to persuade the upcoming Aug. 4, 2020, election,” she wrote on her Facebook page. “These are negative campaign ethics.

The office is initially taking 31,000 square feet of the building. It will take the rest of the space on Jan. 1, 2022, when communications firm Windstream plans to vacate the first-floor space it currently occupies. General Registrar Kirk Showalter said the city has been searching for five years for a space that could consolidate the office’s operations, which currently are split between its City Hall space and a 6,000-square-foot storage warehouse it leases. She said the new space will increase the office’s storage capacity to 10,000 square feet.</p>

Although Wilton’s will be a bit different because they will be virtual stickers. A set of six stickers features the images of four Wilton women known to have registered to vote in Wilton  in 1920. A fifth sticker features a group of Connecticut suffragists and the sixth honors all Wilton women, known and unknown, who cast their first ballot 100 years ago. Although the pandemic eliminated actual stickers, designer Pamela Hovland pursued the idea of virtual ones that people could display on their social media sites or print out and display in their windows or elsewhere. “We were very lucky to have photographs in the Wilton history room of about 30 to 40 of the women who voted in that election,” Julie Hughes who works in the Wilton Library’s history room told The Wilton Bulletin.  “We were able to choose the best, sharpest photographs, and we were lucky those women were ones we happened to find historical information about.”</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>A<a href="https://wtop.com/elections/2020/08/experts-assure-house-panel-of-us-election-security-improvements/"> House Homeland Security subcommittee</a> heard from several witnesses</strong>, who said it is critical for Americans to have confidence in the election system, given the foreign meddling that occurred four years ago. John Gilligan, president and CEO of the Center for Internet Security, said states have made technical improvements that make it difficult to hack into voting systems. He noted that election officials have consistently said that there was no evidence any votes were changed in the 2016 election. “Those systems tend to be highly resilient, and they’re not easily accessible,” Gilligan said. When asked his greatest fear for the upcoming election, he cited the issue of voter confidence that was rattled four years ago. “I believe that the biggest challenge that we continue to have into 2020 … is to be able to ensure that the American public has clear information about what is being done to protect the systems,” Gilligan said.</p>
<p><strong>The State Department has announced</strong> that it will offer<a href="https://www.state.gov/rewards-for-justice-reward-offer-for-information-on-foreign-interference-in-u-s-elections/"> rewards of up to $10 million</a> for information to help identify any person who, acting at the direction of a foreign government, tries to hack into election or campaign infrastructure.</p>

The<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/510362-house-republicans-introduce-legislation-to-give-states-400-million-for"> Emergency Assistance for Safe Elections (EASE) Act</a> would designate $200 million to assist with sanitizing in-person polling stations and purchasing personal protective equipment, while a further $100 million would go towards recruiting and training new poll workers, following a nationwide shortage of workers due to the pandemic. The final $100 million would be appropriated for states to maintain the accuracy of their voter registration lists. Other provisions in the bill include measures to increase the cybersecurity of the elections process, including establishing an election cyber assistance unit at the Election Assistance Commission, and updating voluntary voting system guidelines established by the Help America Vote Act to cover next-generation voting technology, such as e-pollbooks.</p>

The executive order automatically restores their voting rights once they have discharged their sentence or been granted probation or parole. Reynolds, signed the order to restore the right to vote to felons who have completed their sentences or have been paroled or placed on probation, and to set up a process where she will daily restore voting rights of eligible felons going forward. “It boils down to our fundamental belief in redemption and second chances,” she said. “Quite simply, when someone serves their sentence and has paid the price our justice system has set for their crime, they should have their right to vote restored automatically, plain and simple.” The order does not apply to felons who were convicted under Iowa’s Chapter 707 homicide criminal code section — which includes murder, manslaughter and voluntary manslaughter — nor does it extend voting rights to felons with special lifetime sentences for sexual crimes or other offenses.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> After several virtual meetings, the Minnetonka Charter Commission passed a resolution July 28 rejecting the<a href="https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_sailor/community/minnetonka/minnetonka-charter-commission-rejects-ranked-choice-voting-method/article_98764936-d663-11ea-a2fb-2b7c408339a4.html"> ranked-choice voting charter amendment</a> proposed by the city council, asking it to rescind the ordinance. At its first June meeting, the Minnetonka City Council adopted an ordinance to amend the city charter requiring the use of ranked-choice voting for municipal elections and remove all references to primaries from the charter. This accelerated the process for the Charter Commission to further study the impacts of the amendment and whether it would be in the best interest of residents. The commission had up to 60 days, or until Aug. 7, to review the proposed amendment, though it could potentially take up to 150 days, or until Nov. 5, if more information was requested.</p>

<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> State Representatives Jeffrey A.

That typically means they must be mailed by the Thursday prior to Election Day or be dropped off in person. Knopp is proposing instead that ballots must be postmarked no later than the Saturday before Election Day—effectively giving voters an extra two days and protecting them from unforeseen delays in mail delivery.</p>

He argued there were already plenty of ways for someone to register to vote, including by absentee ballot during the 2020 cycle due to the coronavirus. “New Hampshire has a very accessible voter registration process. Voters have the option of in-person registration with town clerks, same-day registration on Election Day and the ability to register by absentee for those with disabilities or who will be temporarily absent on election day,” he said in his veto statement. “This ease of registering to vote in New Hampshire is reflected in the high percentage of eligible voting age individuals who are able to register and vote every year.”</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Assembly Majority Conference Leader Annette Quijano (D-Elizabeth) and Assemblywoman Nancy Pinkin (D-East Brunswick) have introduced a bill that would require<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/lawmakers-want-voting-system-vendors-to-disclose-shareholders/"> voting machine vendors</a> that work with New Jersey to disclose their ownership structure.

This order authorized state election officials to make their own determinations at the local level.  On Tuesday, Stark County commissioners were asked to affirm and uphold their oaths by voting on a resolution affirming that they will<a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/government-and-politics/6604914-Stark-County-commissioners-approve-resolution-on-voting"> maintain polling places</a> in order to secure the rights of county citizen to vote in-person this November.  Commissioners thought so and passed the resolution unanimously certifying that the county will have in-person voting come November.</p>

That law required people who have served time for a felony to pay off any court debts before they can register to vote. “Voting is a right. It is not a privilege only for those who can afford to pay a poll tax,” Illinois AG Kwame Raoul said in a written statement. “Pay-to-vote laws are discriminatory and serve mainly to suppress Black and other minority voters. Individuals who have completed their sentences deserve a second chance, which includes having the right to participate in our nation’s democracy.” In addition to the attorney generals,<a href="https://www.wlrn.org/post/civil-rights-veterans-argue-against-florida-voting-law#stream/0"> three dozen former Department of Justice attorneys</a> are also asking a federal appeals court to side with plaintiffs. The 37-page brief filed this week includes a history of the litigation surrounding discriminatory voting laws that led to the passage of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and seminal U.S. Supreme Court decisions thwarting states from skirting the constitutional amendment’s prohibition against poll taxes.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, Pinellas County Circuit Judge George M. Jirotka denied Democrats motion for partial summary judgement that the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections violated state law when they refused to initially provide them with the names and contact information for 68<a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/politics/2020/08/04/pinellas-judge-rejects-florida-democratic-party-request-for-information-on-voters-who-cast-provisional-ballots"> voters who had to cast a provisional ballot</a> in the March 17 presidential primary election. “What’s very important is that I recognize that there’s a constitutional right to public records and we respect that,” Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Julie Marcus told Spectrum Bay News 9 after she learned of the judge’s ruling. “But there is also an unfettered constitutional right to a secret ballot. That was the issue at hand. And I will go to whatever extent I have to go to the highest court possible to ensure that our voters right to a secret ballot is not violated.”</p>

The lawsuit questions if a bill passed by the General Assembly in May that made various changes to elections this year due to COVID-19 effects local units of government. The lawsuit contends that the bill only amended the School Code and the State Universities Civil Service Act. It did not specifically mention the Municipal Code which governs Illinois cities. The lawsuit court documents say that the Illinois Municipal League asked the Illinois State Board of Elections and lawmakers who sponsored the bill for clarification, but didn’t receive an answer. The lawsuit says that requiring all municipalities to close on Election Day would be an “unfunded mandate with unintended implications on municipal operations, personnel and collective bargaining agreements.”</p>

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, comes as state officials are facing increasing pressure to allow no-excuse absentee voting for the Nov. 3 general election because of the health threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic that has already claimed 150,000 American lives. The lawsuit says “even in the best of times the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline disenfranchises voters, this is not the best of times. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a number of new and significant challenges for voters and election officials, including serious health risks to in-person voting and significant delays in mail-in ballot delivery.”</p>

The lawsuit was filed Monday on behalf of the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP, the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice and voters from Baton Rouge and Hammond. Ardoin crafted an emergency plan for the state’s July and August elections that increased early voting and expanded mail-in balloting. But no such plan has been offered so far for the fall elections.</p>

The MVA believes the county is violating State statute 203B.121. In particular, the party balance requirement: &#8220;No more than half of the election judges in a precinct may be members of the same major political party unless the election board consists of an odd number of election judges, in which case the number of election judges who are members of the same major political party may be one more than half the number of election judges in that precinct.&#8221; The MVA says the county is using its employees to serve in these positions, and it&#8217;s a conflict of interests when election judges are rejecting ballots.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Voter Alliance has also sued Gov. Tim Walz and other officials in an attempt to<a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/voters-sue-walz-to-block-face-masks-at-minnesota-polls/89-2c9e8f68-ce38-4eb7-b91e-de54b58fcb91"> block a requirement that voters wear face masks</a> at polling places to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The suit argues that Walz&#8217;s mask mandate conflicts with a 1963 state law making it a misdemeanor for someone to conceal their identity with a mask. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a statement standing behind “the legality and constitutionality&#8221; of Walz&#8217;s executive order.</p>
<p>In other Minnesota litigation news, Ramsey County Assistant Chief Judge Sara Grewing has extended a court order allowing registered Minnesota voters to<a href="https://www.southernminn.com/owatonna_peoples_press/news/state/article_1844e093-9b13-5afe-b3e6-1ba5e4503103.html"> skip getting a witness signature</a> on their mail-in ballot for the Aug. 11 to the November general election. The decision by Grewing also ordered that with an increased volume in mail-in balloting and U.S. Postal Service delays, election officials must count Minnesotans’ ballots if they are postmarked by Election Day, as long as they are received by official county canvassing dates. The ruling follows an hours-long court hearing Friday involving two lawsuits from groups concerned about preserving voting rights during the COVID-19 pandemic, including for populations most vulnerable to the effects of infection, like people of color, seniors and those with preexisting health conditions.</p>

Under Torres’s decision, ballots received the day after Election Day — June 24 — will be counted “without regard to whether such ballots are postmarked by June 23.” Ballots that were received by June 25 — two days after the election deadline — would also be valid, so long as they did not have a postmark later than June 23. In sworn testimony postal officials conceded that their system of identifying and postmarking ballots was not foolproof, and that some ballots had not been postmarked.

The ruling said people will now be ensured “due process” to fix any problems that arise with their ballots, and Osteen left open the door for the state’s political leaders to write a more specific rule or law “which provides a voter with notice and an opportunity to be heard” if there is a problem with their mail-in ballot. Osteen quoted the challengers’ argument that leaving the current rules in place “could result in voters being inadvertently disenfranchised if they make a mistake.” Osteen did not rule on several other provisions of the original lawsuit including the deadline for voter registration, use of ballot drop boxes and the witness requirement for absentee ballots.</p>

Filed in Franklin County Common Pleas Court, the Democrats’ suit argues that current law already allows Ohioans to send in requests for absentee ballots either by email or fax. It wants a judge to agree that electronic forms of transmission are acceptable for ballot requests so that the electronic methods can begin to be accepted. The league’s suit &#8212; which also includes the A. Philip Randolph Institute of Ohio and others as co-plaintiffs, all represented by the ACLU of Ohio &#8212; also touches on the anticipated high numbers of absentee ballots that would be requested due to the pandemic. It’s filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus. The lawsuit challenges the practice of election officials matching voter signatures on the ballots and the ballot applications.</p>
<p>Also in Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said that he has asked the state’s attorney general for clarity on whether or not it is allowable to install more than one<a href="https://www.wksu.org/post/larose-says-ag-will-determine-if-boards-elections-can-add-ballot-drop-boxes#stream/0"> ballot drop box</a> per county. If it&#8217;s legal to add extra drop boxes, then I&#8217;m certainly open to that idea,&#8221; LaRose said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a question that I&#8217;ve asked the attorney general to clarify, because the Ohio revised code is definitely not clear as to the question of whether counties can add additional drop boxes.&#8221;</p>

Supreme Court for an emergency hearing to declare the state’s election law unconstitutional and widen voting ahead of November, arguing the state has failed to guarantee access to the ballot for all people during the pandemic. More specifically, the petition asks the court, for example, to implement early voting, drop-box absentee returns, curbside voting polling locations and online absentee applications in addition to allowing more time for officials to count absentee ballots.</p>
<p>Another group of South Carolina voters has asked U.S. District Judge Michelle Childes for an injunction that would require the South Carolina Election Commission to allow all voters — not just a limited few —<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article244712647.html"> the right to vote absentee</a> in the upcoming November election. This week’s injunction request seeks a far broader ruling than the pre-primary ruling and would open up absentee voting to virtually anyone who wanted to do so. Currently, only a minority of South Carolinians in narrowly defined categories — such as being in jail, or being disabled, or being away on vacation — are granted permission to vote absentee. The injunction seeks: o allow all S.C. voters the right to cast an absentee ballot in the upcoming November election; To extend the time by which mailed-in ballots must reach elections officials in order to be counted; and to eliminate the requirement that an absentee voter must have another person witness their signature.

According to the complaint, the plaintiffs have been barred from voting in the primary election because Tennessee has improperly imposed additional barriers that would clear them to submit a ballot. During last week’s hearing, attorneys argued for an injunction that would force the state to people who have had their voting rights restored to vote in the Aug. 6 primary and any future election.</p>
<p>Also in Tennessee, Janet Kleinfelter, deputy attorney general argued before the state Supreme Court, that a Davidson County Chancery Court essentially rewrote<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/tennessee-supreme-court-weighs-vote-by-mail-expansion-during-pandemic/"> vote-by-mail</a> laws when she issued an injunction allowing all Tennesseans to send in their ballots during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Courts don’t construe statutes based upon what the current circumstances are,” Kleinfelter told the justices. “Courts construe statutes based upon the plain language and the legislative intent.” On Wednesday, the Supreme Court<a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/news/state/justices-overturn-tennessee-mail-vote-expansion-for-november/51-d68a840c-cf98-4a34-89c4-c68bba1d292c"> overturned the option</a> for all eligible voters to vote by mail in November due to COVID-19.

The legal challenge combines four unique lawsuits that contend several Wisconsin voting laws shouldn’t be allowed to stand during the COVID-19 pandemic because they make it too difficult for people to vote as the virus spreads. Two of the lawsuits were filed before the April 7 presidential primary and have been extended to apply to November’s election. Two others were filed after April’s election. The challenge is asking the federal court to extend the state’s online voter registration deadline, as well as the deadline for mail-in ballots to be received by election officials. The court did both of those things for April’s election. During arguments, Conley said he believes current deadlines for mail-in ballots make it very possible some ballots may arrive too late to be counted. &#8220;Absentee ballots requested five days before the election are simply not going to get turned around,&#8221; Conley said. &#8220;There’s compelling evidence that’s not going to happen.&#8221;</p>

State Election Commission,” a press release on the change said. The commission has operated<a href="http://scvotes.org"> scVOTES.org</a> for years. “Having the .gov extension will help voters easily recognize the site as a trusted source of information,” the release said. The .org domain extension will continue to exist indefinitely and will redirect visitors to the new address, the release said.</p>

Some local election boards in Virginia were already doing that for voters, but the new rule makes it a requirement statewide. “We’re mandating that localities create unique identifiers to track each individual ballot,” James Heo, a policy adviser for Virginia’s Department of Elections said. “The voter can track through a dashboard site that we’re providing to the public, while the registrar can track internally.”</p>

														<p><a href="https://umn.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Wxlq4O-MSMaaOvV1dKQo6g">Election Security: Security for Whom?:</a> Good elections are secure elections—but what does that mean? Does it mean that election processes help eligible people vote, while thwarting anyone else? Does it mean accurate vote tabulation—and being able to prove that the counting was done right? Does it mean keeping voters safe at the polls? Does it mean giving the voting public a sense of security in a time of disinformation and misinformation? Yes, yes, yes and yes. Learn from national elections experts about cybersecurity, election validation and audits, healthy polling places and communicating about security. <strong>Where:</strong> Online: <strong>When:</strong> August 13, 12pm Central</p>
<p><a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/project/defending-digital-democracy#!2020-training-tour">D3P National Training Tour</a>: The Defending Digital Democracy Project (D3P) is launching a national training tour effort for local election officials as they prepare for the 2020 election. Given the many changes of the past months, this tour will be conducted digitally and is designed to give officials the best of D3P live training sessions in a new format. In addition to supporting local election officials through customized training, the tour may also host some special sessions for state election officials. Local jurisdictions can sign up for a block of virtual training sessions from June to August 2020, with the timing, content, and outputs customizable based on election officials’ schedules and priority needs. D3P’s work is committed to supporting officials in protecting the elections process. Just as you continue your work to serve the American people, we continue our work to serve you. This is a free, virtual resource that will involve discussion groups, live table top simulations, and state-specific content. Key training topics include operations management, crisis communications, disinformation, and Covid-19 support. <strong>When:</strong> Now through August 28. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/lessons-learned-from-2020-primaries.aspx">Lessons Learned From the 2020 Primaries</a>: Now, before we’re in the thick of November’s election fever, is an excellent time to pause and reflect on this year’s primary season. What did we learn from the states, starting from Iowa’s caucuses in February all the way through September’s state primaries? We’ll discuss the timing for primaries, whether state and presidential primaries are best run jointly or as two separate events, how ranked-choice voting performed this year, independent voters&#8217; role in political party decision-making and more. Expect to take away ideas for 2022 or 2024. Speakers include: Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, Rob Richie, president and CEO of FairVote and Scott Saiki, Hawaii Speaker of the House and NSCL president-elect. <strong>When:</strong> Sept. 9, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
