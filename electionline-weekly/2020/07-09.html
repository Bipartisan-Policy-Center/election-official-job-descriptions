														<p><strong>Has COVID-19 made audits even more important?</strong><br />
<em>Key states conduct RLAs during pandemic</em></p>
<p>By Ginny Vander Roest, election implementation manager<br />
<a href="https://voting.works/">VotingWorks</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5728" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA1-300x165.png" alt="" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA1-300x165.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA1.png 410w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While COVID-19 has pushed back primary dates and plans to try new things in many states, jurisdictions piloting the Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) process continue to forge ahead. Three key RLAs have occurred over the last two months, using<a href="https://voting.works/risk-limiting-audits/"> Arlo</a>,<a href="https://voting.works/"> VotingWorks</a>’s open source RLA tool supported by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Each audit continues to prove the post-election audit process is efficient and effective, even across states with different voting methods.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong><br />
In May, Michigan clerks piloted the largest risk limiting audit ever in terms of the number of jurisdictions and counties participating, with 277 local jurisdictions auditing randomly-selected ballots. This exercise built on the RLA process Michigan began exploring in November 2018 by conducting their first pilot at scale, this time auditing the results of the March 10th Presidential Primary. The voluntary statewide process was an overwhelming success, with over 80% participation even in the midst of a pandemic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5729" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA2-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA2-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA2-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA2.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A pilot at this scale tells us a lot about the feasibility of conducting RLAs more broadly across the country. Michigan, traditionally a polling place voting state, has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of vote by mail ballots since a Constitutional Amendment allowing for no-excuse absentee passed in 2018. Add to that over 4800 polling places, with ballots stored securely in the custody of 1520 local jurisdictions, and the task might seem daunting. With almost all counties participating, however, Michigan was able to simulate a full statewide audit very closely, auditing 591 ballots for the random sample. The experience was quite smooth, especially given training and support had to be handled entirely remotely. These adaptations to the constraints of COVID-19 were actually a key factor in determining that RLAs can be successful at a very large scale, even with many other priorities vying for local officials’ attention.</p>
<p>Review Michigan’s<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Michigan_RLA_Report_693501_7.pdf"> 2020 Presidential Primary RLA Pilot Report</a> for details including the public audit data file.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong><br />
In June,  Rhode Island, with the assistance of VotingWorks and<a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/"> Verified Voting</a> ,<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMarionjr/status/1270746528114769920"> conducted its first official statewide RLA</a> on their June 2nd Presidential Primary. This primary, like many this spring, had been pushed back due to the pandemic. The<a href="https://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2020/07/06/mail-ballot-watch/"> number of voters that used a mail ballot</a> also increased exponentially from previous elections.</p>
<p>Despite these changes, Rhode Island joins Colorado as only the second state to conduct statewide RLAs as part of their standard post-election procedure. With wide margins, Rhode Island was able to confirm the outcome of both Presidential Primary races in just three hours, sampling 88 ballots. Their first pilot was conducted in January of 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5730" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA3-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA3-300x225.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RLA3.png 410w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At the end of June, Georgia conducted its second RLA process pilot (the first of which was in November 2019). This round focused on the most populous county in the state, Fulton County. Fulton County<a href="https://www.gpbnews.org/post/fulton-county-performs-risk-limiting-audit-pilot-presidential-primary"> confirmed the tabulation</a> outcome of their county’s June 9th Presidential Primary results by sampling less than 30 ballots in an election where the voting method was split between traditional polling places, absentee ballots, and early voting conducted in both March and May.</p>
<p>While the actual number of ballots needed to confirm the outcome was small, that sample was drawn randomly from over 275,000 ballots. Successfully organizing and maintaining chain of custody at that scale, such that individual ballots can be retrieved quickly and easily, is no small feat. We applaud Georgia for continuing to experiment with RLAs as a way to provide voters with confidence in the vote counting process, and are eager to see what other states they might inspire to jump in.</p>
<p>While these sample sizes may seem low, they prove the efficiency of the risk limiting audit process. The Presidential Primary contests in these states had large margins of victory. When the margin of victory is large, the sample size is small. When the margin of victory is small, the sample size is larger. By adjusting the sample size based on the margin of victory, RLAs ensure that you&#8217;re always doing just enough work to confirm the outcome of the election &#8211; never more, or less, than needed.</p>
<p>Other counties and states are working on summer training programs for the risk limiting audit process. During the pandemic, the training and preparation for these pilots has been easily managed online and via traditional phone and email support chains. And while audit day can be managed in many different ways to include the public, every step is documented (including the<a href="https://github.com/votingworks/arlo"> open-source Arlo code</a> ), allowing for a transparent process that can be independently verified by any interested party, whether they observe in person or not.</p>
<p>At Voting Works we know COVID-19 has turned even the best 2020 preparation plans upside down. We know there is much more to do to prepare for the November General election and the elections in between with a lot of uncertainty mixed in. If you’ve contemplated piloting an RLA in 2020, we have many ways to support your project remotely to ensure success. We’re even available to talk through sound practices for maintaining your paper ballots as you work through shifts in voting methods. All of which makes the conduct of an RLA much easier.</p>
<p>Auditing election outcomes is a key security measure in the election process and becomes more important in times of change and uncertainty. We’re here to help.</p>

According to published reports, it was a very quiet day at the polls. “It’s been<a href="https://delawarestatenews.net/news/presidential-primary-voters-arriving-steadily-at-polls/"> very, very slow today</a>, and that could be contributed to the pandemic and COVID-19,” Sherita Bell, a poll worker in Lewes told <em>The Delaware State News</em>. “This is very different from four years ago.” Although it was a slow day at the polls Sussex County Department of Elections Director Ken McDowell was<a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2020/07/voters-still-turning-out-to-cast-their-ballots-in-person-on-sussex-countys-primary-election-day/"> hopeful that fewer people would show up</a> at the polls on Tuesday. “I was hoping they would more vote absentee because we’re giving them an opportunity to stay apart from the polling site with the six foot distancing and the masks and the chance of catching COVID-19,” he told WMDT. Some poll workers even lamented to the lack of voters at the polls. “I was hoping for more, because being busy is always better than sitting, but I’m not surprised by it just because of COVID…”<a href="https://delawarestatenews.net/government/trump-biden-win-primary-that-draws-record-absentee-votes/"> said</a> poll worker Gretchen Fox.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong>: Woodbury County held a<a href="https://ktiv.com/2020/07/07/confusion-affects-todays-special-election/"> special election</a> for the county board of supervisors this week and many voters, who had actually cast absentee ballots several months ago in the delayed election forgot and then showed up at the polls on Tuesday. Woodbury County Auditor Pat Gill According to a news release from Gill Tuesday afternoon, his office sent a notice to all active registered voters in March, to notify them of the special election, and because of the onset of the pandemic, they should request an absentee ballot. Officials say voters responded with more than 10,000 requests, and Gill&#8217;s office received more than 8,000 ballots back over several weeks.  Gill says on March 20, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate postponed the original election date and set the new date for July 7. According to KTIV, phones were “ringing off the hook, as precinct election officials were calling when a prospective voter had gone to the polls and the register reflects they have already participated.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5510" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NJ-Welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />New Jersey</strong>: Following local elections earlier this summer that made people question the state’s vote-by-mail system, Tuesday postponed primary was relatively smooth. Although ballots are<a href="https://www.thedailyjournal.com/story/news/2020/07/08/nj-july-primary-mail-in-ballots-elections-counting-provisional-votes-clerk/5399780002/"> still being counted</a>, none of the problems that surfaced in the local elections have reappeared. Although the majority of voters did cast their ballots by mail, some voters did<a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/07/some-nj-voters-did-actually-go-to-the-polls-in-person-on-tuesday-heres-how-it-went.html"> insist on going to the polls</a>. &#8220;I got it (a vote-by-mail ballot) in the mail, but decided I&#8217;d rather vote in person,&#8221; Leia Calabrese told the <em>Press of Atlantic City</em> after voting at the polls. &#8220;It just made me feel like I really voted.&#8221; On Monday night the Atlantic County Board of Elections said it had already received about 34,000 vote-by-mail ballots, of which about 29,000 had been &#8220;zipped and stripped.&#8221; That means the signatures had been checked, the certificates removed and envelopes opened. The County Clerk had mailed out about 105,000 ballots, so the<a href="https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/some-voters-insist-on-going-to-polls-despite-vote-by-mail-election/article_a7638036-05c0-5ed4-8f9d-1ac1a3440e50.html"> return rate is already about 30%.</a> The one problem that did arise on Tuesday for in-person voters was the state had to temporarily shut down its<a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/07/nj-temporarily-shuts-down-site-showing-where-you-can-vote-in-person-for-todays-primary.html"> polling place locator</a> for an unspecified problem. “For a brief time this morning, the Division of Elections removed its polling place lookup tool, which was providing inaccurate information to some voters, said Alicia D’Alessandro, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “While fixing the tool, the Division of Elections directed voters to contact our office or their county clerk to verify the correct polling location.”</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: Last week the day after the Oklahoma primary, local television headlines announced a case of potential voter fraud after a woman claimed someone had voted on behalf of her dead husband. Turns out it<a href="https://kfor.com/news/local/no-voter-fraud-in-canadian-county-just-an-honest-mistake-officials-say/"> wasn’t voter fraud but a simple mistake</a>. Canadian County Election Board Secretary Wanda Armold says it didn’t take long to figure out the problem after they started investigating what happened. “We pulled the registry and looked at it,” Armold told KFOR. “I immediately noticed that two lines down from the deceased person’s name was a name very similar.” Just below the name Ronald Michael was the name Robert Mickle. Mickle confirmed to KFOR that it was his signature next to the wrong name. “I didn’t mean to sign in the wrong spot. Believe me,” Mickle said. “I was in a hurry that morning. Came in, voted, ran out the door.”</p>

States would only be allowed to use any remaining funds once they have certified to the EAC that all direct-recording election equipment has been replaced.</p>

The guidance suggests that state and local election officials take steps to minimize crowds at voting locations, including offering “alternative voting methods.” Voters who want to cast ballots in person should consider showing up at off-peak times, bringing their own black ink pens or touch-screen pens for voting machines, and washing their hands before entering and after leaving the polling location, the guidance said. Workers and voters alike, it said, should wear face coverings. According to The Washington Post, the CDC guidelines were developed with the help of election officials who had shared the limitations and opportunities they observed throughout this year’s primaries, as well as public health experts who shared updated research about the virus. “I’m glad to see CDC issue this vital guidance, which is an important step in the right direction that will help protect citizens’ ability to vote,” Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said in a statement. “But this still only scratches the surface.” She and others in her party plan to push for more federal funding to protect the fall elections, she said.</p>

Larry Hogan Jr. (R) late last week, following a lengthy review of the June 2 mail-in primary. The elections board drew up<a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/June%202%20Election%20Report_Final%2007022020.pdf"> three options</a> for the November election for Hogan to consider: holding the election entirely by mail, holding a traditional in-person election, or a mix of both. On Wednesday, Hogan announced that the state would conduct a “normal” election in November meaning that every precinct will be open on Election Day for in-person voting and all early vote centers will be open as well. As part of his decision, Hogan said he will ask the board of elections to send an application to vote by mail to all eligible voters. While the state board of elections was split over entirely mail-in voting or a hybrid of mail voting and vote centers, the board was unanimous in its opposition to conducting a precint-based election.<a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/local-leaders-slam-hogan-for-rejecting-universal-mail-in-ballots-in-november/"> County elections officials</a> have<a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2020/07/local-elections-officials-reject-proposal-to-require-applications-for-mail-in-ballots/"> expressed their concerns</a> not only with the decision to send applications for absentee ballots as opposed to the ballots themselves, but also the opening of all precincts on Election Day.</p>

The letter urges DOJ to work with Tribal governments to find solutions so voters aren’t disenfranchised. “With the 2020 general election fast approaching, there is concern that measures intended to ensure safe voting during the pandemic may make [existing] challenges worse,” a letter sent to the DOJ reads. “Across the country, states are closing polling locations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic…We are deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Tribal communities will spread to the ballot box via changes in voting procedures that may disenfranchise Native American voters.” The letter asks DOJ to respond to three specific questions: Will the Department commit to working with Tribal leaders and Native American communities to find solutions to problems associated with voting during a pandemic that will not disenfranchise voters?; Has the Department received complaints regarding a lack of polling locations for Native American voters during this year’s primary elections? Please provide reports detailing those complaints and any documents citing complaints that voters were unable to cast a vote due to the lack of accessible poll locations; and has the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division’s Indian Working Group engaged with election officials to ensure that Native American voting rights are protected during the upcoming elections? If so, what actions have been taken?</p>

According to the paper, Democrats typically outpace Republicans in absentee ballot requests. During the 2018 general election, about 80,000 Democrats voted absentee compared to 53,000 Republicans. However, the differences are more striking this year. More than 120,000 Democrats have requested absentee ballots compared to just 32,000 Republicans, according to the secretary of state’s office.</p>

According to Alaska Public Radio, in defense of his veto, Pierce had previously claimed on social media that the vote-by-mail system would be mandatory, which is not the case. Assembly President Kelly Cooper called a post on Pierce’s campaign Facebook to that effect on June 13 irresponsible for its inaccuracy. The ordinance has resolutions of support from every city in the borough, and included stakeholders from across the borough. Ordinance 20-24 not only provides for vote-by-mail elections, but provides for more time between regular elections and run-offs, and it removes position statements from ballot initiatives in the voter pamphlet. The ordinance will go into effect in 2021 and only apply to borough elections.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong>: Supporters of a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/jul/06/arkansas-group-turns-petitions-ranked-choice-votin/"> ranked-choice voting</a> for most state offices said they turned in more than 94,000 signatures of registered voters. The Open Primaries Arkansas committee said its proposed amendment would create an open primary election system under which candidates for U.S. Congress, the General Assembly, and state constitutional officers would appear on a unified primary election ballot to all eligible voters. In the general election, voters would have the option to rank the four candidates in order of preference and ensure the candidate with majority support is the winner, according to the committee. Ballot committees are required to submit signatures of 89,151 signatures of registered voters and signatures of registered voters equaling 5 % of the voters who cast votes for governor in the 2018 election in 15 counties to qualify their proposal for the ballot. They also are required to get the approval of the state Board of Election Commissioners for their proposed ballot titles and popular names for their proposals.</p>

Federal inmates could request absentee ballots for the November election, but elections officials would not be required to send those ballots to all prisoners this year. The District has allowed felons to vote after leaving prison, and also allows those convicted of misdemeanors to vote from jail. The legislation requires the D.C. Board of Elections — which already works with the jail to facilitate voting for those awaiting trial who have not been convicted, or are serving time on misdemeanor charges — to distribute absentee ballots for felons being held at the jail. The emergency legislation directs the elections board in 2021 to reach out to the Federal Bureau of Prisons to obtain the contact information of D.C. resident inmates and to send them ballots. The prisoners would be registered at their last address before incarceration.</p>

North Dakota is the only state that does not have a voter registration system and with voters relying more and more on mail balloting, some have expressed concerns about the lack of a registration system. &#8220;I think the Legislature next session has to look at the very question …,&#8221; Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, said. &#8220;Are we going to actually have a voter registration system run through the secretary of state&#8217;s office and not through the department of motor vehicles?&#8221; Jaeger said North Dakota&#8217;s current system is simple and he expressed confidence that only qualified voters cast ballots for the June election. &#8220;Right now I&#8217;m not convinced that any changes should be made,&#8221; the longtime secretary of state told the Tribune. &#8220;We should be allowed to work with the system that we have now and continue to refine it and use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in North Dakota, advocates pushing for election reform have submitted what they say are the necessary number of signatures to<a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/petitions-submitted-for-sweeping-north-dakota-election-changes/article_8a22c877-8aff-57ad-9453-d04723f837c9.html"> get the reforms on the November ballot</a>.

In a letter to members of the Vermont Legislature, Scott said there appeared to be a technical problem with the law that creates an ambiguity in how the secretary of state deals with ballot returns. Under the new law all voters will receive ballots in the mail and they can return them by mail, take them to their local town or city clerk or bring the ballot to their polling place on Election Day.</p>
<p>Also in Vermont, the Burlington Charter Change Committee voted 2 to 1 this week to ask Mayor Miro Weinberger to call forth a special election this November that would have voters choosing whether or not to adopt a<a href="https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Burlington-Charter-Committee-pushes-for-ranked-voting-571684471.html"> ranked choice voting</a> system. According to WCAX, if Weinberger agrees to the special election, a separate ballot would be created to ask voters if they think Burlington should reinstate ranked choice voting in mayoral, city councilor, and school commissioner elections.</p>

The U.S. Court of Appeals of the 11th Circuit put the lower court ruling on hard while it considers the state’s appeal. With the deadline to register to vote for Florida’s primaries less than two weeks away, the plaintiffs argue that the appellate court’s hold “creates chaos and confusion about who can and cannot vote, where a wrong guess creates the risk of criminal prosecution.”  In their filing, the voters urged the Supreme Court to lift the 11th Circuit’s stay and reinstate the district court’s ruling. Citing the court’s 2006 decision in<a href="https://casetext.com/case/purcell-v-gonzalez"> Purcell v. Gonzalez</a>, which stands for the principle that courts should be wary about making changes in the run-up to an election, the voters complained that the 11th Circuit’s order “has created triple the ‘confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls’” as the Supreme Court found in Purcell. And it did so, the voters continued, “just three weeks before the registration deadline for the August primary” and “after vote-by-mail applications were already received and just as ballots were mailed to overseas voters.”</p>

The Ballot Interference Prevention Act, enacted by Montana’s 2017 Legislature, restricts who can collect ballots and dictates that caregivers, family members and others can collect no more than six ballots per election.  Several Native American tribes and advocacy groups claim in their suit challenging the law that Native Americans in Montana’s seven reservations are particularly isolated, and tribal members often must rely on someone else to collect or transport their ballots to the post office. “The Court finds that BIPA serves no legitimate purpose; it fails to enhance the security of absentee voting; it does not make absentee voting easier or more effective; it does not reduce the cost of conducting elections and it does not increase voter turnout,” Fehr wrote in her 11-page ruling. Fehr added that the state “failed to demonstrate through any evidence the existence of any compelling state interest that would warrant the interference of the right to vote created by BIPA.”</p>

Texas law allows voters to mail in their ballots only if they are 65 or older, confined in jail, will be out of the county during the election period, or cite a disability or illness. But Texas Democrats have argued that voters who are susceptible to contracting the new coronavirus should be able to vote by mail as the pandemic continues to ravage the state.</p>

The panel also said emailing and faxing absentee ballots is unconstitutional. The state’s photo ID requirement for voters wasn’t in question, although the panel did find that expired student IDs are acceptable at the polls. The court blocked an option to allow people to vote without an ID if they show an affidavit saying they tried to obtain one. Judge Frank Easterbrook, who wrote the opinion, noted that the restrictions don’t burden people in the state, where voters still enjoy more ways to register, long poll hours on Election Day and absentee voting options than in other states. “Wisconsin has lots of rules that make voting easier,” Easterbrook wrote. “These facts matter when assessing challenges to a handful of rules that make voting harder.”</p>

According to<em> Roll Call</em>, the 11 weeks between Election Day and  Inauguration Day could be rife with disinformation coming from all directions as criminal hackers, enemy states and even domestic political forces try to shape people’s perceptions of what actually happened. Lawsuits are also likely to proliferate if the outcome is not clear. “It’s inevitable that we’ll have convoluted election results and it’s inevitable there’ll be a period of time when results are confusing, and it’s not clear what’s going on,” Graham Brookie, director and managing editor of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab told <em>Roll Call</em>. From social media executives to federal, state and local officials, everyone needs to be prepared for “what could happen so they can avoid the information vacuum that’s extremely vulnerable to disinformation.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5715" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-02-at-10.06.02-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Facebook:</strong> Civil rights auditors hired by Facebook to scrutinize the social media giant’s record delivered what many are referring to as a “scathing” report on the company’s decisions to prioritize free speech above other values, which the auditors called a “tremendous setback” that opened the door for abuse by politicians. The report criticized Facebook’s choice to leave several posts by President Trump untouched, including three in May that the auditors said “clearly violated” the company’s policies prohibiting voter suppression, hate speech and incitement of violence. The report also found that Facebook provides a forum for white supremacy and white nationalism. Although Facebook has been reluctant to make changes in the past, according to <em>The Washington Post</em>, the Facebook-commissioned report potentially carries more weight than other criticisms on the grounds of civil rights because the social network granted the auditors extensive access to its systems and executives, and it encompassed feedback from over 100 civil rights groups. However, it provides no guarantee that Facebook will make major changes to its policies or practices.</p>

Through it all, Wisconsin’s election community – led by its State Election Commission – had to navigate both pandemic and politics to hold its primary.
