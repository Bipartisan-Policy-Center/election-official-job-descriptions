<em>Officials find new and unique ways to power the polls in November</em></p>

<p>Robin Davis served as an election judge when she lived in Maryland and so when she moved to Florida a few years ago, becoming a poll worker in<a href="http://www.volusiaelections.org/"> Volusia County, Florida</a> was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>“I love civic engagement,” Davis said. “I believe in the voice of the people.”</p>
<p>But she’s sitting out serving as a poll worker for the August primary in Florida and hasn’t made up her mind about November yet.</p>
<p>“I worked the presidential primary in March and was terrified of the vast number of deniers and outright belligerent people who belittled and mocked us for wearing a mask and gloves. I did not feel safe. It was stressful,” Davis said. “ Moving forward, it appears that sensible people are voting by mail, and those who decry vote-by-mail and insist on in-person voting are more likely to be science deniers who could spread coronavirus carelessly. I am old but not ready to die!”</p>
<p>Davis is not alone. Across the country, in every county, city and state long-time poll workers, many who are 60+ and are therefore more susceptible to the coronavirus are choosing to sit out serving as poll workers in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.eac.gov/documents/2017/11/15/eavs-deep-dive-poll-workers-and-polling-places"> 2016</a>, local election officials operated 116,990 polling places, including 8,616 early voting locations, across the country. These polling sites were operated by 917,694 poll workers. And while more and more states are moving to mail voting and consolidating polling places for the November 2020 General Election due to the coronavirus, a veritable army of poll workers will still be necessary to pull the whole thing off.</p>
<p>States and localities are resorting to all sorts of new ways to recruit poll workers.</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/470596642/072720-Ltr-to-Mayor-Bowser-and-Councilmember-Allen-Open-Polling-Places-Act"> District of Columbia</a>, the DCBOE is working with D.C. Public Schools to possibly provide enhanced community service hours to high school students 16 and older to serve as poll workers. The<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/02-06/"> Ohio</a> secretary of state office’s partnership with the Ohio Supreme Court to provide continuing education credits (CECs) to attorneys who serve as poll workers is finally rolling out after the state’s March primary was scuttled.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5378" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WV-Flag-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WV-Flag-300x160.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WV-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Similarly, for its June primary, the<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/news/Pages/05-29-2020-A.aspx"> West Virginia</a> secretary of state’s office partnered with the Real Estate Commission to recruit poll workers who in turn earned CECs.</p>
<p>“During the primary we were looking for ways to bring people in for poll workers to our larger, more urban counties,” explained Matthew Gallagher, programs coordinator with the West Virginia secretary of state’s office. “The Real Estate Commission really pulled through for us. We expected a dozen or two, but as soon as we announced had partnered the Commission and we had about 80-100 sign up in a day. We were so grateful for them.”</p>
<p>And the partnership wasn’t just a win for the secretary of state’s office. Gallagher said the Real Estate Commission reported back that it got a lot of really good feedback from the realtors who served as poll workers.</p>
<p>“Their members really wanted to find a way to help,” Gallagher said “And this gave them a concrete way to do that. “</p>
<p>In addition to working with the Real Estate Commission again for November, Gallagher said the state will also be working with the United Way. Twelve of the United Way’s 14 statewide organizations have signed up with the secretary of state’s office to push poll worker recruitment to their members.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5832" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Detroit-Pistons-300x270.png" alt="" width="300" height="270" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Detroit-Pistons-300x270.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Detroit-Pistons-768x691.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Detroit-Pistons.png 778w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While many sports franchises are offering up their idle facilities to serve as voting centers, the<a href="https://www.mlive.com/pistons/2020/07/election-board-to-train-pistons-employees-as-poll-volunteers-for-upcoming-elections.html"> Detroit</a> Pistons are taking it one step further. More than 50 employees of the team will be serving as poll workers for the upcoming Aug. 4 primary and during the November 3 general election. Those dates will be  company-wide paid days off so all staff members can vote, volunteer as election workers and rally others to do the same. Volunteers will work at the Pistons’ Performance Center in Detroit, as well as another site.</p>
<p>“The Detroit Piston organization has deep roots in our community, supporting programs and initiatives that fundamentally make a difference in the lives our residents,” said Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said in a<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127--533456--,00.html"> statement</a>. “This is an organization that consistently, demonstrates positive corporate values, and acts as a role model for our children.  I am excited about forging a long-term partnership with the Pistons organization, to raise voter awareness and participation in the democratic process.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5430" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nebraska-300x156.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nebraska-300x156.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nebraska.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For the<a href="https://nased-org.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/2020+Summer+Conference/Bena_July+2020.pdf"> Nebraska</a> primary, while a record number of voters cast their ballots by mail, 77,000 residents still showed up at their polling place to vote on May 12.</p>
<p>Nebraska took a multi-pronged approach to staff their polling places. In addition to offering CCEs to attorneys, the state also worked with CPAs and Realtors to receive CCEs in exchange for serving as poll workers. In counties that needed more help, the state sent out <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mailers.pdf">mailers</a> to all registered voters between the age of 18 and 50 encouraging them to be a poll worker. The mailing included an application to become a poll worker.</p>
<p>According to Deputy <a href="https://sos.nebraska.gov/">Secretary of State</a> for Elections Wayne Bena, the state sent out 132,000 mailers at an estimated cost of about $100,000. The costs included paper, printing and postage.</p>
<p>“We did not ask the counties how many poll workers it generated, but even just a couple in a county made all the difference for some,” Bena said.</p>
<p>Bena noted that given the new generation of poll workers to compliment the ones they already had, the hope is they won’t need to do another mailing for November, but the state is ready if the need arises.</p>
<p>The state also relied heavily on <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/print-ads.pdf">print ads</a> and radio/television ads to recruit poll workers.</p>
<p>“We should not forget traditional methods of advertising to get the word out. While social media is great, there are other ways to recruit,” Bena said.</p>
<p>Thanks to the state’s poll worker recruitment efforts, Nebraska was able to open all 1,225 precincts on time and with appropriate staffing levels for the May primary.</p>
<p><strong>Adopt-a-Polling Place</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5835" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Orange-Co.FLA_-300x226.png" alt="" width="300" height="226" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Orange-Co.FLA_-300x226.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Orange-Co.FLA_.png 562w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Some counties offer a program where local businesses or nonprofits adopt a polling place and provide the necessary poll workers and then the poll worker compensation goes directly to the nonprofit or the nonprofit of the busines’ choice.  <a href="https://www.ocfelections.com/">Orange County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles</a>, credits his adopt-a-precinct program to having the necessary number of poll workers.</p>
<p>“I truly believe that<a href="https://www.ocfelections.com/adopt-precinct"> our Adopt-A-Precinct program</a> has contributed to us not experiencing a significant drop in poll workers, either in advance of Election Day or on Election morning,” Cowles said. “Orange County, Florida currently has 247 polling places. We have been able to keep all polling places open for the three elections in 2020, with only a limited number of polling places being replaced for Election Day, and no reduction in voting sites.”</p>
<p>For the presidential preference primary and municipal elections, Orange County had  114 precincts adopted by 89 groups. Heading into the August 18th Primary Election, they will have 116 precincts adopted by 88 groups. Each precinct has an average of 7 trained poll workers per polling place – that’s 812 poll workers that the county didn’t have to recruit, since the AAP groups do the recruiting. Hands-on, in-person training for poll workers is already underway.</p>
<p>Given the concerns about older poll workers, following the March primary, Cowles conducted a survey of Florida supervisors of elections in larger counties regarding the average age of poll workers. Cowles found that Orange County has the youngest average poll workers at 56 years old.</p>
<p>“That is a direct result of our Adopt-A-Precinct program,” Cowles said. “Many of our AAP poll workers are younger business professionals who take a day off from work to help their organization raise funds to support their mission.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5824" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Power-the-Polls-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Power-the-Polls-300x183.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Power-the-Polls.png 516w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Power the Polls</strong><br />
A coalition of businesses and nonprofits has launched<a href="https://www.powerthepolls.org/"> Power the Polls</a>, a first-of-its-kind initiative to recruit a new wave of poll workers – especially among younger, more diverse populations that have not historically filled these roles – to ensure a safe, secure, healthy and fair election for all voters.</p>
<p>Power the Polls plans to offer solutions to the poll worker shortage through education, recruitment, business engagement, PPE procurement, and potential rewards for those who sign up. The initiative is being launched by nonprofit organizations and businesses, namely<a href="https://www.civicalliance.com/"> Civic Alliance</a>,<a href="http://www.cc.com/"> Comedy Central</a>,<a href="https://www.fairelectionscenter.org/"> Fair Elections Center</a>,<a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/"> Levi Strauss &amp; Co</a>,<a href="http://www.mtv.com/"> MTV</a>,<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/"> Patagonia</a>,<a href="https://polls.pizza/"> Pizza to the Polls</a>,<a href="https://www.maketimetovote.org/"> Time To Vote</a>,<a href="https://www.uber.com/"> Uber</a>, and<a href="https://wecanvote.us/"> We Can Vote</a>—with a goal of recruiting more partners.</p>
<p>The initiative’s platform is built using poll worker requirements collected by the nonpartisan Fair Elections Center with its unique Work Elections web portal. Information is available on poll worker compensation, hours, application links, and training and voter registration requirements for more than 4,000 jurisdictions in states across the country.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about this new, expanded initiative to recruit people to be poll workers for the Fall elections,” said<a href="https://www.fairelectionscenter.org/"> Fair Elections Center</a> President Robert Brandon. “We established Work Elections to provide information and make it easy for folks to sign up. This year, with the pandemic affecting the ability of many people who normally work at the polls, we’re pleased to join with these partners to get the word out that poll workers are going to be desperately needed in many communities to help ensure a safe and fair election for voters.”</p>
<p>Power the Polls will recruit and support workers by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educating potential voters on the opportunity and experience of manning Election Day polls.</li>
<li>An efficient and effective program to ensure people sign up and show up on Election Day.</li>
<li>Activating businesses to give their workers Election Day off so they can work the polls.</li>
<li>Providing PPE for worker safety on Election Day (through corporate partners).</li>
<li>Rewarding poll workers for their service by providing virtual gifts (merchandise, gift cards, etc.) from Power the Polls business partners to celebrate their service.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We have been trying to think about ways to convince people to think about it as their civic duty so people from communities would be helping the voters that look like them,” Brandon said. “The pitch for and the plea is to be part of democracy and it’s an appeal to help your community. Do some sort of service for your community.”</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: If you&#8217;ve found a unique and successful way to recruit poll workers, let us know we&#8217;re happy to include it in a future edition of electionline Weekly.)</em></p>

							<h2>Important USPS News!</h2>
														<p><strong>Must Read</strong><br />
<em>New Post Master General issues directive</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick, senior advisor<br />
<a href="https://democracyfund.org/">The Democracy Fund</a></p>
<p>Although he hasn’t been on the job long, the new Postmaster General (PMG) of the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/internal-usps-document-tells-employees-to-leave-mail-at-distribution-centers/175dd1ae-e202-4777-877c-33442338d1cc/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_14"> directive “Stand-Up Talk&#8221;</a>  this month that has the potential to delay the delivery of the mail and has the mailing industry concerned with the decision.</p>
<p><strong>What You Should Know</strong><br />
The new directive requires tasks not completed by the end of the workday must wait until the following business day, with no overtime or second deliveries. Unlike past USPS practices this means that a mail carrier may not wait for the rest of the workload if it is not ready when it is time to leave for their route, and a truck may not wait if it is time to leave for the next plant or destination. The new “leave it behind” directive would be particularly harmful in this year’s presidential election and may contribute to the delayed receipt of ballots.</p>
<p>We understand the new directive contains the following elements:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5838" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG1.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="470" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG1.jpg 936w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG1-300x151.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG1-768x386.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>It appears that these changes may be only the beginning of other concerning changes. In a recent article,<a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2020/07/usps-tests-more-mail-delivery-changes-lawmakers-push-back/167075/"> Government Executive</a> reported that under the new PMG, the USPS is conducting a pilot with urban postal carriers in 200 locations where mail carriers will not case mail in the morning, but rather will leave uncased mail in the post offices to be delivered the next day.  Some mail will be sorted “while on the street”. With rural postal carriers exempt from the pilot’s requirements, this practice could have a disproportionate impact on voters across any and all states.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on Election Mail</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5839" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG2.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="526" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG2.jpg 936w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PMG2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>The impact on Election Mail under this guidance could be severe, and unless addressed, may cause an increased number of ballots rejected for being late at various points in the pipeline, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mail-in ballots that are delayed may not be postmarked on day received. For years, the election community has worked with USPS to postmark Election Mail with the date that it was picked up. Under the new USPS directive, however, this is no longer guaranteed if the mail delay occurs on the day the ballot is picked up; this could lead to disastrous effects in states relying on USPS data to demonstrate that the voter mailed the ballot back in time.  This could happen regardless of whether a state simply looks at the date of the postmark, or other USPS data including the Intelligent Mail Barcode (IMb) or orange processing marks.</li>
<li>Mail-in ballots not returned to election officials by close of the polls on Election Day. Many states require the ballot to be in-hand by the close of the polls on Election Day, but compounded delays may lead to undelivered ballots that prevent otherwise eligible voters from having their ballots count.  “One more day” is one day too late in many states.</li>
<li>COVID has changed the way elections are being conducted in 2020. As a result, more states are mailing out ballots to voters and paying postage upon return under Business Reply Mail (BRM)—an additional step where mail could be left until the next day.</li>
<li>State Deadlines Already Misaligned with USPS Guidance. For many years now, USPS has advised that voters return their ballots back in the mail one week before they are due. Although this has been known for some time – and reports such as the Bipartisan Policy Center’s<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/voting-by-mail/"> “New Realities of Voting by Mail”</a> have called for policy changes to align dates and deadlines with USPS delivery standards – that hasn’t happened in many states. As outlined in the<a href="https://www.vote.org/"> Vote.org</a> table below, almost half of the states allow for a voter to still request a ballot be mailed to them after the time that USPS recommends the ballot be mailed back. This problem will be exacerbated given this new delivery delay directive if additional time is added to the process.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What Can be Done</strong><br />
During the Mailers Technical Advisory Committee (MTAC) meeting this week, the dedication of USPS to Election Mail was reiterated by postal leadership. However, the new Postmaster General must also voice this dedication, and outline how USPS will continue to prioritize Election Mail along with other critical mail, to ensure no ballots – and therefore no eligible voters –are left behind in this presidential election year. As Former Deputy Postmaster Ronald Stroman – now a Senior Fellow for the Democracy Fund Elections Team – continues to emphasize: “It is essential for the new Postmaster General to set and prioritize a target of 100 percent on-time delivery of mail-in ballots.”</p>
<p>In addition to pushing for clarity on the prioritization of Election Mail and working with their local postmasters, election officials can better guide their own voters by encouraging them to not wait to request or return mail in ballots, provide as many additional options for ballot return as their laws allow, and make sure that voting instructions are clear and set the correct expectations.</p>
<p>Voting by mail is still safe and secure, but the message is clear:<br />
Don’t wait to request. Don’t wait to return.</p>

<p><strong>Unfinished Business</strong>: All eyes might be on November 2020, but officials in Macon County, Illinois and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia are still focused on 2018 and 2019 respectively. In<a href="https://herald-review.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/macon-county-sheriff-recount-documents-sent-to-judge-latest-step-in-declaring-18-election-winner/article_b287afbd-9585-5190-8bae-0aa486139970.html"> Macon County</a>, following a court-ordered recount, Tony Brown holds an 18-vote lead over Jim Root in the 2018 race for sheriff. There are still 1,337 ballots being contested and sorting out who gets those votes will fall to Champaign Circuit Court Judge Anna M. Benjamin. According to the Herald &amp; Review, the recount report from the clerk’s office indicates there were 395 under votes (no vote cast for either candidate), four over votes (votes were cast for both candidates) and 57 uncounted ballots that were found in the wrong precinct. The two-week recount of nearly 40,000 ballots involved 10 election judges, split between Republican and Democrats, to hand count each precinct, two judges to a precinct. There were also 10 poll watchers, split evenly between Brown and Root, who were chosen by them to monitored the process and raise objections to a decision on any ballot. In<a href="https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/ballots-cast-in-disputed-harpers-ferry-election-to-be-counted-wednesday/article_e9847cd8-cf59-53e7-8b7c-2ccfbe8f09e6.html"> Harpers Ferry</a>, four contested provisional ballots in a tight town council race are set to finally be counted this week. Following a state Supreme Court Ruling earlier this summer, 23rd Judicial Circuit Judge Debra McLaughlin ordered that the four ballots be counted. McLaughlin previously concluded that the four provisional ballots should be included in the vote tallies because the voters’ names were left out of the poll book because of a technical error involving the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles.</p>

Voted on by NASS members, this award recognizes significant state contributions to the mission of NASS. California’s<a href="https://www.nass.org/sites/default/files/awards/2020/CA-IDEAS-Award-2020.pdf"> VoteSure: A Public Education Campaign Encouraging Voters to be Vigilant of Election Misinformation</a> launched in October 2018. The program was developed to counteract election misinformation, provide public education resources and strengthen voter confidence. VoteSure strategically placed social media ads aimed at directing voters to official elections tools, information, and resources. Other ads explained the various security measures in place that pro­tect the integrity of our elections. The initiative also included proactive social media monitoring for election misinformation and provided voters a dedicated email address to report suspicious posts. The state worked in partnership with social media platforms to develop more efficient reporting procedures for potential misinformation. Misinformation identified by the secretary of state’s office or voters was promptly reviewed and, in most cases, removed by the social media platforms. “Bad actors — both foreign and domestic — continue to threaten our elections and elections offi­cials must be more proactive and innovative in strengthening voter confidence. In response, Cali­fornia launched VoteSure, the first initiative of its kind in the nation to both promote official, trust­ed sources of election information while countering election misinformation on social media,” said Secretary of State Alex Padilla.</p>

According to the Bradenton Herald, Sweat oversaw the office through Florida’s notorious role in the presidential election of 2000. In Manatee, the process went smoothly compared to elsewhere in the state. A year prior in 1999, Sweat had sought transparency regarding the state’s recount policy on behalf of Manatee County voters. His query prompted a four-page opinion from the Secretary of State’s office— a ruling that demanded physical reprocessing of ballots in the event of a recount— that could have potentially changed the outcome of the following year’s election, had it been enforced in all Florida counties. Sweat retired in 2012. He was succeeded by current elections supervisor Mike Bennett. “It was scary,” Bennett said of the new responsibility. “Because Manatee County under Bob Sweat was always considered, truly, as a model for everybody else.” But Bennett said that Sweat made the transition easy for him and was always there to offer advice.  “The professionalism that he brought to the office, the wonderful, wonderful job he did gave me a tough hill to climb when I got here,” Bennett said. “He left me with a fantastic staff and a great history of running wonderful elections.”</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/elections/Pages/default.aspx"> West Virginia Secretary of State’s</a> office released its<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/elections/Documents/WV%202020%20Primary%20After%20Action%20Report.pdf"> after action report</a> on the state’s June primary elections last week. The report covers the legal framework for postponing the election, the relaxing of absentee voting requirements due to COVID, mailing absentee ballot application forms to voters, statistics for voting methods by county and party, use of CARES Act funding, consolidation of in-person voting sites, and election night reporting. The report states that absentee ballots account for only roughly 2 percent of all ballots cast in typical elections in the state. In the June 2020 primary, 49.9 percent of voters cast an absentee ballot.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.osetfoundation.org/"> OSET Institute</a>’s<a href="https://trustthevote.org/"> Trust the Vote Project</a> released an<a href="https://trustthevote.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/JournalistsGuideToElectionTerminology_v5.pdf"> explanatory brief</a> on election terminology for journalists earlier this month. The brief provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding commonly misused or misunderstood election terms.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.votingrightslab.org/"> Voting Rights Lab</a> released a<a href="https://www.votingrightslab.org/polling-place-consolidation-report"> report</a> on polling place consolidation earlier this month. The report explores pre-COVID-19 trends in polling place closure and consolidation, consolidation during the 2020 primaries, the effect of consolidation on turnout, mitigation measures, poll worker recruitment during the pandemic, and recommendations for policymakers.</p>

The security researchers at Area 1 Security noted that while the diversity of election systems and infrastructure across U.S. election jurisdictions would make it “impossible” for a nationwide hacking incident to occur, the low email security standards could easily lead to localized cyber incidents. “The disparate approaches to cybersecurity by state, local and county officials is such that should a cybersecurity incident occur in one small town, whether in a ‘battleground state’ or not, even if statistically insignificant, could cause troubling ripple effects that erode confidence in results across the entire country,” the researchers wrote in the report.</p>

John Lewis (D-Georgia), coinciding with a ceremony to honor him at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. The bill<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/us/politics/house-voting-rights.html"> passed</a> with the votes of 227 Democrats and one Republican in December, with Lewis presiding over the vote and banging the gavel to announce the approval of the bill. On Monday, the House voted by unanimous consent to approve a measure, proposed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-South Carolina) to rename the bill the “John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.”</p>
<p>Reps. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pennsylvania) and Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) have introduced the<a href="https://www.bctv.org/2020/07/28/bill-supports-ballot-access-for-people-with-disabilities/"> Accessible Voting Act</a> which would establish an Office of Accessibility in the Election Assistance Commission and provide grants to help states improve voting access, including absentee ballots. The House bill is the companion to a bill introduced in the Senate earlier this year by Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. So far, the Senate bill has stalled in committee</p>

Although the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the bill, it wasn’t without debate. Republicans, although only two voted against the bill, argued that the secretary of state’s ballot drop boxes weren’t secure and that the absentee voting process could be confusing to voters. Republicans sought to amend the bill Thursday to allow for some regulation of the boxes, but were unsuccessful. The<a href="https://www.theday.com/statenortheast-news/20200728/state-senate-passes-bill-expanding-absentee-voting-provisions"> Senate</a> approved the bill this week.</p>

The nine members of the county council are calling on the Republican governor to send ballots with prepaid postage directly to eligible voters. The council also said touch-free drop boxes should be provided so that voters can cast their ballots “to make voting as easy and safe as possible.”  “Substantially changing the procedures for the general election now will confuse voters, undermine confidence, add costs and create unnecessary health risks for voters, staff and volunteers,” Council member Tom Hucker said. “We urge the state to reconsider.”</p>

The legislation had to scrapped in 2019 after a typo in the bill would have allowed noncitizens to register to vote. Under the new bill, voters will be automatically registered to vote when obtaining and a driver’s license and conducting business with certain state agencies. They will be permitted to opt out of the registration.  Legislators also approved a bill allowing voters the chance to apply for and receive absentee ballots well ahead of November’s fast-approaching election. The measure suspends a law barring local boards of election from processing mail-in ballot applications until 30 days preceding an election. Now, applications can be approved as soon as they are received.</p>

<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3346" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> The Florida Council of the Blind and Secretary of State Laurel Lee have reached an agreement over a suit filed seeking<a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2020/07/27/state-advocacy-group-reach-deal-on-blind-voters/"> better accessibility for the state’s vote-at-home ballots</a>. The deal will require five counties &#8212; Miami-Dade, Nassau, Orange, Pinellas and Volusia &#8212; to implement a program allowing blind and print-impaired voters to fill out ballots online. The agreement also requires statewide implementation of the process by March 2022. The five counties agreed to have the system in time for the Nov. 3 elections, according to Florida Council of the Blind lawyer Matthew Dietz. More than 500,000 Floridians are blind, and hundreds of thousands of others are print-impaired, he said. Under the settlement, Lee will “educate” and “encourage” county supervisors of elections about a variety of vote-by-mail procedures that were at the heart of the case. For example, the state’s top elections official will be required to educate supervisors about pre-paid postage for mail-in ballots. The settlement also will encourage local elections officials “to maximize the use of drop boxes for vote-by-mail ballots” and to inform voters about the availability of the ballot drop-off sites.</p>

Hodges, retired from the Northern Circuit and appointed to hear the case in Athens, cited a state case called Jones vs. Norris, which in part reads “votes cast for candidates who have died, withdrawn or been disqualified shall be void and shall not be counted.” District 9 incumbent Commissioner Jerry NeSmith died days before the June 9 election. As a result, Athens-Clarke Attorney Judd Drake concluded that Houle could take the seat in January despite losing the vote count to NeSmith. NeSmith tallied 1,864 votes to 1,404 for Houle.</p>

About 29,000 provisional ballots were cast in the 2018 general election in Kansas, the ruling noted. Plaintiffs sought the release of the 2018 provisional voter information so that it can help voters correct the problems that caused them to be given provisional ballots, such as correcting mismatched signatures in voter registration records or telling them what ID they&#8217;ll need to present and what polling site they&#8217;re supposed to use.</p>
<p>In another matter, Shawnee County District Judge Thomas Luedke has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Democrats to force Secretary of State Scott Schwab to implement for the 2020 elections a law allowing voters to cast ballots from any polling station within their home county. In the suit, the Kansas Democratic Party and three national Democratic Party organizations contended Schwab was intentionally dragging his feet on the changes for partisan benefit. In dismissing the case, however, Luedke said implementation of the<a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/2f25f992-e93c-410d-b2d0-95d7930798e5"> Vote Anywhere act</a> was in the “complete discretion of the county election officials” whether or not Schwab devised rules or regulations to guide them.</p>

Four Mainers have filed a complaint in U.S. District Court of Bangor to block the use of ranked-choice voting in the 2020 general election. They argue the system disenfranchises voters whose ballots are eliminated before the final round of tabulation, and they have asked the court to declare Maine’s law unconstitutional and prevent ranked-choice voting from being used in the November election. “This case seeks to vindicate the constitutional rights of Mainers who will soon be denied full participation in the 2020 general election,” the complaint states. The Maine Republican Party filed a<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2020/07/27/maine-republicans-file-last-minute-court-challenge-to-ranked-choice-ruling/"> last-minute court appeal</a> this week, asking a judge to overturn the decision of Secretary of State Matt Dunlap to allow ranked-choice voting in the November presidential election. The party filed the appeal just before Cumberland County Superior Court closed for business and on the last day of a 10-day window for contesting Dunlap’s action.</p>

Bell has ordered Flint Clerk Inez Brown to carry out election law related to absentee voting, including<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2020/07/judge-orders-flint-clerk-to-comply-with-absentee-voting-law-in-aclu-case.html"> clearing a backlog</a> of more than 1,000 requests for absentee ballots within 72 hours of the Thursday ruling. The suit was brought by by voters and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which sought the judicial writ and injunctive relief as a “last resort to restore and protect” voter rights as the Aug. 4 primary election nears. Registered voters in Flint were unable to do business with the Clerk’s Office in person until Monday, July 23, because it and the rest of City Hall has been closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit claimed that some voters who requested absentee ballots weeks ago still had not received them. In court Thursday, Bell called the right to vote “a vital constitutional right” and said “the absentee ballot, particularly in the time of COVID, is going to be very important to all citizens, certainly citizens in the city.&#8221; The judge ordered Brown to process absent voter ballot applications within 24 hours once the current backlog is cleared and said the Clerk’s Office must remain open from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday, for distribution and acceptance of absent voter ballots and applications, distribution of ballots and acceptance of completed absent voter ballots until Election Day on Aug. 4. The city is also required to file a daily summary with the court, detailing the number of absent voter applications received, the number of absent voter ballots issued, the number of completed ballots received and the number of absent voter applications rejected or delayed due to some deficiency.</p>

The organizations filed a legal petition in Ramsey County District Court last week, writing in a press release that they are asking the county to follow state law that requires ballot boards be made up of election judges from lists submitted by each party. Instead, they say Ramsey County relies on county staff who do not declare party affiliation to perform the job, said Andrew Cilek, executive director of the Minnesota Voters Alliance.</p>

Even though the candidate did not face a primary opponent, state law requires write-in candidates to receive a certain number of votes to be placed on the general election ballot. The suit asks a federal judge to stop enforcement of a state provision requiring payment for a recount and to force a recount.</p>

Representatives of the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday that they have filed a request for a preliminary injunction in their ongoing lawsuit first filed in November 2018 against the New York state Board of Elections. The civil liberties groups’ leaders argues that the 25-day cut-off left about 93,000 New Yorkers unable to vote in the 2016 presidential election because they registered after the deadline. The preliminary injunction would ensure New Yorkers can register at least ten days before the election, which the group’s leaders say is the latest deadline currently allowed under the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>Also in New York, the state board of elections is urging a federal judge<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-ask-for-rejected-absentee-ballots-to-be-counted/"> not to force a recount</a> of absentee ballots in the state’s June primary election and instead unburden election officials to focus on getting ready for the fall presidential election. Two weeks ago, two Democratic candidates in New York’s primary election along more than a dozen voters filed a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PatelGallagherClassaction.pdf"> class action lawsuit</a> in federal court in Manhattan accusing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state’s Board of Elections of allowing an “election snafu” during the state’s June primary election that could potentially disenfranchise thousands of voters.</p>

The lawsuit asks the court to block, for this election cycle only, the requirement that Rhode Islanders seeking to vote by mail have two witnesses or a notary sign their ballot envelope. Removing the witness and notary requirement in the midst of a deadly pandemic is a common-sense solution that protects people’s health and their right to vote,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island. But the RI GOP announced plans to intervene in the case “to protect our Democracy,″ asserting “the ACLU’s lawsuit is not about protecting public health. It is about undermining the integrity of our election.” The Republican National Committee has filed a request requesting that both the national and state GOP be<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200727/republican-national-committee-joins-ri-fight-over-mail-ballots"> given status</a> as defendants. On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200728/judge-backs-suspension-of-witness-requirements-for-mail-ballots"> signaled her intent to waive witness requirements</a> for mail-ballot voting in Rhode Island during this COVID-themed election year. She told the lawyers on both sides that she views the waiver agreement that the advocacy groups that brought the lawsuit forged with the secretary of state and the R.I. Board of Elections as “justified and lawful and fair.” “I am making that finding,″ said McElroy, promising that a written order would follow. She also denied the Republicans’ bid to formally intervene in the case. She also denied their lawyer Thomas McCarthy’s request that she stay her decision pending an appeal to a higher court.</p>

According to the Tennessean, Ernest Falls, of Grainger County, is one of two plaintiffs named in the suit over felons&#8217; voting rights. Tennessee elections officials won&#8217;t let him register because of an out-of-state felony conviction from the 1980s, even though Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam granted him clemency in February, court documents show.  But Tennessee statute has allowed pathways for people with felony convictions to restore their voting rights for decades, meaning the officials are breaking state law by denying him, the lawsuit contends. Some who try to register to vote in Tennessee run into roadblocks around the felony conviction question. Some who filed by paper had their applications rejected, court documents show. Others who tried to register online were unable to complete the form after checking the box to show they had a felony conviction. But the reasons for their rejection go against state law, the suit says.</p>

In Texas, voters must fill out a paper mail-in ballot, which plaintiffs argue is inaccessible to voters with disabilities and requires assistance that may not be feasible to coordinate safely amid the pandemic. The lawsuit seeks for Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs to overhaul the state’s mail-in ballot request system by establishing a remote and accessible one across counties for future elections. A spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office declined to comment Monday.</p>

In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that they are unable to independently mark a paper ballot due to their disabilities, including blindness, and that violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. “The (state’s absentee voting system) provides no alternatives to accommodate individuals with print disabilities to enable them to vote privately and independently,”<a href="https://www.washlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Complaint-Filed-7-27-2020-947-pm-ACE.pdf"> the lawsuit claims</a>. “As a result, individuals with print disabilities must choose between their health and their right to vote because they are forced to go to their local electoral board or polling place to privately and independently mark their ballots.”</p>

Chimene continued, &#8220;We applaud the Texas Secretary of State’s voter information website (<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001eJWvNm7cvuosQmHJBzR4UjQOBlYxVsyk-C_UupEO-mfEyE_K3D00dD53GKk1YAH8d1htNOWipSN1jAJRraL3NhYPZ87p9BpWm5FsEqsJEm60jJiWiHQRdKej2CxxWqa0lbZ5K5Uttr4Aixpjjl6Wjw==&amp;c=8MmSa4Gt-w6WpbBUvYa_tuq0Jrh3x0u0bHbOcAQ64VIi7TZAUHTFCw==&amp;ch=P-2RemhTeEC6Iwyb5QBQQpUOGPUTLv_ABUTR8pscLwaAnh2xiXwuhw==">votetexas.gov</a>) for adding a button to easily access Vote By Mail information and the Vote By Mail application.

<p><strong>Key Results of the Survey on Safer Voting Information</strong><br />
While there was good news &#8211; 65% (166 out of 254 counties) provide a Vote By Mail link or voter education &#8211; only 27% of counties in Texas provide adequate safe voting information to their voters. In addition, only 69 counties provided information on election worker training. Recruiting and training new election workers will be a critical component of safer elections in November.</p>
<p><strong> A Brief Summary of Recommendations<br />
</strong>The 2020 General Election will be here before you know it! Texas voters are concerned with staying safe and healthy during this pandemic. Voters need to find accurate and comprehensive election information on their county and state websites regarding safe voting options.</p>
<p>To ensure safer voting conditions, the League recommends that counties take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide voter education on voting by mail with a link to a Vote By Mail application.</li>
<li>Prepare for a loss of election workers by providing information to recruit and train more election workers.</li>
<li>Provide information about actions the county is taking to provide a safe voting experience for voters who vote in person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Voters look to their county&#8217;s website to find accurate, accessible, and useful information on how to vote safely and effectively in their communities. The League works in partnership with counties and the Texas Secretary of State to encourage the use of election website best practices to prepare for the upcoming 2020 General Election.</p>
