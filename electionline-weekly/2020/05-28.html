<em>Planning and Conducting a Risk-Limiting Audit Pilot</em></p>
<p>By Jennifer Morrell<br />
The Democracy Fund</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[T]his guide presents much of [Jennifer Morrell&#8217;s] knowledge and wisdom about risk-limiting audits in accessible, relevant detail. Election officials around the country will read it repeatedly as they plan for RLAs.&#8221; – Mark Lindeman, Director, Science and Technology Policy, Verified Voting</span></em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5557" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RLA-Story-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RLA-Story-233x300.png 233w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RLA-Story-797x1024.png 797w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RLA-Story-768x987.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RLA-Story.png 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" />The first Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) pilot I assisted with as part of the<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/increasing-trust-in-elections-democracy-funds-election-validation-project"> Election Validation Project</a> was in Gloucester County, New Jersey in the fall of 2018. In preparation, we held several calls and planning meetings to ensure everyone understood how risk-limiting audits worked and to outline expectations for the pilot.</p>
<p>On the big day, I quickly realized I was not as prepared as I thought—there was a problem with the naming convention for the Batch ID and the accompanying ballot manifest. That was not the fault of the election officials – they were amazing participants – it was mine.</p>
<p>In the planning stages, I glossed over important concepts in naming batches and had not fully considered how different equipment and methods for scanning ballots might affect the process. Furthermore, the election officials came fully prepared with a bevy of questions that I struggled to answer in a way that was helpful and not just a recitation of terms and definitions. Thank goodness they were patient and willing to learn along with me.</p>
<p>I realized in the moment that to better help state and local election officials conduct a pilot RLA on their own, they were going to need more resources, including more examples to help connect ballot reconciliation to the RLA process, a list of supplies, and a script to help explain some of the most frequently asked questions. I went back to my hotel room that night and quickly crafted the beginnings of this guide. Using that rough draft, I helped conduct two additional pilots in<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/new-jersey-rla-case-study/"> New Jersey</a> that fall, each one going a bit smoother and each one providing additional thought about what would be important for an election official to know if they were planning an RLA pilot on their own.</p>
<p>Since then, I have continued to learn and document best practices from the 13 pilots I’ve helped conduct or participate in around the country.<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/knowing-its-right-part-3-planning-and-conducting-a-risk-limiting-audit-pilot/"> Knowing It’s Right, Part 3: Planning and Conducting a Risk-Limiting Audit Pilot</a> provides a workbook and script to guide participants through planning and communication as well as step-by-step procedures for conducting the pilot. It also lays out a plan for scaling up the process from single precincts or jurisdictions to a statewide pilot.</p>
<p>This year, more than ever, our attention is on election security and safety. Unfortunately, there is no single thing that guarantees absolute security or prevents issues or errors. Success comes from having multiple layers of protection. An RLA is one of those pieces or layers. It shows that the equipment used to tally votes operated correctly, and that the right winner won. Audits also play a role in deterring fraud, detecting errors, and providing accountability to voters. Even if you don’t plan on conducting an RLA pilot this year, consider reading through the guide anyway. If you pull out one concept – such as stronger ballot accounting – that provides an added layer in your security arsenal and will help create a more orderly process in the event of a challenge or recount.</p>
<p>I recognize that as state and local election officials continue to plan, prepare and execute elections unlike anything they’ve dealt with before – all while dealing with rapid change – adding an RLA pilot to that litany of change may be one change too many. I would still encourage election officials to use the material in this guide to strengthen the way they organize and account for ballots—especially for those who are seeing a substantial increase in mail and absentee ballots. Jurisdictions who do so will find it leads to a more organized workflow and they will be perfectly situated to take on an RLA in the future with ease.</p>
<p><em>Jennifer Morrell is a nationally recognized election official with over eight years of experience managing local elections. Her work in Colorado was instrumental in the successful implementation of the first statewide risk-limiting audit and she has been an outspoken advocate of implementing election audit standards beyond just post-election audits and has a vision of creating uniform audit and testing standards for all critical components of the voting system. Bringing extensive expertise in election administration, Morrell serves as a consultant leading the Election Validation Project at Democracy Fund. She’s always happy to answer questions about RLAs and happy to provide assistance in supporting RLA pilot activity in 2020 and beyond. She can be reached at jennifer@electionsgroup.com.</em></p>

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services administers the oath of citizenship to an average of about 63,000 applicants per month. USCIS closed its offices in mid-March amid the pandemic and canceled nearly all naturalization ceremonies. According to the Post, though USCIS is scheduled to begin a phased reopening next week, the agency has not committed to resuming a full slate of ceremonies nor has publicly released a plan for rescheduling the approximately 150,000 naturalizations that have been postponed because of the closures.</span></p>

If you want to be tested then you go out of line and over to another area for the testing so there is no risk for transmission as it relates to that,&#8221; Fulton County Manager Dick Anderson told FOX 5.</span></p>

Spokesman Dan Kulin said an unspecified number of employees are being tested or isolated as a precaution after the employee was diagnosed Monday. The county’s main election office in North Las Vegas reopened Tuesday morning after a brief closure for cleaning. On Monday, Kulin said, the employee wore a mask while in the building, but he had been in a public area on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. About 75 members of the public and 55 county employees were in the office during the three-day period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Dakota</strong>: North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger is making lemonade from pandemic lemons. While debate is raging about the security of mail-in ballots, Jaeger said having more voters in his state—about 160,000—vote by mail presents a</span><a href="https://www.kxnet.com/news/local-news/secretary-of-state-says-mail-in-voting-is-an-opportunity-to-teach-kids-about-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great lesson in democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for children. “The ballot coming home, the parent showing their children in terms of, ‘OK, this is what I’ve done to get the ballot, and this is how we vote.’ And show them how the voting process works and how the ballot is returned,” Jaeger told a local television station.</span></p>

Instead they are helping the county’s Department of Elections and Voter Registration process mail ballots for the June 2 primary.  &#8220;We have people all over the building helping,&#8221; said Sally Kohlbus, assistant director of the county elections office, who added that the atmosphere at the office Tuesday was &#8220;insane.&#8221; Several other county personnel are volunteering their time to help with the ballots, said county spokesperson Mark Walters, and the additional staff will be working June 2 to help scan the mail-in ballots at the elections office.</span></p>

The line reads: &#8220;I understand that if I apply to vote absentee by mail and I am not entitled to do so, I have committed a felony.&#8221; The state’s absentee ballot request form does not have that line nor to forms from other counties. Commissioners expressed concern that the line may prevent residence from applying to vote absentee during the pandemic.</span></p>

This guidance reflects the minimum recommended health protocols to help ensure the health and safety of all voters, election office personnel, polling place workers, and poll watchers in Texas. The protocols include social distancing, asking voters to bring their own pen/pencil, asking voters to bring hand sanitizer and asking, but not requiring voters to wear a face covering of some sort.</span></p>

According the Metro News,  Kanawha County Clerk Vera McCormick says she’s starting to receive some calls from voters who applied for and were sent mail-in absentee ballots for the June 9 primary election but now they would rather take advantage of in-person early voting or go to the polls on election day. “I think people were concerned about the virus and nobody knew what was happening and they wanted to vote and they went ahead and got their ballots but they are kind of hanging on to them now,” McCormick said. Fortunately West Virginians have second thoughts do have an option. “We will mark it spoiled and then will take their name off of the list as receiving a ballot and then when they go to vote they won’t have to vote a provisional ballot,” McCormick said, adding it’s best for a voter to call her office for instructions if that’s what they want to do.</span></p>

Under the plan approved Wednesday night, the state would send absentee ballot applications to nearly all registered voters in an effort to prepare for Wisconsin&#8217;s November election. Two groups of voters would be excluded from the plan. The state would not send the applications to people who already have an absentee ballot request on file, a group that numbers about 528,000. In addition, about 158,000 voters who were flagged as having potentially moved would not be sent the mailings.</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5435" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />According to <em>The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</em></strong>, the Wisconsin Elections Commission will be implementing a</span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/05/22/wisconsin-election-commission-usps-tracking-system-after-absentee-ballot-vote-lost-myvote-president/5237945002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new tracking system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Postal Service so residents can better track their mail ballots. In the past, the state’s MyVote system would list the date the ballot was sent but in reality that was the day the mail label was created, it would then take several more days to create the ballot packet and actually put it in the mail. The new system will consist of a unique barcode on each envelope that identifies it as election mail. The envelopes will be scanned at each postal facility, allowing voters to track exactly where their ballot is in the mail system. In addition, barcode tracking will enable officials to monitor whether ballots are sent to the wrong place, such as when three tubs of absentee ballots intended for Appleton and Oshkosh were discovered in a mail processing center the day after the election. The new system &#8220;is definitely going to happen,” Commission spokesperson Reid Magney told the paper. “That’s something we are definitely putting in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts Auditor Suzanne Bump said this week</strong> that the state should</span><a href="https://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/bump-cities-and-towns-owed-700k-for-early-voting/article_93c448f5-6245-5acf-83ec-ed649b7d86ac.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reimburse local governments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more than $700,000 that was spent on early voting costs for the March 3 presidential preference primary. As state lawmakers look to expand early voting to municipal and state elections, Bump has urged them to be mindful of the costs to local governments and that the Legislature should set up a dedicated funding source. &#8220;Early voting has already proven to be a valuable addition to our democratic processes,&#8221; Bump wrote. &#8220;Establishing a formal procedure to fund the expenses incurred by our municipalities will make it that much stronger.&#8221;</span></p>

Director Laura Bruns said she brought the idea to the board due to other county employees being off work due to the coronavirus and shelter-in-place order. According to Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s regional liaison Kenny Henning, 13 of the 14 counties he observes has provided some kind of compensation due to the extended election this spring. Henning told The Troy Daily News, Warren County provided 40 additional hours of vacation to staff; Butler and Greene County paid an additional eight hours to staff; Montgomery County closed its office for three days; and Hamilton County closed last Friday for an extended holiday weekend.</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3500" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Capitol2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Legislation</strong>: Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) has introduced a bill on to create a new federal organization to help with elections. The legislation would establish a &#8220;</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/498914-booker-introduces-bill-to-create-democracycorps-for-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DemocracyCorps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; of individuals who would help register voters, carry out voter education campaigns and serve as poll workers. The organization would include 35,000 people who would serve two-year terms. They would be assigned to states based on population, number of elected officials and population on Native American lands. In addition to creating the new organization, Booker&#8217;s bill, the DemocracyCorps Act, would also include broader election reforms that includes expanding early voting to 20 days before a federal election, allowing for online voter registration and allowing for vote-by-mail in addition to voting in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alaska:</strong> The City of Soldotna has introduced an ordinance that, if passed, could enact a</span><a href="https://www.ktva.com/story/42182197/soldotna-kenai-peninsula-borough-considering-vote-by-mail-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote-by-mail system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for city elections. It&#8217;s a move that follows a similar ordinance moving through the Kenai Peninsula Borough according to KTVA. According to the city&#8217;s ordinance, &#8220;recent catastrophic events including disaster declarations related to local floods, fires and a global public health pandemic&#8221; reinforce the need for a vote-by-mail system. However, the city is calling for a hybrid system that would allow people to cast a ballot at a vote center if they wish to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Illinois:</strong> The Illinois Senate passed a bill expanding vote by mail for the 2020 election Friday. The bill will</span><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/politics/illinois-vote-by-mail-bill-passes-senate-heads-to-governor-for-signature/6205072/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatically send an application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a vote-by-mail ballot to any person who has voted in the past two years, in the 2018 general election, the 2019 consolidated election or the 2020 primary election. Anyone who registered to vote after the 2020 primary will also receive an application for a vote-by-mail ballot. The bill also declares Election Day, November 3, 2020, a state holiday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3672" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NCCapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Carolina</strong>: An elections</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/pandemic-prompts-lawmakers-to-make-changes-for-fall-elections/19116742/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill responding to the coronavirus pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moved through two House committees Wednesday on its way to what appears to be likely passage by the full House Thursday according to WRAL. House Bill 1169 makes changes, some temporary and others permanent, to make voting by mail easier and more secure at the same time. For 2020, the requirement of two witnesses for an absentee ballot is dropped to one witness, who is required to print his or her name and address. Voters will also be able to submit an official absentee ballot request online or by fax or email as well as by mail or in person. The bill requires all absentee ballots to have a bar code or other unique identifier so voters and elections officials can track them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vermont:</strong> This week, lawmakers on the Senate Government Operations Committee advanced a bill that would take the governor out of the</span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/05/26/final-reading-senate-moves-to-sideline-scott-from-mail-in-election-decision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election emergency decision-making process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and give the secretary of state the sole authority to make changes to election procedures during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> By a 5 to 1 vote, the Oshkosh city council voted that as long as the city remains under a public health emergency, it will send an</span><a href="https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Oshkosh-council-passes-plan-for-vote-by-mail-option--570787981.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to every registered voter. The effort will be in place for both the August 11th partisan primary and the November 3rd general election. Mayor Lori Palmeri says a decision has to be made now to give the city clerk&#8217;s office time to prepare. &#8220;Nobody has a crystal ball, but there are certainly scientists and epidemiologists and public health people who are warning us that we could have another potential surge in the fall,&#8221; Palmeri said according to WBAY.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Legal News</strong>: If there’s a day that ends in a Y, there is some new elections-related litigation and</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/27/863422759/the-legal-fight-over-mail-in-and-absentee-voting-intensifies-during-the-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National Public Radio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Pam Fessler has a great piece this week tying together all the litigation surrounding absentee and vote by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3587" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/California-Flag-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/California-Flag-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/California-Flag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/California-Flag.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />California:</strong> Former Congressman Darrell Issa—who is also currently running for Congress—has sued Gov. Gavin Newsom over the governor’s executive order to send every registered voter in California a ballot for the November election. Issa’s suit argues that the executive order is an unconstitutional maneuver that</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-congressman-issa-sues-california-over-mail-in-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rips local control from county election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Issa suit, three Republican groups—the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the California Republican Party have also</span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-24/republicans-sue-newsom-over-vote-by-mail-order-for-november-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed suit against Newsom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his executive order to send every voter a ballot in November. The lawsuit accuses Newsom of a “brazen power grab” that would “violate eligible citizens’ right to vote.” Responding to the lawsuit, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said via Twitter: “Expanding vote-by-mail during a pandemic is not a partisan issue — it’s a moral imperative to protect voting rights and public safety. Vote-by-mail has been used safely and effectively in red, blue, and purple states for years. This lawsuit is just another part of Trump’s political smear campaign against voting by mail. We will not let this virus be exploited for voter suppression.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court refused to hear a constitutional challenge to the</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/supreme-court-denies-petition-to-hear-california-voting-rights-act-challenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> California Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over its requirement that some local governments hold district rather than at-large elections. The 2002 law prohibits sweeping at-large elections in favor of individual district elections in areas where minorities may be impeded from electing candidates of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3346" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida</strong>: As expected, in a 125-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242972791.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is unconstitutional to prevent returning citizens from voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Florida because they cannot afford to pay back court fees, fines and restitutions to victims. Calling the law a “pay-to-vote system,” Hinkle’s ruling declares that court fees are a tax, and it creates a new process for determining whether felons are eligible to vote. “This order holds that the State can condition voting on payment of fines and restitution that a person is able to pay but cannot condition voting on payment of amounts a person is unable to pay,” Hinkle wrote. With one sentence, Hinkle also allowed two large groups of felons to register to vote: those who were appointed an attorney for their criminal case because they couldn’t afford one on their own, and anyone who had their financial obligations converted to civil liens. For all other felons who can’t afford to pay their financial obligations, Hinkle ordered state officials to adopt a new process for determining whether felons are too poor to vote: They can request an advisory opinion from Secretary of State Laurel Lee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retired sheriff’s deputy and two others working to help senior citizens have filed suit seeking to have every registered voter receive a</span><a href="https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/lawsuit-seeks-mail-ballots-for-every-florida-voter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mail ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November and that the state pays the postage. It asserts requiring voters to request a mail ballot rather than just sending one, and requiring them to pay the postage is asking too much.“Many people don’t have computers,” said attorney Harvey Sepler, who is representing the three plaintiffs. “They don’t want to leave their homes because of the virus because they don’t want to expose themselves. That means they don’t want to leave to request a mail in ballot.” The suit has been assigned to a judge, but no hearing has been set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a year-long investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement there was</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article242893826.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “no evidence of fraudulent intent”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Florida Democratic Party in the 2018 election. The voter fraud complaints against Democrats came at the end of the 2018 elections as counties completed required recounts in the races for governor, U.S. Senate and state agriculture commissioner. Investigators found that three people associated with the Florida Democratic Party changed the submission deadline dates in an election form, known as a “cure affidavit,” which is designed to fix signature problems on vote-by-mail ballots. Investigators found “no evidence of fraudulent intent to use the altered forms” on April 20 and handed the case over to the Florida Office of Statewide Prosecution to determine if there was enough evidence and information to file charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Idaho</strong>: U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill has granted a</span><a href="https://www.tetonvalleynews.net/coronavirus/federal-judge-extends-deadline-for-absentee-ballots-to-tuesday/article_c3734f22-08a9-5923-9c91-f711b36cda44.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> giving Idaho voters more time — until Tuesday, May 26 — to request absentee ballots for the May primary election. Winmill ruled in favor of the Nicholas Jones for Congress campaign, which sued after the Idaho Secretary of State’s website repeatedly crashed as the 8 p.m. May 19 deadline approached to request absentee ballots. “The concern is those who had access to the internet understood that they could rely on that, that they could use the website, and it did not work,” the judge declared.</span></p>

The lawsuit also asks the court to extend Kentucky’s new expanded vote-by-mail policy beyond the June primary elections. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of several individuals who say they have health issues that make it dangerous for them to go to a polling place or get an ID during the pandemic. Plaintiffs also include the Kentucky League of Women Voters, the Louisville Urban League and the Kentucky NAACP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Louisiana</strong>: The League of Women Voters of Louisiana (LWV), three Louisiana voters, and other organizations filed a federal lawsuit against Gov  John Bel Edwards, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, Attorney General Jeff Landry, and other government officials over the</span><a href="https://www.knoe.com/content/news/Another-lawsuit-takes-aim-at-Louisianas-emergency-voting-plan-570667331.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state’s plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for voting during the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>

It claims that a</span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/05/22/michigan-absentee-voting-lawsuit-donald-trump/5244248002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law in place since at least 1929</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan that requires absentee ballots be received by a local clerk&#8217;s office by 8 p.m. on Election Day to be counted runs counter to what the lawsuit says is an &#8220;unqualified, unconditional state constitutional right for registered voters to vote in all elections by absentee ballot.&#8221; n 2018, no-reason absentee voting passed by state referendum, giving voters the right to cast absentee ballots by mail or in person beginning 40 days before an election. Since regular mail can often take days, the lawsuit says the old rule conflicts with the intention of the state referendum to expand absentee voting.</span></p>

The suit claims many people with disabilities are being excluded from New York state&#8217;s expanded absentee ballot program. To help keep voters safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, New York is allowing anyone to apply for an absentee ballot that can be mailed in rather than going to the polls. But many people with visual or physical disabilities such as paralysis, dystonia and tremors cannot independently and privately mark a paper ballot.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

After a federal judge temporarily blocked the ID law, two GOP members of the North Carolina General Assembly sought to intervene, claiming that the state elections board and Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein failed to adequately defend state interests in the case. The district court denied their motion, prompting an appeal to the Fourth Circuit. State Senator Phil Berger and state Representative Tim Moore urged the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court on Wednesday to let the lawmakers step in to defend the voter ID statute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Coalition for Social Justice filed a federal lawsuit demanding</span><a href="https://www.wral.com/lawsuit-argues-nc-s-voting-laws-aren-t-built-for-a-pandemic/19111009/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changes in North Carolina&#8217;s voting laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The 72-page suit declares the state&#8217;s absentee ballot and voter registration rules unconstitutional, saying people can&#8217;t be forced to choose between voting and protecting their health. Among other things, it calls for a longer registration period and contact-less drop boxes for absentee ballots, in case there are post office delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio</strong>: U.S. District Judge Jack Zouhary has dismissed claims by an ex-election official that she was improperly fired, finding that she could be removed without cause.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this week, South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed a case that sought to allow any voter to cast an</span><a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2020/05/27/sc-supreme-court-dismisses-case-would-expand-absentee-voting/5266175002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to avoid polling places during the coronavirus pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Democrats and the DCCC filed a lawsuit last month alleging the state&#8217;s absentee voting requirements would disenfranchise voters in upcoming elections. On May 12, the day the state Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, state lawmakers passed a measure to allow anyone to vote absentee in upcoming elections until July 1, 2020.  &#8220;As for elections after July 1, 2020, we hold that whether any change should be made to the law is a political question for the Legislature likewise to answer,&#8221; the majority opinion states. </span></p>

The court agreed with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that the risk of contracting the virus alone does not meet the state’s qualifications for voting by mail. “We agree with the State that a voter’s lack of immunity to COVID-19, without more, is not a ‘disability’ as defined by the Election Code,” the court wrote. The high court also rejected Paxton’s request to prevent local election officials from sending mail-in ballots to voters who were citing lack of immunity to the coronavirus as a disability. Those officials denied they were operating outside the law and argued they cannot deny ballots to voters who cite a disability — even if their reasoning is tied to susceptibility to the coronavirus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi has ruled that the state must pay almost</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/27/texas-voter-id-legal-fees-court-costs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $6.8 million in legal fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and costs in its years-long voter ID battle.</span></p>

The federal lawsuit was by conservative attorney Jim Bopp on behalf of six northern Virginia voters. The Virginia lawsuit says that expanding absentee balloting is unnecessary to combat COVID-19. “The same social distancing and good hygiene practices — which are effective for preventing the spread of the virus when going out for essential services, like grocery shopping and other essential services — are also an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus for in-person voting,” the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also says that a dramatic increase in absentee ballots “would be a logistical nightmare and increases the risk of disenfranchisement.”</span></p>

According to the criminal complaint, Pendleton County clerk received eight “2020 Primary Election COVID-19 Mail-In Absentee Request&#8221; forms to the Pendleton County Courthouse in April that appeared to have had the voters&#8217; party-ballot requests altered. According to Secretary of State Mac Warner, the altered forms were investigated by the WV Election Fraud Task Force, which is a multi-agency law enforcement effort formed in April as a way to deter potential voter and election fraud with upcoming elections. Investigators responded to the complaint quickly, and Warner said the altered forms were uncovered early and will have no impact on the outcomes of any elections.</span></p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0 Open Comment Period</h2>
														<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"> unanimously voted</a> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</p>
<p>On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</p>
<p>The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</a>, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"> regulations.gov</a>.</p>
<p>EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</p>
<p>Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</p>
<p>The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</a> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</p>
<p>The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</p>
<p>The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>
<p>The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</p>
<p>The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</p>
