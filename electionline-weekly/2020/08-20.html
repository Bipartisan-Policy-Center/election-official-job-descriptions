							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>HealthyVoting.org</strong><br />
<em>Site helps voters and administrators know what’s healthy</em></p>
<p>Tasmin Swanson<br />
Healthy Voting and Center for Civic Design, Voter-centered content</p>
<p>When it comes to the 2020 General Election, healthy has two meanings. There’s the physical health of voters in the midst of a global pandemic. Equally important is the democratic health of our country as measured by access to the vote.<a href="http://healthyvoting.org"> HealthyVoting.org</a> is designed to bolster both.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5564" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Created by We Can Vote in partnership with American Public Health Association (APHA), National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), and Center for Civic Design (CCD),<a href="http://healthyvoting.org"> HealthyVoting.org</a> features detailed guidance for all 50 states, DC, and voting territories, as well as Americans Abroad. Each page lays out all available voting methods in the state, paired with positive, proactive steps that voters can take to keep themselves and others safe, no matter how they choose to vote.</p>
<p>Voters will appreciate the concise, easy to skim, mobile-friendly layout. Lower-risk options, such as mail voting when available, appear at the top of the page, but voters can also explore in person voting options during the early voting period and on Election Day. In recent weeks, voters who may have been confident about their plan to vote by mail may be rethinking that in light of growing concerns about the U.S. Postal Service. For those voters, as well as those who are new to voting, this site lays out everything they need to make an informed decision in one mobile-friendly place. In user testing, one voter from Georgia described it as “easy to understand… the information was right there I didn’t have to read through a ton to find what I needed.”</p>
<p><a href="http://healthyvoting.org"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5823" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />HealthyVoting.org</a> was also designed with election administrators in mind. We interviewed independent public health experts at universities and former federal officials, ensuring that best practices such as masks, physical distancing, handwashing are presented as positive, proactive steps that keep voters (and poll workers) safe at all stages of their voting process. We Can Vote staff and volunteer lawyers monitor evolving state election policies, and update the guidelines when policies change. (Several states are still finalizing their rules for the general election, while others are still completing their primaries.) The site makes it easy for voters to contact local election officials with questions by providing multiple links back to the state or local boards of elections websites to ensure that voters can reach trusted info with ease.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use and adapt the site:</p>
<p><strong>Pocket guides</strong><br />
Each state’s page includes a downloadable pocket guide, which is regenerated if there are changes to the voting process in your state. These can be printed on a single sheet of paper, and then a few folds transforms it into a pocket-sized booklet that includes relevant deadlines, available voting options, and healthy tips vetted by public health experts. These booklets can be printed en mass and placed in public spaces such as hospital waiting rooms, food distribution sites, or senior-living centers for potential voters to pick up and carry away, or made available online for voters to print at home.</p>
<p>If your state<a href="https://electiontools.org/tool/pocket-voter-guide-template/"> already has its own pocket guide</a>, the healthy tips can be quickly adapted into a one page supplement.</p>
<p><strong>Partner with local trusted messengers</strong><br />
A recent<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57b8c7ce15d5dbf599fb46ab/t/5f3307ec6569af05af274bb7/1597179885893/CID+Voter+Messaging+in+the+Time+of+COVID-19+-+Fact+Sheet+-+FINAL.pdf"> survey from the California Center for Inclusive Democracy</a> found that people who see messages that lay out all of their voting options report that they are more likely to vote than those that do not. That effect is compounded when there is a safety and health component of the message and it is delivered by a trusted messenger.</p>
<p><a href="http://healthyvoting.org">HealthyVoting.org</a> makes it easy to replicate that success in the real world. Both the pocket guide and the website include multiple reminders to check with local elections offices for the most up to date policies. Advocacy groups and other trusted messengers are able to share it, and the site then encourages voters to contact local election officials with questions.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong><br />
Each state page includes links to Twitter and Facebook with prewritten posts that you can adapt as needed. The downloadable pocket guide also makes for easily sharable social media content. Simply export the guide as an image, crop the page you’d like to use, then share it.</p>
<p><strong>Borrow the text</strong><br />
Election officials looking to send out accurate, practical health advice vetted by public health officials can take the text and use it in social media posts, email blasts, and even websites to help instill confidence in voters as they weigh which voting method is right for them.</p>
<p>The 2020 General Election promises to be an election like no other. Election administrators across the country have risen to the challenge, adapting messaging and processes in real time to instill trust, confidence, and a sense of efficacy in their voters. HealthyVoting.org is designed to be one more tool in the election administrator’s arsenal. As former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson (R) described it in our launch press conference, “In America, we have adapted our elections over the years, going back to the Civil War. We need to adapt right now, and tools like this will help administrators do that.”</p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>Cliff Notes</strong><br />
<em>A few ways to avoid falling off an electoral cliff</em></p>
<p>By Conny McCormack</p>
<p>With the upcoming tsunami-like deluge of voters choosing to vote by mail, election officials across the U.S. are facing added stress on the capacity of their systems and staff to respond during this pandemic.  As a former local election official with 35-years of experience processing hundreds of thousands of absentee/mail ballots, highlighting a few issues could assist with expected consequences resulting from an unprecedented number of mail ballots:</p>
<p>Any voter throughout the U.S is entitled to vote a provisional ballot at the polls if s/he did not receive the mail ballot, or if s/he is worried that the voted mail ballot may not reach the elections office in time to be counted. The importance of emphasizing in poll worker training that all voters in such circumstances have the right to a provisional ballot (per federal HAVA law) is crucial, including to deflect potential accusations of disenfranchisement.  Consider providing extra provisional ballot supplies and envelopes at the polls to accommodate the anticipated higher number of voters expressing such concerns.  And it could be helpful to provide poll workers with an information sheet to explain the provisional ballot process to voters, including how and when provisional ballots are counted.</p>
<p>Another unintended consequence of an exponentially higher number of mail ballots is an explosion in the number of those mail ballots that will NOT be able to be counted, for a number of reasons including voters forgetting to sign the envelope.  In the 2016 General Election, the EAC reported 1% of absentee/mail ballots lacked signatures and could not be counted.  With a major increase in the number of voters choosing to vote by mail &#8211; often for the first time &#8211; an unprecedented number of such inadvertent mistakes are likely to occur. For ex, in the recent KY primary election, voting by mail far outpaced in-person voting, for the first time ever.  An unfortunate consequence was the percentage of mail ballots that were unable to be counted exceeded 4% in the two largest counties. The huge increase of mail voters occurred in many other State primary elections as well, leading to much greater numbers of uncounted mail ballots compared with previous elections.</p>
<p>Among the practical ways for election officials to consider reducing the number/percentage of uncounted mail ballots is using a contrasting color, like red, to highlight the box(es) where the voter must sign. Such a design has proven effective in making a difference in many jurisdictions.  Although election officials have undoubtedly completed their initial purchase of mail ballot materials and envelopes, it might be possible to use a hand-stamp in red or a contrasting color to point to where the voter needs to sign as an alternate approach.  And if/when jurisdictions order supplemental supplies, more prominently highlighting the signature box could be incorporated into a re-design.</p>
<p>Election officials are girding for the outcry about slower election results as a surge of mail ballots will inevitably arrive at the deadline and remain to be counted in the days, and weeks, following election night.  Anxiety is heightened when there is a cliffhanger election in any of the electoral contests. Pre-election preparation of press releases and concise information guides helps to explain the laborious, time-consuming processes that are legally required, such as signature verification and/or other protocols, prior to opening and counting mail ballots.  Election officials always emphasize that accuracy beats speed, but noisy complaints will likely reach a crescendo in many jurisdictions and the potential for lawsuits looms. Informing stakeholders that election processes are open to observation by candidates, media and the general public de-mystifies the multiple processes involved to move from unofficial election results to official certification.</p>

							<h2>2018 Elections Performance Index</h2>
														<p><strong>How Effective Is Election Administration in the US?</strong><br />
<em>The MIT Election Data + Science Lab releases the 2018 Elections Performance Index</em></p>
<p>The MIT Election Lab has just launched the <a href="https://elections.mit.edu/#/data/map">2018 Elections Performance Index</a>, along with a brand new website for the EPI. The new website allows users to navigate the state and indicator data more easily and intuitively; it also features a section for ongoing discussion, commentary, and analysis. The newest post, by Election Lab director Charles Stewart III, discusses what the 2018 EPI can tell us about the upcoming 2020 election.</p>
<p>The EPI, an objective measure of election performance in the United States, is an important, nonpartisan source of information on how—and how well—elections are managed in the US. It provides data on each national election since 2008, allowing us to compare states with their own past performance, as well as with other states across the country. The newly released 2018 data show that, across the board, U.S. election management has continued to improve—to learn more and explore the data, visit elections.mit.edu.</p>

Most voters cast their ballots by mail, but a few did show up at the polls and those that did found few issues. “This year we sent out 53,970 mail ballots,” said Division of Elections Public Relations Manager Tiffany Montemayor told KTUU about the<a href="https://www.ktuu.com/2020/08/18/alaska-sees-more-absentee-ballots-less-polling-places-due-to-covid-19/"> increase in absentee voting</a>. She compared that to the 8,715 sent out during the 2016 state primary. For those that chose to<a href="https://www.juneauempire.com/news/election-officials-say-it-was-a-slow-morning-at-the-polls/"> vote in-person</a>, polling places were quiet throughout the day.  “Our experience voting here is, there’s no congestion, there’s no lines,” voter Tim Polasky told the <em>Juneau Empire</em>.  While there was a mix of mail-in and in-person voting throughout most of the state,<a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/08/18/voters-in-6-villages-will-vote-absentee-in-person-tuesday/"> a poll worker shortage forced the state to close polling places</a> in a half-dozen small towns. A spokesperson said despite raising the hourly rate for the temporary workers, the division was unable to overcome fears about the spread of coronavirus. Elections officials made the announcement late Monday, a little more than 12 hours before polls opened, that there would only be absentee in-person voting in the communities of Arctic Village, Port Lions, Kake, Takotna, Cold Bay and Nunam Iqua.</p>

In a story we first saw reported in the <em>Anchorage Daily News</em>, in a nationwide rule change that went unnoticed this summer, the<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/08/18/in-rule-change-postal-service-forbids-employees-from-signing-absentee-ballots-as-witnesses/"> U.S. Postal Service has forbidden employees from signing absentee ballots as witnesses while on duty</a>. In Alaska and several other states, absentee ballots must be signed by a witness who can verify that a ballot was legitimately filled out by a particular voter. Without a signature, the ballot will not be counted. Alaska’s ballot instructions say to “have your signature witnessed by an authorized official or, if no official is reasonably available, by someone 18 years of age or older.” In response to the complaints from voters, Alaska Division of Elections Director Gail Fenumiai sent a letter to the Postal Service. “They have been told by the postal official that they are not authorized to serve as a witness in their official capacity. This came as surprise to the state because we know in past elections postal officials have served as witnesses. Rural Alaska relies heavily on postal officials as they are often sometimes the only option for a witness. &#8230; Can you provide me with an explanation and a copy of the official postal regulation stating this mandate?” her letter said. Daniel Bentley, a product management specialist for the Postal Service in Washington, D.C., responded to Fenumiai. “Postal Employees are prohibited from serving as witnesses in their official capacity while on duty, due in part to the potential operational impacts. The Postal Service does not prohibit an employee from serving as a witness in their personal capacity off-duty, if they so choose,” he wrote. James Boxrud, a spokesman for the Postal Service in the western United States, provided a copy of a training slide presented to clerks in July to the <em>Anchorage Daily News</em>. The slide states in part, “Some state laws specifically authorize Postal Service employees to provide a witness signature on ballot envelopes. However, performing this function is not within the scope of a postal employee’s duties and is not required by the Postal Service’s regulations.” Boxrud told the ADN at least one supervisor in Alaska has pushed back against the rule, but as far as he knows it remains in place.</p>

The Leffel Roots Orchard<a href="https://wxow.com/2020/08/18/corn-maze-pays-tribute-to-19th-amendment/"> designed a corn maze to celebrate</a> the anniversary and simply put, it’s awesome. &#8220;It&#8217;s always good to celebrate something that&#8217;s positive in our history, and so we are definitely excited to have people out to see this and I think, hopefully, it will encourage people to vote. No matter who you&#8217;re voting for it&#8217;s just good to get your voice heard,&#8221; owner Laura Leffel told WQOW. The 10-acre corn maze features the word VOTE  and a picture of a suffragette. This year, Leffel says the maze has a bonus feature for those who go through it. “We thought we would come up to times and we now have QR codes and you can click on those QR codes and there is a little voting question for you,” Leffel told WEAU. “They are non-controversial, they are just things like, ‘do you think you’re going to be able to finish the maze?’” It opens September 2 and will remain open through October.</p>

According to AllOnGeorgia, Payne who had served as the county’s probate judge for 45 years, positive for the virus on July 26th and succumbed to complications from the virus this week. In February of 1975 Jon Payne won a special election to fill the office of Probate Judge.  He was 25 years old when he was sworn in. Casie Bryant with AllOnGeorgia has this story to tell about Judge Payne from the June 9th primary when a precinct card issue forced the ballot count to wait till the next morning: “I was standing beside Judge Payne who was sitting at his desk. A young man walked into the Judge Payne’s office, I did not immediately notice the fellow, there were a dozen or more people crammed into the office, but the Judge noticed him. Casually, while still chatting with me, he opened his desk drawer and removed a revolver the size of my arm and sat it on top of his desk. In a stare only a Marine can deliver, he watched the visitor as he approached the desk, the gentleman identified himself as a technician from Atlanta there to assist with the ballot counting machine, showed his identification, and lived to see another day. Judge Payne looked at me, I looked at the 44 Magnum on the desk, he smiled and said, ‘my job is to keep these ballots safe, I did not know who he was.’”</p>

The Democratic-led House is scheduled to vote on the legislation on Saturday, though there is little chance for passage in the Republican-led Senate. The bill would prevent the Postal Service from implementing policies to alter service levels that were in effect at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas is the lead sponsor of the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/politics/legislation-youth-voting-rights/index.html"> Protect the Youth Vote Act of 2020</a>, a piece of voting rights legislation meant to prevent age discrimination in voting. The bill is co-sponsored by Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse, Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, New York Rep. Grace Meng, and Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy. The bill addresses and lays out legal violations to the 26th Amendment &#8212; which gave 18-year-olds the right to vote &#8212; in an attempt to help improve transparency around voter suppression tactics. Across the country, young voters face a number of barriers at the state level, including strict same-day voter registration and voter ID laws. Additionally, polling sites have been left off certain college campuses and universities.</p>

Ardoin&#8217;s new plan will only allow a COVID-19 exemption for someone who tests positive for the infection during and after early voting but before election day. That will fall under the existing &#8220;hospitalization&#8221; excuse for an absentee ballot. On Wednesday, after five hours of debate, House and Governmental Affairs<a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/house-ga-votes-to-approve-emergency-election-plan-passes-in-8-6-vote"> voted to approve</a> the plan in an 8-6 vote. The plan will now move to the full House. Gov. John Bel Edwards has expressed disapproval with the plan.</p>

According to the Cegavske&#8217;s office, under NRS 233B.0613, if a state agency determines an emergency exists, the agency may ask the Governor to approve an emergency regulation. An approved emergency regulation takes effect immediately and remains in place for a period of no longer than 120 days. Cegavske’s state of emergency reads, in part, The proposed emergency regulation would not reinstate the ban on ballot harvesting because it is not the Secretary of State’s role to create new laws. Instead, the proposed emergency regulation would require any individual engaged in ballot harvesting (defined in the regulation as a person who returns 10 or more completed ballots at the direction of any other voters) to report to the Secretary of State their name, the names of the individuals they returned ballots on behalf of, and the location(s) where the ballots were returned. The regulation would also require these individuals, known as ballot harvesters, to list any corporate, political, or advocacy entity with which the individual is associated. By having this information, the Secretary of State will be able to properly investigate any illegal activity associated with the practice of ballot harvesting.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey:</strong> Two more  counties have supported disapproval resolutions against an entirely vote-by-mail general election.<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2020/08/13/morris-gop-freeholders-vote-reject-mail-voting-november/3366245001/"> Morris</a> and<a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/warren-county-freeholders-oppose-exclusive-use-vote-mail/"> Warren</a> counties join the  growing list. In Morris County, the resolution specifically states that predominate use of mail-in ballots during the recent primaries &#8220;caused concerns for voter fraud, voter disenfranchisement, postal delivery delays, significant increase in election costs, and reliance on a flawed statewide voter/DMV computer registration database and resulted in significant delays in the counting of ballots.&#8221; [Ed. Note: While there were delivery delays, there were absolutely no reported instances of voter fraud using mail ballots during the primaries.] Warren County’s resolution focused less on fraud and more on enfranchisement. “I realize people’s concern as we’ve been fighting coronavirus in the county,” Warren County Freeholder Jason J. Sarnoski said, adding, “This does not mean that people will not have the option to vote by mail.” But the resolution unanimously adopted opposes running an election with all mail-in ballots, he said.</p>

Senate President Harvey Peeler announced Monday that the session will convene on September 2 at 12 p.m.  Peeler wrote that the Senate will consider updates to state election laws that will protect the voter and the vote this November. &#8220;We addressed these issues for the primary elections by working together in a bipartisan manner. My hope is that we can do this again September 2nd.&#8221; As for the South Carolina House of Representatives, House Speaker Jay Lucas says the House will return on September 15th, when lawmakers return for the COVID-19 funding session. &#8220;I anticipate the House will be able to quickly address the issue in our chamber,&#8221; says Speaker Lucas. &#8220;I understand if the Senate feels it needs additional time to debate this matter. I’m confident that, working together, both chambers will make changes that will protect voters throughout the state.”</p>

Stephen Handy, R-Layton, and Sen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, would<a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/election-2020/new-bill-expands-utah-voter-options-in-the-covid-19-pandemic"> expand voter access during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The bill keeps existing voter options in place, including in-person balloting and same-day voter registration. But it has a provision that allows for the Lt. Governor&#8217;s office to suspend in-person voting in an area if there&#8217;s a state of emergency. In that case, there must still be other options including &#8220;drive-thru&#8221; voting or an &#8220;outdoor voting&#8221; location.  The bill also expands the ability for county clerks to add &#8220;drive-thru&#8221; voting in addition to vote-by-mail and in-person voting. It also allows for additional drop boxes across the state for people to deposit their ballot. The bill also increased the penalty for &#8220;ballot harvesting&#8221; from an infraction to a class A misdemeanor. Ballot harvesting, which is the practice of collecting someone else&#8217;s ballot, is largely illegal in Utah (with some exceptions for same households or those with disabilities). While not opposed to the legislation, county elections officials said they would rather have it focus on their<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/08/19/election-bill-provides/"> ability to accept mail ballots that may be delayed by the Postal Service</a>. “In several parts of the state, including Salt Lake County, there are some sections of the county and of the state where it takes one week for the mail to get to or from the voters,” Weber County Clerk Ricky Hatch told lawmakers during a briefing on the bill at Tuesday’s Government Operations Interim Committee meeting according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Hatch said the state’s county clerks would like this year to mail out ballots 28 days before an election rather than 21, which is the standard time frame. An extra week would help clerks get ballots to those who have moved or haven’t updated their voter registration, he said. The Weber County clerk said his fellow election officials also want the state to add an additional seven days to the two week canvassing period.</p>

In a call with reporters Wednesday, the groups said DeJoy&#8217;s reversal Tuesday did not sufficiently address their concerns. &#8220;DeJoy&#8217;s statement rings hollow in the absence of remedial actions taken to address the damage that he has caused,&#8221; said Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyer&#8217;s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is representing the groups in the lawsuit. &#8220;We seek remedial relief that will bring the United States Postal Service back to the status quo and that can help guarantee that for every day between now and the election, DeJoy will not take any action that will impair the ability of our Postal Service to do its job to timely deliver mail to Americans across the country,&#8221; she added.</p>

The plaintiffs claim a state ban on curbside voting violates federal law as applied to voters with disabilities or those at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 because of age or medical condition. The plaintiffs also challenged the Alabama law requiring absentee ballots to be signed by two witnesses or notarized and the requirement that absentee voters submit a photo ID, which has some exceptions. Kallon dismissed claims against some of the defendants. Merrill is no longer a defendant on the challenges to the witness and photo ID requirement. The lawsuit<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/05/naacp-others-sue-to-block-alabama-voting-laws-for-runoff.html"> was filed in May.</a> In June,<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/06/federal-judge-blocks-some-alabama-voting-laws-because-of-pandemic.html"> Kallon ruled</a> the state could not enforce the ban on curbside voting for the July 14 runoff. Kallon’s ruling also blocked enforcement of the witness and photo ID requirements for absentee voters, although that only applied to Jefferson, Lee, and Mobile counties. On July 2,<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/07/plaintiffs-ask-clarence-thomas-to-let-curbside-voting-order-stand.html"> the U.S. Supreme Court</a> granted the state’s request for a stay on Kallon’s ruling, so the ruling was not in effect for the runoff. But the issues remain pending for the Nov. 3 general election. A trial in the case is scheduled for September.</p>

Abutin pretended to be his mother in three elections between October 2012 and November 2014, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said. In each of the elections, Abutin claimed to be his 67-year-old mother, who had died in July 2006 and also cast votes using his own identity. The deceptive practice was discovered after an investigation by the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder and the district attorney’s office.</p>

The complaint filed in Chancery Court seeks a permanent injunction barring the state Department of Elections from distributing vote-by-mail ballots or otherwise informing voters that they can cast absentee ballots in the November election except for specific reasons outlined in Delaware&#8217;s constitution. The complaint also asks the court to declare that state lawmakers exceeded their constitutional authority in passing a universal vote-by-mail bill in June. The bill cleared the Democrat-led Senate on an 18-to-3 vote after passing the Democrat-controlled House on a strict party line vote. It was signed into law by Democratic Gov. John Carney on July 1.</p>

The hearing, held via Zoom due to the Covid-19 pandemic, follows a year of litigation after the passage of<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/activists-blast-florida-bill-limiting-felon-voting-rights/"> SB 7066</a>, a law requiring felons to pay all restitution, fines and fees before they are eligible to vote. During Tuesday’s oral arguments, the en banc panel focused on whether fines and fees can be categorized as a tax, and thus violate the 24th Amendment, or if they are simply part of the sentence. “Are the felons who wish to be re-enfranchised really paying a fee to vote or are they paying fines and other financial penalties as a result of their debt to society?” U.S. Circuit Judge Britt Grant asked Julie Ebenstein, one of the attorneys for the 17 plaintiffs with felony convictions. “Your honor, if we look at two people similarly situated – one that can afford to pay and one that cannot – only for the person who cannot afford to pay is the disenfranchisement ongoing,” said Ebenstein of the ACLU. “Disenfranchisement is not just a single momentary penalty. It’s an ongoing punishment as the individual misses election after election.”</p>

The motion came this week in the July 30 lawsuit filed by Common Cause Indiana and the state chapter of the NAACP in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana over election rules that require absentee ballots to be received by noon on Election Day to be counted. The lawsuit argues the requirement will disenfranchise voters in the November general election and that the noon deadline serves no purpose other than enabling county clerks to reject late ballots. In asking for a preliminary injunction, the civil rights firms representing the parties to the lawsuit are seeking a quick ruling because the issue is urgent and they have an expectation of prevailing in the long run. “This early receipt deadline is unjustified in any election, but it is particularly burdensome and unjustified in this election year, when mail delivery is unreliable and the risk of infection from COVID-19 makes voting by mail the only safe option for many voters,” the motion for the injunction says.</p>

Dunlap issued an “amended determination” that summarized his review of a ruling he made in July that the petition came up short of the 63,067 valid signatures needed to gain a spot on the statewide ballot. The affirmation will now be considered by a Cumberland County Superior Court judge, who ordered Dunlap to review his earlier decision in response to a lawsuit filed by the state GOP. During the review, Dunlap considered sworn affidavits and other documents submitted as part of the lawsuit. He accepted some voter signatures that had previously been rejected, but he also invalidated some that had previously been accepted.</p>

The president’s re-election campaign and the Republican Party are appealing an agreement between the secretary of state and litigants that waived the witness requirement for absentee ballots. A Ramsey County judge signed off on the agreement as well as one making ballots postmarked by Election Day eligible for counting in the days after. The Republican lawyers urged a ruling by Sept. 9 because absentee ballots will start going out nine days later.</p>

Phil Murphy in federal court alleging New Jersey&#8217;s<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/18/trump-campaign-suing-gov-murphy-over-mail-voting/3398064001/"> largely all-mail election plan</a> for November is an unconstitutional &#8220;recipe for disaster.&#8221; Murphy&#8217;s executive order directing the November race to be conducted mostly via mail-in ballots improperly appropriates power that belongs to the state Legislature and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the campaign says in its lawsuit, filed Tuesday. &#8220;In his haste, the governor created a system that will violate eligible citizens’ right to vote,&#8221; the lawsuit reads. &#8220;By ordering universal vote-by-mail, he has created a recipe for disaster. Fraudulent and invalid votes dilute the votes of honest citizens and deprive them of their right to vote in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in New Jersey Superior Court Judge Ernest Caposela<a href="https://www.nj.com/passaic-county/2020/08/nj-city-gets-an-election-do-over-after-voter-fraud-issues.html"> ordered a new election</a> for Paterson’s Third Ward for Tuesday November 3, said Scott Salmon, an elections attorney representing Third Ward Councilman William McKoy. The election will have voters once again decide which of five candidates will fill the single post for the city’s Third Ward. In June, Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced voting fraud charges against 1st Ward Councilman Michael Jackson, 3rd Ward Council-Elect Alex Mendez and two other men. On behalf of McKoy, Salmon filed a successful injunction to stop Mendez from being sworn into office late June. The judge’s decision comes after a May election beset by allegations of voter fraud almost immediately. Hundreds of city ballots were found scattered across different municipalities in New Jersey. Ultimately, the Passaic County Board of Elections decided not to count 800 city ballots.</p>

Plaintiffs said this keeps about 60,000 people statewide from casting ballots even though they have finished serving their time. The groups also have launched the Unlock Our Vote campaign to raise awareness of the problem and generate pressure on state lawmakers. Daryl Atkinson, one of the attorneys in the case, was formerly incarcerated. He said the law withholding the vote from people for not paying fines and court fee is a classic example of taxation without representation.</p>
<p>A North Carolina appeals court has dismissed New Hanover County Board of Elections former director Marvin McFadyen’s<a href="https://www.wect.com/2020/08/18/state-appeals-court-dismisses-former-nhc-board-elections-directors-appeal-termination/"> appeal of his termination</a>. McFadyen sued the county, the county Board of Elections, the North Carolina State Board of Elections, and its members after he was fired in 2015. A state appeals court vacated and dismissed his appeal of that decision this week. The court ruled that since McFadyen was terminated by the State Board of Elections, the lawsuit needed to be filed in Wake County. By filing the lawsuit in New Hanover County, which had no jurisdiction, it rendered his appeal moot. The appeals court dismissed without prejudice his ability to refile in Wake County so McFadyen can refile his case there.</p>

State Rep. Tom Brinkman (R., Cincinnati) had sued the four justices for not issuing an opinion that spelled out their reasoning for rejecting an effort in the early hours of Election Day to put in-person voting back on track. He argued that the justices had shirked their responsibility by failing to do so. The high court on Wednesday, as with its original decision early in the morning of March 17, did not spell out its reasons for approving the motion to dismiss.</p>

<p>Citing a warning by the U.S. Postal Service about delivery times, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration is asking the state Supreme Court to<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/08/14/Pennsylvania-asks-court-extend-mail-in-voting-deadlines-2020-election/stories/202008140079"> extend deadlines for mail-in ballots</a> to be received in the November election when Pennsylvania will be a premier presidential battleground. The filing, submitted cited a letter dated July 29 by the general counsel of the U.S. Postal Service, Thomas Marshall. In it, Marshall warns that Pennsylvania’s mail-in ballot deadlines are “incongruous” with the postal service’s delivery standards and he recommended that voters mail in their ballots a week before the deadline for it to be received and counted. The deadline, under current law, is the close of polls on Election Day, Nov. 3, at 8 p.m. The suit is asking the state Supreme Court to order that ballots postmarked by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3 be counted if they are valid and received during the three days following the election. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, asked the high court for “extraordinary” help to end confusion and various ongoing court cases that have put elections officials, interest groups and campaigns at odds largely about how to conduct mail-in voting in the swing state that&#8217;s key to both parties. If court cases continue before trial judges through August, they&#8217;ll &#8220;sow confusion&#8221; with voters and election workers, lawyers Boockvar wrote. &#8220;There is simply insufficient time to litigate these novel constitutional and statutory issues of statewide importance twice,&#8221; Boockvar&#8217;s unusual court filing said, citing multiple court cases where Democratic groups and the Trump campaign have separately sued to set balloting procedures. &#8220;Both voters and election officials need clarity on these critical election issues as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

The judge’s ruling suspended a requirement that voters using mailed ballots fill them out in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. The Supreme Court’s unsigned order included an explanation, which is unusual when its acts on emergency applications. The case differed from similar ones in which state officials had opposed changes to state laws ordered by federal judges, the order said. “Here the state election officials support the challenged decree,” the order said, “and no state official has expressed opposition.” The order added that Rhode Island’s last election was conducted without the witness requirement, meaning that instituting a change now could confuse voters. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch dissented.</p>

Election officials say the app was notoriously buggy and no longer reliable. And they concede it isn’t likely that the elections board will be able to roll out a new app before the Nov. 3 election, potentially making it more difficult for new residents to register to vote or for existing voters to change their information. “We are working to identify a new possible vendor, but significant testing would need to be done prior to launch, and we’re not sure this will be doable before the general [election],” said Rachel Coll, a spokeswoman for the elections board, in an email. “We’re actively looking, though.”</p>

<p><strong>CISA Election Security Initiative Virtual Training &#8211; Managing Risk in a Dynamic Election Environment:</strong> This presentation covers various risk management challenges faced by election infrastructure stakeholders in the current dynamic environment, including continuous cybersecurity risks, evolving mis- and disinformation campaigns, and risks associated with responding to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., implementing new systems and processes for in-person and mail-in voting, adopting new technology, and supporting a remote workforce).

Three panelists from NSGIC’s Geo-Enabled Elections pilot projects discuss how GIS helped them remove potential errors from their election database. Learn key things you can do right now to ensure election accuracy in November. The goal: right ballot to the right voter. EAC Commissioner Hovland will share insights around how incorrect data (inaccurate precincting and districting) and cybersecurity issues can sometimes be confused. Join the Geo-Enabled Elections team as we work to heighten the general understanding of election data quality issues so that, if issues are experienced, the correct conclusions are drawn and appropriate remedies applied. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> September 2 at 1pm Eastern.</p>

What did we learn from the states, starting from Iowa’s caucuses in February all the way through September’s state primaries? We’ll discuss the timing for primaries, whether state and presidential primaries are best run jointly or as two separate events, how ranked-choice voting performed this year, independent voters&#8217; role in political party decision-making and more. Expect to take away ideas for 2022 or 2024. Speakers include: Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, Rob Richie, president and CEO of FairVote and Scott Saiki, Hawaii Speaker of the House and NSCL president-elect. <strong>When:</strong> Sept. 9, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
