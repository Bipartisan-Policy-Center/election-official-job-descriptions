							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Countdown to November 3: What to watch</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ll be watching on November 3</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4575" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Whelp, this is it. Election Day 2020 is finally upon us, The end is nigh…for voting that is, but as for the counting and the rest of it, that really remains to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although a record number of Americans have</span><a href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already cast their ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more will do so before Election Day, millions more still will head to the polls on November 3 and cast their ballot for president of the United States as well as countless other federal, state and local races and many ballot issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a tumultuous election cycle to say the least. At the dawn of 2020, everyone assumed that</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-security-acting-dhs-secretary-chad-wolf/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be driving the conversation but we quickly found out that while election security remains at the critical forefront,</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-2020-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-unlike-year/story?id=73592283"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducting an election in a pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fighting</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/technology/misinformation-local-election-officials.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a tidal wave of misinformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the process have also become the focus for state and local election administrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5564" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Elections administrators have had to fight for</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/07-30/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to find new</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/10-01/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to deal with literally hundreds of lawsuits, and change long-standing practices due to emergency rulemaking and new laws in light of the pandemic. All this on top of all the normal chaos a presidential election year brings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while one might want to chalk it up to hyperbole, New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner probably put it best when he referred to this year as a “</span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/nh-secretary-state-says-2020-once-hundred-years-type-election#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">once in a hundred years type of an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” And he should know, he’s been at this longer than anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5579" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-Mailbox-193x300.png" alt="" width="193" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-Mailbox-193x300.png 193w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-Mailbox.png 386w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" />“Here we are, a once in a hundred years type of an election,” Gardner told local election officials during a pre-election huddle this week. “But we&#8217;ve at least known about it for enough time that we can all have prepared, like you all have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot to watch on Tuesday and we of course, will be keeping an eye on everything, but these are some of the major issues will be tuned into. We’ll be posting our Election Dispatches throughout the day more or less around 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm, and 8pm. Depending on how things go we may add in another late morning and afternoon dispatch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good luck and godspeed to all the elections officials out there. May the gods of democracy have mercy on our souls!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Due to the high volume of daily stories, electionlineToday will publish both on Saturday October 31 and Sunday November 1, by around 10 a.m. each day).</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Turnout/lines</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time we get to Election Day,</span><a href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s likely that more than 100 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will have already voted either in-person or by mail. What impact that has on Election Day remains to be seen. Will overall turnout be up or did just more people vote differently this year? If lines do form at polling places, what’s causing them, how quickly are they cleared and are people waiting in line to cast a ballot when the polls close?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pandemic Impacts</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coronavirus pandemic has impacted so much including elections. What impacts may it have on Election Day? Will COVID-positive voters be able to vote or will they be stymied by state election laws? What happens if a poll worker tests positive? What happens if an elections worker behind the scenes or an elections director tests positive? Will there be issues with social distancing and mask-wearing at the polls?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Poll Workers/Polling Places</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">States have had to hire thousands of new poll workers. While many of them are younger and more tech savvy than some of their more senior predecessors, there’s still a learning curve. Will they be ready? Cities and counties have had consolidate hundreds of polling places. Will voters be able to find out where they are supposed to vote without issue? How will all the sports stadiums being used this year work out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vote by Mail</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While vote-by-mail isn’t typically an Election Day issue—it’s more of a fact before and after Election Day—with so many millions of people choosing to vote-by-mail will people show up at the polls or at elections offices on Tuesday to drop off their ballots? Will there be back-ups at dropboxes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Displaced Voters</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floods, wildfires and the pandemic has displaced hundreds of thousands of voters. Will all those who want to vote be able? Will last-minute issues with wildfires cause problems for voters and elections officials?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Poll Watchers</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president has called for an “army” of poll watchers to turn up at polling places on Election Day and observe what’s happening. Most state’s typically have pretty strict</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/poll-watcher-qualifications.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll watcher/challenger laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so what impact, if any, will the president’s supporters have on voting. And what too of the people who come to watch the poll watchers? All-in-all there could be a lot of people standing outside polling places on Election Day, many not there to vote.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Equipment</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if everything else wasn’t enough, some counties and states are rolling out new, but long-planned voting machines and e-poll books. Even if these devices were used previously they will be new to many voters who vote only in presidential general elections.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Provisional Ballots</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we seeing a lot of provisional ballots from people who voted by mail but for whatever reason chose to vote in person and is that causing line issues?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Unknown Unknowns</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2002, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> infamously said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “…we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don&#8217;t know we don&#8217;t know.” And while we tut-tutted about it when he said, it really has become a life lesson for Election Day. There are the known knowns—people will show up at the polls and vote. There are the known unknowns—lines will form, equipment will fail, someone will show up late the open a polling place, a car may crash into a polling place, etc. But what we don’t know are the unknown unknowns. What those will be for 2020 are anyone’s guess, but we’ll be sure to bring them to you via our Election Day Dispatches and right back here next week.</span></p>

Because early voting is like an election every day, there is always a treasure trove of stories that occur. Here are just a few from this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida</strong>: Early voting in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties was cut short on Wednesday in anticipation of</span><a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2020/10/27/hurricane-zeta-escambia-santa-rosa-county-early-voting-sites-close-early-wednesday/3754249001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hurricane Zeta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polls closed at 3pm and opened late on Thursday.  In</span><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-woman-labor-casts-ballot-early-voting-20201027-dg3ejsa3t5c7jalh3bha24f3k4-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Orange County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a woman in labor refused to go to the hospital until she voted so elections staff helped her cast her ballot from the elections office parking lot. “We are very, very busy, but when something like that happens it just makes our day,&#8221; Eileen Deliz, an early voting clerk told the Orlando Sentinel. “It kind of validates what we do [and] the importance of voting. Every election cycle brings us a great little story.” If it’s a boy we really hope they named him Bill!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maine</strong>: In</span><a href="http://www.bridgton.com/casting-absentee-ballots-turns-ugly-in-naples/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Naples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Town Manager John Hawley said that voters have acted fearfully about handing over their ballots. “The attitude of voting this year has been different from I have ever seen in any other year. People are very possessive with their ballots,” Naples Town Manager John Hawley said. “People have accused us of shredding the ballots. They don’t want to hand back the absentee ballots,” he said. “There are people who firmly believe” that the ballots are being dumped in a dumpster out back or something along that nature.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland</strong>: In</span><a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/daniel-swain-refused-to-wear-face-mask-at-polling-place-arrested-charging-docs-say-harford-county/34495235"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harford County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a man was arrested for refusing to wear a mask in an early voting site. State law requires wearing a face covering inside public buildings. Election officials offered the voter an isolated voting booth inside the building, but he declined, saying it was unconstitutional. The voter, a retired correctional officer,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/mask-voting-lawsuit-maryland/2020/10/28/653061c4-1934-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has filed suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Harford County Circuit Court seeking a temporary restraining order that would prohibit the election board from requiring voters to wear a face covering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: With long lines persisting since early voting began over the weekend, several jurisdictions including</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/elections/new-york-citys-board-of-elections-expands-early-voting-hours.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/28/early-voting-westchester-county-new-york-ny-2020-locations/6053040002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Westchester County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have expanding early voting hours. In</span><a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/28/early-voting-hours-rockland-county/6060231002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rockland County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partisan elections commissioners were split on extending early voting hours by one hour. In</span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/nyc-voting-red-hook-ppe-brooklyn-nypd-take/7329484/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brooklyn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PPE that was being handed out by volunteers to voters waiting in line was temporarily confiscated by the police but ultimately returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A one-stop early voting site in</span><a href="https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/3-poll-workers-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-one-stop-early-voting-location-in-reidsville/83-b155b7b5-076b-4b08-8946-815b74478975"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rockingham County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had to be temporarily closed after three poll workers tested positive for COVID-19. The Board of Elections held an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine how to replace the workers in quarantine. The polling site was deep cleaned.

According to The Times, music executive Jeff Ayeroff, who founded the organization didn’t get mad at the politicians, he decided to get even. Instead of just lobbying lawmakers to protect the creative expression of his artists, Ayeroff went a major step further by forming a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to boosting voter registration and participation among young people — historically a group less likely to show up at the polls. “I thought it was an invitation to the powers that be to address a disengaged generation on their own terms,” said Judy McGrath creative vice president of MTV at the time. “We were inviting them in and we were going to do it the way we did everything — with spirit and fun and creativity and music. Who the hell knew if it was going to really have an impact?” In 2018, the Washington-based organization helped facilitate 8 million voter registrations, according to its annual report. Turnout among voters under 30 for the midterm elections that year was the highest in 25 years. A lot has changed in those 30 years and Rock the Vote has adapted. “The organization has had to continuously adapt to stay relevant,” Rock the Vote Executive Director Carolyn DeWitt told The Times. “When Rock the Vote was founded you could make a PSA and it would reach 90% of young people. Fast-forward to today, you have the internet, you have apps, you have text messaging. There are just so many more platforms that both distract people and also provide an opportunity to reach them.”</span></p>

For the ninth time, observers affiliated with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have come to the United States to watch over an election and recommend improvements. According to The Washington Post, this year is different for the international observers. “This is one of the most important elections we have ever observed as the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly,” said Roberto Montella, secretary general of the group, which will dispatch 59 lawmakers and a staff of 16 to monitor voting in 10 states and Washington, D.C. “One of the reasons is that this is the first time in my recollection that the incumbent cries foul before the competition actually takes place and before the outcome is known,” Montella added. OSCE officials note that no election anywhere is perfect, and many nations are undergoing a period of strident political divisiveness. But rarely have so many questions arisen about the validity of American elections, which are often held out as the epitome of fair and free voting. The OSCE observer groups will coordinate their efforts and announce their preliminary findings the day after the election, then issue a complete report two months later.</span></p>

Voters will still be able to visit her gravesite on Election Day, but they will no longer be able to leave their “I Voted” stickers directly on the tombstone. According to Patricia Corcoran, president of Friends of Mount Hope Cemetery this spring, amid a restoration project, it became clear that the fragile marble marker had sustained damage from a combination of adhesive residue and the solvents and methods needed to remove it. The Friends group had clear plastic sleeves made for Anthony’s headstone and that of her sister, Mary S. Anthony, for use during election season, and people can put their &#8220;I Voted&#8221; stickers on the sleeves. Visitors also will be able to place &#8220;I Voted&#8221; stickers on an oversized thank-you card to Anthony at the gravesite. As many as 12,000 people visited the gravesite during the 2016 election cycle.</span></p>

The OIG credited CISA for making progress in helping election officials mitigate cyberthreats, but also concluded the agency hadn’t invested enough resources in countering physical threats to election infrastructure. CISA officials say they’ve accounted for those threats in their preparation. Multiple federal agencies, including the FBI, also are working with state officials to guard against cyber and physical threats to the election. “While the OIG [office of the inspector general] recognizes our extensive coordination effort, releasing this report before Election Day fails to account for CISA’s actions throughout the entirety of the actual 2020 election cycle,” CISA Director Chris Krebs said in a statement. “While we can certainly update plans, use more resources, and coordinate better with partners, I am confident that the work we have done to protect the 2020 election means your vote is secure and you should vote with confidence,” Krebs added. The IG report suggested CISA improve the data sharing it does with DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, pointing out that CISA does not have authority to declassify threat data. Krebs said that his agency has been working more closely with DHS’s intelligence office in the last year. Krebs said responding to the IG report pulled his staff away from some election security tasks: “We think, and as the report reflects, our partners agree our time was better spent working with them.”</span></p>

Current law allows victims of domestic violence who obtain a court order to have their voter registration record sealed from the public. Under a separate section of the law, survivors can also be excused from going to their polling place to vote and get a special ballot if they so choose. No court order is needed to apply for such a ballot. Rozic’s measure would go further by allowing a victim of domestic violence to easily opt-in to voter confidentiality by delivering a signed written statement to their local board of elections swearing or affirming that “because of the threat of physical or emotional harm to themself or to family or household members, they wish for their registration record to be kept confidential.” “New York needs to do everything it can to make sure people register to vote &#8212; including breaking down barriers for domestic violence survivors too scared to register because exposing their address puts them in harm’s way,&#8221; Rozic said.</span></p>

Existing state law only allows local election boards to process absentee and mail ballots beginning the day before and the day of Election Day. To avoid a significant delay in reporting election results after the polls close on Election Day, the North Dakota County Auditors Association requested additional time for local election boards to conduct the initial verification and securing of absentee and mail ballots.</span><a href="https://www.governor.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/executive-orders/Executive%20Order%202020-13.1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Executive Order 2020-13.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives absentee ballot counting boards more time to complete their duties as prescribed by law but does not alter the process that must be completed.

Sullivan&#8217;s order largely follows a proposed plan agreed upon by the USPS and those suing the Postal Service, which include the NAACP and the group Vote Forward.

Any prior communication that is inconsistent with this instruction should be disregarded,&#8221; the order continued. The Postal Service declined to comment on the order other than to say that delivering ballots remains its top priority.</span></p>

Soto noted that the tribe waited until just three weeks before Election Day to sue, and he said it had not made a case that any tribal members will be denied the ability to vote without such a site. He also said the tribe has options to help members vote, including taking those without transportation to the nearest site using the tribe&#8217;s fleet of vehicles.</span></p>

State law requires election officials to reject absentee ballots that are missing a voter’s signature or if there’s a mismatch between the signature, address or date of birth on the absentee ballot and the application materials. The group&#8217;s lawsuit said state law regarding absentee ballots disenfranchises voters because they’re not given any notice or chance to cure any deficiencies.</span></p>

The Appeals Court granted a stay of a judge’s order that would have provided a backup copy of voter records in case computers fail on Nov. 3. The panel’s two-page decision didn’t explain its reasoning. One of the judges dissented. Attorneys for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had argued that printing paper backups would have been a “Herculean task” on the weekend before Election Day. “We thank the 11th Circuit for recognizing that, with record turnout and the difficulties of conducting an election during a pandemic, local election officials have enough on their plates without last-minute additions from federal judges,” Raffensperger said Saturday.</span></p>

Both suits were filed in the Michigan Court of Claims. One suit was filed by gun rights activist Thomas Lambert and three nonprofit organizations: Michigan Open Carry Inc., Michigan Gun Owners and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners. The other suit was filed by Robert Davis, a Wayne County activist and serial litigator. Benson’s directive specifically acknowledges those with a license to carry a concealed weapon must continue to follow the law and guidelines that apply to where they&#8217;re allowed to carry. One suit argues that the directive forces Michiganders to choose between two constitutional rights and the other suit argues that Benson&#8217;s directive to local clerks is essentially a new rule she has created under state election law, but the rule was not created in accordance with public notice and other requirements of the state Administrative Procedures Act. Court of Claims Judge Christopher Murray has issued a</span><a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/judge-blocks-secretary-of-states-order-banning-open-carry-of-guns-at-polling-places"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preliminary injunction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that stops the ban on open carry guns at the polls. The Michigan Attorney General says she will take the case to the Court of Appeals in this statement: &#8220;We intend to immediately appeal the judge’s decision as this issue is of significant public interest and importance to our election process.&#8221; Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/10/this-is-a-voting-right-case-michigan-officials-appeal-court-ruling-allowing-guns-at-polls.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have appealed the decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking an expedited relief request. n the brief, they argued that the ban on open carry of firearms on Nov. 3 was to protect every Michigander’s right to vote. “Make no mistake. This is a voting rights case,&#8221; reads the opening line of the state’s brief to the Michigan Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Court of Claims declined to issue a preliminary injunction that would have upended</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/10/michigan-court-declines-to-upend-online-absentee-ballot-requests.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online absentee ballot applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a case brought by the Election Integrity Fund and Glen Sitek. The group in a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson argued the online absentee ballot applications impermissibly allowed voters to copy the signature from their driver’s license instead of signing with ink. But the request for a preliminary injunction came too late, ruled Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens, who noted that the request came months after the defendant, the Secretary of State, started publicizing the online system in June. It wasn’t until weeks after the August primary that the lawsuit was filed, she said, and a month after that the Election Integrity Fund requested the preliminary injunction. “Plaintiffs have not given the court a compelling reason why it should exercise its discretion to grant preliminary injunctive relief on the eve of an election, given the delay occasioned in bringing this matter,” Stephens wrote in her opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit is challenging the rules ordered by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for partisan</span><a href="https://www.wnmufm.org/post/lawsuit-challenges-mask-distance-rules-poll-workers#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll challengers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Election Day.  The complaint filed with the Michigan Court of Claims says distancing and face covering directives will make it too difficult for poll challengers to see what’s going on as voters are checked in at voting sites. “They’re concerned, rightfully so, that recent restrictions that were put in place in regard to COVID and poll site safety, are not going to allow election challengers to perform their duties,” Matthew Gronda an attorney representing a Republican state House candidate and an election day volunteer told WNMU. The case has been assigned to Michigan Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephans, who’s been dealing with much of the cyclone of high-stakes litigation with the approach of Election Day next week. On Wednesday the plaintiffs and the state announced in front of Michigan Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens that</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/10/poll-challengers-can-be-within-6-feet-of-michigan-election-workers-state-agrees-to-in-settled-lawsuit.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a deal had been reached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will still require poll challengers and watchers to wear masks, but that they can be closer than 6-ft to voters.</span></p>

The court stayed a district court ruling that would have allowed voters to return their mail ballots in person. Mail-in ballots will need to be returned soon because they must be received by election officials by Election Day in order to count. The ruling comes in a federal lawsuit filed by the Organization for Black Struggle, a St. Louis-based nonprofit, against Missouri&#8217;s mail-in ballot restrictions. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, representing Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, argued in a legal brief that changing the rules for mail-in voting so close to the Nov. 3 election would confuse voters. He noted thousands of Missourians have already received their mail-in ballots, which contain instructions that they must be returned by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled that Missouri’s comparably restrictive</span><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article246673087.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mail-in voting laws aren’t unconstitutional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because mail-in voting isn’t a fundamental right in the state. The lawsuit, brought by the Washington, D.C.-based American Women organization and three St. Louis County plaintiffs, challenged a number of election laws that advocates say make voting in the state too inaccessible — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lawsuit challenged Missouri’s practice of rejecting any ballot received by local election authorities after the polls close on Election Day, the requirement that all mail-in ballots and some absentee ballots be notarized and that all mail-in ballots be returned through the postal service. “Restrictions placed on mail-in balloting do not violate the fundamental right to vote because mail-in balloting is not a fundamental right under the Missouri Constitution,” Circuit Judge Daniel Green wrote in his decision. “The authority to allow one to vote not in person and not on Election Day is commended to the legislature in our constitution.”</span></p>

Wilson made the ruling hours after the lawsuit was filed by the Nevada Republican Party and the campaign for President Donald Trump&#8217;s re-election, according to the Las Vegas Sun.

Plaintiffs, including many elected officials, argued that the need to use a ferry to get to vote early in person would be a severe hardship to many elderly and/or infirm Islanders. “The court failed to appreciate the unique challenges faced by Island voters separated from early voting by a body of water that can only be traversed by ferry,” Town Information Officer Det.

But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled earlier this week that ballots could be accepted through Nov. 12, under a policy adopted by the board of elections. The board said concerns about the speed of delivery by the U.S. Postal Service prompted the change. Republican leaders of the state House and Senate sued seeking to force the board to follow the date set by law. “The question now before the U.S. Supreme Court is whether an unelected state panel should be able to change election laws after voting has already started,” Senate Leader Phil Berger said in a news release. “Multiple judges in multiple jurisdictions have already said no, and this case was thrown into further chaos by the shocking behavior of one appeals judge who thwarted the Fourth Circuit’s favorable ruling before they could publish the opinion.” The appeal comes as nearly 700,000 North Carolinians had already cast mailed-in ballots and nearly 1.8 million people had voted early in person. On Wednesday night, the</span><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/10/court-wont-block-extended-deadline-for-north-carolina-mail-in-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Supreme Court rejected the reques</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">t. With three justices dissenting, the court left in place an extension of the deadline for the receipt of mail-in ballots to nine days after the election. The justices turned down the requests without explanation, leaving the extended deadline in place. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch indicated that they would have blocked the extension of the deadline.</span></p>

Philip Randolph Institute of Ohio filed a brief notice that dropped all claims against Secretary of State Frank LaRose in U.S. District Court in Cleveland with regard to the suit they had filed over</span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/politics/2020/10/voting-rights-groups-end-federal-fight-over-drop-boxes-in-ohios-presidential-election.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The filing marked the end of a contentious issue that lasted six weeks and bounced between a federal judge in Cleveland and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in LaRose’s favor earlier this month and limited the number of drop boxes across the state. “We believe the appeals&#8217; decision was wrong, but we didn’t have any other options,” said Jon Greenbaum, an attorney representing the organizations. &#8220;We weren’t going to make it better by appealing that decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 5-1 ruling, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Secretary of State Frank LaRose was justified in</span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/10/ohio-supreme-court-rules-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-was-justified-in-rejecting-elections-board-nominee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rejecting a Democratic appointment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Ashtabula County Board of Elections for alleged election misconduct. The ruling means county Democrats must now act quickly to put forward a new nominee to fill the open seat by next Tuesday’s general election. Republicans have held a 2-1 majority on the county elections board, rather than the usual 2-2 split between Republicans and Democrats. La Rose had argued that appointee Ashtabula County Democratic Party Chair Eli Kalil “would not be a competent member” of the elections board because Kalil was investigated in 2016 for allegedly altering the dates on voter registration forms and encouraging a constituent to forge the signature of another person on a voter registration form.</span></p>

Two Republican justices joined five Democratic justices in the decision. “County boards of elections are prohibited from rejecting absentee or mail-in ballots based on signature comparison conducted by county election officials or employees, or as the result of third-party challenges based on signature analysis and comparisons,” the justices wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Pennsylvania appeals court has upheld a decision denying President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign access to</span><a href="https://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/story/news/2020/10/23/trump-campaign-loses-appeal-philadelphia-satellite-election-offices/3743513001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> satellite voter offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Philadelphia. The campaign had sued the Philadelphia Board of Elections, claiming that it should be allowed to have poll watchers at the offices where voters were applying for and casting mail-in ballots. Judge Gary Glazer agreed with city and state elections officials, who argued the offices were not polling places, where watchers are allowed, but extensions of Election Board offices, where they are not. &#8220;Given their scope, timing, and purpose, the satellite offices do not constitute polling places where watchers have a right to be present under the Election Code,&#8221; Glazer wrote. In a short opinion, the three-judge panel said Glazer&#8217;s ruling &#8220;thoroughly discusses, and correctly disposes of, the legal issues before this Court&#8221; and therefore was upheld. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs — including four registered voters from Somerset County and a Republican congressional candidate — asked a federal judge in Pittsburgh to</span><a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/beyond-the-podium/new-lawsuit-targets-pennsylvanias-mail-in-ballot-deadline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> block the deadline extension</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from going into effect. The state Supreme Court last month ordered county election officials to receive and count mailed-in ballots that arrive up to three days after the Nov. 3 election, until Nov. 6, even if they don’t have a clear postmark, as long as there is no proof it was mailed after the polls closed. Thursday&#8217;s lawsuit came 12 days before the election and three days after the U.S. Supreme Court, divided 4-4, rejected a Republican plea making a slightly different argument than Thursday’s lawsuit. The new lawsuit said the court’s deadline extension and the lack of a postmark requirement “will allow for late and otherwise unlawful ballots to be counted.” That is unconstitutionally unfair to in-person voters and exceeded the court’s authority by exercising a power that is constitutionally vested in Congress and the Legislature, it said. The Pennsylvania GOP asked the U.S. Supreme Court to</span><a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/522859-gop-files-second-request-for-supreme-court-to-block-pennsylvania"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fast-track a formal review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a major ruling by the state Supreme Court, which held that mailed ballots sent by Election Day and received up to three days later must be counted. The Luzerne County Board of Elections filed a motion</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/27/928385599/a-newly-sworn-in-justice-barrett-faces-a-motion-to-recuse-herself-in-election-ca"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking to have newly installed Justice Amy Coney Barrett to recuse herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Citing federal ethics laws that require a judge to recuse herself if her impartiality might reasonably be questioned, the elections board contends that the nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court justice right before a presidential election is not only &#8220;unprecedented,&#8221; but &#8220;even more troubling&#8221; is President Trump&#8217;s own statements linking Barrett&#8217;s nomination &#8220;directly to &#8230; his own current re-election,&#8221; should the results of the election be challenged in court. Late on Oct. 29, the</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/28/supreme-court-nov-6-deadline-pennsylvania-mail-ballots-stands/6054492002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Supreme Court refused to fast-track the request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The unsigned order means that for now, ballots received by Nov. 6 will be counted. But ballots received after polls close on Tuesday will be segregated from those received earlier, and if the state turns out to be pivotal, the high court could consider the state GOP&#8217;s challenge after the election.</span></p>

Gergel said any county election boards that wish to employ signature matching techniques going forward must first seek and receive permission from the court and provide voters an opportunity to correct any perceived signature mismatch issues before discounting their votes. The ruling applies only to voter signature mismatches. The court order comes a day after the South Carolina Election Commission directed all counties to immediately stop using signature matching procedures for absentee ballots after learning that at least 10 counties had been employing or planning to employ the practice to reject otherwise legitimate ballots.</span></p>

The state does offer paths to voting restoration after felony convictions, but because the plaintiffs&#8217; were convicted out of state, they found that even though they had completed most of the process, they were unable to fully become re-eligible to vote. &#8220;Until the Plaintiffs meet the same requirements as Tennessee felons seeking reinstatement of their right to vote, Tennessee law does not require that Tennessee reach the same result as Virginia’s Governor or North Carolina’s Legislature — nor does the Tennessee Constitution,&#8221; Lyle wrote. &#8220;Because Tennessee is constitutionally permitted to legislate different standards than other states for restoration of the right to vote and Plaintiffs do not allege that they meet these standards, their challenges necessarily fail.&#8221;</span></p>

The court rejected the challenge without an order or opinion, though Justice John Devine dissented from the decision. The justices had already ruled against another challenge to expanded voting access this month because they said the lawsuit was filed too late, noting that altering voting procedures during an election could cause voter confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals has ruled that voters who get sick shortly before Election Day and can&#8217;t go to the polls will still need a</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/23/texas-emergency-absentee-ballots-doctors-note/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doctor’s note</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before they can get an emergency absentee ballot. The ruling, overriding a state district court order, said implementing the lower court&#8217;s ruling &#8220;would change the longstanding requirements governing late mail-in ballots and risk voter confusion.&#8221; The case will still be reviewed further after the election. Voting rights group MOVE Texas will not appeal the temporary ruling further. Instead, as a fallback, the group has established a free telehealth service with volunteer physicians to provide the necessary documentation for sick voters seeking absentee ballots</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">District Judge Amos Mazzant denied a group’s request for a temporary restraining order preventing Dallas, Harris, Hays and Hopkins counties from accepting</span><a href="https://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/news/us-district-court-denies-attempt-stop-elections-grant"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $25 million in grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Center for Tech and Civic Life saying the group will not be injured if more people vote because of the private election funding. “That is not a harm. That is democracy,” he said. The case is still open according to the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas and Judge Ruben Becerra. “It is an active lawsuit until I am told otherwise,” Becerra said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state appeals court on Friday upheld a Travis County State district court order allowing Texas counties to have multiple</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/23/texas-mail-in-ballot-drop-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drop-off locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for hand delivery of absentee ballots, undercutting Gov. Greg Abbott&#8217;s recent directive limiting counties to one drop-off site. But the intermediate court&#8217;s decision will not yet lead to the reopening of ballot drop-off locations that were shut down in Harris and Travis counties after Abbott&#8217;s order. Abbott and Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs immediately appealed the ruling to the Texas Supreme Court, which at least temporarily blocked the order from taking effect Saturday morning. On Tuesday the state</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/27/texas-voting-elections-mail-in-drop-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Supreme Court upheld</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Abbott’s order. In their opinion, the justices wrote that Abbott&#8217;s order &#8220;provides Texas voters more ways to vote in the November 3 election than does the Election Code. It does not disenfranchise anyone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP candidates and a Republican member of the Texas House filed suit asking the state Supreme Court to void ballots cast at Harris county</span><a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20201028/new-challenge-seeks-to-void-thousands-of-harris-county-drive-thru-votes"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drive-thru vote sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That could put more than 100,000 ballots at risk, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats and raising fears among voters, including those with disabilities and others who were directed into drive-thru lanes as a faster method of voting. The new petition asks the all-Republican Supreme Court to confiscate memory cards from voting machines at drive-thru locations and reject any votes cast in violation of state election laws. The petition argues that drive-thru voting is an illegal expansion of curbside voting, which state law reserves for voters who submit a sworn application saying they have an illness or disability that could put them at risk if forced to enter a polling place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A three-judge appellate panel stopped, at least for now, a district judge&#8217;s Tuesday ruling that invalidated an exemption for polling places included in Gov. Greg Abbott&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/28/texas-voting-mask-abbott/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statewide mask mandate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The panel granted what&#8217;s known as an administrative stay, which only stops the ruling from taking effect while the court considers whether it will issue an order to nullify it during the entire appeals process. In his temporary ruling issued Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Jason Pulliam said the exemption “creates a discriminatory burden on Black and Latino voters.” Abbott and Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs immediately sought an appeal at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the administrative stay Wednesday evening</span></p>

Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos sent Kavanaugh a letter requesting the change after Kavanaugh incorrectly opined that Vermont had made no changes to its election procedures due to the pandemic. Condos pointed out in his letter that the state had in fact made changes including sending mail-in ballots to every registered voter and also counting votes earlier than in previous years. Late Wednesday, without comment or explanation, Kavanaugh issued a revised opinion, changing the phrase &#8220;ordinary election rules&#8221; to &#8220;ordinary election-deadline rules.&#8221;</span></p>

Court documents say these records were requested so that the DPVA could notify and assist registered Virginia voters in Richmond with fixing any material errors and omissions in their ballots before the election so their ballots are counted. Seventeen days after the request was made by the plaintiff, the complaint says the General Registrar denied the plaintiff had any responsive records and produced limited information, which she characterized as “inaccurate.” The lawsuit says the plaintiff seeks a temporary injunction and ‘writ of mandamus’ to prevent irreparable harm to herself, the DPVA and the Richmond voters who tried to vote absentee for the upcoming election. A hearing scheduled was pushed after the Richmond Registrar provided a partial list and sources now say the two parties are working to negotiate an agreement, with the Virginia Democrats asking for daily updates on absentee issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Virginia, Frederick Circuit Court, Judge William Warner Eldridge IV ruled that absentee</span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/42832726/judge-virginia-cant-count-ballots-with-missing-postmarks"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballots without postmarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will not be counted if the barcode does not indicate whether the ballot was mailed by Election Day. He ruled that if the postmark on a ballot is illegible, the ballot can still be counted if the voter signed the ballot by Election Day. The Public Interest Legal Foundation sued the Virginia Department of Elections and members of the Virginia State Board of Elections earlier this month, challenging a regulation that instructed local election officials to count absentee ballots with missing or illegible postmarks — as long as the ballots are received by noon on the Friday after Election Day, Nov. 3. The lawsuit alleged that the regulation violates a 2020 state election law that says absentee ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 and received by Nov. 6 will be counted.</span></p>

The justices determined the courts shouldn&#8217;t be the ones to decide the election rules amid the coronavirus pandemic that is surging in Wisconsin and across the world. &#8220;The Constitution provides that state legislatures — not federal judges, not state judges, not state governors, not other state officials — bear primary responsibility for setting election rules,&#8221; Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan gave that notion short shrift, noting Wisconsin&#8217;s Republican-run Legislature hasn&#8217;t met since April. Extending the deadline for absentee ballots should have been allowed, she wrote. &#8220;On the scales of both constitutional justice and electoral accuracy, protecting the right to vote in a health crisis outweighs conforming to a deadline created in safer days,&#8221; Kagan wrote.</span></p>

White wrote he wasn’t ruling on the merits of the lawsuit but had to determine whether the lawsuit presented an issue on which he could rule. He said none exists because there is no controversy between the voter group and the Board of Canvassers. “The defendants have not taken any action in opposition to the plaintiffs,” White wrote. “No brief opposing the plaintiffs’ motion was filed. No argument contrary to the plaintiffs’ argument was provided.”</span></p>
