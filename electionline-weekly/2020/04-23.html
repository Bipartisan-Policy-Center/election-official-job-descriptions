														<p><strong>What are costs of voting by mail?</strong><br />
<em>The costs are as varied as the process</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5380" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The next time you fly, whenever that may eventually be, if you ask everyone on the flight how much they paid for their ticket, you’ll get a different answer from just about every passenger.</p>
<p>The same can be said for how much it costs to conduct an election entirely or mostly by mail. It’s a bit different for every jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Election costs are traditionally difficult to gather given the dispersed nature of funding sources — federal dollars, state reimbursements, fees for services, general funds, etc.— as well as the functions across different governmental agencies (in some states).</p>
<p>Another obstacle is the way we talk about elections. The same term is used to describe different things (IE “early voting”) so it isn’t as easy as simply comparing election office budgets.</p>
<p>“However, if we break it down to the bare materials and functions—those specific to the policy being analyzed, we can get a semblance of understanding of baseline costs,” said Tammy Patrick senior advisor, Elections at the <a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Patrick noted, the answer sought needs to be specified in order to ask the correct question. For instance, there is a difference between “what does it cost to conduct an all-mail election” and “what costs are specific to an all-mail election”?</p>
<p>As more and more jurisdictions ramp up their absentee/vote-by-mail capabilities for still-to-come primaries and of course November, we wanted to take a look at what officials can expect the final bill to look like, where they can cut financial corners and where they shouldn’t.</p>
<p>So before we get into cost cutting measures, just how much should it cost — generally.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Auburn University and <a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">The Election Center</a> released the findings of the Investing in Elections project that surveyed Election Center members about office operations, methods of election and resources.</p>
<p>“The differences between budget, lead staff salaries, and cost per registered voter between mail ballot jurisdictions and all other jurisdictions in our sample are statistically significant. The budget and cost per registered voter figures are significantly greater in the mail ballot only jurisdictions,” wrote brief authors <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/polisci/directory/professorial-faculty/kathleen-hale/">Kathleen Hale</a> and <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/polisci/directory/professorial-faculty/mitchell-brown/">Mitchell Brown</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5381" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM2-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>“On balance, these data indicate that the jurisdictions in our sample using mail ballot only methods are operating in environments with larger budgets overall. This suggests that jurisdictions that are not currently all mail ballot jurisdictions are at a comparative resource disadvantage to those that do. This has implications for resource outlays in legislative and administrative decision-making for moving to an all vote-by-mail model,” the authors wrote.</p>
<p>In the Vote at Home <a href="https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAHScale_StrategyPlan.pdf">Scale Plan</a>, the <a href="https://www.voteathome.org/">National Vote at Home Institute</a> estimated that it would cost a state like Michigan, $37,850,00 to implement a centralized plan and includes all that is needed to mail every voter a ballot, the operational costs to process them, and infrastructure updates.</p>
<p>The Brennan Center has also released a report on the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures">Estimated Costs of Covid-19 Election Resiliency Measures</a> which focuses on a number of measures to make the November 2020 election safe including expanding absentee/vote-by-mail. In their report Brennan estimates it will cost between $982 million–$1.4 billion nationwide.</p>
<p>“In this moment, everyone is asking what the costs would be in November with scaling up to VBM,” Democracy Fund’s Patrick said. “Here are some of the items to consider as states evaluate their needs for outbound processes:”</p>
<p><em>Ballot application average materials and costs </em></p>
<ul>
<li>$.15 postcard</li>
<li>$.50 postage outbound &amp; return business reply mail</li>
<li>$.10 time stamping &amp; scanning</li>
<li>$.25 application data entry (60 an hour at $15hr average)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ballot packet </em></p>
<ul>
<li>$.30 per ballot card (if jurisdiction using paper ballot at the polls, this cost would be same under either system)</li>
<li>$.15 per envelope (2-3 depending on privacy sleeve requirement)</li>
<li>$.10 per insert</li>
<li>$1.00-$6.00 postage (depending on class of service, mailing preparation, bulk discounts, round trip, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Processing costs vary widely if automated or manual process</em></p>
<ul>
<li>$1.50 automation processing (via vendor support or insertion/sorting equipment)</li>
<li>$15-$20 if entirely manual process</li>
</ul>
<p>“Review existing costs and contracts,” Patrick advised. “Don’t simply scale up existing — adopt best practices so you are scaling solutions rather than previous problems that didn’t come to light due to small volume. There is a cost to business as usual&#8230;”</p>
<p>And even with the most detailed of plans, unexpected costs are going to take you by surprise. It’s the known unknowns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3427" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="224" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" />“The costs that took me a bit by surprise, even with our detailed planning process, was the ‘extra’ costs associated with full integration,” said Neal Kelley, <a href="https://www.ocvote.com/vc/web/">Orange County, California</a> registrar of voters. “There are always hidden costs in integrating systems, but these were pretty large and was frustrating.  If I had to do it all over again I would focus extreme attention on those downstream issues.”</p>
<p>And even for an already large vote-by-mail jurisdiction, the pandemic is changing things. Kelley noted that he’s recently regrouped and increased his extracting capacity by 25% and his scanning capacity by 50% following the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“Election administrators may be surprised how much more it costs to scale up a small absentee ballot program to one where 80-90% of your voters maybe voting by mail,” said Hillary Hall, senior advisor for state and local election officials with National Vote at Home.</p>
<p>Here are some areas that may not be obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper chain of custody procedures for both picking up ballots for processing and internally as ballots make their way through the process</li>
<li>Resources for a call/email center.  With new voting, calls and emails increase dramatically.  That is why using the best to design the original information and using something like Ballot Scout are so important.  Addressing issues on the front end will reduce voters needing to speak with your office.</li>
<li>The cost of voters sending in duplicate requests for ballots</li>
<li>Setting up a system to track your data on the front end.  This will help you see issues as the election progresses and give you data for the next election.  This is especially important if you still have a primary election before the November election. Some examples` of data to collect, processing times each step in ballot processing, staffing, ballots returns</li>
<li>Storage for vote by mail records- need to store envelopes and the ballots, time lines for those</li>
</ul>
<p>Hall said there are some ways officials can cuts costs including staffing levels, polling place consolidation and eliminating the ballot request process. On the staffing front, Hall said ballots take time to process and staffing can be allocated so that it takes place over a few days and without overtime. However it means elections officials need to manage expectations.</p>
<p>“It is important to fill-in campaigns and parties in ahead of time and keep them updated. The first most important update is to communicate how many ballots have been received after the polls close on election day. Interested parties should also know what ballots may still come in (even if this is a guess, postmark vs close of polls impacts this as does deadlines for overseas and military voters),” Hall said. “The last part that must be updated is daily or twice daily updates on how many ballots have been processed and counted and how many still need to be processed.”</p>
<p>Reynaldo Valenzuela Jr., CERA, director of elections <a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/elections/">Maricopa County, Arizona</a> noted that the biggest expense in his county is on staffing.</p>
<p>“Initially before automation to assist us with inserting outgoing early voting mail packets, we were caught off guard on<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5435" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> how tedious a process it is to manually ready an outgoing packet and all of its contents – and do it correctly without error,” Valenzuela said. “The human capital cost was extraordinary and no matter how well you plan, manual inserting is just not possible once you get past a certain volume, and for us that was at over 400,000.”</p>
<p>None of the costs listed here include estimated costs of additional equipment: insertion/sorter machines, extractors, and central tabulation for those who seek to automate themselves. And that’s something officials will need to seriously consider. Valenzuela stressed the importance of automating the process as much as possible also provided <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FOUO-Print-Vendor-Mail-Capacity-V-2.0.pdf">a list of vendors</a> that make it possible to streamline the vote-by-mail process.</p>
<p>Valenzuela also cautioned that figuring out costs for 2020 could be harder to estimate than down the road.</p>
<p>“In the beginning of no-excuse voting it was quite difficult to estimate the number of requests that would come in and every election had differing request volumes based on the type of election. So unique supplies for each cycle were hard to order for,” Valenzuela explained. “However, we quickly grew into a universal set of items that were valid for any election to include making the ballot width (3 column) standard for outgoing and incoming envelopes so they would properly fit versus using 1, 2 or 3 column optical scan ballots. For the most part though, it was a quick set standard operating procedure for supplies and not too many pain points as far as over budgeting.”</p>

Of the absentee ballots requested in the spring election, 1.1 million — about 88% — were returned and counted, while 135,417 ballots were never returned, according to the latest data. Commission Chairman Dean Knudson noted the average absentee ballot return rate is 80 to 85% for state elections. &#8220;My point here is while much has been made of this, we actually had a higher than the historical average percentage of valid return,&#8221; Knudson said according to <em>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</em> But the raw number of unreturned ballots went up because so many more people tried to vote absentee because of the coronavirus pandemic, he said according to the paper. Meanwhile the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>, in partnership with the PBS series Frontline and Columbia Journalism Investigations takes</span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/21/wisconsin-absentee-ballot-crisis-fueled-multiple-failures/5156825002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a deep dive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into what happened with the absentee ballots in the April 7 primary and found, that while officials are pointing most of the blame toward the U.S. Postal service, the mailing of absentee ballots was plagued by “…inadequate computer systems, overwhelmed clerks and misleading ballot information.” The WEC also debated whether or not to investigate the</span><a href="https://fox11online.com/news/coronavirus/election-commission-meets-to-talk-green-bay-in-person-polling"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lack of polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Milwaukee and Green Bay but that failed to move forward after the commission deadlocked on the issue.

Federal assistance is desperately needed to adjust to new realities on the ground. Congress has appropriated $400 million through the CARES Act for emergency election security grants, a critical infusion of cash for election administrators. Will states and local administrators receive the funds in time to use them this fall? How will states use this funding? Will it be enough for elections to administered safely and legitimately? States have various needs spanning from security upgrades to procuring envelopes in anticipation of an influx in mail voting. This week, Bipartisan Policy Center Elections Project Director Matthew Weil lead a</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/e-briefing-marshaling-resources-for-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how the U.S. Election Assistance Commission is working with state and local officials to distribute federal funds and provide key resources to protect America’s voters and voting systems. Weil was joined by EAC Commissioners Ben Hovland and Donald Palmer as well Rob Rock, director of elections for Rhode Island and Michael Winn, director of elections for Harris County, Texas.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Public Opinion</strong>: A new poll from NBC News/The Wall Street Journal finds that while politicians bicker about voting by mail,</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/two-thirds-voters-back-vote-mail-november-2020-n1187976"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2/3 of the public supports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it for the upcoming November general election. A majority of voters — 58 percent — favor nationwide reform of election rules that would allow all eligible voters to cast their ballots by mail. And nearly 10 percent more say that, while the rules should not be permanently changed,</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6843613-200203-NBCWSJ-April-Poll-Publish.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all voters should be able</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to mail in their ballots this November because of concerns that the coronavirus may still be a major public health threat this fall. he survey shows that 58 percent of voters support allowing voting by mail generally, while 39 percent do not support it. When an additional 9 percent of voters who back a one-time exception for November are added, a total of two-thirds — 67 percent — of the electorate supports allowing anyone to vote by mail in this year&#8217;s general election. Just 29 percent disagree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alabama:</strong> The executive committee of the Alabama League of Municipalities has elected to wait until June to decide if the group wants to seek a</span><a href="https://280living.com/news/alabama-league-of-municipalities-delays-vote-on-idea-to-post/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delay in city elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Elections for most municipalities in the state are now scheduled for Aug. 25.</span></p>

For the April 7 municipal election in Glendale,</span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/21/glendale-election-coronavirus-michael-dunafon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only 16 of the county’s roughly 5,000 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cast a ballot. “I had 13 people request absentee ballots prior to the election and we had three actual voters come in. So that’s the 16,” said City Clerk Veronica Marvin, according to The Denver Post. Marvin said she ordered 500 ballots for the in-person polling place election. Another 16 were mailed to military members and overseas citizens, but not returned. Marvin says her city did what it could to let voters know about the April 7 election and allow them to vote under such unusual circumstances. “We tried to get voters in here,” she said, “but I understand.”</span></p>

Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said he had to reverse a previous statement that the state government would pay for the return postage of the absentee ballots, because some counties had not attached postage to the materials for absentee ballots. To address the concern that some voters will not receive return postage, Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said voters can bring their return envelopes with their ballots to any participating Albertsons or Safeway to get a stamp for their ballot.</span></p>

Kamala Harris (D-California) has introduced the</span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/kamala-harris-coronavirus-election-bill-984898/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VoteSafe Act of 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $5 billion piece of legislation that would satisfy what voting experts and advocates estimate states need to enact necessary reforms. Working closely with various secretaries of state, Harris crafted a bill that would standardize early in-person voting periods, mandating that each state have at least a 20-day period ahead of the November 3rd general election. It would also require states to permit no-excuse mail-in absentee voting for this election, allowing any citizen to submit such a ballot, regardless of explanation. The bill would also maintain minimum due process protections for each voter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> The Kern County Board of Supervisors</span><a href="https://www.bakersfield.com/news/kern-supervisors-reject-prospect-of-all-mail-election-in-november/article_01bb554e-8407-11ea-9c06-87421efcceed.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rejected a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have provided all voters with mail-in ballots for November’s election. Kern County Clerk Mary Bedard brought the recommendation forward. “This is simply giving people options, that’s all this is,” Bedard told supervisors, adding that satellite elections offices would be set up to allow limited in-person voting. “It’s recommending that the people be given options and the counties be given options.” About 72 percent of Kern County voters already vote by mail,</span></p>

Originally, the plan would have allowed absentee ballots for those 60 or older, those subject to a stay-at-home order, those unable to appear in public due to concern of exposure or transmission of COVID-19, or those caring for a child or grandchild whose school or child care provider is closed because of the virus. According to The Advocate, all those reasons are now gone, according to a revised plan submitted by Ardoin’s office. The remaining reasons people would be able to access a mail-in ballot, according to the plan, include those at higher risk because of serious medical conditions, those subject to a “medically necessary quarantine or isolation order,” those advised by a health provider to self-quarantine, those experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a medical diagnosis, or those caring for someone who is subject to a quarantine order and has been advised to self-quarantine. The new plan</span><a href="https://www.ktbs.com/news/reworked-louisiana-elections-plan-crosses-legislative-hurdle/article_71116744-b625-590d-8822-a76f84c59106.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from two key state House and Senate committees this week</span></p>

Galvin said he is crafting a</span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/21/nation/mass-secretary-state-crafting-vote-by-mail-package-cautions-against-mailing-every-voter-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislative package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow early voting by mail before September’s primary election and expand the window people could send in ballots before November’s general election Galvin said he’s finalizing details of the proposal, with the goal of releasing it in May to allow time for it to gain legislative approval. Galvin said  he believes any changes should still keep open in-person voting on Sept. 1, the state primary, and Nov. 3, the general presidential election, to allow voters “maximum options” for casting a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: State Sen. Tim Kennedy (D-Buffalo) introduced new legislation which would require the state Board of Elections to</span><a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/new-legislation-would-send-all-new-yorkers-absentee-ballots"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> send absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all New Yorkers. According to the legislation, the Boards of Elections would be required to mail absentee ballots no later than 30 days before any election scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utah:</strong> The Utah Legislature voted during a special session last week to run an upcoming primary election</span><a href="https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2020/04/17/apc-utah-lawmakers-vote-to-temporarily-eliminate-polling-places-conduct-primaries-entirely-by-mail/#.Xp32b5p7mRY"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entirely by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and temporarily do away with traditional polling places. The bill would automatically repeal on Aug. 1, so in-person voting can return for the general election in November. The bill would also suspend in-person early voting and same-day voter registration and give staffers more time to count ballots to ensure they are safe.</span></p>

Under Northam’s plan, absentee ballots that already have been cast would have been destroyed, and people would have to vote again in November. Elected officials’ with terms expiring June 30 would have seen those terms extended. The House of Delegates narrowly approved Northam’s recommendation 47-45, but the Senate declined to take up the proposal.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> A group of voting rights organizations is suing Florida again over its</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242158066.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing that not enough was done during the March 17 primary to allow registered voters to safely cast a ballot. In the amended complaint, the groups are asking in part for the state to supplement voter registration outreach efforts, expand mail voting deadlines and make other in-person voting options available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag.jpg 799w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Georgia:</strong> An election integrity group and five voters have filed suit seeking emergency changes to the state’s</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/federal-lawsuit-demands-health-protections-for-georgia-primary-voters/FTsQWgIBWQz1rgsPADhsxI/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> June 9 primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including another postponement and a switch to hand-marked paper ballots. The suit alleges that the state’s new touchscreens could spread the coronavirus. A judge should delay Georgia’s primary by three weeks, abandon touchscreens, allow curbside voting, create mobile “pop up” early-voting locations, permit vote centers on election day and provide protective equipment to poll workers, the lawsuit said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Iowa:</strong> Former state Sen. Rick Bertrand filed a lawsuit against Woodbury County Auditor Pat Gill&#8217;s plans to offer limited in-person voting options for June&#8217;s primary and a July special supervisor&#8217;s election. Bertrand claims it will</span><a href="https://siouxlandnews.com/news/local/former-state-senator-files-lawsuit-over-upcoming-elections-citing-voter-suppression"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suppress voter turnout by white male Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they&#8217;re least likely to use absentee ballots or other vote-by-mail options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5223" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maine-Flag-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maine-Flag-300x211.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maine-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Maine:</strong> The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting has filed suit Kennebec County Superior Court against Secretary of State Matt Dunlap, alleging  that the people’s veto process does not apply to the new</span><a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/04/16/politics/ranked-choice-voting-backers-file-suit-seeking-to-block-republican-peoples-veto-effort/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked-choice voting law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the law is already in effect. The lawsuit alleges that Dunlap’s office misinterpreted Maine law when allowing the people’s veto process to move forward. Although the ranked-choice law was not codified until January, laws not signed by the governor “have the same force and effect” as if the governor had signed them in the same timeframe that the Legislature passed them, the suit states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> In a lawsuit filed last week, plaintiffs led by the ACLU of Missouri asked a judge to declare that state law allowing someone to</span><a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/19/aclu-sues-missouri-expand-absentee-voting-amid-pandemic/5156018002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote absentee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to “incapacity or confinement due to illness” applies to people sheltering in place. Currently, it’s not clear that’s the case, creating confusion with municipal contests all over the state set for June 2. Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican and the state’s top elections official, has declined to clarify the issue, saying it’s not his place.</span></p>

The suit seeks mail ballots for all registered voters, not just those with active status, an increase in the number of in-person voting centers to reflect the population and geography size of each county and to bar enforcement of the state’s voter assistance ban and ballot rejection rules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: A coalition of advocacy groups, including the American Council for the Blind, the National Center on Independent Living and the New York Association on Independent Living, have filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice arguing that the state’s absentee voting rules</span><a href="https://thefulcrum.us/voting/absentee-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discriminate against the blind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The complaint argues that requiring voters to use paper ballots is discriminatory because that prevents blind people from voting &#8220;privately and independently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The Pennsylvania Alliance for Retired Americans has filed suit against the state in an effort to</span><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/democratic-lawsuit-pennsylvania-voting-by-mail-2020-20200422.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make vote by mail easier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic. The suit seeks to require prepaid postage for all absentee and mail-in ballots; allow mail-in ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day and received up to seven days later, rather than received by Election Day, as under existing law; allow third parties to collect and return absentee or mail-in ballots; and uniform standard for verifying signatures on mail-in ballots, and to allow voters an opportunity to correct signature questions that might lead to their ballots being rejected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of South Carolina, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a federal lawsuit in Columbia over &#8220;South Carolina’s failure to take action to ensure all eligible voters can vote by mail during the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221; for the June 9 statewide primary, according to a statement from ACLU. The groups are challenging a state requirement that forces people who vote absentee to have a</span><a href="https://wpde.com/news/coronavirus/aclu-naacp-files-federal-lawsuit-for-putting-voters-at-risk-during-covid-19-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third-party witness signature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their ballot envelope, as well as an “&#8217;excuse&#8217; requirement that fails to provide an accommodation to allow all eligible voters to vote absentee during the pandemic,&#8221; ACLU officials said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union and League of Women Voters filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Lynchburg asking the court to stop Virginia from enforcing the requirement during the pandemic and to have localities count &#8220;otherwise validly cast absentee ballots that are missing a</span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/special-report/coronavirus/update-lawsuit-seeks-to-stop-virginia-from-enforcing-witness-requirement-for-absentee-voting-during-pandemic/article_67dbe141-da92-504b-b74d-e7c9ed8a118c.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> witness signature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Virginia’s primary and general elections in 2020.&#8221;</span></p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0 Comment Period</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</span></p>
