														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Some good news”</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 newsmakers from 2020</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say it takes a village to raise a child, but any election official will tell you that it takes a small army to run an election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of those involved tend to toil away in obscurity (or at least they hope they do) but this year with the media and the nation laser-focused on the election officials and advocates found themselves constantly in the spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a look at 12 people that made elections-related headlines this year for their work to provide a safe and secure election that saw the largest turnout in more than a generation. There are certainly some headline-grabbing folks not listed here (hello Louis DeJoy), because in the same vein as John Krasinski, we’ve chosen to focus on “some good news.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6335" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stacey-Abrams-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stacey-Abrams-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stacey-Abrams-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stacey-Abrams.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Stacey Abrams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The fact that America has been talking about Georgia since Election Day can, in large part, be attributed to the work done by Stacey Abrams and her voting rights organization Fair Fight. “She really put the spotlight on Georgia, convinced the people that needed to be convinced that there was room here, that there were voters here, and that this place really was competitive if people would just put in the time, the money and the effort in to do that,” State Sen. Jen Jordan told The New York Times. In the months before the election Amazon released a documentary All In: The Fight for Democracy about the voting issues Abrams faced in her 2018 run for governor in Georgia as well as the broader fight for voting rights. &#8220;We should not live in a nation where your access to democracy depends on your celebrity, your wealth, or your ZIP code,&#8221; Abrams said in an interview with NPR.</span></p>

From her active presence on social media to her willingness to take on the president and his allies over the integrity of the election in Michigan and nationwide, Benson has been front and center for much of 2020.</span></p>

In San Antonia, Texas, Sara Muiz voted curbside on her 106th birthday. Ruth Rosner, 104 lost her father in the 1918 pandemic but the 2020 pandemic wasn’t going to stop her from voting, in-person in New York. C.B. Stewart, 101, of Somerset, Kentucky was born during the Spanish flu and has only missed one election—while he was serving in the army during World War II. And Gertrude Stackhouse at 102 voted in her very first election ever. Stackhouse’s Fayetteville, North Carolina polling place was located on lands that used to be a field where she picked cotton.</span></p>

Cázares-Kelly is a member of the Tohono O&#8217;odham Nation. Cázares-Kelly told Arizona Public Media that one of the first things she plans on doing in office is restoring the Pascua Yaqui early voting site. Cázares-Kelly.</span></p>

In NC, the qualifications to vote are judged on election day. She passed away from glioblastoma after submitting her ballot but before Nov. 3 #electionintegrity.” “I couldn’t even bring myself to start doing the briefings on the challenges and I couldn’t figure out why,” Knotts told the News &amp; Observer. “Then I opened the folder, saw her name and realized I had been putting it off.” Knotts told the paper this election has been hard on her and her staff. The allegations and suspicion hurt them. “I wanted people to trust the process and know that not just me, but all election administrators, worked hard for this,” Knotts said. “We really want people to have trust in the system.” Knotts’ story took off, especially after she was interviewed by the News &amp; Observer. While Knotts’ story was very specific to her, it certainly encapsulated the integrity with which all local elections officials tackled their jobs this year.</span></p>

He showed the nation what 24-hour voting periods could look like and he moved to expand physical access to the polls. “We tripled the number of early voting centers,&#8221; Hollins said. &#8220;We strengthened our wait-time tools so that voters could choose to vote at a place that was going to be most convenient for them where they could get in and get out, and we ended up with an Election Day where there were essentially zero lines across Harris County.” Hollins was the youngest person to ever hold the office and the first minority to serve in this position. “It’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve in this position and protect the right to vote in Harris County,” Hollins said. “Despite so many court battles, we were able to protect the right to vote.”</span></p>

Krebs became a newsmaker however when he challenged the president’s allegations of voter fraud and was fired from his job via Tweet. An attorney for the president has even threatened Krebs’ life. In an op-ed in The Washington Post Krebs talks about the tireless work of his CISA team and state and local elections officials to make the election secure. “The 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history. This success should be celebrated by all Americans, not undermined in the service of a profoundly un-American goal,” Krebs wrote.</span></p>

The organization raised millions of dollars to help with get out the vote efforts, helped spearhead the movement to get sports venues to serve as polling places and helped recruit thousands of poll workers. “Because of everything that’s going on, people are finally starting to listen to us — we feel like we’re finally getting a foot in the door,” James told The New York Times. “How long is up to us. We don’t know. But we feel like we’re getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference.”</span></p>

McReynolds and her organization published a national mail voting proposal which laid out all the different paths state election administrators could take for a vote-by-mail election. She was interviewed by every media format, spoke on countless Zoom conferences and consulted with dozens of elections officials. “We know what the solution is,” McReynolds told Time Magazine in a lengthy profile. “It’s just a matter of shifting the giant Titanic that is election administration. And really, it’s 50 Titanics because it’s all run differently in every state.”</span></p>

He’s been berated by the president and he and his family have received threats. Through it all he has stood by the integrity of the process in Georgia. In an op-ed for USA Today he wrote: By all accounts, Georgia had a wildly successful and smooth election. We finally defeated voting lines and put behind us Fulton County’s now notorious reputation for</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/virus-lack-preperation-lead-fulton-county-election-disaster/X61R25rc0cDXjCZkTz1ePO/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disastrous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections.

She started “Ride to the Polls” in early October, hoping to empower Native American youth to vote in the 2020 election while connecting with their cultural heritage. She lead groups on horseback along a 10-mile route from Church Rock in Navajo County to the polling stations in Kayenta, Ariz. “Our Indigenous children across the country are feeling the urge to connect with our culture more than ever,” Young says. “We thought this was a great way for them to feel inspired and motivated to vote in honor of our ancestors who rode longer miles to make their voices heard by voting at the polls.”</span></p>

Zuckerberg and Chan initially donated $300 million in September and followed up with an additional $100 million closer to the election. “Due to the unprecedented challenges COVID-19 will have on voting across the county, election officials are working around the clock to make sure that every voter has the ability to participate safely and have their vote county, Chan and Zuckerberg said in a statement. “Many counties and states are strapped financially and working to determine how to staff and fund operations that will allow for ballots to be cast and counted in a timely way. These donations will help to provide local and state officials across the country with the resources, training and infrastructure necessary to ensure that every voter who intends to cast a ballot is able to, and ultimately, the preserve the integrity of our elections.” The donations of course weren’t welcomed by open arms from everyone and several lawsuits were filed to stop certain counties from accepting the funding.

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>Protecting election workers is critical to securing to our elections</strong></p>
<p>By David Levine</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much has been reported about the security of the 2020 election, there is one critical area many news reports are missing—the security and protection of the people carrying out the election, and that has fallen woefully short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing elections is about more than protecting the physical security and cybersecurity of the systems and assets that support elections. It is also about protecting the people who secure these systems, including state and local election officials, information technology staff, temporary staff such as poll workers, and vendor support staff. The U.S. appears to have done an</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> admirable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> job protecting the former during the 2020 cycle, but on the latter, there is still much room for improvement. From exposure to the coronavirus to armed protesters demanding access to people tabulating votes, those conducting our elections have faced an onslaught of threats.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">                          </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials  have unique training, knowledge, and skills, and their offices are often under-resourced and understaffed. As a result, their absence can significantly hinder our country’s ability to successfully protect elections from bad actors, including foreign adversaries. Yet, there have been numerous instances during the 2020 election cycle where election workers have been unnecessarily exposed, and in at least one case,</span><a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2020/04/29/fulton-county-elections-employee-dies-of-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fatally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news cycle this year has been dominated by the coronavirus—an ailment that has not spared election workers. In April, an employee from Fulton County, Georgia’s elections office</span><a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2020/04/29/fulton-county-elections-employee-dies-of-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from COVID-19., And a couple of weeks ago, the Virginia State Board of Elections</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/virginia-delays-statewide-certification-of-election-results-citing-richmond-offices-covid-outbreak/article_41c9d5ec-43c6-5cbe-b096-d96ab0442f7f.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delayed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certification of Virginia’s election results to provide additional time to the Richmond voter registrar’s office, which is dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the obvious health implications, this also has national security implications. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency previously</span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2020/PSA200922"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that foreign actors and cybercriminal could exploit the time required to certify and announce election results by disseminating disinformation of problems intended to convince the public of the election’s illegitimacy. And if critical members of an elections team become ill, that could result in less experienced workers performing tasks they’re not as familiar with, which could lead to more errors and greater susceptibility to intentional and unintentional threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coronavirus weren’t enough for these election workers to manage on top of the painstaking work of administering our country’s elections, election officials have also been subjected to numerous personal threats during the 2020 Election. Following Election Day,</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/threats-to-election-officials-piled-up-as-president-trump-refused-to-concede/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in several closely contested</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/arrests-vote-count-oregon-new-york-f92075a34ce8dd166ff17bbd9bedc49d"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that they were worried about the safety of their workers amid threats and gatherings of protestors—including armed protesters—outside of vote tabulation centers, drawn by baseless claims of widespread fraud. In response, many election offices bolstered their security. While such threats do not appear to have impacted the counting of votes for the 2020 election, there’s no place for such behavior in a democracy society and it’s unclear what long-term effects these actions could have on election administrators, poll workers and/or voters. Retaining top</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/26/782680291/as-2020-approaches-some-experienced-election-officials-head-to-the-exits"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and recruiting sufficient numbers of poll workers in many parts of the country was already a challenge</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2018_EAVS_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 2020 presidential election. Will these trained professionals opt to leave the industry for safer positions or merely retire? We don’t know for certain. However, this isn’t merely a theoretical question. For example, as  of September 2020, more than a</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/mail-ballot-law-pennsylvania-has-driven-out-nearly-quarter-state-n1240504"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dozen counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Pennsylvania had already seen election directors or deputy directors leave within the past year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the viral circulation of false election stories on social media has taken a toll on many election workers. For example, one Georgia poll worker recently had to go into</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-georgia-poll-worker-in-hiding-aa0f256ec21de96fd5a41da703c4b443"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a video was widely shared on Twitter that claimed to show him crumpling up an absentee ballot. In actuality, the poll worker was discarding paper instructions, not a ballot, which would have been much larger than the paper seen in the video. Yet the worker decided to stay with friends because he no longer felt safe at home after social media users harassed him and released his personal information, doxing him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2016, election officials have been given more support and services to tackle physical and cyber threats to their election infrastructure. But our protection can’t stop there. As the United States continues confronting concerted and sophisticated operations aimed at disrupting its elections, let’s be sure that our election workers feel safe too. They are the front-line troops in the battle to secure our elections from adversaries. </span></p>

							<h2>Clearie Awards</h2>
														<p><strong>EAC Clearinghouse 2020 Awards Information</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) invites submissions for its fifth annual national Clearinghouse Awards. The Clearinghouse Awards, also referred to as the “Clearies,” honor the enterprising spirit and hard work of election officials across the country. In the challenging circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis, the Clearies offer the opportunity to recognize the resourcefulness of officials who adjusted their efforts to account for the ever-evolving pandemic. This year, the EAC is also pleased to offer a new category distinguishing cybersecurity and technology initiatives that improve election security of voting systems and strengthen U.S. elections.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC will present awards in the categories of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding Innovations in Elections,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Practices in Recruiting, Retaining, and Training Poll Workers,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative and Original “I Voted” Stickers, and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding Innovation in Election Cybersecurity and Technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurisdictions of all sizes are encouraged to submit their work. Entries must be received by Friday, January 8, 2021. Submissions will be judged on innovation, sustainability, outreach, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and the generation of positive results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 2020 Clearie Awards will help recognize the innovation and hard work of election officials across the nation during an extremely well-run general election with record turnout,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “Election officials did an amazing job this fall as they navigated unprecedented health concerns due to COVID-19, a substantial increase in early and mail or absentee voting, and poll worker shortages. The best practices developed from 2020 will be highly valuable for future elections. The EAC Commissioners look forward to honoring these hard-working public servants who do so much to serve voters and further our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 Clearies will build on the successes of past years, encouraging innovations in election administration and publicizing achievements across the elections community. Under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the EAC is charged with serving as a clearinghouse for election administration information. The Clearies and the efforts they celebrate play an important role in helping the EAC fulfill this mission.</span></p>

According to the AP, Barr specifically singled out one theory peddled by Trump and his allies that vote tabulation machines had been tampered with in a way to skew the election towards President-elect Joe Biden. &#8220;There&#8217;s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven&#8217;t seen anything to substantiate that,&#8221; Barr said.</span></p>

The letter, addressed to Harris County Attorney Vince Ryan on Nov. 25, concludes the appointment of Isabel Longoria as the county’s first election administrator is “unlawful and null and void.” County commissioners met in executive session Tuesday with representatives of the Harris County Attorney&#8217;s Office, then</span><a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/harris-county/2020/12/01/387059/harris-county-leaders-refuse-to-back-down-over-election-administrators-appointment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> declined to take any further action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making a lawsuit all but certain. Commissioner Rodney Ellis, a Democrat, told Houston Public Media he was proud of the work the county had done in advancing what he called necessary election reforms. Ellis said that the previous arrangement of election and voter registrar powers held by elected officials was a relic of the Jim Crow era, and noted that well over 100 Texas counties have already created independent election administrators to take over those duties. &#8220;I think that the general&#8217;s pronouncement that the Harris County Office of Election Administrator does not exist and calling Ms. Longoria&#8217;s appointment void over administrative technicalities is just another blatant attempt to continue that assault on Texas voters,&#8221; Ellis said.</span></p>

Vin Gopal (D-Long Branch) will introduce bills</span><a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/gopal-plans-bills-to-hasten-mail-in-ballot-counts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to quicken New Jersey’s counting of mail-in ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the planned bills would require New Jersey’s State Department to create a grant program to fund improvements for county election boards. That money could go to high-speed ballot counting machines. Gopal’s other bill would create a vote-by-mail task force meant to spot and fix deficiencies in the state’s counting process. “Our main goal is to ensure each county has the technology they need to provide safe, secure, and efficient vote-by-mail counting methods,” Gopal said. “Establishing funding for these counties is a positive step towards making sure each board of elections is well equipped to handle vote-by-mail ballots in the years to come if a voter chooses to use that method.”</span></p>

Those include: Allow ballots to be postmarked up to Election Day and still be counted. Currently, there is a cut-off date several days in advance of the election, after which Oregonians are told to bring ballots to drop boxes or elections offices to ensure that they will be counted. Institute same-day voter registration, which is already in place in nearly two dozen other states. Currently, the cut-off date is 21 days before an election. Pay for more ballot box infrastructure statewide.  Expand its “motor voter” program, which automatically registers voters when they visit the DMV. Under Brown’s proposal, other state agencies would also be able to process voter registrations. </span></p>

Seth Grove, who championed the idea, from releasing a report on the election just hours later. During a meeting of the bipartisan Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, state Rep. Jake Wheatley Jr., an Allegheny County Democrat, called a possible legislative audit a “wasted effort” because the Pennsylvania Department of State is already conducting one. “There are other ways to validate our election result,” he said during the meeting of the committee’s officers as they discussed House Resolution 1100, which was passed last week along mostly party lines. Wheatley, the committee’s treasurer, and committee vice chairman state Sen. Jim Brewster, another Allegheny Democrat, voted against doing an audit while committee chairman state Sen.

Spreading lies and misinformation is irresponsible. Pennsylvanians deserve better from their elected officials.”</span></p>

It’s a simple matter of changing a few words in the Election Code and bring it in line with modern technology.” Beckley’s House Bill 661 appears to do just that, providing that the secretary of state “shall elect to participate in the program each county that uses direct recording electronic voting machines, ballot marking devices or hand-marked scannable paper ballots that are printed and scanned at the polling place or any other type of voting system equipment.”</span></p>

Filed against the state of Alaska and the Alaska Division of Elections, the lawsuit requests that the measure be nullified, that it not be used in future elections, and for “costs, damages, and attorney fees as may be appropriate.” If plaintiffs win, Alaska would keep its existing elections system.</span></p>

But Warner capped at 200 the number of ballots Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her team can examine, arguing the limited sample should be &#8220;enough to let us know if there&#8217;s a red flag&#8221; when he reviews the results at trial Thursday. Ward’s challenge relies on a state law that allows voters to dispute election results if they suspect misconduct by election officials, illegal votes or an inaccurate count. Without evidence, Ward&#8217;s lawsuit questions the signature verification process used to authenticate mail-in ballots, as well as the duplication process election officials use to count ballots that tabulation machines couldn&#8217;t read. </span></p>

Mahoney did not elaborate on her reasoning for throwing out the case at the end of the hearing but said she would issue an order in writing.</span></p>

The lawsuit alleges “widespread ballot fraud,” due in part to Dominion Voting Systems machines used in Maricopa County, which they assert were designed purposely to take votes away from Trump. Attorney Sidney Powell specifically blames that on Eric Coomer, an executive with the company, and “his visceral and public rage against the current U.S. president.” She said it is part of a criminal conspiracy. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, among others, also claims poll watchers were unable to adequately monitor that the signatures on envelopes of mail-in ballots were verified. It refers to “biased and partisan Maricopa County poll referees.”</span></p>

According to Politico, the hearing was held via Zoom and not announced in advance on the court’s docket or accessible to the press or public, but it was transcribed by a court reporter who provided the transcript to POLITICO on Monday evening. The transcript shows that Batten repeatedly wavered on whether to grant any relief to the Republican plaintiffs in the case, before settling on the narrow relief limited to three counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former lawyer for President Donald Trump’s campaign and some supporters filed a lawsuit against the state of Georgia, citing massive election fraud, multiple violations of Georgia laws and multiple constitutional violations, and asking elections officials to</span><a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/politics/trump-lawyers-file-suit-asking-georgia-de-certify-election-declare-trump-winner/I4EONEJXNVAUHKLKRTFGYXGHV4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturn the results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state. The 104-page civil suit was filed on Wednesday, specifically naming Gov. Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and several other state election officials. In the lawsuit, former campaign lawyer Sidney Powell claimed there was widespread voter and ballot fraud, that voting machines were rigged to change votes from Trump to Biden and that ballots were mishandled, among other things. The suit seeks an emergency order instructing the state to decertify the results of the general election and declare Trump the winner in Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting rights groups filed a federal lawsuit this week that accuses the Georgia secretary of state’s office of</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/election/groups-sue-georgia-over-voter-purges/3LXX43F335EMJFTHZFH66JLF3Q/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improperly removing nearly 200,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the state’s voter registration list last year. The lawsuit says the state removed tens of thousands of voters from the list because it believed they had moved away when, in fact, they had not. It also challenges a “use it or lose it” provision in state law that allows Georgia to purge voters who do not cast ballots for many years. That allowed the state to remove tens of thousands more voters, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by the Black Voters Matter Fund, the Transformative Justice Coalition and the Rainbow Push Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samuel Scott has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Chatham County board of elections saying that he was</span><a href="https://www.wsav.com/news/local-news/man-files-civil-rights-lawsuit-against-chatham-county-board-of-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied the right to work as a poll worker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a felony conviction that was overturned. In 1987, Scott was sentenced to life in prison for rape and kidnapping. After 15 years in prison, he was exonerated by DNA evidence and released in 2002. He’s been a legal Georgia voter since 2006. Scott applied to be a poll worker and never received any correspondence from the BOE until his attorneys eventually got a response. “We had to write a letter to them, and ask why he had been turned down, and they wrote us back, simply, that his prior felony conviction stopped him from being a poll worker,” William Claiborne told reporters.  He says the board claimed to have no written policy to back up their denial of Scott. That’s why he and his client want a court to step in. “If you’re going to take the step to deny someone their constitutional or their fundamental rights, then you need to have a very clear policy, and that policy has to pass strict scrutiny,” the attorney said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Republicans — three who would be Electoral College electors for President Donald Trump and three local GOP officials — filed the suit in federal court last week, two days after the Board of State Canvassers certified Biden&#8217;s 154,000-vote victory in Michigan. The suit asks a federal judge to</span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/26/michigan-lawsuit-wants-trump-named-winner-citing-conspiracy-theories/6432005002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturn President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state based on a bevy of conspiracy theories and claims contradicted by election experts. suit relies heavily on speculation and claims that a Wayne County judge previously labeled &#8220;not credible&#8221; in a separate legal action. &#8220;Relief sought is the elimination of the mail ballots from counting in the 2020 election,&#8221; the 75-page suit says. &#8220;Alternatively, the electors for the State of Michigan should be disqualified from counting toward the 2020 election. &#8220;Alternatively, the electors of the State of Michigan should be directed to vote for President Donald Trump.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Supreme Court</span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/11/23/supreme-court-denies-appeal-seeking-audit-wayne-countys-election-results/6401052002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied an appeal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from poll challengers seeking an immediate halt to the certification of Wayne County results, ruling the request should not be reviewed by the high court.  The 6-1 opinion was released Monday, nearly a week after the Wayne County&#8217;s certification was completed and a little more than an hour after the Board of State Canvassers certified the Nov. 3 results of Michigan&#8217;s 83 counties. The certification cemented President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s 154,000 vote victory in Michigan.  The Costantino suit, which originated in Wayne County Circuit Court, was one referenced frequently by President Donald Trump&#8217;s lawyer Rudy Giuliani in a press conference last week as proof of fraud in Michigan&#8217;s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of Black voters in Detroit have announced they are suing President Trump and his campaign, saying the targeted effort to overturn the election repeats one of the “worst abuses in our nation’s history” by</span><a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/group-of-black-voters-suing-president-trump-citing-voting-rights-abuses-disenfranchisement"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attempting to disenfranchise Black voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The lawsuit specifically takes issue with the campaign’s effort to overturn the results of the election in Michigan by blocking the certification of results in Wayne County – home to Detroit – and attempting to “intimidate” and “coerce” state and local officials into replacing electors. “Central to this strategy is disenfranchising voters in predominately Black cities,” the suit alleges. “Repeating false claims of voter fraud, which have been thoroughly debunked, Defendants are pressuring state and local officials in Michigan not to count votes from Wayne County, Michigan (where Detroit is the county seat), and thereby disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump’s campaign has resurrected a Michigan</span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/12/11th-hour-filing-saves-trump-michigan-voter-fraud-lawsuit-from-dismissal.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter fraud lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a new appeal, recycling old allegations of problems at the TCF Center – where Detroit’s absentee ballots were being counted. Trump’s team filed the appeal at 11:21 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 30. The case would have been dismissed if the appropriate paperwork wasn’t filed by midnight, officials said. Michigan Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens ruled against Trump on Nov. 5 in the lawsuit targeting Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Trump’s campaign attempted to appeal later that week, but didn’t submit the correct paperwork. It had 21 more days to fix the “defective” submission to the Michigan Court of Appeals, otherwise the case would be thrown out. One of the handful of reasons Trump’s campaign lost the court battle is because the remedy sought – to stop counting the votes until certain measures could be implemented – wasn’t possible since all votes had already been counted. But Trump’s campaign claims there’s still time to halt the process since the Electoral College doesn’t meet until Dec. 14. “The conduct of the general election in Wayne County was a disaster,” the campaign says in the appeal . “The Wayne County board of county canvassers found that more than seventy-one percent of the precincts did not balance. More than seventy-one percent!”</span></p>

Simon, the ACLU restates its claim that voting is a fundamental right and that the state has not stated a rational reason for denying that right to people who have been released from incarceration. It also makes a claim that it violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>

During the county commission&#8217;s canvassing of the vote, the Clark County registrar said that he could not determine the identified 139 discrepancies in the district.  Those typically are common election errors and therefore, the county could not be certain Miller really won, given the razor-thin margin of victory. Another court hearing is set for Friday, Dec. 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark County District Court Judge Joe Hardy Jr.</span><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/nov/24/judge-rejects-bid-for-re-vote-in-nevada-state-sena/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on procedural grounds, the effort by GOP candidate April Becker to force a re-vote in the race won by incumbent state Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro. Hardy noted that Cannizzaro wasn’t a named party in Becker’s court filing against county Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria over his handling of the election, and that the case is actually a contest-of-election action. County lawmakers signed off on a canvass of the election on Nov. 16, after Gloria reported 936 “discrepancies” had been found among the more than 974,000 votes counted countywide. The registrar said the results in only the closest race — a commission seat — might have been affected.</span></p>

Mendez will rule on how the recount will proceed after another hearing at 1:30 p.m. Monday, he said, in order to give lawyers in the case time to develop their cases on what size sampling they would accept. “I am not inclined to order a hand recount of every ballot at this point,” Mendez said of the more than 143,000 mostly paper ballots cast countywide Nov. 3. With the vast majority of votes cast by mail and provisional ballots, he said it would be overwhelming for the Atlantic County Board of Elections staff and costly for the county to do a hand recount of so many ballots.</span></p>

According to The Associated Press, Republican Claudia Tenney said Monday she had a 13-vote lead over Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Anthony Brindisi after one county adjusted its tabulation. In a letter to the court on Sunday, a lawyer for Brindisi’s campaign told DelConte he learned that Herkimer County had discovered a transcription error that, when fixed, netted Tenney an additional 35 votes and Brindisi an additional 10. In addition to Herkimer County’s error, Madison County also adjusted its vote tally, prompting DelConte on Monday to order all of the counties involved to “preserve and secure” all written and digital records related to vote counting, and not to make any alterations or changes in worksheets, spreadsheets or other tallying records.</span></p>

The legislature had lost the case at trial in late 2019, which had the effect of blocking any voter ID requirements in North Carolina for the 2020 elections. But the Appeals Court ruled that the trial judge was too harsh on the legislature in her ruling last year and didn’t focus enough on what was actually in the new law.

The Court, five Democrats and two Republicans ruled unanimously in an unsigned ruling over the holiday weekend.

Three justices on the Court of Appeals for the Second District of Texas denied Mason’s first appeal in March, although it agreed she did not know she was ineligible to vote. “The fact that she did not know she was legally ineligible to vote was irrelevant to her prosecution,” Justice Wade Birdwell wrote in the court’s opinion. “The State needed only to prove that she voted while knowing of the existence of the condition that made her ineligible.” Now the ACLU will try to take the case — which ACLU legal director Andre Segura called, “one of the most important voting rights cases in modern Texas history” — through the next appeals process. “I’m more energized than ever before and I refuse to be afraid,” Mason, who is from Rendon, said in an ACLU press release. “I thought I was performing my civic duty and followed the election process by filling out a provisional ballot. By trying to criminalize my actions, Texas has shown me the power of my voice. I will use my voice to educate and empower others who are fighting for their right to vote.”</span></p>

The suit filed in Houston federal court says True the Vote claimed it would be filing lawsuits in swing states, collecting complaints and pursuing “sophisticated data modeling and statistical analysis to identify potential illegal or fraudulent balloting.” But Eshelman said he never received any updates about their efforts, despite “regularly and repeatedly” requesting information — instead, he says, he got “vague responses, platitudes, and empty promises.” Eshelman ultimately asked for his money back.</span></p>

Instead, Missouri City voters who live in Harris County can only cast early ballots at one location: the Missouri City Community Center, located at 1522 Texas Parkway. Missouri City voters who live in Fort Bend County, however, can vote at any of the three early-voting locations: the Community Center, the Quail Valley Fund office and Stafford City Hall.  John Oldham, Fort Bend County’s elections administrator, said there was a miscommunication between his office and the city regarding early-voting locations. Oldham added for previous runoff elections involving both Harris and Fort Bend County voters, the county assigns Harris County voters one early-voting location, and this election is no different.</span></p>

The attorney bringing the suit alleges results are &#8220;tainted&#8221; by the illegal use of ballot drop boxes throughout the state. The suit is asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to stop the certification of election results from Nov. 3 that have President-elect Joe Biden ahead of President Donald Trump by just more than 20,000 votes. An injunction is needed, argues Karen Mueller, because the Wisconsin Elections Commission encouraged local elections officials to use drop boxes to collect absentee ballots without having the rulemaking authority to do so. </span></p>
