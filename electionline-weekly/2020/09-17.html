<em>Pilot program provides direct assistance to military and overseas voters</em></p>

<p><em>Rome, Italy</em> – When people think of Italy they think of the food, the wine, the history, the art, and the culture. And since I moved to Rome two years ago, I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of those things. But Italy also has a significant amount of something else – American citizens. According to an estimate from the <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/">Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)</a>, in 2016 there were <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Reports/FVAP-2016-OCPA-FINAL-Report.pdf">more than 70,000 American citizens of voting age in Italy</a>, ranking ninth in the world.</p>
<p>An FVAP pilot program, the Voting Ambassador program launched earlier this year, is designed to provide direct assistance to those citizens as well as members of the military and their families. And this program is not just in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.rome.ambassador"> Italy</a>, it is also being piloted by my colleagues Deana Vranas in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.tokyo.ambassador"> Japan</a> and Kayla Paulson in the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.london.ambassador"> United Kingdom</a>, with even greater numbers of Americans living in those countries.</p>
<p>The goal of the program is exactly what FVAP’s overall mission states, ”to ensure Service members, their eligible family members, and overseas citizens are aware of their right to vote and have the tools and resources to successfully do so &#8211; from anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>The program was planned prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 and like for everyone, this changed plans. But working with partners here, using social media, virtual meetings, and most recently in-person events (following Italian COVID-19 protocols), I have been able to directly reach out to Americans all over Italy including outreach at:</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://sais.jhu.edu/sais-europe"> Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna</a>. Not every university in Italy is hosting student abroad programs this semester, but the Johns Hopkins program is and many of the American students there have recently finished quarantine and are beginning classes.</li>
<li>A virtual event in partnership with the<a href="https://www.americanclubrome.org/"> American International Club of Rome</a>.</li>
<li>A bipartisan event hosted by<a href="https://stjames.it/"> St. James Episcopal Church in Florence</a> where I was invited by the<a href="https://it.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/florence/"> U.S. Consulate General in Florence</a> to jointly share information to Americans attending the event.</li>
<li>Two days of outreach at the<a href="https://home.army.mil/italy/index.php"> U.S. Army Garrison in Vicenza</a>, reaching both members of the military and their families.</li>
<li>Another virtual event in partnership with the<a href="https://it.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/milan/"> U.S. Consulate General in Milan</a> and the<a href="http://aia-fvg.blogspot.com/"> American Corner in Trieste</a>.</li>

<p>My colleagues in London and Tokyo have also been working non-stop to reach out to Americans there, including events – virtual and in person – at<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.london.ambassador/posts/141903164261598?__tn__=-R"> universities</a>, with<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.tokyo.ambassador/videos/331253751642090/?__xts__%5b0%5d=68.ARDB_tDcbS_j7l9L12sTUq8m1afVebGbqiM9mt26dnWxTez9jLpyRcWCg8z8G_sanNqV5zN1XeCUj6W6e_FqOD7bgETwzI-qI06Pt6WFgOXUvrxD6kTczCfFFrUosYr1ZnpyVFxBfA3uTDfGFvgtimAOqQUpIGMyQhoOsx9GdgcwLESeUPtLouR-iH8dxTS2YU2khPOnbQgTHIrFGGcFU8Nph9s0yxb4Tks260-NS5xHQetEXYd1DlAPt6rcs6Tnmek15pUbkrUyrxej4zYVPSyECBBkyndOBJGDzlQrOtmvtl4YpjFpOY3j_wR7yslPc83fBzqZRcYQWn2Y_ZGVhb_yEje_tlpuiX5gT-rB4gfoYg8tOyIzdscNk88jUW4GUVRAkeP3Oi3IySd6eOjfm9IRHIpp81Zby_MhccAs39AHTv4a1zwuXC3H&amp;__tn__=-R"> military family members</a>, with<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.london.ambassador/videos/1508427716026132/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARBjS9eZMtHXVt2FwpaP9h6eJB3HhmZtQaM5A_tkxX7DGu9aqGdtStSjjyJSn6p-2xK92j4aeaOuDVbE"> U.S. embassies</a> and<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.tokyo.ambassador/videos/307977646939796/"> consulates</a>, and with<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvap.london.ambassador/photos/a.117924836659431/141049564346958/?type=3&amp;theater"> American social clubs</a>.</p>
<p>At these events we have provided specific information and guidance related to the three R’s of the overseas voting process &#8211; registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot, and returning that ballot. We have pointed people to FVAP’s<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/fpca-privacy-notice"> online tool</a> to assist military and overseas voters to register to vote and request their absentee ballot using one form, the Federal Postcard Application (FPCA). We have also shared FVAP’s in-depth<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/guide"> voting assistance guide</a> which provides state-specific guidance on many topics including (but not limited to) how to complete the FPCA, options for returning the ballot, and important deadlines.</p>
<p>The most common question I have received from Americans in Italy is, “What is my U.S. voting address?” This information is required to register to vote and request a ballot from overseas and is also nicely addressed by<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/guide/appendix/faq"> FVAP’s Frequently Asked Questions</a>. For military voters, it is usually the last address the person lived at in their state of legal</p>
<div id="attachment_6048" style="width: 302px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6048" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-6048" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FVAP3-292x300.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FVAP3-292x300.jpg 292w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FVAP3.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6048" class="wp-caption-text"><em>At the U.S. Army Garrison in Vicenza assisting members of the military and their families.</em></p></div>
<p>residence. For overseas citizens, it is usually the last place a person lived at in the U.S. before moving overseas. One does not need to have any current ties with this address.</p>
<p>Another common question I hear is “When will I get my ballot?” The answer for those who have already requested their ballot is very soon. Per federal law, election offices are required to start sending out requested absentee ballots to military and overseas voters this Saturday, September 19th.  For those who have requested their ballots to be emailed to them, they should check their inboxes this weekend.</p>
<p>In addition to providing guidance to forms and processes, one of the advantages of being local is I am somewhat familiar with daily life here and can have a regular back and forth (in the same time zone!) with Americans about more specific topics such as the Italian postal system and where and how to print out voting materials. People can get in touch with me as many times as they need whenever they need, and in Rome this includes my standing offer to drop off hard copies of forms and envelopes in person to those who want them – which I have done!</p>
<p>All of this has been made easier thanks to the U.S. embassy here in Rome and the consulate general offices in Florence, Milan, and Naples. They have been incredibly welcoming and supportive and they have staff who are committed to<a href="https://it.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/voting/"> assisting Americans in the voting process</a> and have years of experience doing so.</p>
<p>I am incredibly proud to play a small part helping members of the military, their families, and U.S. citizens living overseas navigate the absentee voting process. And in the coming weeks my colleagues and I look forward to continuing that support and upholding FVAP’s mission of ensuring Americans in Italy and across the world are aware of their right to vote and have the tools and resources to successfully do so.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: As a pilot initiative, FVAP is curious about the overall value of the Ambassador program going forward and will feature more information in its 2020 Report to Congress.</em></p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>Attacks on mail ballots not grounded in facts</strong><br />
<em>Mail-in ballots are a safe, secure, and implementable solution</em></p>
<p>By The Hon. Paul D. López is clerk and recorder<br />
City and County of Denver</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6038" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lopez_Denver-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lopez_Denver-232x300.jpg 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lopez_Denver.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />The ongoing attacks on mail ballots from the president and his allies are not grounded in fact. There is no evidence that mail ballots (a.k.a. absentee ballots) are more subject to fraud than other methods of voting, and there is virtually no chance that a foreign government could manipulate an election outcome by printing and returning fake mail-in ballots. The facts are that mail-in ballots are a safe, secure, and implementable solution that addresses many of the threats to our democracy, from the public health pandemic to foreign interference.</p>
<p>First, a key component to a successful mail ballot election is accurate voter rolls. States with mail ballots conduct thorough list maintenance of voter registration records to ensure they do not waste resources mailing ballots to bad addresses or ineligible voters. In Denver, that list maintenance is done nightly through automatic registration updates from the Department of Motor Vehicle. We couple that with monthly updates using data from the USPS National Change of Address program, Department of Public Health, and the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a multistate partnership to ensure accurate voter registration rolls.</p>
<p>Second, mail balloting is more resilient to election threats than traditional in-person polling place voting. All ballots are cast on hand-marked paper ballots, and safeguards in our election system make it impossible for fake ballots printed by any outside entity, including a foreign government, to be tabulated. In Colorado, we conduct rigorous risk limiting audits that use statistical models to ensure the correct winner was declared. Mail ballots also are not subject to weather or other natural disaster disruptions like traditional Election Day voting. And, most importantly, voting a mail ballot at home does not put a voter’s life at risk during a public health crisis.</p>
<p>To further protect the integrity of the election in Colorado, we adhere to strict signature verification when processing cast ballots. Voters must sign their ballot affidavit every time they vote in Colorado, and every signature is verified by bipartisan teams of election judges. In Denver, we conduct thorough signature verification training with a former FBI handwriting expert to ensure our election judges are well trained.</p>
<p>Critics are right to point out that signature verification has the potential to disenfranchise voters, particularly those with changing or deteriorating signatures. In Colorado, if a voter’s signature is found discrepant, the voter has up to eight days after the election to fix the issue. And we make it as easy as possible by enabling voters to return their signature cure affidavit from a smart phone.</p>
<p>In order to safely and securely implement a mail ballot election, state and local election administrators need time and resources to develop procedures, invest in equipment, and train their personnel. And they need the support of lawmakers to ensure that legislative restrictions don’t impede the ability to safely and efficiently process mail ballots so that voters have time to vote them and so that election results can be reported in a timely way. Rather than attack a voting model that has the potential to protect the right to vote for all eligible citizens, the president and members of Congress in both parties must join forces now to stop the misinformation about this important option, and to provide needed investments to ensure states and local election officials can safely add mail ballots to the menu of options for voters in November.</p>

							<h2>Stewards of Democracy, Part III</h2>
														<p><strong>Chance and technology in election administration<br />
</strong><em>Different challenges at different scales</em></p>
<p>By Paul Manson<br />
Early Voting Information Center</p>
<p>The legal, administrative, and political landscape of election administration has experienced rapid change over the past two decades. Each election seems to bring a new set of challenges, prompting another wave of change and reform.</p>
<p>In light of these pressures, we asked local election officials (LEOs) to share their experiences navigating this shifting landscape.</p>
<p>In this week’s post we explore what LEOs think about policy change and how technology has impacted election administration. Our previous blog posts highlighted the enormous variation in size across jurisdictions. This variability impacts workload, election-related responsibilities, and professional satisfaction. Size also impacts attitudes about reform, change, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>LEOs Want to Be Involved and Consulted</strong></p>
<p>When reforms occur, LEOs are often left out of the conversation. This was reflected strongly in our survey. LEOs told us that those working at the front line were seldom included in legislative debates over new laws and procedures.</p>
<p>Among the comments we received:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I would like the legislature to consult local election officials before implementing changes and actually pay attention to our concerns.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Our legislators keep making changes to election law without consulting those of us that are in the trenches every day. Making our job more difficult and sometimes making it more difficult for our voters.”</em></p>
<p><strong>LEOs Support More Standardization</strong></p>
<p>In the<a href="https://democracyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2019_DemocracyFund_StewardsOfDemocracy.pdf"> 2018 survey,</a> we provided LEOs a change to speak “in their own voices” about how ways they would change or reform election administration.</p>
<p>One theme that came up regularly was standardization. LEOs told us that different laws, rules, and procedures within and across states, and, in a few cases, different elections over the year, was something they’d like to see addressed. At the same time, other LEOs shared with us some frustrations that they had insufficient flexibility to adapt to their local environment.</p>
<p>In the 2019 survey, we took these ideas and gave the full sample a chance to weigh in on various ways to streamline, standardize, and reform election administration.</p>
<p>LEOs expressed a clear preference for standardization of election rules and procedures. 72% want to standardize election administration across their state, and 66% want to do so across the nation.</p>
<p>We are not arguing that LEOs necessarily believe that “one size fits all” in election administration. Rather we think the survey responses provide a counterweight to the frequently made claim that, in election administration, one size does not fit all.  As the<a href="http://web.mit.edu/supportthevoter/www/files/2014/01/Amer-Voting-Exper-final-draft-01-09-14-508.pdf"> Presidential Commission on Election Administration found in 2014</a>, the truth surely lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>In contrast to the responses on standardization, we found far fewer LEOs endorsed the idea of allowing different rules and procedures in rural and urban areas. 48% opposed differentiating the rules and only 30% endorsed the idea of a different set of rules. (The remaining 22% were unsure.)</p>
<p>In addition to these ideas which percolated upwards from our survey, we also asked about a set of reforms that regularly appear during debates of election reform:</p>
<ul>
<li>61% of LEOs support consolidating local, state, and federal elections to take place at the same time. Only 16% opposed this idea, with the remaining 22% neutral to the idea.</li>
<li>Making Election Day a holiday and Election Day registration divided our respondents evenly, and 21% were neutral.</li>
<li>68% of LEOs opposed moving Election Day to a weekend, with only 15% supporting the idea.</li>
<li>Internet/online voting has little support: 75% of LEOs oppose the idea and 12% support it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Respondents shared in their comments that poll worker recruitment and line management influenced their opinion on changing the date for Election Day.  Those who supported it said that a holiday or weekend Election Day might broaden who can or is willing to volunteer as a poll worker, and increase options for LEOs.</p>
<p><strong>There is Cautious Optimism on Technology</strong></p>
<p>LEOs tend to express positive&#8211;if cautious&#8211;views about new election technologies. 69% of respondents agreed that new technology has “dramatically improved election administration” for their jurisdiction, and 52% agreed that the benefits outweigh the risks of new election technology. When asked about the timeliness of new technology, 64% say that “it is best to wait until all the bugs have been worked out.”</p>
<p>This caution does not appear to translate into a desire to slow down: only 13% of our respondents agree that the country has “moved too quickly to adopt new election technologies.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6052" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEOSurvey3.12-819x1024.png" alt="" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEOSurvey3.12-819x1024.png 819w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEOSurvey3.12-240x300.png 240w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEOSurvey3.12-768x960.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEOSurvey3.12.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Not all jurisdictions are equal when it comes to accepting new technologies. Figure 1 shows that LEOs in larger jurisdictions are more likely to express “pro-technology” views than those in smaller jurisdictions. 65% of LEOs from small jurisdictions agree that new tech has “dramatically improved election administration” for their jurisdiction, while over 90% of LEOs in the largest jurisdictions agree with the statement.</p>
<p>We suspect the difference in opinions about technology is driven by their professional experiences and work environment. For larger jurisdictions (&gt; 250,000 registered voters), technological changes may have arrived earlier and were more easily integrated into their workflow because, as we saw last week, larger jurisdictions are more likely to have their own dedicated IT staff and other personnel to help them manage these changes.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead – Involving Local Officials and Sharing Experiences</strong></p>
<p>What do these messages on change and technology tell us about election administration and election reform in the United Staes?</p>
<p>First, LEOs are not averse to change or reform. The pain point for local officials is when change is too rapid, without sufficient consultation and with inadequate funding.</p>
<p>Second, LEOs should be involved earlier in policy debates. This gives legislators the opportunity to hear what has worked well and what has worked less well at the “street level”.  As one LEO wrote, they would:</p>

<p>Third, one way to engage local officials is through their state associations and other professional organizations. These organizations can help bridge the gap between legislatures and administrators and make sure both sides, if they don’t see exactly eye to eye, at least listen to one another.</p>

							<h2>Safe Election Administration Grants</h2>
														<p><strong>CTCL issues open call for grants aimed at safe election administration during COVID-19</strong><br />
<em>Project will support poll worker training and recruitment, PPE for poll workers, early voting, and vote by mail</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5301" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png" alt="" width="526" height="250" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png 526w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" />Backed by a<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/open-call/"> generous $250M contribution</a>, the nonpartisan Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), has announced a grant program to help local election officials administer elections this year in the midst of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The grants will help ensure the local election jurisdictions across the country have the staffing, training, and equipment necessary so this November every eligible voter can participate in a safe and timely way and have their vote counted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all depend on election officials to provide safe and secure voting options to the public. Unfortunately, election departments face unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to COVID-19”, said Center for Tech and Civic Life Executive Director Tiana Epps-Johnson. &#8220;This expansion of our COVID-19 Response Grant program provides our country&#8217;s election officials and poll workers with the critical resources they need to safely serve every voter&#8221;.</p>
<p>The minimum any local jurisdiction can receive is $5,000. The open call, along with additional information and the application can be found at<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/grants/"> https://www.techandciviclife.org/grants/</a></p>
<p>This grant program will enable localities to prepare for and administer safe elections by investing in priorities that would otherwise be challenging to accomplish &#8212; such as securely opening an adequate number of voting sites; setting up drive-thru and drop box locations; providing PPE for poll workers; and recruiting and training a sufficient number of poll workers.</p>
<p>Election offices can use the funds to cover certain 2020 expenses incurred between June 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020. These include the costs associated with the safe administration of the following election responsibilities. Program areas include:</p>
<p><strong>Ensure Safe, Efficient Election Day Administration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain open in-person polling places on Election Day</li>
<li>Procure Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and personal disinfectant to protect election officials and voters from COVID-19</li>
<li>Support and expand drive-thru voting, including purchase of additional signage, tents, traffic control, walkie-talkies, and safety measures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expand Voter Education &amp; Outreach Efforts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Publish reminders for voters to verify and update their address, or other voter registration information, prior to the election</li>
<li>Educate voters on safe voting policies and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Launch Poll Worker Recruitment, Training &amp; Safety Efforts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit and hire a sufficient number of poll workers and inspectors to ensure polling places are properly staffed, utilizing hazard pay where required</li>
<li>Provide voting facilities with funds to compensate for increased site cleaning and sanitization costs</li>
<li>Deliver updated training for current and new poll workers administering elections in the midst of pandemic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support Early In-Person Voting and Vote by Mail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expand or maintain the number of in-person early voting sites</li>
<li>Deploy additional staff and/or technology improvements to expedite and improve mail ballot processing</li>
</ul>

According the poll, fear of the coronavirus and doubts about the reliability of mail voting after months of attacks from the president are weighing heavily on Americans as they decide how to safely ensure their vote will be counted in this fall’s presidential election. Even as more voters want to mail their ballots than in 2016, just over 3 in 10 say they are “very confident” that their vote will be counted accurately if they vote by mail, compared with nearly 7 in 10 who say the same about voting in person on Election Day. The survey also reveals a sharp racial disparity in perceptions of election integrity, with 71 percent of Black Americans saying it is easier for White citizens to vote than Black citizens compared to 34 percent of Whites who believe that to be the case. Similarly, 71 percent of Black voters say they prefer voting before Election Day, whereas 58 percent of White voters say the same. In another poll, this one from Fox News, more than 60 percent of likely voters were</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/13/fox-news-poll-voter-opinion-delayed-election-result/5785554002/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OK with the possibility of not knowing the results of the election on Election Night</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The poll found only 29 percent of likely voters expect to know on election night if the president won a second term or if his Democratic challenger succeeded in unseating him. Another 20 percent said they expected to know by the next day, 19 percent said it would probably be two to three days before a winner is declared and 27 percent said it would be longer than three days. When asked if they were &#8220;comfortable&#8221; with not knowing the result on Nov. 3, 27% said they were &#8220;very&#8221; comfortable and 34% said &#8220;somewhat&#8221; comfortable. Overall, 36% were not comfortable with the idea (21% &#8220;not very&#8221; and 14% &#8220;not at all&#8221;).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

Election officers have been hired to create the ballot packages. The officers were not exposed, and remain hard at work, he said. Blevins also turned to the City to find a solution to quickly mitigate the impact of the illness. “I am very fortunate to have partners that we can leverage quickly. Together, we have managed to dodge the proverbial bullet,” Blevins said. The only unresolved issue is that the election department phones have not been extended remotely. The clerk’s office is working on a solution.</span></p>

The House Science, Space and Technology Committee</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/470506-bipartisan-bill-to-secure-election-tech-advances-to-house-floor"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approved the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year. The timing for consideration of the bill in the Senate is unclear. </span></p>

The bill does not allow clerks to start counting absentee ballots. Rather, the bill allows clerks to remove absentee ballots from their outer envelopes and start sorting them for counting on Election Day. The ballots need to remain in their secrecy sleeves until the morning of Election Day; if a ballot is not included in a secrecy sleeve, the bill allows clerks to place these ballots in a sleeve. The bill only allows cities with at least 25,000 residents to start processing ballots the day before the 2020 general election and no other election. The bill still needs to be passed by the state House and be signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to become law. </span></p>

Voter intimidation tactics and suppression has no place in New Jersey. We’ve seen the punitive effects of these anti-civil rights strategies in other states as well as in New Jersey in the past.”</span></p>

Bob Peterson, voicing the key argument that sank the spending appeal. State Sen. Bill Coley, another Republican, said LaRose&#8217;s request was going beyond the authority given to his office by lawmakers and asking them to “look the other way.” LaRose appeared personally at their virtual hearing to make his case, arguing strongly that it was within the law. “A no vote today is a no vote that is over the objection of our bipartisan election officials and over my objection as the state&#8217;s chief elections officer,” LaRose said.</span></p>

The House agreed with a Senate bill passed earlier this month that allowed anyone to request an absentee ballot without providing a specific excuse.

Henry McMaster. A spokesperson McMaster said the governor will sign it. &#8220;The bill strikes a good balance between protecting South Carolinians and the integrity of the voting process,&#8221; said Brian Symmes, McMaster&#8217;s Communications Director. </span></p>

The City Council voted 6-5 in July to put the question on the November ballot, but weeks later, Mayor Miro Weinberger struck it down, saying it’s too expensive to create a separate ballot. He also said ranked-choice voting is too divisive to focus on during a contentious presidential election. The resolution also calls on the city clerk to set public hearings to ensure voters have the information they need to make an educated decision on ranked-choice voting.</span></p>

Arizona Public Integrity Alliance, a conservative political nonprofit, sued Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes over a new instruction included with ballots mailed to voters in March and August. A Superior Court judge ruled that Maricopa County had likely violated the law, but said it would be logistically difficult to change the instructions this close to the election. The state Supreme Court disagreed and ordered that the county cannot include the instruction with ballots for the Nov. 3 general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Arizona, U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Rayes has ruled that Arizona voters who forget to sign their early ballots before mailing them get up to five days after the election to fix the problem. The ruling sided with state and federal Democratic groups who argued it was unfair for election officials not to</span><a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/arizona-voters-who-dont-sign-early-ballots-can-fix-them-up-to-5-days-after-election-judge-rules/75-fe8e72a1-c2f7-4f85-a7a6-e6790e6a03bf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">allow voters to “cure”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those ballots. They argued that ballots with mismatched signatures should get five days to be fixed. But unsigned ballots are discarded if they are not corrected by 7 p.m. on Election Day.</span></p>

The campaign and various local and national Republican Party entities argued that they can&#8217;t count on Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs to represent their interests in the case. But Snow ruled that the campaign, the GOP and Hobbs have all taken the same position against allowing more time to count ballots from the Navajo Nation. He also denied a request by a liberal group, the Arizona Advocacy Network, to join the case. The group had hoped to argue in favor of counting all late-arriving ballots statewide.</span></p>

U.S. District Judge William Martinez agreed and</span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/jena-griswold-usps-lawsuit-election-misinformation/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily barred USPS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from sending the mailer. “The Court recognizes that removing the (mailer) from circulation may impose limited burdens on Defendants. Such burdens, however, pale in comparison to the potential disenfranchisement of registered voters within Colorado,” Martinez wrote. The mailer, already received by some Colorado voters, “provides false or misleading information about the manner of Colorado’s elections by stating that voters should ‘[r]equest [their] mail-in ballot (often called ‘absentee’ ballot) at least 15 days before Election Day’ and ‘mail [their] ballot at least 7 days before Election Day,” the ruling said. Although Colorado was the only state to sue to stop the mailing,</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/politics/postal-service-mail-voting.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a number states had to come out with statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to explain that the mailing either didn’t apply to voters in that state at all or did so, sorta.</span></p>

The panel ruled that the plaintiffs did not prove a violation of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs included more than a dozen people with felony convictions who accused Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers of imposing a “poll tax” by requiring them to pay off all court-ordered costs relating to their felony convictions before voting. “Because the felons failed to prove a violation of the Constitution, we reverse the judgment of the district court and vacate the challenged portions of its injunction,” Judge William Pryor wrote for the majority.</span></p>

The decision requires Johnson County Auditor Travis Weipert to void any absentee ballot application with pre-filled information returned to his office and notify voters that their request is not valid. Voters must resend a new request form in order to vote absentee by mail in November. At least 15,000 request forms pre-populated with voter&#8217;s personal information, including voter PIN numbers, were returned to the Johnson County auditor’s office last week. Voter&#8217;s four-digit PIN numbers, driver&#8217;s license numbers or other valid ID numbers are required on these forms as part of Iowa&#8217;s Voter ID law.</span></p>

The ruling will allow Louisiana’s voters to request absentee ballots for the Nov. 3 general election and Dec. 5 runoff if they personally certify they are COVID-positive, quarantining pending COVID-19 test results, at greater risk because of comorbidities or caring for someone who fits those criteria. It will also require early voting for the Nov. 3 election to be held 10 days from Oct. 16, through Oct. 27, excluding Sundays, after prior plans limited early voting to a standard seven-day period.</span></p>

The filing also seeks to bar elections officials from accepting mail-in ballots that do not have a postmark for two days after Election Day. The campaign and its co-plaintiffs, the Republican National Committee and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, filed an “an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue” — its first move to hasten the lawsuit they filed Aug. 18. But the motion, signed by state Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland), does not seek to immediately pause the larger plans for a mail-in election, despite the Trump campaign’s claims it violates the U.S. Constitution and three federal laws.</span></p>

Legislators still could appeal last week’s decision, however. Stein said in a news release that the state elections board is identifying the qualifying individuals and ultimately would provide information to them on how to register. People who want to vote on Election Day or receive a mail-in ballot must register by Oct. 9. Others can register and vote at the same time at early in-person voting sites open Oct. 15-31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in North Carolina, the N.C. Court of Appeals ruled this week that the state legislature had the authority in 2018 to place two Constitutional amendments on the ballot, one capping income tax and the other calling for</span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article245744325.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">voter ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the ruling doesn’t mean that people will have to show a photo ID when they vote this year according to the News &amp; Observer. There are two other ongoing lawsuits where judges have found North Carolina’s voter ID law appears to be unconstitutional, one in state court and one in federal court. As long as those other lawsuits and legal rulings continue to block voter ID from going into place, people will be able to vote without having to show ID first. The new ruling Tuesday — which dealt with the process by which the two amendments were passed, not their actual substance — can’t override those other court cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican members of the Watauga County board of elections have filed suit in Wake County over the state board of elections decision to approve an</span><a href="https://theappalachianonline.com/watauga-county-board-of-elections-members-file-lawsuit-against-state-board-over-app-state-campus-voting-site/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">early voting site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the campus of Appalachian State University. Watauga Board members Eric Eller and Nancy Owen re arguing that Watauga County BOE Chair Jane Hodges was not acting on behalf of the full board when she notified App State that they would request the Blue Ridge Ballroom as an early voting site.  “The general statute requires that the local board of elections request the use of a building 90 days in advance of the time of voting, the time of voting being Oct. 15,” said Nathan Miller, the lawyer representing Eller and Owen. “Since the board didn’t do it, the state board has zero statutory authority to essentially seize the building and take control from ASU.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

McIntosh has ruled that elections officials must allow voters to</span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/09/judge-orders-ohio-officials-to-allow-online-absentee-ballot-applications.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for absentee ballots online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The current system allows voters to request an absentee ballot application online, but the actual application itself must be printed off and filled out in ink before being physically delivered to a county elections office. McIntosh’s Friday ruling says the state must allow voters to fill out a physical form and email an image or fax it to their county elections office. “In reviewing the plain language of the statute, absentee ballot applications must be in writing and need not be in any particular form,” McIntosh wrote. “The statute does not address in what form the boards of elections are to receive absentee ballot applications. The statute only requires that the applications be made in writing.” On Friday, an</span><a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/09/13/ohio-absentee-ballot-order-halted/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">appeals court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> halted McIntosh’s order and called for both sides to submit responses by Sept. 23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Pleas Judge Richard Frye has ruled that Ohio&#8217;s county boards of elections have the authority to have</span><a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/politics/2020/09/15/Judge-rules-counties-may-have-multiple-drop-boxes-for-ballots/stories/20200915126"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple drop boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for placement of absentee ballots by voters. “This restriction blocks individual county boards of elections from even considering the use of more than one drop box, or placing boxes at locations separate from board offices,” the judge wrote. “Given the ambiguity [of state law], this is not required by law. “Instead, every board of elections is legally permitted to consider enhancing safe and convenient delivery of absentee ballots, and may tailor ballot drop box locations or conceivably other secure options to the needs of their individual county,” he wrote.</span></p>

Siding with the state’s Republican leadership, the appellate judges rejected the Texas Democratic Party&#8217;s effort to expand eligibility for voting by mail to all registered voters based on their argument that the state&#8217;s age restrictions for such voting violate the 26th Amendment&#8217;s protections against voting rules that discriminate based on age. The panel of appellate judges ultimately found that &#8220;conferring a privilege&#8221; to some voters — in this case the option of voting by mail to voters 65 and older — does not alone violate the 26th Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge R.K. Sandill ruled that Harris County can move forward with its plan to send every registered voter an</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/11/texas-mail-in-ballot-applications-harris-county/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">application to request a mail-in ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the November general election. Sandill rejected the Texas attorney general’s request for a temporary injunction blocking the plan. In his ruling, Sandill shot down the state&#8217;s claim that Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins was acting outside of his authority by sending out the applications and that the move would harm voters. &#8220;The Legislature has spoken at length on the mechanisms for mail-in voting. There are no fewer than 42 Election Code provisions on the subject,&#8221; Sandill wrote. &#8220;In those provisions, the Legislature has made clear that in order to vote by mail a voter first &#8216;must make an application for an early voting ballot.&#8217; But, as to how the voter is to obtain the application, the Election Code is silent.&#8221; The state has</span><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/AG-Ken-Paxton-seeks-quick-appeal-on-mail-in-15562110.php"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">appealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ruling. And on Tuesday, the state Supreme Court granted the Texas attorney general’s request to</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/15/harris-county-mail-in-ballot-applications/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily halt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the county’s mailing of applications while the case is appealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas Supreme Court ruling returning Green Party candidates to the November ballot will cost McLennan County some green, as more than 8,000 absentee ballots ready for distribution will have to be</span><a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/court-ruling-forces-mclennan-county-to-call-back-8-000-ballots-add-green-party-candidates/article_49fc5982-f79f-11ea-8646-bb0d0e3a95ed.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scrapped and re-produced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the candidates included. The county could spend thousands extra, just for mail-in ballot materials and postage to comply with the last-minute wrangling in the courts, based on a breakdown provided by McLennan County Elections Administrator Kathy Van Wolfe showing 25 cents to produce each ballot, 10 cents each for envelopes and labels, and 65 cents each for postage. That is in addition to days of already complete staff work that will have to be repeated. “We have to start over,” Van Wolfe told the Waco Tribune-Herald. “We may have to work around the clock, but we will get it done. We had 8,100 mail-in ballots sitting in a car, ready to be carried to the Post Office, when we were notified of what happened. We’ve already been getting calls from people wanting to know about their ballot, asking, ‘When am I going to get it?’ Well, it’s going to be a little longer now, probably the end of the month.”</span></p>

In a one-page judgment filed this week, Crawford denied the motion for a preliminary injunction to block the system and he dismissed the lawsuit filed by five Vermonters. Crawford did tell the people challenging the vote-by-mail system, including a town clerk and a former Republican state representative, they had 30 days to file a notice of appeal.</span></p>

A great deal of misinformation is spreading, and voters do not know where to look for trusted information. Increases in by-mail voting and safety concerns about voting in polling places have led to confusion about the best options to vote. All of these changes will likely lead to slower results reporting and the possibility of one or both parties dismissing official totals as fraudulent or illegitimate.  Please join The Bipartisan Policy Center as we discuss what’s fact and what&#8217;s fiction, and what we can still do to maintain the integrity of our elections this November. Featured Participants: Donna Brazile, Michael Steele, and Laurel Lee, Florida Secretary of State. Moderated by: Steve Scully. political editor, C-SPAN. <strong>When:</strong> September 18 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="http://bpcevents.cloudapp.net/Pages/Home.aspx?eventid=%7b2F233582-81F3-EA11-A815-000D3A13A9B7%7d&amp;_cldee=bW1vcmV0dGlAZWxlY3Rpb25saW5lLm9yZw%3d%3d&amp;recipientid=contact-934f206aa2f8e31181766c3be5a82168-0ff352f1394a41bfa2316c44ffa9dd12&amp;utm_source=ClickDimensions&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=General%20%7C%20Worst%20Case%20Scenarios%20%7C%209.30.20&amp;esid=5384c3b6-b2f3-ea11-a815-000d3a1bbb23">Worst Case Scenarios 2020</a>: Any number of scenarios in November could lead to electoral uncertainty. What would happen if the parties disagree about who won the election and send competing slates of electors to Congress? Or what if the electors act “faithlessly” and vote for a candidate who didn’t win their state? Consider, too, a scenario where neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden gets an absolute majority in the electoral college. Or what happens if one of the candidates dies or gets sick after the election but before the electoral college votes are counted? To answer these and many other questions, join John Fortier, director of BPC’s Democracy Project and author of After the People Vote and Ned Foley, professor of law at Moritz College and author of Ballot Battles. <strong>When:</strong> Sept. 30; 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
