							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Vote by Mail Planning Calculator</strong><br />
<em>New tool helps officials plan for increased mail voting</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5380" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The 2020 primary election cycle has seen unprecedented increases in mail ballots. A recent Gallup Poll shows that 64% of Americans across both major parties favor allowing voting by mail this November. As election officials plan for an increase in mail voting, they’ll need to consider costs, staffing, automation, and even secured ballot-counting facilities along the way.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.voteathome.org/"> Election Official Operations Toolkit</a> by the National Vote at Home Institute (NVAHI) with funding support from the Democracy Fund features a<a href="https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vote-by-Mail-Planning-Calculator-1.xlsx"> Vote by Mail Planning Calculator</a> to facilitate those preparations. This user-friendly Excel spreadsheet takes as its inspiration the polling place resource planning tools built by Aaron Strauss, Mark Pelzarsky, Stephen Graves, and Rong Yuan. Like those tools, it allows election officials to input data and simulate multiple scenarios to improve resource allocation.</p>
<p>The Voting by Mail Planning Calculator estimates the number of voters who choose mail ballots under a variety of scenarios and uses that information to model the likely costs and resource needs associated with supporting those mail voters. A<a href="https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-Vote-by-Mail-Resource-Planning-user-guide-1.pdf"> user guide</a> and<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GXLkpqnP6ZBL-CqXZ951rAQzFIWM-pUj?usp=sharing"> step by step demo videos</a> accompany it as well to make sure users can take full advantage of the capabilities. The calculator can help election officials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare for potential variations in mail ballot requests</li>
<li>Make decisions about automation and equipment</li>
<li>Plan staffing throughout the election cycle</li>
<li>Plan for voter education and outreach; and</li>
<li>Budget for new or different expenses due to voting by mail</li>
</ul>
<p>For jurisdictions thinking about buying equipment to automate parts of the VBM process, preparing to outsource components of this work, or organizing staffing plans, the calculator can help to compare automated versus manual, in-house versus contracted and simulate staffing needs throughout the election cycle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5306" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAH-300x60.png" alt="" width="300" height="60" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAH-300x60.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAH.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />It can’t do everything, though: no currently-available model can accurately predict how many voters will choose to cast their ballots by mail this November. The scenarios included in the calculator support planning for a range of potential outcomes, rather than being used to “lock-in” a specific plan. For example, many voters have chosen mail ballots under current public health guidance, though if public health provisions wane for the November election, many of these same voters may prefer the familiarity of in-person voting. Should public health concerns heighten, the record rates of mail ballot use we’ve seen will likely hold or increase in coordination.</p>
<p>Contingency planning is critical in running elections, even in years with fewer surprises than 2020 has offered so far. The Election Official Operations Toolkit from NVAHI can simplify planning and support election officials as they navigate new challenges and serve voters.</p>

In the<a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/07/18/d-c-elections-board-signs-off-on-plan-to-mail-ballots-to-every-registered-voter-for-november-election/"> District of Columbia</a>, the DC Board of Elections confirmed that it would be mailing ballots to all registered voters. The city will also have 40 vote centers for early and day of voting and drop boxes will be placed citywide. In<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/17/iowa-secretary-state-paul-pate-mail-absentee-ballot-request-form-registered-voters-covid-19-pandemic/5458727002/"> Iowa</a>, Secretary of State Paul Pate announced his intentions to once again send an absentee ballot application to all registered voters. “I want Iowa voters and poll workers to be safe during this pandemic while we conduct a clean, fair and secure election. After consulting with all 99 county auditors, I believe the best way to accomplish that goal is by mailing an absentee ballot request form to every active registered voter in the state,&#8221; Pate said in a statement, noting that in-person voting will still be available. In<a href="https://abc3340.com/news/local/covid-19-acceptable-excuse-to-cast-absentee-ballot-in-november-alabama-sec-of-state-says"> Alabama</a>, Secretary of State John Merrill announced that the pandemic is an acceptable excuse to request an absentee ballot for the general election. In<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/elections/bs-md-hogan-coronavirus-election-20200723-cal2jinsxrgj3mnaqm55j37qhu-story.html"> Maryland</a>, Gov.

Senate President Harvey Peeler and S.C. House Speaker Jay Lucas she has serious concerns about the state’s ability to conduct what’s expected to be a busy presidential election under current rules. Among her concerns were that the absentee-by-mail voting process “will be overwhelmed and overrun” as social distancing at polling places will be either difficult or impossible, poll managers will be hard to recruit, wait times will rise and more people will seek curbside voting to avoid long lines. Officials in Grand Forks,<a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/6584534-Grand-Forks-County-Commission-moves-to-hold-November-election-by-mail"> North Dakota</a> voted to hold the November General Election by mail with only one in-person voting site.<a href="https://www.salisburypost.com/2020/07/18/n-c-elections-chief-orders-minimum-early-vote-sites-in-fall/"> North Carolina</a> Board of Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell used her emergency powers to announce that she was requiring counties to provide at least one early voting site per 20,000 voters, that early voting sites must be open on weekends and that poll workers will be required to wear masks, voters will not.</p>

In <strong>Connecticut,</strong> officials from the secretary of state’s office were forced to reach out to the mayor of Wallingford after he said last week that he plans to keep the<a href="https://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Wallingford/Wallingford-News/State-election-officials-order-Wallingford-mayor-to-place-ballot-box-outside.html"> two drop boxes</a> inside Town Hall, citing security and vandalism concerns. “Our office has grave concerns about your unwillingness to protect the health and safety of your voters by providing them with a safe and trusted method of contactless delivery of their absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of the State Scott Bates said via letter Monday. Also in Connecticut, the town of Vernon has<a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/vernon/vernon-refuses-state-election-drop-box-builds-safer-version"> refused to accept</a> the drop boxes from state. According to <em>The Patch</em>, Vernon Town Manager Michael Purcaro said the town instead wants to use a drop box connected to a window at the Vernon Town Clerk&#8217;s office to for a &#8220;safe, secure, easily accessible and convenient&#8221; method of filing ballots. &#8220;What we&#8217;re doing is offering a safer and healthier way to collect ballots. I have a concern over an unmonitored drop box being touched by who knows how many people while unsupervised and not necessarily cleaned after each transaction. I also question the security of a drop box at the curb rather than one attached to town hall. A monitored ballot submission is consistent with the constitution. After each time it us used, it will be cleaned and wiped down for health reasons.&#8221; The secretary of state’s office has also reached out to town officials in Vernon. During testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, <strong>Tennessee</strong> Secretary of State Tre Hargett said that he is opposed to ballot drop boxes for security reasons. “Frankly, it’s an<a href="https://martinsvillebulletin.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/tennessee-secretary-of-state-opposes-absentee-drop-boxes/article_23c872e0-c408-51e9-8305-900c1bd7e48b.html"> anti-coercion methodology</a>,&#8221; Hargett responded. &#8220;If you look at it, if someone knows you’ve got an absentee ballot and they can say, &#8216;Hey, I’ll be glad to take that for you and drop that off for you,&#8217; they can ask you what you filled that ballot out or they cannot turn it in at all for you.”</p>

In<a href="https://www.wbrc.com/2020/07/17/piedmont-poll-worker-hospital-with-covid-/"> Alabama</a>, Piedmont city leaders informed people, via Facebook, that a poll worker who worked on runoff election day tested positive for COVID-19 and has been hospitalized. City leaders say their legal team advised them to notify anyone who voted at the court location last week. They also said all of the poll workers wore masks on election day. In<a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-workers-come-down-with-covid-19-as-numbers-continue-to-rise/article_2940a912-c181-560d-bbf9-3272cea52675.html"> Texas</a>, at least three election workers who manned a polling site in McLennan County have been diagnosed with COVID-19. According to the Waco Tribune, One of the workers who is hospitalized estimated that from 10 percent to 15 percent of voters who cast ballots at the Robinson Community Center did not wear masks into the polling site.</p>

He was 80. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, while Lewis was not a policy maven as a lawmaker, he served the role of conscience of the Democratic caucus on many matters. His reputation as keeper of the 1960s flame defined his career in Congress. In 2012, when Rep. Paul C. Broun (R-Ga.) proposed eliminating funding for one aspect of the Voting Rights Act, Lewis denounced the move as “shameful.” The amendment died. Lewis helped form and later led the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Passage of the Voting Rights Act, which provided incisors for the 15th Amendment 95 years after its enactment, is the Lewis saga’s richest chapter, what he called “the highlight of my involvement in the movement.” On March 7, 1965, what became known as Bloody Sunday, Lewis and Hosea Williams lead 600 people to the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Selma’s outskirts. Ordered to disperse, the procession held its ground. The troopers charged. Network cameras filmed police in gas masks brutalizing unarmed men, women and children, many dressed for church. Millions that night saw police using clubs and tear gas chasing terrified civilians. Mr. Lewis, his skull fractured, went to the hospital along with 77 others. “I remember how vivid the sounds were as the troopers rushed toward us,” he wrote in his memoir. “The clunk of the troopers’ heavy boots, the whoops of rebel yells from the white onlookers, the clip-clop of horses’ hoofs hitting the hard asphalt, the voice of a woman shouting, ‘Get ’em!’ ” The events of Bloody Sunday lead to the Voting Rights Act which President Lyndon Johnson signed on August 6, 1965.  When Johnson signed the bill Lewis viewed it as “the end of a very long road.” In 2010 President Barack Obama awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “Do not get lost is a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle of a day, a week, a month or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.”</p>

According to <em>MeriTalk</em>, Krebs said the 2016 election acted as a wake-up call to the American people and government as election interference “demonstrated the potentiality to undermine democracy at large.” Because of the looming threat, CISA and other agencies across the federal government have worked to up the cybersecurity and resilience posture of election infrastructure. “Compared to where things were in 2016,” Krebs explained, “we’re not seeing that level of coordinated, determined cyber activity from adversaries.” CISA has worked to develop a “vibrant election security community of practice” with state and local and private sector partnerships to bring together the pockets of election security expertise, he said. Through these partnerships, the agency has helped create “comprehensive visibility across the election infrastructure sector,” according to Krebs, and placed election intrusion detection sensors in every state.</p>

The requirement to send information would apply for students who are not located on campus during the pandemic. Institutions may also email students instead. If an institution is requiring students to remain off campus, it must request absentee ballot applications from the state and distribute them to students. The college or university should also make an effort to inform students about deadlines and voting requirements in their state.</p>

The bill would allow local election officials to begin counting paper ballots in city and town halls early on the morning of Election Day, to address the expected surge of absentee ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. “This bill brings us in line with the rest of the county,” said Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, at the online hearing.</p>

Among the concerns are that huge numbers of Idaho voters already have requested absentee ballots for November, meaning county clerks will need to be ready to process them; and counties are experiencing problems lining up poll workers, many of whom are older and fall into high-risk groups for contracting COVID-19, and polling places, with many regular locations no longer able or willing to accommodate voting due to virus concerns.</p>

Rebuffing opponents who argued the law violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, the court ruled that “no reasonable factfinder could find that Alabama’s voter ID law is unconstitutionally discriminatory” based on the evidence. But Judge Darrin P. Gayles, a district judge who heard the case with the circuit judges, dissented in an opinion that noted Alabama’s “deep and troubled history of racial discrimination” and voter suppression. While some absentee fraud occurs, Gayle wrote, in-person voting fraud is ”virtually non-existent.”</p>

The lawsuit argues that the state’s actions violate the 26th Amendment. The suit explains not only that the selective mailing is unconstitutional, but that is irrational because the state’s mailing leaves out many Alaskans who would be prime candidates to vote absentee including individuals at high risk for COVID-19.</p>

The judge outlined his position on the month-old litigation in a seven-page ruling that states that the three plaintiffs have not shown any evidence that they &#8220;have suffered or face imminent danger of suffering any injury protected by law&#8221; related to the actions of the secretary of state.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5488" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CT-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Connecticut:</strong> The chief of the state Supreme Court ruled this week that four candidates running for Congress chose the wrong venue to challenge the state’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/connecticut-judge-refuses-to-block-mailing-of-absentee-ballots/"> plan to mail absentee ballots</a> to all eligible voters. According to Courthouse News Service, while the candidates styled their<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ct-absentee-comp.pdf"> complaint</a> as an original jurisdiction proceeding in the state Supreme Court, counsel for the state emphasized in a motion to dismiss that the law permitting such challenges “applies only to elections, not primaries.” Chief Justice Richard Robinson tossed the case Monday afternoon shortly after holding remote arguments on the motion. In a 1-page order, the chief wrote that an original proceeding under state law 9-323 “is not a proper vehicle to challenge a ruling of an election official with respect to a primary.”  “Instead, the plaintiffs’ challenge should have been brought in Superior Court,” Robinson added.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3346" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Florida:</strong> A divided Supreme Court declined to stop a Florida law about<a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/07/16/supreme-court-allows-florida-to-enforce-felon-voting-rights-law/"> felon voting rights</a>, a decision that could leave tens of thousands of people without clarity about whether they are eligible to vote in the state’s Aug. 18 primary election. “This Court’s inaction continues a trend of condoning disfranchisement,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent, which was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. The Supreme Court declined a request from voter rights groups to undo the 11th Circuit’s decision, and the majority gave no explanation for doing so. Sotomayor took seven pages to describe why she disagreed, writing that the 11th Circuit had added “confusion” and “voter chill” that the Supreme Court’s precedents say the justices should avoid in elections. Sotomayor pointed out that the state still needed to screen 85,000 registrations, which the district court found would take officials six years, and tens of thousands of Floridians had already registered to vote when the law was blocked. They will remain on the voter rolls. The case remains at the 11th Circuit, which will hear arguments on the same day as Florida’s primary election.</p>
<p>Priorities USA, Dream Defenders and other plaintiffs have reached a settlement with the state over Florida’s<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/07/19/florida-vote-by-mail-legal-battle-reaches-settlement/"> vote by mail procedures</a>. Plaintiffs had been seeking to expand the state’s vote-by-mail process, arguing that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in a record number of Floridians casting ballots from home to reduce chances of being infected with the highly contagious coronavirus. Among other things, the plaintiffs asked to extend a deadline for mail-in ballots to be returned. They also wanted free postage for the ballots and challenged a provision in Florida law restricting paid workers from collecting mail-in ballots. The agreement would require Secretary of State Laurel Lee to “educate” and “encourage” county supervisors of elections about a variety of vote-by-mail procedures that were at the heart of the lawsuit. For example, the state’s top elections official would be required to educate supervisors about pre-paid postage for mail-in ballots. The settlement also would encourage local elections officials “to maximize the use of drop boxes for vote-by-mail ballots” and to inform voters about the availability of the ballot drop-off sites.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, a judge has rejected the City of Miami’s request for an injunction ordering the county and Supervisor of Elections to provide<a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/07/17/judge-rejects-miamis-call-for-more-early-voting-sites/"> more early voting sites</a>. A lawyer for the city told the court there is a “voting desert” in the middle of Miami, particularly in Hispanic neighborhoods, that infringed on voters’ ability to cast a ballot, especially during the pandemic.</p>

The four plaintiffs are alleging that the lack of accommodations violates the federal Americans With Disabilities Act and the Maine Human Rights Act. They are asking for a remedy before the November 3 general election. Kristin Aiello is an attorney with Disability Rights Maine who filed the lawsuit against the Maine Secretary of State&#8217;s Office and several city clerks on behalf of the four Maine residents. Aiello says their desire to vote absentee has been exacerbated by the new coronavirus pandemic. Three of them have underlying medical conditions that put them at high risk if they contract COVID-19. And while Gov. Janet Mills issued an emergency order that expanded the absentee voting program to encourage all registered voters to safely vote from home via absentee ballot, Aiello says her clients cannot do that.</p>

The complaint, filed in Genesee County Circuit Court Thursday, demands that the Clerk’s office, closed by the pandemic since March 17, be reopened to the public and that information about the status of absentee ballot applications and ballot mailings be made public.  The complaint requests “expedited consideration” because of the tight timeline leading up to the elections. It also demands that absentee ballots be mailed out within 24 hours of receipt of the ballot application. The complaint states that the City Clerk has failed to comply with “basic legal duties” and aims to protect the plaintiffs from “being denied their constitutional absentee voting rights and from potential disenfranchisement.”</p>
<p>Also in Michigan, a Court of Appeals panel sided with the state Legislature this week, upholding a rule that would require<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/07/20/appellate-panel-upholds-legislatures-voter-registration-identification-rules/5473874002/"> voters without a driver&#8217;s license or personal identification</a> to vote a challenged ballot.  The case was a consolidation of two similar arguments brought by voting rights group Priorities USA and ballot committee Promote the Vote, which promoted the voter-approved voting rights initiative known as Proposal 3 in 2018. The case had been dismissed June 24 by the state Court of Claims before it was appealed to the Court of Appeals.  &#8220;&#8230;the Legislature&#8217;s definition of proof of residency is a reasonable means to prevent voter fraud,&#8221; Judge Patrick Meter wrote in a 2-1 decision.</p>
<p>The League of Women Voters is appealing a decision that requires<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2020/07/group-seeking-to-have-absentee-ballots-postmarked-by-election-day-appeals-to-michigan-supreme-court.html"> absentee ballots</a> be received by local clerks by Election Day to the Michigan Supreme Court. The League says voters should have their ballots count if they are put in the mail by Election Day. “The unconstitutional barriers to absentee voting in Michigan, must be corrected immediately,” said Christina Schlitt, president of the League of Women Voters of Michigan in a statement. Schlitt said they want the state’s highest court to rule by September 4, “so voters, candidates and election officials know the rules well in advance of the November general election. This will ensure voting is accessible and convenient for every registered voter in Michigan.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5511" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NY-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />New York:</strong>  Two candidates and more than a dozen voters filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Board of Elections of creating an “election snafu” during the pandemic that stands to<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/cuomo-board-elections-sued-disenfranchising-thousands-voters-over-postmark-problems-absentee-ballots"> disenfranchise thousands of voters</a>.  The plaintiffs argue the problem stems from one of the executive orders signed by Cuomo to expand access to absentee ballots due to the Covid-19 public health emergency. It required Boards of Elections statewide to send voters a postage-paid absentee ballot envelope &#8211; a change from the previous system where voters applied their own postage. In the complaint, plaintiffs argue that this deluge of absentee ballots in the primary were handled inconsistently in part because of the State Board of Elections’ reliance on the United States Postal Service and that those ballots will be counted, or not counted with, “lightning-like randomness.”</p>
<p>Belén Colón, 81, filed the federal lawsuit earlier this month seeking payment for damages she says she sustained on primary day, where she alleges a series of events unfolded that resulted in her being unable to vote for her candidate and left feeling discriminated against for being Hispanic. The lawsuit alleges that Colón and three other Puerto Rican senior citizens had to be shuttled by her daughter to the Baden Street Settlement polling site after the Board of Elections <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/07/21/lawsuit-latino-voters-denied-voting-rights-monroe-county-primary/5427732002/">consolidated polling sites</a> According to the Democrat and Chronicle, the odds of the lawsuit being successful could be long; past legal precedents show that it is difficult to prove any monetary damages if one’s vote is not counted and there appears to be no evidence that the problems were so widespread as to affect the election outcome.</p>

The NAACP argues that new, touch screen voting machines risk exposing voters to COVID-19. It also said the ExpressVote machines are “insecure, unreliable, and unverifiable” and threaten “the integrity of North Carolina’s elections.” This week’s request for an injunction said the machines create “unique and substantial risks to the lives and health of voters” because each screen will be touched frequently.</p>

Richardson issued the order on the laws that bar first-time voters from voting absentee unless they show an ID at the local election office, make the unsolicited distribution of requests for applications for absentee ballots a misdemeanor for people who are not election workers and spell out a signature verification process for those voters. The groups sought a requirement that voters get the chance to fix signature matching issues with their ballots.mRichardson wrote that he will still consider whether to block the laws for the November election.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3609" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TexasFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Texas:</strong> Mi Familia Vota, the Texas NAACP and a group of voters have filed suit claiming the state’s current polling place procedures — including rules for early voting, the likelihood of long lines and Gov. Greg Abbott&#8217;s decision to not require voters to wear masks — place an<a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/politics/elections/wide-ranging-lawsuit-claims-texas-in-person-voting-rules-will-disenfranchise-black-latino-voters-during-the-pandemic/287-1f1f7352-1961-4d03-b735-95968cf85d81"> unconstitutional burden on voters</a> while the virus remains in circulation. That burden will be particularly high for Black and Latino voters whose communities have been disproportionately affected by the virus, the lawsuit argues. Abbott and Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs are named as defendants, but the suit targets some decisions that are ultimately up to local officials. The long list of changes the plaintiffs are seeking includes a month of early voting, an across-the-board mask mandate for anyone at a polling place and a suspension of rules that limit who can vote curbside without entering a polling place. The plaintiffs also want to overturn a relatively new statewide election law that ended the long-established practice of setting up temporary or mobile early voting sites that could be moved around during the early voting period to reach as many voters as possible near where they live, work or go to school. They are asking the court to allow counties a temporary reprieve from that 2019 law, which is the target of a separate lawsuit filed last year.</p>

Supreme Court did reverse this Court’s November 6, 2019 ruling regarding the question of standing of (town council candidate) Nancy Singleton Case,&#8221; McLaughlin&#8217;s new order states. The state Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in the case was filed June 15 and remanded the case back to Jefferson County Circuit Court. McLaughlin had previously concluded that the four provisional ballots should be included in the vote tallies because the voters’ names were left out of the poll book because of a technical error involving the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles. Citing the high court&#8217;s decision in the case, McLaughlin&#8217;s order on Tuesday reverses the decision of the Harpers Ferry Contest Tribunal Order declaring election results, and orders that the Harpers Ferry Town Council count the provisional ballots of the four voters.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: Grand Rapids-based mail service provider Kent Communications, Inc. (KCI) announced this week that it has worked with local election officials to create a product called<a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/politics/elections/grand-rapids-business-elected-officials-create-ballot-tracking-system/69-9567d66a-3a2c-4b84-85cb-7451e689bdfb"> TrackMIBallot</a>. The product used a service from the United States Postal Service, called Informed Visibility, to track each piece of ballot mail as it goes through the postal system. TrackMIBallot will track ballots as they are sent out to voters and also as they are sent back to the election office. So far, the City of Walker, the City of Lansing, Grand Rapids Township and Cannon Township have signed on to use TrackMIBallot for the upcoming election. The City of Walker was one of the very first Municipalities to sign on. “As City Clerk for the City of Walker in Kent County Michigan, I strive to be on the forefront of technology, and I am excited to assist KCI in rolling out TrackMIBallot. This tool will be a great benefit to voters by giving them the opportunity to track their ballot to its destination,” said City of Walker clerk Sarah Bydalek.</p>
