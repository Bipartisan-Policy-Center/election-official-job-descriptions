							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Boulder County Elections releases Election Security Community Briefing</strong><br />
<em>Election official reflects on why and how the report came together</em></p>
<p>By Molly Fitzpatrick<br />
<a href="https://www.bouldercounty.org/elections/">Clerk &amp; Recorder for Boulder County, Colorado</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6077" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Boulder1-234x300.png" alt="" width="234" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Boulder1-234x300.png 234w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Boulder1.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" />Last week, my office announced the release of a new report on election security. The<a href="http://www.boco.org/ElectionSecurityReport"> Election Security Community Briefing</a> aims to educate voters and other stakeholders about the work Boulder County Elections is doing to identify and mitigate the constantly evolving threats to election security and how we are partnering with federal and state agencies, as well as the private sector, to continuously strengthen our security posture.</p>
<p>In the briefing, I wanted to detail how we have prioritized security throughout our operations, both at the state and local level. Our goal with this report was to increase transparency and ensure that our community understands the actions we are undertaking to safeguard the integrity of our elections and to protect voter information. We also wanted to empower voters with critical steps they could take to partner with us in these efforts.</p>
<p>Prior to running for office in 2018, I spent a decade involved in Colorado elections. From this experience, I knew our state had always been recognized within official circles as a national leader in election security. In particular, Boulder County Elections, led by former term-limited Clerk Hillary Hall, had been an instrumental voice in the framework of the Colorado Elections Model (<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/2013a_sl_185.pdf">Colorado Voter Access and Modernization Act</a> – Colorado HB 13-1303 passed in 2013) and the implementation of the now routine statewide post-election<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/RLA/faqs.html"> Risk Limiting Audit</a>. However, in the process of running for office, I found that these facts were not well-known among our voters.</p>
<p>I knew that, if elected, my mission with regard to election security would be twofold: 1) to maintain and continue building on what had already been done by the great team at Boulder County Elections, and 2) to focus on sharing this excellent work with the community. I was inspired by<a href="https://www.ocvote.com/election-library/docs/2018%20Election%20Security%20Playbook.pdf"> Orange County’s 2018 Election Security Playbook</a> and knew that I wanted to create something similar for Boulder County.</p>
<p>When I took office in January 2019, I was briefed on Boulder County Elections Security Program. I learned that Boulder County had been undergoing formal security assessments since 2012, that we had a cybersecurity consultant and partner in Rule4 (more on this fantastic company in the report), that our County Commissioners backed our program, and that we had an ongoing project list to tackle in response to our assessments. Everything I learned compelled me to wholeheartedly pursue my twofold mission.</p>
<p>After getting settled into office, I began working with staff to brainstorm how to bring this technical, robust program to the public in a way that was comprehensive, digestible, and memorable. There is no doubt that deciding on the framework by which to communicate this complex topic to voters was the hardest part of creating this report!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6078" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Boulder2-229x300.png" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Boulder2-229x300.png 229w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Boulder2.png 448w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" />We eventually decided to categorize our security posture into three pillars: the Colorado Election Model, Strategic Partnerships, and the Boulder County Elections Security Program. We hoped that this organizational structure would make sense to the public and would be a handy way to remember the major categories of our security posture.</p>
<p>As work got under way to develop the structure, framework, and content for the report, we carried on implementing elections (Nov 2019, March 2020, June 2020) and executing the security programs detailed in the report. Our original plan was to have the briefing ready in the spring of 2020. When the pandemic hit, we obviously had to change gears to focus on creating operational plans that would allow us to run vote centers and conduct ballot processing as safely as possible.</p>
<p>While we did not end up releasing the Election Security Community Briefing according to our original timeline, in retrospect, the timing seems perfect. With the 2020 Presidential Election right around the corner, voters are constantly reminded of the events of 2016, when the U.S. experienced unprecedented attempts to undermine the integrity of elections infrastructure. In addition, the current pandemic and associated national dialogue have raised even more questions around election security nationwide, with mail ballot voting coming under particular scrutiny.</p>
<p>As election officials, it is critical that we ensure that our voters know how election security works and about our dedication to actively working against any threats that infringe on our most sacred right as Americans. This briefing is our attempt to show the great work that Boulder County Elections is doing on this front and to dispel some of the common misinformation circulating about election security.</p>
<p>We hope that this briefing will help stimulate accurate cybersecurity conversations and enhanced practices around the country. I specifically would encourage all election officials to replicate something similar in their own communities to showcase the work they and their teams are doing to secure the vote.</p>
<p>Our collective work to safeguard election security will be more effective when the voting public understands it: meaningful transparency strengthens our democracy.</p>

							<h2>Stewards of Democracy, Part IV</h2>
														<p><strong>More than the sum of their parts</strong><br />
<em>Empowering voters and administering elections</em></p>
<p>By Paul Gronke and Paul Manson<br />
<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/">Early Voting Information Center</a></p>
<p>In this final installment on the 2019 DF/RC LEO Survey, we explore the relationship between voters and local election officials (LEOs).</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk this year about the key role LEOs play in ensuring a safe, secure, and accessible election, and for good reason. The challenges faced by LEOs in<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2020/09/21/490586/recruiting-retaining-poll-workers-coronavirus-pandemic/"> recruiting poll workers</a>, providing<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/socially-distanced-voting-how-we-can-vote-at-the-polls-this-november/"> socially distant voting</a> options, and<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2020/09/21/vote-by-mail-washington-state-postal-service/"> countering misinformation about voting by mail</a> are daunting.</p>
<p>We want to take a step back and talk about local election administration as administration.  Over the past quarter century, there’s been a shift in how public administrators at all levels of government connect with citizens and voters. This shift has resulted in agencies or public offices working to empower the public, and not simply serve them.</p>
<p>Our survey finds that this shift has also occurred in election administration. LEOs see their work as an opportunity to engage and support voters. This voter-centric approach means LEOs work to identify what voters need, innovate to meet these needs, and communicate these challenges into the policy processes to improve elections.</p>
<p>It was this perspective that first led our team to refer to LEOs as the “Stewards of Democracy,” important administrators that protect and enable key elements of US democracy.</p>
<p>This voter-centric perspective acknowledges the complexity and skills required to successfully administer elections. As the final report of the<a href="http://web.mit.edu/supportthevoter/www/"> Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a> notes:</p>
<p>The last decade’s heightened demand for more professional administration of elections and modernization of the process demonstrates that there is an increasing need for technology acumen, public relations skills, and data savvy.</p>
<p>As we will discuss at the end of this post, LEOs rate the voter and election official experience as easier today when compared to when they first started working. The technical steps of election administration have become easier, but that’s not the whole story.</p>
<p>Administering elections is more than a technical skill set – it is a role that engages and connects with the voting public.</p>
<p><strong>Examining voter-centric attitudes among American LEOs</strong><br />
The DF/RC LEO Survey is the first to try to measure voter-centric orientations among local election officials. There are several behaviors that LEOs exhibit, as well as the processes they establish, that indicate a voter-centric orientation. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and distributing voter education and outreach materials;</li>
<li>Fostering partnerships between LEOs and local organizations to help address specific voter needs;</li>
<li>Ensuring that election processes at the local level are secure so that every ballot can be counted to the fullest extent of the law; and</li>
<li>Establishing and maintaining a voter-centric organizational culture in local election offices and departments.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn’t ask about each of these, but instead provided a set of statements that reflect some aspects of voter-centric election administration.</p>
<p>LEOs overwhelmingly value voter education and outreach and consider it part of their job to work on voter education and satisfaction. 74% of LEOs agreed with the statement that they enjoy educating citizens, and 62% believe that their responsibilities include improving voter education and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Almost sixty percent disagreed that their primary task was to just conduct the election, and not worry about voter satisfaction. As one LEO shared with us:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Constant communication with our voters is key to ensuring a successful election.”</em></p>
<p>LEOs also recognize the benefit of an informed voting public: it can reduce complexity and potential public concerns. 57% of LEOs cited lack of citizen knowledge as a source of problems when it comes to voting. Many LEOs told us that election officials need to counter the fears or risks that are being discussed by the press and in social media.</p>
<p>In this way, education is not simply sharing how to vote, but rather actively engaging election administration narratives that can help to avoid problems during the election period.</p>
<p>In 2019, we added a question about whether LEOs should be concerned with turnout—a sensitive issue among many administrators since the main drivers of turnout (demographics and candidates) are out of their control.</p>
<p>We’re encouraged to report that LEOs recognize the value of higher turnout in fostering a healthy elections system. 49% agreed that it is part of their job to encourage turnout, and only 22% disagreed.</p>
<p>We also asked if LEOs should play a role in in reducing demographic disparities in voter turnout. On this LEOs were more divided, and the largest segment neither agreed nor disagreed (47%) but 29% agreed that it should be part of their work.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to see some divided opinions here. Public administrators commonly seek to be value neutral in their work, and these questions stepped close to potentially appearing as political or value-based.</p>
<p>Finally, as we found before, one of the main impediments to more voter education and engagement is that local offices face resource constraints.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6080" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO4.1.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO4.1.png 640w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO4.1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>An improving election experience over time &#8212; for voters and LEOs</strong><br />
LEOs generally report that election administration conditions have improved over time. On the five measures of voter access that we asked about, over 80% of LEOs responded that it had become easier for voters to participate along these lines since they began their job, which increases slightly with jurisdiction size.</p>
<p>On five prompts about LEO job tasks, over 60% of respondents agreed that these tasks had gotten easier since their first election. These results are similar to our 2018 survey, and indicate that election administration is generally improving or voters &#8211; and for the LEOs themselves. This may be tied into what they have control over: many of the tasks that LEOs perform directly make it easier for voters to participate in elections, but the changes that make it harder for LEOs to do their jobs often come from outside, such as state policy changes or citizen-led ballot initiatives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6079" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO-4.2.png" alt="" width="640" height="373" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO-4.2.png 640w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO-4.2-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Democracy takes work and LEOs are up for the challenge</strong><br />
These final items from our survey illustrate a key strength in US elections: the people called to serve and administer at the local level. LEOs show a commitment to not just running safe, fair, and efficient elections – they want to help voters claim their role in our elections.</p>
<p>They are also in a unique position where they must balance the work of elections with the task of engaging voters, often without additional resources. This work is something they both enjoy and are passionate about. It seems only fitting to close this series not with our words, but with a comment from a LEO that captures this sentiment:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I do my part to educate my residents and voters. I wish others would see that is what is needed […] I love my work and I love our free democracy!”</em></p>

							<h2>Safe Election Administration Grants</h2>
														<p><strong>CTCL issues open call for grants aimed at safe election administration during COVID-19</strong><br />
<em>Project will support poll worker training and recruitment, PPE for poll workers, early voting, and vote by mail</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5301" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png 526w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Backed by a<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/open-call/"> generous $250M contribution</a>, the nonpartisan Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), has announced a grant program to help local election officials administer elections this year in the midst of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The grants will help ensure the local election jurisdictions across the country have the staffing, training, and equipment necessary so this November every eligible voter can participate in a safe and timely way and have their vote counted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all depend on election officials to provide safe and secure voting options to the public. Unfortunately, election departments face unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to COVID-19”, said Center for Tech and Civic Life Executive Director Tiana Epps-Johnson. &#8220;This expansion of our COVID-19 Response Grant program provides our country&#8217;s election officials and poll workers with the critical resources they need to safely serve every voter&#8221;.</p>
<p>The minimum any local jurisdiction can receive is $5,000. The open call, along with additional information and the application can be found at<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/grants/"> https://www.techandciviclife.org/grants/</a></p>
<p>This grant program will enable localities to prepare for and administer safe elections by investing in priorities that would otherwise be challenging to accomplish &#8212; such as securely opening an adequate number of voting sites; setting up drive-thru and drop box locations; providing PPE for poll workers; and recruiting and training a sufficient number of poll workers.</p>
<p>Election offices can use the funds to cover certain 2020 expenses incurred between June 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020. These include the costs associated with the safe administration of the following election responsibilities. Program areas include:</p>
<p><strong>Ensure Safe, Efficient Election Day Administration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain open in-person polling places on Election Day</li>
<li>Procure Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and personal disinfectant to protect election officials and voters from COVID-19</li>
<li>Support and expand drive-thru voting, including purchase of additional signage, tents, traffic control, walkie-talkies, and safety measures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expand Voter Education &amp; Outreach Efforts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Publish reminders for voters to verify and update their address, or other voter registration information, prior to the election</li>
<li>Educate voters on safe voting policies and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Launch Poll Worker Recruitment, Training &amp; Safety Efforts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit and hire a sufficient number of poll workers and inspectors to ensure polling places are properly staffed, utilizing hazard pay where required</li>
<li>Provide voting facilities with funds to compensate for increased site cleaning and sanitization costs</li>
<li>Deliver updated training for current and new poll workers administering elections in the midst of pandemic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support Early In-Person Voting and Vote by Mail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expand or maintain the number of in-person early voting sites</li>
<li>Deploy additional staff and/or technology improvements to expedite and improve mail ballot processing</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/">The Center for Tech and Civic Life</a> is a nationally-recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization of civic technologists, trainers, researchers, election administration and data experts working to help modernize U.S. elections.  CTCL connects election officials with guidance, expertise, tools, and trainings so they can best serve their communities, and ensure that elections are more professional, safe, and secure.  CTCL works with the federal government, as well as local and state governments of all sizes across the nation and regardless of partisanship to highlight best practices and create easy-to-use resources for administrators.</p>

According to The Washington Post, the money will fund a program organized by the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition to pay the fines, fees and restitution costs for former prisoners who are already registered to vote in Florida but barred by law from participating in the election because of those outstanding debts. While Bloomberg has made the donation in hopes of boosting Democratic voters, the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition is a nonpartisan group that has been fundraising to return all former felons in the state to the voting rolls. Desmond Meade, the group’s president, said the group does not share Bloomberg’s goal of empowering only one political side in the upcoming election. He said that through separate efforts, his organization has raised about $7 million from about 44,000 donors to help pay the debts of citizens with felony convictions so they can return to the voting rolls. The average debt, the group said, is about $1,000. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody on Wednesday<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/elections/2020/09/23/florida-attorney-general-asks-for-investigation-into-mike-bloomberg-plan-to-help-florida-felons-vote/"> asked state and federal law enforcement officials to investigate</a> “potential violations of election laws” over billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s decision to help pay Florida felons&#8217; fines, fees and restitution to be eligible to vote. In a letter dated Wednesday, Moody wrote that she instructed statewide prosecutor Nick Cox to work with law enforcement and any statewide grand jury that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may want to call to address the issue. DeSantis initially asked Moody to review the matter, the attorney general wrote.</p>

The partnership will see voter education and registration opportunities onsite during the Rock Hall&#8217;s Resident Rockers Showcase of the Live and Local Series of free concerts. The concert series will combine both music and voter education. &#8220;We are very excited to be a partner with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they share our goal of voter education and engagement,&#8221; said Anthony Perlatti, Director of the Board of Elections. &#8220;These events are a great way to have fun and to get prepared to vote at the same time.&#8221;</p>

The three first-place winners will receive a $1,000 scholarship, with the second and third place winners receiving $500 and $250 scholarships, respectively. “Serving as a poll official is an unmatched opportunity for students to see our electoral process in action,” Hargett said. “Students participating in this contest not only have the opportunity to win scholarship money by sharing their election experience in writing, but they are helping their local election commission run a safe and secure election.” Can’t wait to read and share the winning submissions!</p>

This week the city announced its Election Commission and Cultural Division had selected 12—TWELVE—different designs following a three-week public campaign. The winning designs, which say “My Vote Counts,&#8221; will be available in multiple languages including English, French, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Vietnamese. Those who choose to vote by mail will receive the “My Vote Counts” stickers, along with their ballot, inside the mail-in ballot envelope, City Clerk Niko Vangjeli said. “By working with the phrase ‘My vote counts’ rather than ‘I voted,’ this initiative includes those who haven’t voted before, as well as those not yet old enough to vote in 2020,” Nikki Erskine of the Cultural Development Division said in a statement. “In this way, this call to artists is not just to create a souvenir, but to create an empowering statement of intent.” TWELVE!!!!</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://healthyelections.org/"> Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project</a> released three reports on 2020 primary elections last week. Complementing earlier reports on 16 states’ primaries, the newly released reports analyze various aspects of the primaries in<a href="https://healthyelections.org/state-updates/kentucky"> Kentucky</a>,<a href="https://healthyelections.org/state-updates/maine"> Maine</a>, and<a href="https://healthyelections.org/state-updates/wisconsin"> Wisconsin</a>, including mail-in ballot usage, mail-in ballot rejections, the effects of litigation, and comparisons to earlier primaries.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://publicinterestlegal.org/"> Public Interest Legal Foundation</a> released a<a href="https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/Report-Critical_Condition-Web-FINAL-FINAL.pdf"> report</a> on voter registration list maintenance last week. The report, <em>Critical Condition: American Voter Rolls Filled with Errors, Dead Voters, and Duplicate Registration</em>s, summarizes findings from an analysis of data collected from 42 states’ voter registration rolls. The research identifies 349,772 deceased registrants, including 14,608 registrants who were credited with voting after death in 2016 and 2018; 81,649 duplicate registrants who appear to have cast second votes from the same address in 2016 and 2018; and 8,360 registrants apparently registered in 2 states and credited for voting in both states in 2018; among other findings.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/"> Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a> released a report on hate incidents and elections last week. The report, <em>Hate in Elections: How Racism and Bigotry Threaten Election Integrity in the United States</em>, provides an overview of the relationship between hate incidents and elections, examining hate crimes and other hateful activity in the 2018 midterm elections and other recent elections. The report includes resources for voters and candidates who may be targeted for hateful activity, as well as information on how hate groups and individuals have used technology such as Zoombombing and social media disinformation campaigns to harass voters and candidates.</p>

Trump and Attorney General William Barr. Several times during his testimony he said several time doesn&#8217;t want to step into political controversies in a way he considers inappropriate, which is likely why he phrased his answer to the House committee as broadly as he did.</p>

In his op-ed, Coats said &#8220;democracy’s enemies, foreign and domestic,&#8221; were working to chip away at its foundation.  He warned those enemies &#8220;want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent; that sinister conspiracies have distorted the political will of the people; that our public discourse has been perverted by the news media and social networks riddled with prejudice, lies and ill will; that judicial institutions, law enforcement and even national security have been twisted, misused and misdirected to create anxiety and conflict, not justice and social peace.&#8221;  In his op-ed, Coats said that in order to reestablish confidence in elections and &#8220;unambiguously reassure all Americans that their vote will be counted,&#8221; Congress should pass emergency legislation to create a &#8220;supremely high-level bipartisan and nonpartisan commission to oversee the election.&#8221; He also called on both campaigns to commit in advance to accepting the commission&#8217;s findings.</p>

The bipartisan bill was introduced by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) last year. It will now be sent to the president desk for signature.  Blumenthal applauded the bill&#8217;s passage Monday, saying in a statement that “as foreign adversaries seek to undermine our democracy, our election systems are in dire need of strong safeguards.&#8221; &#8220;Our adversaries have shown a willingness and capability to hack the infrastructure that powers our democracy, however, our laws and enforcement lag far behind this dire threat,&#8221; Blumenthal said. “This bill must now quickly become law so every vote counts.

Among the topics covered by the bills are: Early, in-person voting and excuse-free absentee ballots; Permanent “cure” process for correcting absentee ballots; Expanded voting hours to 7:00 p.m.; Automatic voter registration and same-day voter registration; Repeal straight-ticket voting; Require advance notice of polling-place changes; Automatic restoration of voting rights for felons and expanded felony expungement; and Redistricting reform/maps with citizen input, rather than just lawmakers whose districts are being redrawn. Other election changes would expand the list of which family members could request an absentee ballot for a voter having a medical emergency, make requesting an absentee ballot via the Secretary of State’s secure online portal permanent, provide additional secure drop boxes for absentee ballots, require provisional ballots in state races for voters whose identity cannot be verified by poll workers, and make it easier for Kentuckians to vote who do not have a permanent address.</p>

Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton, co-sponsored the house bills and defended the Senate ones in a Tuesday, Sep. 22 hearing in the House Judiciary Committee. Providing false information on an absentee ballot is now a misdemeanor punishable up to 93 days in jail or a $500 fine. By increasing the consequences, attempts at fraudulently voting would decrease and help prevent local clerks from getting overwhelmed, Bollin argued.</p>
<p>The House Elections and Ethics Committee has approved Senate Bill 757 by a 4-1 vote with two abstaining. The bill, sponsored by Sen.

According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University,<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/voting-rights-lawsuits-explode-as-2020-election-kicks-into-high-gear/"> 82% more voting rights cases have been filed this year</a> compared to the same time during the last presidential election. During the last six months, 155 voting rights lawsuits have been filed in courts across the country compared with 85 such cases during the same time in 2016. The last six months have seen the highest amount of voting rights lawsuits since TRAC began tracking federal civil litigation in October 2007. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, has been tracking the<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/22/914431067/step-aside-election-2000-this-years-election-may-be-the-most-litigated-yet"> number of pandemic-related voting lawsuits</a> this year. He&#8217;s logged 250 so far. Beyond mail voting, Levitt says there&#8217;s litigation about in-person voting, too, such as how long polls will be open, how many polling places there will be and what safety measures will be taken. Then there&#8217;s also litigation pushing back on pandemic voting measures — arguing election officials have gone too far in making adjustments due to the pandemic. And The New York Times has an article about the impacts the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/us/supreme-court-voting-rules.html"> U.S. Supreme Court</a> may have on Election Day.</p>

The lawsuit was filed Sept. 11 by Ward 4 resident Walter Johnson and by Ward 4 Aldermen Steven Mays and Bruce Lockett. Adam and Soffer have also been named in an ethics complaint filed by the Democratic Party of Arkansas with the state Board of Election Commissioners regarding a number of poll site consolidations that it contends were done illegally and regarding a number of public comments made by Soffer that it said are abusive or offensive. One of the allegations in the lawsuit is that Soffer and Adam improperly closed three polling locations in African-American neighborhoods, including New Town. The decision on two of those locations, Old Morning Star Baptist Church in Packingtown and the Pine Bluff Administration Building, were reversed at a meeting Aug. 18 as a compromise with Commissioner Theodis &#8220;Ted&#8221; Davis. Davis had refused to allow the relocation of the Swan Lake Community Center polling site to the Swan Lake Fire Department, which Adam and Soffer said better met requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act, until the decision to close polling sites was reconsidered.</p>
<p>The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and two registered voters have filed suit against which names Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston and several members of the state Board of Election Commissioners alleging in their lawsuit that the state&#8217;s requirements for<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/sep/23/state-absentee-ballot-system-needs-revamp-suit/"> accepting absentee ballots</a> are unconstitutional and that history has shown that a significant number of ballots are wrongly rejected every election cycle. That won&#8217;t change, attorneys said, unless the law is changed. The suit is seeking more time for residents to cure their ballots should a problem arise which means elections officials need to begin processing ballots earlier.</p>

The so-called standing amendments restricted who may ask for an extension of polling hours. “Prior to 2019, voters could go directly to state court to seek an extension of polling place hours when they encountered barriers to casting their ballot,” Young’s order says. Under the standing amendment, “[o]nly a county election board has standing in an Indiana court or with any other state governmental entity to file an action or petition to request the extension of the hour for closing the polls by the court or entity,” Young wrote. “The Standing Amendment prevents any entity other than a unanimous county election board from ‘fil[ing] an action or petition’ in state court ‘to request the extension of the hour for closing the polls’ when there are unforeseen barriers to casting a ballot. This burdens the right to vote because when voters face disenfranchising conditions at their polling place, the Standing Amendment can deny them an opportunity to vindicate their right to vote by seeking relief in an Indiana court,” the judge found.</p>

Currently, only ballots that arrive before the polls close on Election Day are counted. Stephens made the ruling in a lawsuit brought by the Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans. She said her order applies only to the Nov. 3 election, citing the coronavirus pandemic and recent delays in U.S. postal service. The ruling, which Stephens issued in a 21-page order, is likely to face appeal efforts from Republicans who are interested parties in the case, but have not been recognized as intervening defendants, as they have requested.

The extension has been granted and approved by the courts to accommodate the large volume of mail-in ballots because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In August, a state judge approved an agreement between Secretary of State Steve Simon and several advocacy groups, which permits ballots to be counted up to a week after Election Day as long as they are postmarked Nov. 3. In previous elections, the ballot had to be received by Election Day. Ramsey County Judge Sara Grewing also waived the requirement for a witness signature. Lucero, who was not a named party on the previous lawsuits, could find a judge in federal court more sympathetic to criticisms that the changes to voting rules threaten the integrity of the state’s elections. “Plaintiffs, registered voters in Minnesota and certified electors, will be irreparably harmed in all of these ways and respectfully request that the Court declare the Secretary’s agreement unlawful and enjoin it,” Lucero argues in the lawsuit.</p>

The evidence in the record points to the conclusion that adherence to the Witness Requirement in November would only increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 for members of the public with underlying medical conditions, the disabled, and racial and ethnic minorities,” Childs wrote. As Childs noted, the witness requirement would have applied to voters even if they had contracted COVID-19 — meaning infected voters could be forced to expose their witnesses to the virus.

The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court directed the county to hold off on sending any unsolicited applications earlier this week while the case is on appeal, and the high court is the next stop for the politically fraught lawsuit. In<a href="http://www.search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=f30b7ff9-c214-43ad-9baa-796c297c04b9&amp;coa=coa14&amp;DT=Opinion&amp;MediaID=dbab9558-16ff-467a-a052-1d44e1a7f410"> an 11-page ruling,</a> three Democratic justices — Charles Spain, Meagan Hassan and Margaret Poissant — rejected the state’s argument that the injunction was necessary to keep the county from “walking” voters into committing felonies by sending applications to voters who may ultimately not be eligible for mail-in ballots. That claim, the panel ruled, was “based on mere conjecture,” with the state offering no proof to support it. “The State failed to meet its burden of showing that mailing the applications will result in irreparable injury,” the panel wrote. “The injury alleged by the State is at best speculative.” The case is on track to the Texas Supreme Court, but the clock is running out for the applications to be mailed with sufficient time to get ballots into voters’ mailboxes.</p>
<p>A group of Texas Republicans, including state party Chair Allen West, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and members of the Texas Legislature have filed suit against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over his<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/23/texas-republicans-greg-abbott-early-voting/"> extension of early voting</a> for the November election. In July, Abbot used emergency powers to add six days to early moving, moving the start time from Oct. 19 to Oct. 13. The plaintiffs say the move defied election law that requires early voting to start on the 17th day before the election. The plaintiffs argue Abbott needs to consult the Legislature before making such decisions and that &#8220;if ever a special session was justified, now is the time.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-768x524.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wisconsin</strong>: Judge William Conley has extended the<a href="https://www.wpr.org/federal-judge-extends-deadline-mail-ballots-wisconsin"> deadline for mail-in ballots</a> to be counted in Wisconsin for up to six days after the Nov. 3 election. Conley issued<a href="https://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/092120_conley_order.pdf"> the order</a> on Monday in response to a lawsuit from the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Party of Wisconsin and several nonprofit groups. The lawsuit sought to change a number of state voting laws because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Under the ruling, clerks across the state can accept ballots until Nov. 9 as long as they are mailed and postmarked on or before Election Day. The ruling knocks down a state law that requires ballots to be in the possession of local election officials by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted. In his ruling, Conley said &#8220;election workers’ and voters&#8217; experiences during Wisconsin’s primary election in April, which took place at the outset of the COVID19 crisis, have convinced the court that some, limited relief from statutory deadlines for mail-in registration and absentee voting is again necessary to avoid an untenable impingement on Wisconsin citizens’ right to vote, including the near certainty of disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters relying on the state’s absentee ballot process.&#8221; Other changes approved in Conley&#8217;s order include: Extending the deadline for online and mail-in voter registration to Oct. 21. The previous deadline was Oct. 14; Lifting a ban on replacement ballots only being sent by mail. Under the order, voters will be able to access a replacement ballot online or by email if theirs never arrived after they requested it. The window for making online or email requests will be Oct. 22-29; and Lifting a requirement that people must live in the county where they want to serve as a poll worker. Republican lawmakers have<a href="https://www.wpr.org/gop-lawmakers-ask-court-overturn-extension-mail-ballot-deadline"> filed an appeal</a> with the federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>A poll worker is suing La Crosse’s city clerk and governor Tony Evers over<a href="https://www.news8000.com/local-poll-worker-files-lawsuit-against-gov-evers-and-clerk-teri-lehrke/"> mask requirements</a>. Poll worker Nicholas Newman says in the suit that he has difficulty breathing, and has a medical condition that makes it dangerous for him to wear a mask for an extended period of time. In August, Newman went to work his shift as a poll worker, and he was told he could not work if he didn’t wear a mask. The lawsuit claims La Crosse city clerk Teri Lehrke, “wrongly indicated to Newman that Emergency Order 1 required a face covering.” It also says he, “could not work in any future elections because of this failure.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James Peterson said this week that he won’t rule before the election on a lawsuit that challenged a state law requiring<a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/09/23/judge-wont-rule-before-election-day-on-lawsuit-over-use-of-wisconsin-student-ids-to-vote/"> college student IDs</a> to have an expiration date in order for them to be used as a voter’s ID. Peterson canceled a hearing he had scheduled for Thursday morning in the case, less than six weeks before the election in the hotly contested battleground state. Peterson said he didn’t want to cause “chaos and confusion” by ruling in the case so close to the election, noting that absentee voting was already underway. “If the court were to issue an order changing the status quo now, it would leave the (Elections) Commission and municipal clerks with little time to issue new guidance and retrain staff,” Peterson said. “The nearly inevitable appeal would mean weeks of uncertainty as the case was reviewed by the court of appeals and possibly the Supreme Court.”</p>

While voters are making their plans, they are provided with critical election information and voting resources to ensure they are prepared and know their safe voting options in the Presidential General Election, according to officials.</p>

According to StateScoop, the tool, which uses natural-language processing to respond to users’ queries both online and over the phone, was first implemented ahead of the May 19 primary. The bot was up and running within about two weeks of IBM’s offer of a free 90-access to its virtual assistance platform. According to officials it  handled about 3,300 inquiries from Idaho voters seeking information about filing or updating their voter registrations or how to fill out and return their absentee ballots. In a press release, Idaho Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said the Watson tool freed up Denney’s staff to help relieve local county boards of elections with the flood of queries they were being inundated with at the time. “That was a huge weight off the shoulders of our staff,” Houck said. The state will be using assistant again for the general election.</p>

While it’s a limited step — the online option is still only available to people updating their licenses — the change marks the first time Texans have been able to register to vote online, which advocates say could significantly increase turnout both this year and for future elections. Mimi Marziani, the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which brought forward the lawsuits, said the change specifically helps marginalized Texans, who most often move. “This is absolutely a victory for voting rights for all Texans,” Marziani said. “It’s a particular victory for younger Texans, poorer Texans and Texans of color.”</p>

What would happen if the parties disagree about who won the election and send competing slates of electors to Congress? Or what if the electors act “faithlessly” and vote for a candidate who didn’t win their state? Consider, too, a scenario where neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden gets an absolute majority in the electoral college. Or what happens if one of the candidates dies or gets sick after the election but before the electoral college votes are counted?
