							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>2019 Clearinghouse Awardees</strong><br />
<em>Sharing best practices to assist election officials in 2020</em></p>
<p>By Christy McCormick, chair<br />
<a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a></p>
<p>This week, the EAC announced the winners of the 2019 Clearinghouse Awards or “Clearies.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This program honors election offices by celebrating best practices in election administration. Under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the EAC’s enabling legislation, we work to implement election reforms, assist states in certifying voting systems, advance accessibility, and serve as a clearinghouse of election information. The EAC developed the Clearie awards program in 2016 to document and promote the accomplishments of election officials and others in the elections community with the hope that these best practices can be implemented in other communities across the country.</p>
<p>During the past four years, we have received more than 130 submissions for the Clearies competition, and the awards have grown from one category to four. The 2019 awards retain three previous categories: Outstanding Innovations in Elections, Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities, and Best Practices in Recruiting, Training, and Retaining Poll Workers. We are pleased to add the newest category of Creative and Original “I Voted” Stickers to the 2019 contest. In 2020, the EAC will launch an additional category featuring best practices in election security.</p>
<p>Elections present unique challenges and opportunities for officials across the U.S., and the 2020 presidential contest will be no different. As we heard at last week’s EAC 2020 Elections Summit, ballots are already being cast for the 2020 primaries by overseas voters. Election officials must be prepared to handle every facet of organizing elections, from the ballot box to the staffing of the polling place. Jurisdictions large and small have been adopting innovative ways to ensure election efficiency and security while protecting access for voters with disabilities or language barriers. With this in mind, my fellow commissioners and I are pleased to announce the 2019 Clearie winners.</p>
<p>For the 2019 contest, we received dozens of submissions from jurisdictions and organizations of all sizes across the United States. Each program submission presented a proven best practice or original endeavor. Submissions were evaluated by an independent panel of election officials from the EAC’s Board of Advisors and Standards Board. Judges rated submissions on merits such as replicability, cost-effectiveness, innovation, and positive results. Sticker submissions, judged by EAC commissioners, celebrated the American spirit and voter pride through artistic expression.</p>
<p>After thorough evaluation by our judges and commissioners, we are pleased to announce 12 program awards and five sticker awards. Competition winners include county, township, and state election offices as well as one advocacy organization. All of the winners celebrate the can-do spirit of election officials striving to meet the needs of voters. The full list of winners will be available at<a href="http://www.eac.gov"> EAC.gov</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-5027" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019clearies_stickers.1.22.20.jpg--1024x522.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019clearies_stickers.1.22.20.jpg--1024x522.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019clearies_stickers.1.22.20.jpg--300x153.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019clearies_stickers.1.22.20.jpg--768x391.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />In the new<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/01/22/five-winners-announced-eacs-first-annual-national-award-creative-and-original-i"> Creative and Original “I Voted” sticker category</a>, we were impressed by the artistic creativity of Alaska’s celebration of state animals and Louisiana’s incorporation of the state bird, the Pelican, into the state seal. Clark County, NV’s catchy Vegas sticker transported us to the sunset strip while Washoe County, NV underscored the picturesque landscape behind a city skyline. We also found inspiration in our HAVA roots of accessibility with the braille “I Voted” sticker of Douglas County, NV.</p>
<p>The Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities category featured a<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/01/21/national-council-independent-living-ncil-wins-national-award"> toolkit</a> for election officials on website and ballot accessibility, an iPad-based system for<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/01/21/merced-county-registrar-voters-office-california-wins-national-award"> assisting voters who are deaf</a> with sign language interpretation, and <a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/01/21/dc-board-elections-wins-national-award">an elections office making outstanding efforts</a> in multiple areas, from electronic ballot delivery to physical access to polling places.</p>
<p>Our Outstanding Innovations honorees harnessed the buy-in of election officials to <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/office-secretary-state-wa-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner">secure statewide databases</a> and election management systems, utilized <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/yolo-county-elections-office-ca-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner">geographic information systems</a> to improve operations, developed apps for <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/ann-arbor-city-clerks-office-mi-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner">shortening lines</a>, conducted extensive <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/coconino-county-elections-office-az-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner">outreach to tribal lands</a>, engaged the community with <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/maricopa-county-recorders-office-az-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner">roundtable discussions</a>, and requested real-time feedback from voters through a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/salt-lake-county-election-division-ut-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner">handy QR code</a>.</p>
<p>The Election Worker category offered new approaches to the recruitment of high school poll workers, enhanced existing election worker pools through creative mailings, and improved training through interactive video modules.</p>
<p>Given the upcoming 2020 elections, the EAC’s Clearinghouse Awards offer an excellent stage to highlight new field-tested programs from recent elections and promote their successes for replication across the U.S. We would like to extend a big thank you to everyone who shared their initiatives, whether in the form of a program or “I voted” sticker. During 2020, the EAC looks forward to continuing to provide best practices and other innovative programs to help with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. On behalf of myself and my three fellow commissioners, congratulations to the 2019 Clearinghouse Awardees!</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: The Election Worker category will be announced on Friday, Jan. 24. You can find all the winners on the <a href="http://www.eac.gov">EAC website</a> and we&#8217;ll include that information in next week&#8217;s newsletter as well. )</em></p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Speaking to National Public Radio, Shelby Pierson</strong>, the nation’s intelligence community election threats executive said that<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse"> threats to U.S. elections in 2020 could be broader</a> and more diverse than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a Russia-only problem,&#8221; she told Noel King on Morning Edition. &#8220;We&#8217;re still also concerned about China, Iran, non-state actors, &#8216;hacktivists.&#8217; And frankly &#8230; even Americans might be looking to undermine confidence in the elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierson said that the intelligence community is expanding its technical capabilities and trying to develop more human sources to alert it to interference efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Officials from the FBI and the Department of Justice announced</strong> last week that the FBI will<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/fbi-will-now-notify-state-election-officials-when-any-part-n1117321"> notify state election officials about cyber breaches</a> to elections systems in their states even if those breaches only affect one county. According to NBC News, typically the FBI notifies only the victim of a cyber intrusion, but if the FBI only notifies local officials, “it may leave the state officials with incomplete knowledge of the threats,” an FBI official told reporters on a background call.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>A new National Public Radio/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll finds</strong> that<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/21/797101409/npr-poll-majority-of-americans-believe-trump-encourages-election-interference"> 41 percent of Americans don’t believe the U.S. is prepared</a> to keep the November election safe and secure. Two-thirds of Democrats think the country isn&#8217;t prepared, while 85% of Republicans said they think it is. &#8220;Like so many issues, Americans view election security from opposite poles of the partisan divide,&#8221; said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. According to NPR, driven by Democrats and independents, 56% of those surveyed think the president has not done very much or has done nothing at all to make sure there will be no future election interference — although 75% of Republicans think he has done enough.</p>
<p><strong>By a 2 to 1 vote, Iowa’s Registration Commission</strong> has<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2020/01/17/iowa-linn-county-auditor-complaint-voter-registration-vulnerable-dismissed/2774034001/"> dismissed a complaint filed by Linn County Auditor</a> Joel Miller. In the complaint, Miller alleged the state voter registration system does not meet security standards mandated under HAVA. “We won’t rush to judgment on what to do next, but I think there is a good case to appeal because federal law is very clear that a hearing shall be heard and that didn’t happen,” Miller told the Des Moines Register. The four-person registration commission is tasked with preservation and maintenance oversight of Iowa’s voter registration records.</p>
<p><strong>Chalk this up to the law of unintended consequences</strong>. Beaver County, Pennsylvania announced recently that it would<a href="https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20200120/no-stamp-beaver-county-to-cease-providing-postage-for-absentee-ballots"> no longer be covering the cost of return postage</a> for absentee ballots. In the past, the county had covered those costs, about $20,000 in a presidential election year. However, a new Pennsylvania law which allows for no-excuse absentee voting means that more people than ever before could be voting by mail. “With the volume of requests we’re going to get with the state going to mail-in voting, it makes sense to eliminate the postage,” orene Mandity, director of the Beaver County Bureau of Elections told the Ellwood City Ledger. “There’s going to be a high turnout I think, three or four times more than a normal presidential election.”</p>
<p><strong>The law of unintended consequences part 2</strong>. Voters in Falls County, Texas will be using brand new voting machines this year after a<a href="https://www.kxxv.com/news/local-news/courthouse-move-melts-voting-machines"> move to a new facility destroyed the county’s existing voting machines</a>. It seems the 8-9 hours in the moving trucks melted the plastic rollers inside the ballot scanning machines. &#8220;I have no words. I have no words. What do you say to that? Really, what do you say to that?&#8221; Terri Westmoreland, a voter in Marlin aske KXXV. Weighing the cost of repairing aging voting equipment with refurbished parts vs. purchasing all new equipment, the county went with spending $250,000 on 36 new voting machines. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to be the &#8220;hanging chad&#8221; county of Texas,&#8221; Falls County Judge Jay Elliot told KXXV.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing polling locations is never easy</strong>. The Smith County, Texas commissioners court was under fire this week for its<a href="https://tylerpaper.com/news/local/county-commissioners-defend-polling-location-to-be-added-at-juvenile/article_9739c4ba-3c7d-11ea-9e78-9b096a7b8094.html"> decision to locate one of the county’s 35 vote centers</a> at a juvenile attention center. Residents speaking out against the location compared the location to voter suppression and one even invoked the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “’Our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter,’ and I cannot be made silent on this matter,” voter DeAnn Fox. “I just feel very strongly about that.” Fox was joined by other residents like Mike Nichols who said he did not want to have to tell his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren that their polling location is at a jail. According to the Tyler Morning Telegraph, Commissioner JoAnn Hampton pushed back. “It is one of the nicest facilities that we have in Smith County. You do not have to go through security. You just walk in, you go to the right into the conference room,” Hampton said. “You don’t even know it’s a juvenile attention center, not a detention center. And we do that because we care about the students here in Smith County, and I do not appreciate you saying we are doing voter suppression because we are not.” The commissioners court voted unanimously to locate the vote center at the attention center.</p>
<p><strong>Sticker News</strong>: The<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200121/ri-elections-board-looking-for-i-voted-submissions"> Rhode Island</a> board of elections is hosting a statewide competition for members of the public to design “I Voted” stickers to be used during the 2020 election cycle. According to <em>The Providence Journal,</em> the submission period for designs will be open through March. “We want it to represent something uniquely Rhode Island,” Miguel Nunez, deputy director of elections said. At the end of the submission period, board members and the secretary of state will each choose a finalist, and during the beginning of April, the public will be able to vote on a winner. The winning design will be announced in early May, Nunez said.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: U.S. Sens, Bob Casey, D-Pa., ranking member of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,  have introduced the<a href="http://www.bradfordera.com/news/local/casey-introduces-bill-to-remove-barriers-to-voting/article_11531d07-97ba-5f20-ab1e-c2e25f3258fa.html"> Accessible Voting Act</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Two pre-filed bills sponsored by Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, would allow<a href="https://www.timesdaily.com/news/bills-seek-to-expand-early-voting-in-alabama/article_66b98ab4-2620-582c-8457-cae54780a0f0.html"> early voting up to 14 days before an election</a>, and would abolish the need to apply for absentee voting. House Bill 28 would allow voters to vote absentee without having to supply an excuse, and House Bill 30 would require each county to provide at least one voting center to be open for in-person voting for 14 days preceding an Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Rep. Jay Lawrence, R-Scottsdale has introduced a bill (HB 2137) that would require<a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/arizona-lawmaker-wants-police-posted-at-every-polling-place/article_11989c9f-0125-50e4-b3da-0c273d9c92c8.html"> police to be posted at every polling place</a> in the state. According to the <em>Capitol Media Services</em>, Lawrence said this isn’t about mediating disputes between election officials and people who are told they’re not registered to vote. “We are talking about contentious, we’re talking about anger, we’re talking about someone who comes in and intends to disrupt the polling place because of the politics,” Lawrence said. “There are individuals in our society whose anger is so thorough, so extreme, that they will do anything they can.”</p>
<p>Rep. Bob Thorpe (R-Flagstaff) has introduced HB 2461 that would essentially<a href="https://www.yourvalley.net/stories/arizona-lawmaker-wants-to-keep-students-from-voting-where-they-go-to-school,132453"> prohibit college students from voting where they attend school</a> instead of where their parents live. According to <em>Capitol Media Services</em>, the bill would spell out that anyone who is living in a dormitory “or other temporary college or university address” is presumed to be there only temporarily and is there “with intent to return to some other permanent address.”</p>
<p>The House Elections Committee voted unanimously to support a bill that will allow officials to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1405471/house-panel-approves-faster-vote-counting-process-maricopa-county"> resolve ballot issues digitally</a>. The current process to correct a ballot requires a physical duplicate copy of a ballot be printed and filled out in full, even if there’s only one vote on the ballot in question. That takes election workers an average of 12 minutes. The proposed legislation would allow ballots to be duplicated digitally. That would allow election workers to identify and correct individual questions on ballots, a process that takes less than one minute to resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> The Senate has approved House Bill 73 that would allow for<a href="https://delawarestatenews.net/news/senate-votes-to-repeal-lodging-tax-authorization-expand-absentee-voting/"> no-excuse absentee voting</a>. The measure, the first leg of a constitutional amendment, passed the House 38-3 in April but fell short of the necessary two-thirds threshold in the Senate just after midnight on July 1, 2019 before the chamber gaveled out for the year. The Senate was able to move the bill this year after several senators were persuaded to change their previous no votes. Gov. John Carney supports the measure, although as a constitutional amendment it must pass again in either 2021 or 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Gov. J.B.

The proposed amendment would allow Ohioans to register and cast a ballot on the same day during the early-voting period, including on Election Day. It also would enact automatic voter registration.

The bills  would make knowingly destroying or failing to deliver a voted ballot a felony, appropriate $1.8M so the state can tap into $8.6M in federal matching funds to improve elections security and would remove electronic methods of ballot return for military and overseas voters.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The Florida Supreme Court has sided with Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republican lawmakers who argued that<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article239355253.html"> felons must pay back all court-ordered fines</a>, fees and restitution before registering to vote. “We conclude that the phrase, when read and understood in context, plainly refers to obligations and includes ‘all’ — not some — LFOs [legal financial obligations] imposed in conjunction with an adjudication of guilt,” justices wrote according to <em>The Miami Herald.</em></p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A trial to determine whether<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/local/gluegate-trial-begins-in-bid-to-overturn-morris-township-election/"> 42 uncounted provisional ballots</a> in a race for Morris Township committee began this week. In a situation that’s become known as Gluegate, Peter Mancuso was declared the winner by just 15 votes over Democrat Bud Ravitz after a recount of the November 2019 general election.  Democrats want to see if the 41 uncounted votes will reverse the outcome of the election. The ballots were not counted because the ballot envelopes were not properly sealed allegedly due to issues with glue on the ballot envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> A federal judge has ordered a<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/federal-judge-delays-voting-machine-case-against-pa-department-of-state/"> month-long delay</a> in a case that seeks to bar the state’s use of the ExpressVote XL touchscreen voting machines violates a legal settlement that sets higher standards for election security in the commonwealth.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: The South Carolina Elections Commission has settled a lawsuit filed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign, the South Carolina Democratic Party and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Under the agreement, the state will<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article239387333.html"> no long require voters to provide their entire Social Security numbers</a> when registering to vote. They will only have to provide the last four digits, which is the case in 47 other states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Attorneys for the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, or WILL, asked the<a href="https://www.wpr.org/conservatives-ask-state-high-court-reverse-voter-purge-ruling"> state Supreme Court to overturn a state appeals court&#8217;s Jan. 14 decision</a> to place the original Ozaukee County judge’s ruling to purged 209,000 from the voter rolls.  on hold.

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> According to the secretary of state’s office, a<a href="https://www.sj-r.com/news/20200121/voter-registration-glitch-gets-bipartisan-criticism"> programming error</a> led to more than 500 possible noncitizens being registered to vote. Secretary of State Jesse White’s office discovered last month that between July 2, 2018, and Dec. 13, 2019, registration information of 574 people was “improperly forwarded” to local election authorities to be registered, even though those people had indicated while at secretary of state facilities that they were not citizens. According to the <em>State Journal-Register</em>, of those people, registered under an automatic voter registration system for people who apply for driver’s licenses or state identification cards, 16 ended up voting, including one who voted in three elections and another who voted in two, according to State Board of Elections spokesman Matt Dietrich. Combined, 19 ballots were cast statewide in the general election of 2018, the consolidated primary of spring 2019 and the consolidated election of spring 2019. The Illinois House executive committee will be<a href="https://www.sj-r.com/news/20200122/hearing-planned-on-voter-registration-glitch"> holding a hearing</a> next week on the problem.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Welcome the Roughrider State to the growing list of states that<a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-electronic-pollbooks-set-to-go-out-to-north-dakota/article_c451dd5b-0644-5e1c-9636-f7c5ea771ab8.html"> rely on e-poll books</a> to check-in voters on Election Day. Although North Dakota has no voter registration, it does maintain a central voter file and the use of e-poll books in all 53 counties will help maintain that file. While Secretary of State Al Jaeger touts the new machines as an election security benefit, local county auditors told <em>The Bismarck Tribune</em> they see them as a time saver. The poll books are part of larger purchase that included 425 ballot scanners, 425 assistive devices for voters with physical difficulty in marking ballots and 53 central count machines for processing absentee and mail ballots. The new equipment will all be used for the first time June.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Utah County has finalized a deal for an<a href="https://kjzz.com/news/utah-county-hopes-to-boost-voter-turnout-save-people-time-with-new-app"> election app</a> that voters can use to choose a party affiliation, request a primary ballot and confirm that they returned a signed ballot. According to KJZZ, The thousands of people who mail back their ballots without signing them are contacted by elections officials. Only half responded in Utah County during the last election, so the other 1,000 votes could not be counted. “Oftentimes they’re difficult to contact,” said Josh Daniels, chief deputy clerk, “and they don’t return the affidavit in a timely fashion. With a convenient mobile option, they’ll be able to return those forms quicker, and we’ll be able to count those ballots, which will actually increase total voter turnout.”</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> This week, voters in the King Conservation District were able to<a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/morning-edition/npr-story/798126153"> begin casting their ballots via mobile app</a> in the District’s election, which is open to about 1.2 million voters in Seattle and more than 30 other cities. Voting, which can be done via app or by mail closes on February 11. According to NPR, King County voters will be able to use their name and birthdate to log into a web portal and cast their votes. Once they’ve completed their ballots they must verify their submission and submit a signature via the touchscreen on their ballots. The King County elections office will print all submitted ballots and count those along with ballots received by mail. The county is working with Democracy Live on the technology. Security experts and Secretary of State Kim Wyman have expressed<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/secretary-of-state-questions-online-mobile-voting-plan-in-king-county-race/"> concerns</a> over the program.</p>
