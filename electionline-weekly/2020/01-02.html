							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election 2020</strong><br />
<em>Voting observations at year’s start</em></p>
<p>By Adam Ambrogi, Program Director, Elections<br />
<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4922" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" />2020 will be our fifth presidential election at electionline.org – we at<a href="https://www.democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a> have been proud to continue supporting and growing the work that started at<a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en"> Pew</a> and has been heralded at different points by<a href="https://www.forsmarshgroup.com/about/leadership/doug-chapin/"> Doug Chapin</a> and Mindy Moretti.</p>
<p>This is an important election to get as “right” as we possibly can.</p>
<p>It means candidates and campaigns behaving responsibly, election officials administering elections fairly and advocates and voters getting informed and promoting access so all the votes get counted. Wanted to kick off the new year with some thoughts about opportunities and challenges facing the elections world in the year ahead.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION #1</strong><br />
<em>The security race since 2016: election officials and advocates have been working like crazy to help promote election security since 2016, but the successes may not be uniform and the cybersecurity playing field is still challenging for election administrators.</em></p>
<p>More than I would’ve thought possible, election officials at the state and local level, combined with good-government advocates, have worked intensely over the last three years, attended numerous convenings, forums, table-top exercises aimed at helping prepare themselves for a cybersecurity intrusion or other attempts to manipulate the election process. Given the broad scope of this challenge, this community pushed legislators and other government entities for the action. Some states have changed laws and Congress has provided funding (but has not made substantive legal change some believe are justly needed) in response.</p>
<p>So, this year, we will see the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> Election Assistance Commission</a> release a second tranche of election security funding move from the federal government to the states this year. Compared to the 2018 funding, states will have a few more months to plan and use the funding; the question is how states should be using the funding. Each state is in a different place when it comes to election security — and so each state needs to assess what is the best next use of the federal funding.</p>
<p>One challenge that remains is ensuring that some of the funding comes down to local election officials—where the vote casting and counting actually occurs. In 2018 the distribution of federal funds to the local election officials was uneven, and our Democracy Fund/Reed College polling identified that election officials from smaller jurisdictions had less awareness of the cybersecurity risks than larger jurisdictions, with larger staff. If we accept the premise that part of interest in foreign intrusion is to make us lose confidence in our way of counting votes, every jurisdiction, small and large, needs to increase their awareness and capacity to identify and defend against threats, and check their results when they’re done.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION #2</strong><br />
<em>The potential for surge in voter turnout: while election officials have been necessarily working at dealing with the newest threat and focus (risk of foreign intrusion), the fundamentals still raise concerns about how we prepare for an ever-charged and nervous electoral and political system.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3308" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin-300x176.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="176" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin-300x176.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wisconsin.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wherever you land on the ideological spectrum (including a nonideological framework), most observers feel like there is both heightened interest and heightened concern. For those who work in elections and voting issues, that presents a unique challenge. Every change, no matter how small in the system can be seen to aid one side or disadvantage the other. Combine this with polling indicating that the public is much more interested in voting in the 2020 election (compared with prior elections at this point in time). If that high level of interest holds, we may have a higher level of turnout than the last similarly situated presidential election (2016).</p>
<p>While the race to understand and change policies around security concerns was and is necessary, planning for 2020 has to include the potential for much higher turnout. In many ways, election officials are in a better position for higher turnout elections, as more states have early voting and no-excuse absentee mail voting than in 2020. But if the planning is a little off, and contingency plans are not in place, the inevitable error at a busy polling place may result in a line that comes to a halt, and nervous first-time voters may be frustrated at the speed of voting.</p>
<p>Many election officials work hard to educate the public to develop a voting plan and identify ways to reduce the “time cost” of voting. The focus on cybersecurity can’t be the reason why polling place management and a voter-centric service suffers in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION #3</strong><br />
<em>Implementation of new laws matter: a good deal of reform has occurred in 2019 and appears to continue the trend where states are (hopefully responsibly) changing their laws in the ‘off federal election’ year. </em></p>
<p>There is a good deal of modernization of election laws that have been passed or adopted over the last year. The number of states joining the<a href="https://ericstates.org/"> ERIC</a> system grew, as did other adoptions of other voter registration improvements. Even New York, who has at times served as a lagging indicator of modern elections made some improvements in early voting and other policies.  These changes are smartly adopted in a non-election year, giving states time to implement in local/state elections and then the federal primary election.</p>
<p>However, implementation of voting is complicated, especially in a tense political environment (as described in Observation #2 above). Any one change in an election system presents opportunity for complications but applying multiple changes at the same time take careful planning and strong communication efforts with stakeholders and the public.</p>
<p>If states are making changes in how people vote and they aren’t working with election officials, voter and civil rights advocates and the media to ensure awareness and strong implementation of new provisions, they run the risk of causing confusion connected to elections.</p>
<p>Communications awareness and responsiveness are essential in making sure the reality of a new policy is upheld. And we need to be aware that not every interaction will be perfect. On election day, over a hundred million Americans engage in the voting process; outside of tax filing day there is no equivalent of people interacting with government. Problems will emerge, should be fixed, and practices improved for the next cycle. But smart planning and implementation of new policies are key to reduce the number of problems around Elections.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION AND THANKS</strong><br />
At the start of this year, it’s also appropriate to give thanks — starting here with Mindy Moretti of electionline.org who wakes up every morning at an unusual hour to cultivate news, for the great staff at Democracy Fund’s elections team who work to both understand and improve the election and voting system every day of the year.</p>
<p>I’m also thankful for the advocates, election officials and academics who work hard every day to try to imagine a better system of voting, and the year we all we are about to enter. 2020 will test many elements of our elections, but I am confident we will be able to rise to the challenge and that the United States will have an election worthy of its’ people, accessible, free and fair.</p>
<p>Happy New Election Year!</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>A review by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong> has found<a href="https://www.wral.com/federal-review-finds-no-evidence-hacking-caused-2016-durham-election-problems/18860107/"> no evidence that hacking caused electronic pollbooks to shut down</a> on Election Day in 2016 in Durham County, North Carolina. In the 12-page report, federal cyber security experts say they &#8220;did not conclusively identify any threat actor activity,&#8221; but that aspects of the state&#8217;s election security could be improved. According to WRAL, state elections director Karen Brinson Bell said the state is working with county boards and the federal government &#8220;to improve security at every step in the voting process.&#8221; CISA said it assessed 24 Durham ePollbook laptops, 21 USB drives and two images of a desktop computer used to download voter registration information from State Board servers for transfer onto the USB drives during the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p><strong>The Texas secretary of state’s office has given the go-ahead</strong> to three more counties to move permanently the vote center model beginning in 2020. The counties —<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2019/12/30/dallas-tarrant-win-approval-to-move-forward-with-countywide-voting/"> Dallas, Tarrant</a> and<a href="https://www.fox7austin.com/news/secretary-of-state-approves-hays-county-countywide-polling-program-for-future-elections"> Hays</a> — represent more than five million people. The counties all successfully piloted vote centers during the 2019 election cycle.</p>
<p><strong>The Wisconsin Elections Commission</strong> has<a href="https://www.wpr.org/state-election-panel-deadlocks-again-how-address-ruling-voter-list-purge"> deadlocked on what to do next</a> after a circuity court judge ordered that the commission purge approximately 234,000 voters from the state voter rolls. The ruling has been appealed and an additional federal lawsuit has been filed. The appeal and pending litigation are what prompted the Democratic election commissioners to vote against moving forward with the purge. Elections Commissioner Mark Thomsen, one of the panel&#8217;s Democrats, said those lawsuits should be allowed to play out before the voting rolls are changed. &#8220;It would seem to me premature and wrongheaded for the commission to jump ahead,&#8221; Thompson said according to Wisconsin Public Radio. Republican Dean Knudson, a former GOP state lawmaker who chairs the Elections Commission, said that he felt it was important for the commission to take action following the court order. &#8220;We are under a court order from the circuit court in Ozaukee County to follow the law,&#8221; Knudson said according to WPR. &#8220;I wish the law was clearer. But I feel like we need to do our best to follow the law.</p>
<p><strong>A recent audit by the Michigan Office of Auditor General</strong> found that state and local elections officials<a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2019/12/27/audit-michigan-bureau-elections-voter-registry/2757039001/"> routinely kept their access to the statewide voter registration database</a> after they should have been removed. The review found:  7% of state workers and contractors with administrative access to the voter registry still had access to the system after they left state employment; 12% of users with non-administrative access to the system did not have that access removed when they no longer needed it to do their jobs; About 25% of users were granted more access to the system than they requested; 57% of system administrators didn’t get proper approvals before receiving access to the voter registry; and 5% of voter registry users did not have an active account on the Bureau of Elections’ online tool that provides information and guides for the registry. According to <em>The Lansing State Journal</em>, the Department of State acknowledge the issues but said there have been no documented cases of problems. &#8220;The audit has been helpful in identifying additional opportunities for improvement,&#8221; Department spokesman Jake Rollow said in an email. &#8220;The Bureau has taken steps to address some areas identified in the report, and will continue to make further improvements in 2020 and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In the waning hours of 2019</strong>, and just under a state mandated-deadline,<a href="https://fox43.com/2019/12/30/dauphin-county-commissioners-vote-to-buy-new-voting-machines-comply-with-state-mandate/"> Dauphin County</a> because the<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pa-new-voting-machines-for-2020-with-paper-trails-20200101.html"> last county</a> in Pennsylvania to commit to a new paper-based voting system in time for the 2020 election cycle. But the 2 to 1 vote wasn’t without controversy. &#8220;To put a new system in place in the heaviest election cycle,&#8221; said Commissioner Jeff Haste. &#8220;There is makes no sense to me at all. I&#8217;ve talked to a number of poll workers, judges of elections,&#8221; said Haste. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve not had one think it&#8217;s a good idea to move forward.&#8221; According to Fox 43, even the two commissioners voting in favor of moving forward with the purchase did so reluctantly.</p>

She was instrumental in many initiatives that are still ongoing in the York County Voter Registration and Elections Office.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Manchester Representative Andrew Bouldin is the lead sponsor on a bill that aims to more clearly spell out the fact that<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/lawmakers-aim-spell-out-absentee-voting-rights-people-jail-nh#stream/0"> people in jail have the option of voting</a> by absentee ballot. Bouldin says he&#8217;s only proposing a change in the absentee paperwork, not any additional requirements on the part of state elections or corrections officials. &#8220;So my bill just looks to add language and a check box to that form that would indicate that they could request an absentee ballot for that reason, and cast their ballot from jail,&#8221; he told New Hampshire Public Radio.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Senator Brian Kelsey has introduced legislation that would allow county elections officials to<a href="https://wreg.com/2019/12/30/memphis-lawmakers-file-legislation-to-change-early-absentee-voting-procedures/"> tabulate early and absentee ballots earlier on Election Day</a> and then release those numbers exactly at 7 p.m. when the polls close. “I think that we should do whatever we can to give the voting public confidence in the process and let them know that everything is fair and equitable,” said House sponsor Rep. John DeBerry. “Early tabulation will engender that confidence. If folks are waiting until 11p.m. or midnight, or the next day to find out what happened in their community’s polls, they wonder. I think that this will engender confidence in the system and the process and make folks believe that they are fully in control.”</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Delegate Joseph Lindsey plans to introduce a bill that would eliminate the commonwealth’s Lee-Jackson holiday and create an<a href="https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/local-news/proposed-bill-could-increase-voter-turnout-in-virginia/"> Election Day holiday</a> instead. Lindsey introduced similar legislation in 2019, but it failed to get out of committee.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> In a 32-page ruling, Judge Steve Jones says he<a href="https://www.gpbnews.org/post/judge-upholds-georgias-no-contact-voter-purge-98000-inactive-registrations"> does not have the jurisdiction to order the state</a> to add back about 98,000 voters who were recently removed from the state’s voter rolls. Jones wrote that the complaint &#8220;appears to be that the Secretary of State (and therefore the State of Georgia) has improperly interpreted and failed to adhere to Georgia’s new voter list maintenance statute&#8221; but it was improper to ask a federal judge to interpret state law. He also said the plaintiffs did not show evidence the list maintenance violated the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> Secretary of State Paul Pate has identified nine voters that allegedly<a href="https://www.weareiowa.com/news/local-news/iowa-secretary-of-state-paul-pate-double-voting-2018-election/"> voted twice</a> in the 2018 general election. Those voters are suspected of voting in Iowa after already voting in another state. Those individuals have been referred to county attorneys.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Three groups that help ex-prisoners rejoin society have filed suit against a state law that<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/civil-rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-over-felon-voting-restrictions-n1107856"> prohibits convicted felons from voting</a> until their full sentence is complete, not just their jailtime. They argue that the restrictions violate the state constitution, unduly hurt African Americans and discourage voting by those who have fulfilled their sentences.</p>
<p>Also in North Carolina, U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Bigg has officially issued a preliminary injunction against the state’<a href="https://www.wral.com/federal-judge-blocks-voter-id-in-north-carolina/18861700/"> voter photo ID law</a>. A full trial on the state&#8217;s voter ID law is planned in the coming months, but for now it&#8217;s up to Attorney General Josh Stein whether and how to fight the judge&#8217;s order.</p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Preparations to roll out Real ID in the commonwealth seem to be having an<a href="https://www.messenger-inquirer.com/news/local/real-id-causing-issues-with-voter-registration/article_505cd17e-30e7-5e77-92c1-7da9aae8c8a8.html"> impact on the voter registration system linked to driver’s licenses</a>. As the process of catching up from where the voter registration books were closed for the General Election, our office noticed some issues (with voter registration reports from Circuit Court Clerk&#8217;s Office),&#8221; Daviess County Clerk Leslie McCarty told the <em>Messenger-Inquirer</em>. &#8220;We noticed in the first week of December with them not printing any records from individuals who have been issued or renewed their license. Whatever is happening with the transportation part it isn&#8217;t connected to what it is supposed to. I think there are other clerk&#8217;s offices facing the same issue. As of now, the state is checking with the Department of Transportation to try and get it fixed. If you have made any changes from Nov. 7 to now, you need to call our office and make sure that that information is correct.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> In order to accommodate election day registration, Maryland will use an<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-to-use-expanded-wireless-network-during-2020-elections/2019/12/29/ebfbc220-228b-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html"> expanded wireless network</a> to transmit new registrations from local polling places to state officials throughout Election Day. Nikki Charlson, deputy administrator at the Maryland State Board of Elections told <em>The Washington Post</em> the only information the network will carry is who is registered and has voted, not how any person voted. The same type of network is used by law enforcement and public safety agencies, she said. “It’s using cellular data, but it’s a secure and closed network,” she said. “No one can find it, and the data’s encrypted, and the network is encrypted.” state Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) said the networking equipment, which will cost counties hundreds of thousands of dollars, is not needed and “makes us more vulnerable to hacks and attacks.” She plans to sponsor emergency legislation in January to ease deadlines under which local officials must tally votes. Such a change, she said, should eliminate any justification for “this risk and cost . . . so that we put the brakes on this terrible idea.”</p>
