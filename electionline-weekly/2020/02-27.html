														<p><strong>What to watch on Super Tuesday</strong><br />
<em>Voters in 14 states head to the polls or mailboxes on Tuesday</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4922" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Super Tuesday, which began more than a month ago for some elections offices, comes to an end on Tuesday as voters in 14 states head to the polls on primary day or drop that mail ballot in a drop box.</p>
<p>The 14 states voting on Tuesday are: <a href="https://www.sos.alabama.gov/"> Alabama</a>,<a href="https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/"> Arkansas</a>,<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/"> California</a>,<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado</a>,<a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/"> Maine</a>,<a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/"> Massachusetts</a>,<a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/"> Minnesota</a>,<a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/index.html"> North Carolina</a>,<a href="https://www.ok.gov/elections/"> Oklahoma</a>,<a href="https://sos.tn.gov/"> Tennessee</a>,<a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/"> Texas</a>,<a href="https://elections.utah.gov/"> Utah</a>,<a href="https://sos.vermont.gov/"> Vermont</a>, and<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/"> Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>Following Super Tuesday, there will be contests almost every Tuesday, and some weekends too, through June 2.</p>
<p>Since 2016, so much of the focus has been on election security and Tuesday will be the first big test of all those security measures and changes that have been put into place.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about security. Elections officials have spent countless hours and dollars purchasing new equipment, training staff and volunteers and educating the public, but since the last time the American public when to the polls en masse, there have been many changes.</p>
<p>How will the voting public cope? How will elections officials? While we think everything is worth watching on an election day, these are the things we’ll be keeping an eye on on Super Tuesday and beyond. .</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Election Security</strong><br />
Tuesday will mark the first big election security test of the 2020 cycle. State and county elections officials have spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours preparing for any eventuality. Will they be ready? Federal officials along with various cybersecurity experts,  vendors and advocates will be monitoring the entire thing from a situation room in the Washington, D.C.-area.</p>
<p><strong>Voting Machines</strong><br />
Counties in many of the Super Tuesday states will be using new voting equipment for the first time. Will voters and poll workers be ready? In<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-22/early-voting-opens-in-l-a-some-problems-reported"> Los Angeles County</a>, Tuesday will mark the first big test of the county’s new in-house designed voting system. While some worry about what will happen when infrequent voters meet new machines in<a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/politics/concern-over-worn-out-voting-machines-rises-as-super-tuesday-lingers-around-the-corner/91-df32d735-4557-4abe-a275-04c6faa7e98c"> Arkansas</a> there are concerns about the aging voting machines being used by 11 of the state’s counties on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Vote Centers</strong><br />
Several of the largest voting jurisdictions in the country will be using countywide vote centers for the first time in presidential primary election on Tuesday. Will these new vote centers help increase turnout? Will there be confusion about where to go? Will these vote centers help speed up the reporting process for elections officials?</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5201" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-27-at-11.27.09-AM-300x193.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-27-at-11.27.09-AM-300x193.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-27-at-11.27.09-AM-1024x659.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-27-at-11.27.09-AM-768x494.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-27-at-11.27.09-AM.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Voter ID</strong><br />
Although the courts have put<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/18/politics/north-carolina-voter-id-law/index.html"> North Carolina</a>’s voter ID on hold for the presidential primary, will that news have made it to poll workers? In<a href="https://www.wkrg.com/top-stories/star-i-d-is-not-required-to-vote-in-alabama/"> Alabama</a> there has been some confusion about whether or not a voter must have a Star ID — Alabama’s version of the Real ID — in order to vote. Secretary of State John Merrill has mounted a public education campaign explaining that the Star ID is not required to vote, but could this cause confusion at the polls on Tuesday? In<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Texas-Secretary-of-State-launches-voter-education-15081311.php"> Texas</a>, the secretary of state’s office is leading an effort to make sure that voters know about the state’s ID requirements which have changed since the last presidential election. “This initiative is aimed at ensuring voters are prepared and informed about the forms of identifications that are needed to cast their ballot,” Secretary of State Ruth Hughes said according to the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Turnout</strong><br />
While interest in the 2020 election cycle is high will that translate into turnout? Although early voting is no real indicator of overall turnout it’s been up in some places, on par with 2016 in others and even down in a few spots. Will there be lines on Super Tuesday and more importantly will those lines actually be moving?</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5203" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/results-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/results-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/results-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/results.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Results</strong><br />
The American public has an appetite for instant gratification, especially when it comes to election results. How quickly will<a href="http://www.pasadenanow.com/main/locals-unsure-when-results-will-come-in-on-election-night/"> Super Tuesday results</a> be known and will voters be able to accept that some of those results are going to take a while?  Also, will candidates accept the results? In some of the states Tuesday isn’t just the presidential preference primary, it’s also the primary for state and local races. In recent years we’ve seen a rise in the number of lawsuits challenging the results. Will there be any on Tuesday?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Late-breaking Litigation</strong><br />
Another day, another lawsuit. Currently there are dozens of pending election-related lawsuits. Will we see any filed either on Super Tuesday or as the result of Super Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Social Media</strong><br />
What role will social media play on Tuesday including potential misinformation/disinformation campaigns? Even well-meaning voters sometimes contribute to misinformation campaigns by citing problems they heard about online without any sort of confirmation. Should a problem arise, will Twitter and Facebook work to take down problematic posts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unknown unknowns</strong><br />
As we do every election day we like to quote former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. “We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don&#8217;t know we don&#8217;t know.” Will there be any unknown unknowns on Super Tuesday and if so, what will they end up being?</p>
<p><strong>Super Tuesday Dispatches</strong><br />
We’ll be bringing you updates throughout Super Tuesday. After our initial morning posting, we’ll post updates roughly around 9:30am, 12:30pm; 3pm and 7pm. You can find all those dispatches <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/weekly/march-3-2020/">here</a> [starting Tuesday morning!].</p>

Pierson’s continued roll came into question after a February 13 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee about Russia’s possible interference with the 2020 election angered the president.</p>
<p>“Ambassador Grenell has not asked me to leave,” Pierson said in an interview with <em>The New York Times</em>. “In fact, he has encouraged and affirmed his support for my position here in the organization. I have not asked to depart nor discussed resignation in any way.”</p>

The survey released Friday found that more than a quarter of registered voters, 27 percent, view voter fraud as the top concern for U.S. elections, followed by foreign interference at 19 percent. Another 14 percent said that viral misinformation was a major concern, while the same percentage called voter suppression the biggest issue facing U.S. elections. Eight percent of voters said poor administration of elections was a concern, while 17 percent said they were not worried about election security altogether.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hill</em> both the House and Senate will be<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/484096-congress-to-get-election-security-briefing-next-month-after-intel-drama"> briefed</a> on March 10 by administration officials on election security.</p>

Security and accessibility, it’s not a question of either/or, we have to have both, because really it’s an issue of civil rights,” Lou Ann Blake, the deputy executive director of Blindness Initiatives at the National Federation of the Blind said according to <em>The Hill</em>. “With the movement to paper ballots, that status of first-class citizenship is now threatened &#8230; paper ballots are not accessible, you cannot make them accessible.”</p>
<p><strong>Disinformation</strong>: Reporter Darrel Rowland with <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em> has an article about the<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/02/24/2020-election-disinformation-presidential-race/4725496002/"> “tsunami” of disinformation</a> voters can expect to face this year. The article also includes a helpful<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/02/24/disinformation-2020-presidential-election-heres-language/4726983002/"> glossary of disinformation terms</a>. And it’s not just Russians or Iranians that Americans need to worry about Joshua Tucker, director of New York University’s Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia told Rowland that Now that U.S. political operatives have seen the Russian toolkit firsthand, domestic sources could become the biggest source of disinformation in what likely will shape up to be a bitter presidential campaign.</p>

Krebs told The Hill that he spends 40 to 50 percent of his time on election security issues. In the interview, Krebs said he does what he does because of his children. One of the reasons I’m doing this job is because I’ve got five kids and I want them to have a United States of America,” Krebs said. “I want them to be able to vote, when they get to 18, and have confidence in the process. I want [to secure] the systems and the networks that they’re going to depend upon in the future.” The article did not discuss Krebs’ controversial stance on pineapple on pizza.</p>

Some of the county’s early voting centers were unable to open on time Saturday for a variety of reasons including machines that weren’t yet delivered and missing security codes. “This is part of the beauty of having the additional days,” Deputy Communications Director Michael Sanchez told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. “Of course, in a perfect world, we’d want to make sure everything is up and running when we open, but the fact of the matter is we have additional days under this new voting model, and that’s part of the benefit. We can fix all of these opening-day issues.” According to KCRW, voters have expressed<a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/las-new-voting-centers/la-voting-centers-open"> praise</a> for the new process. About 2,300 voters in<a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/election/local-election/article240625217.html"> Fresno County</a> received duplicate ballots because their names appear two different ways in the county’s voter registration database. “I know who they are and we will look at each one of them to make sure that no one votes twice,” County Clerk Brandi Orth told the <em>Fresno Bee.</em> “And, that only one ballot is counted.”</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Voters headed to the polls on Monday in the commonwealth’s<a href="https://www.lowellsun.com/2020/02/24/first-ever-period-of-early-voting-underway-in-mass/"> first-ever early voting</a> period for a presidential primary and so far it seems well-received. Secretary of State William Galvin reported that the secretary’s early voting web page had more than 35,000 views over the weekend in advance of early voting. “We had people waiting at the door when we got here this morning. We’ve processed probably 20 ballots in the past hour,&#8221; Pittsfield City Clerk Michele Benjamin<a href="https://www.wamc.org/post/berkshire-voters-taking-advantage-early-primary-voting"> told</a> WAMC.</p>

The site also houses the county probation and parole department. “They called it in to the address, to York Chester Plaza,” Elections Director Adam Ragan explained to the <em>Gaston Gazette</em>. “My guess is somebody had an appointment with their probation officer and had a little too much fun over the weekend and decided to call something in.” Ragan said the threat did not slow early voting, or compromise the site’s security.</p>

<p><strong>Because every. single. vote. counts</strong>. In Arkansas, a recent primary runoff for an open seat in the Arkansas House ended in a tie after early and regular ballots were cast. According to the <em>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</em>, election officials pored over issues with a number of absentee and provisional ballots that had been cast, but not counted in the original results. Most of those ballots ended up not being eligible to be counted, however, and the decisive vote came down to<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/feb/22/ballot-from-sweden-breaks-house-race-ti/"> a single ballot mailed from Sweden</a> that was counted at the Pulaski County Election Commission&#8217;s office. Officials at first were not going to count the ballot because it included the voter’s address in Sweden, not Arkansas, but commissioners decided to count the ballot after being able to confirm multiple points of the voter&#8217;s identity with other documents sent to the commission.</p>

The result is a list of inspirational books that will help to educate, entertain and diversify reading libraries at home.” We think it’s a great list and would also add One Vote, Two Votes, I Vote, You Vote from the Cath in the Hat’s Learning Library.</p>

Trump and the Republican National Committee are spending more than $10 million on a<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/michigan-voting-lawsuits-rnc-trump-116142"> legal campaign</a> to challenge voting-related lawsuits brought by Democrats. According to <em>Politico</em>, the multi-million-dollar effort pits the two parties against each other on the issue of voting rights, with Democrats contending that they’re trying to make it easier for more people to cast ballots — and Republicans arguing that they must guard against potential fraud.</p>

According to <em>Courthouse News</em>, county officials say they were notified that SEIU Local 521 could start their strike by this Friday and “if allowed to occur and continue, will result in the inability of approximately 1.2 million registered county voters to vote in the March 3, 2020, presidential primary election.” County Counsel James Williams seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction “enjoining and restraining” union members and representatives from going on strike because they perform essential public services related to the election.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Ron DeSantis has asked the full 11th Circuit to review a case against a law requiring former incarcerated residents to repay all their fines and restitution before their<a href="https://www.cltampa.com/news-views/florida-news/article/21117828/despite-court-ruling-florida-gov-ron-desantis-asks-court-to-keep-preventing-exfelons-from-voting"> voting rights can be restored</a>. The request for the en banc hearing comes after a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit ruled that the new law was unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5204" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-27-at-11.48.17-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> Advocates have once again filed suit against Georgia’s new voting system this time citing<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-says-georgia-election-system-fails-protect-secret-ballots/2bSjo0c0fwr4LH14FT72pL/"> privacy concerns</a> as the root of their suit. The lawsuit says that highlighted selections of candidates displayed on touchscreens are visible from 30 feet away. Polling places will have blue cardboard or plastic barriers around the touchscreens, but the lawsuit contends they’re inadequate. “This is a silly and desperate attempt by an out-of-state organization to interfere with Georgia elections,” Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs told <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>. “This organization’s policy stance failed at the ballot box, failed in the General Assembly and has failed in the courts.” On Wednesday, Sumter County Superior Court Chief Judge R. Rucker Smith<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/judge-rejects-ballot-secrecy-case-against-georgia-voting-touchscreens/vo188WlAurtpfczx6YgCZN/"> denied an emergency motion</a> to require paper ballots filled out by hand instead of by computer.</p>
<p>A lawsuit filed this week alleges that the DeKalb County Board of Registration and Elections<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dekalb-illegally-canceled-dozens-voter-registrations-lawsuit-says/8sWX3GCmZTDVeAMFLJCYUM/"> illegally purged more than 50 registered voters</a> between December 2018 and November 2019. According to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the lawsuit states that county officials have “encouraged, solicited, and acted on extraordinary voter challenges that extend beyond the routine list maintenance activities that are required by state and federal law.” It also claims DeKalb removes voters “in a non-uniform and discriminatory manner.”</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Circuit Court Judge Larry Roberts heard arguments this week in the disputed<a href="https://www.djournal.com/news/court-hears-challenge-of-monroe-county-supervisor-election/article_4668b13d-7ccb-5e66-a97e-7dd4ebd8c731.html"> Monroe County supervisor election from November 2019</a>. Brian Atkins, who lost by just 14 votes, challenged the election contested more than three dozen ballots. Atkins argues that election officials accepted 20 or more ballots that should have been excluded. Another 18 votes that should have been counted were not, according to the complaint.</p>

The lawsuit names the winning candidate along with Monmouth County Superintendent of Elections Mary Desarno, County Clerk Christine Hanlon, Holmdel Township Clerk Wendy Patrovich and the Monmouth County Board of Elections as defendants. The suit claims that as many eight ballots were improperly excluded from the count, and that at least 10 votes were illegally cast by non-residents.</p>

<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate Pro Tem Phil Berger have filed a motion with the state court of appeals for a hearing on the state’s<a href="http://nsjonline.com/article/2020/02/legislative-leaders-file-motion-to-have-voter-id-case-reheard/"> voter ID law</a>. The motion calls for an en banc hearing, which is a procedural move requesting a rehearing of the case by a 15-judge panel — which would mean convening the entire state Court of Appeals.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The Public Interest Legal Foundation has sued Allegheny accusing the county of<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/02/25/Allegheny-County-voter-rolls-maintenance-lawsuit-voting-registration-act/stories/202002250168"> violating the National Voter Registration Act</a> by not undertaking a “reasonable effort” to remove the names of ineligible voters from the rolls. Named as defendants are David Voye, manager of elections, county Executive Rich Fitzgerald, county Councilwoman Bethany Hallam and county Councilman Sam DeMarco — who make up the board of elections and are responsible for supervising list maintenance.</p>
