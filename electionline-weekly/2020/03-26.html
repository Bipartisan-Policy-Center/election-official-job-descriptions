							<h2>In Focus This Week </h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Being a poll worker during a global pandemic</strong><br />
<em>Six CTCL staffers served as election judges in Illinois</em></span></p>
<p>By Whitney May<br />
<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Tech and Civic Life</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a decade ago: the first iPad was released, “Tik Tok” was just a popular song by Ke$ha, and I was training election judges in Durham County, North Carolina. At the time, our training curriculum focused on standard procedures like setting up voting equipment, processing voters, controlling ballot reconciliation paperwork, and completing provisional envelopes. We also covered a handful of mild  ‘what if’ scenarios, including “What if an election judge tries to sell Tupperware in the voting enclosure?” In 2010, cybersecurity and global pandemics were not on our radar for training topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward 10 years and today’s election officials (and the poll workers they manage) are operating in a new reality where more and more rapid response plans are being added to their long list of fundamental election responsibilities. At the <a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Tech and Civic Life</a> (CTCL), we’re supporting election departments to meet these rising challenges by providing tools, training, and best practices. And we believe being a poll worker is one of the best ways to serve our local communities and stay grounded in the evolving profession of election administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 17th, six of CTCL’s Chicago staff served as election judges for the 2020 Illinois Presidential Primary during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were stationed in both the city and the suburbs, in school auditoriums and American Legion halls, as ballot clerks and epollbook operators. For some of the team, this was their first election judge experience while for others it was a return to the post. This is our story</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Anxious start with special precautions</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one might guess, we had anxiety from the start due to many factors surrounding COVID-19. We wondered if the other election judges would show up. Would the primary be postponed at the last minute like Ohio? How would we set up the voting space for social distancing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, the primary happened and the staffing levels were manageable for most of our polling places. We worked within the physical constraints of our voting enclosures to create more space between workstations and voting booths where possible. And while we weren’t always able to achieve the recommended 6 feet, there were instances where it was easier to implement.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5320 alignleft" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL1-251x300.png" alt="" width="251" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL1-251x300.png 251w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL1.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/team/josh-simon-goldman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Simon Goldman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who served as an election judge in the City of Chicago, creatively used masking tape to mark spots for voters to stand while they were waiting in line to check in.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/team/rocio-hernandez/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocío Hernandez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Cook County election judge, received pop-up reminders on her epollbook screen throughout the day. The reminders encouraged election judges to follow</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/election-polling-locations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> basic guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We all took other health precautions like bringing hand sanitizer, latex gloves, and sanitizing wipes. In fact, most of the election judges we worked with brought their own supply as well as a surplus to share with the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some voters had their own safety gear and ballot-marking pens, which was voter behavior we hadn’t seen in previous elections. Overall, it was clear that staying healthy was a top concern and a team effort. There was the sense that we were (and are) all in this together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Low levels of turnout and high levels of gratitude</strong><br />
</span></p>
<div id="attachment_5321" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5321" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5321" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL2-225x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL2-225x300.png 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL2.png 556w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-5321" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Whitney May prepping a ballot privacy sleeve in her polling place while wearing protective latex gloves</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to following special precautions, we were also curious about voter turnout during a pandemic. Would COVID-19 discourage people from leaving home to vote on Election Day? Would the arrival patterns change? The Chicago Board of Elections did take steps to encourage more people to vote before Election Day. This included extending early voting hours and vote-by-mail request deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the</span><a href="https://chicagoelections.gov/en/election-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unofficial results currently show about 31% turnout for the City of Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is lower compared to previous primaries with comparable contests like the 2008 and 2016 primaries which both had voter turnout over 50%. But even with lower turnout, there was a steady stream of about 250 voters across each of our assigned polling places. And the slower pace of the day provided us with time to wipe down booths, touchscreen voting machines, pens, doorknobs, and table surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While turnout was depressed, our spirits were not. Election judges, voters, and others expressed gratitude for each other and democracy. One voter brought us chocolate candies along with sanitized serving tongs wrapped in aluminum foil. The school we were in, which was closed, was offering free breakfast and lunch to students in the neighborhood and they offered their packed meals to us as well. Overall, most people were effusive, even one voter who lamented that the pandemic had closed all the Chicago pubs on St. Patrick’s Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5322" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL3-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Considerations for November 2020</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With remaining state primaries in limbo and the Democractic presidential primary race inching closer to a winner, much of the nation’s attention is now turning its focus to the general election in November. And the working assumption is that COVID-19 will continue to disrupt business as usual, elections being no exception. With this in mind, election officials, experts, and government leaders are exploring ways to ensure all eligible citizens will have safe, convenient, and accessible options to participate. These include options to register to vote as well as request, receive, mark, and cast their ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on our election judge experiences, we’re interested in how election departments might successfully:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjust policies, procedures, and resources to manage an increase in mail ballots</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invite more people to vote by mail, and communicate deadlines that give voters adequate time to request, receive, and return their ballot</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform voters of their options to return their mail ballot, whether that’s to a polling place, drop box, and/or vote center</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruit and train enough poll workers to maintain safe and convenient in-person voting locations before and on Election Day</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While so much is uncertain right now, you can count on CTCL to stay curious, be poll workers again, and continue supporting election officials with tools, training, and best practices that address the newest challenges in the field. You can find</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/vote-at-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CTCL resources to support your office with implementing vote-by-mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we’ll be expanding these webinars  in the coming weeks and months. And recognizing that accurate, up-to-date election information is more important than ever this year, we’re also offering</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/course/trusted-info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online courses in May and July to boost election departments’ digital communication skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we continue working through these unprecedented times, CTCL is here to produce materials that are helpful to you. We need your feedback to make that happen.  What resources or support would be useful to your election office during the COVID-19 pandemic? What questions are you trying to answer right now? What do your policymakers need to know?</span><a href="https://forms.gle/Rn6R7gemd1wW6QS27"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Share your ideas about election administration during COVID-19 by completing this form.</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bipartisan Policy Center:</strong> In response to the current health crisis posed by COVID-19, BPC hosted an E-briefing with state and local election officials to dig into some of the major issues facing elections during the pandemic. Some of the topics covered during the briefing were how Florida dealt with conducting their March 17 primary during the pandemic and the move to have more and more elections conducted by mail, what that means on the front end, for voters, and especially what that means on the back end for state and local elections officials. It was a great conversation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>National Association of Secretaries of State</strong>: This week, NASS President Paul Pate (Iowa) and President-elect Maggie Toulouse Oliver (New Mexico) penned an</span><a href="https://www.nass.org/node/1824"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Congress and American voters on election preparations during the COVID-19 pandemic. In their letter, Pate and Toulouse Oliver elaborated on states’ readiness to conduct elections during the pandemic as well as called on Congress to “recognize the necessity for flexible funding to meet each of our specific needs. We would also encourage them to aid the U.S. Postal Service, as they are absolutely necessary for sending and receiving mail ballots from absentee, military and overseas voters.”</span></p>

According to the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>,  officials would send postcards to every Ohioan with instructions on how to apply for an absentee ballot. Anyone who hasn’t cast an early ballot already would have to print off a paper application, or call their county elections and request one be mailed to them, and mail it in. Elections officials then would mail an empty ballot with a postage-paid envelope. Voters would have until April 27 to mail it back or drop it off at at a curbside county ballot box, and votes would be counted on April 28.</span></p>

The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020. On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.  This week, the EAC initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. &#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221; Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Continuing Education</strong>: A new online project by the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University and a coalition of foundations has unveiled a new project that they hope will better educate the public about the civil rights movement and the approval of the Voting Rights Act.

The project uses footage from Ava DuVernay&#8217;s 2014 movie &#8220;Selma&#8221; and attempts to show students how events in 1965 shaped voting rights. &#8220;It&#8217;s perfect timing, unfortunately, because of the crisis we are in,&#8221; Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. told <em>The Associated Press</em>. &#8220;Not only is the timing optimal for teachers who are developing online lesson plans but also for families.&#8221;</span></p>

I’m tired of waking up at night in a cold sweat and in the morning — all stressed out — and that was well before all of the coronavirus concerns.”</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alaska:</strong> This week, the Senate approved a proposal that would give the lieutenant governor the power to order</span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2020/03/25/emergency-law-may-allow-alaskans-to-vote-by-mail-in-august-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statewide election by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the August primaries if the public health emergency continues. If the Legislature were to extend the public health emergency through November, the lieutenant governor would have the power to order the November general election to be conducted by mail, also.</span></p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong><a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/20rs/sb2.html?????????"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has passed both chambers of the Legislature.

If signed into law, it would be in effect for the November general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Kentucky, the Legislature has approved a bill that would require counties to purchase more</span><a href="https://wfpl.org/bill-requiring-secure-voting-machines-advances-without-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secure voting machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although election officials estimate it will cost about $80 million statewide to replace the voting machines, no funding was included in the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The General Assembly has approved a bill that would</span><a href="https://www.mvtimes.com/2020/03/23/bill-allow-towns-postpone-local-elections-heads-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow municipalities to postpone 2020 local elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, push back voter registration deadlines and increase voting options while the commonwealth is in a state of emergency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: State Sen.

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A North Carolina appeals court has rejected a request by Republican lawmakers to have all 15 of the court’s judges hear a lawsuit challenging the state’s</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-carolina/articles/2020-03-24/voter-id-ruling-remains-as-appeals-court-nixes-rehearing"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter ID law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ohio</strong>: State Rep. Tom Brinkman (R-Mt.Lookout) has sued Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor and Justices Michael Donnelly, Patrick Fischer and Melody Stewart saying they violated the state constitution when they issued a decision dismissing a legal challenge to the</span><a href="https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/22/ohio-lawmaker-cincinnati-sues-supreme-court-justices-over-primary-delay-decision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election delay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they did not include an opinion, or explanation why. “The Ohio Constitution is quite clear that the Supreme Court must provide reasons for all its decisions in all cases,” Brinkman told FOX19 NOW. &#8220;I am simply asking the court to comply with the constitution. It’s that simple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> In a lawsuit filed in Travis County district court, the Texas Democrats are asking a judge to declare that a portion of the Texas election code allowing voters to cast a</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/20/citing-coronavirus-threat-texas-democrats-sue-expand-mail-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mail-in ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they suffer from a disability applies to any voter in Texas &#8220;if they believe they should practice social distancing in order to hinder&#8221; the spread of the new coronavirus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Judge William Conley has ruled that Wisconsin residents</span><a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/federal-judge-extends-online-voter-registration-deadline-as-covid-/article_ed6f5604-8cd9-576a-a39d-755045f3d284.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can register online to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until March 30. The original deadline was the 18th and the state Democratic party sued to move the deadline. It is apparent that some accommodation is necessary to preserve citizens’ right to vote amidst this unprecedented public health crisis,” Conley wrote in his filing. Conley denied all other requests from the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which were to extend the March 18 deadline for mail-in registration, waive certain voter ID and proof-of-residency requirements, and extend the absentee ballot receipt deadline.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Wisconsin, the</span><a href="https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/24/coronavirus-green-bay-sues-wisconsin-officials-over-election/2912185001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> City of Green Bay is suing state officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to delay the spring election and move it to mail, arguing an in-person election will endanger poll workers and residents amid the growing coronavirus crisis.  The lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court asks a judge to order the state to cancel the April 7 election and mail ballots to all registered voters, a decision that would impact all Wisconsin communities beyond Green Bay. The city also wants the state to extend the deadline for voter registration to May 1 and give municipal clerks a June 2 deadline for counting mailed ballots.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The West Virginia Supreme Court will hear arguments in the ongoing battle over whether four</span><a href="http://www.spiritofjefferson.com/news/article_7233e492-6eb0-11ea-aead-3b4d883bbb96.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cast during Harpers Ferry June 2019 municipal election should be counted. The hearing is set for May 19.</span></p>

You can explore how states rank on a range of indicators, and zoom in on select district and county-level data to get a local snapshot of the communities you care about.</span></p>
