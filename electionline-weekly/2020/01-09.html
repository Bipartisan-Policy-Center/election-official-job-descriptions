							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Improving Motor Voter registration</strong><br />
<em>A Colorado case study</em></p>
<p>By Lisa J. Danetz<br />
Special to electionline</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve traveled across the United States working to understand and improve state motor voter registration services, as yet another step towards ensuring all eligible individuals have the opportunity to register to vote in the United States.</p>
<p>My goal has been to learn from each state’s experience, share its findings with others, and encourage strong connections between the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officials – who, through the motor voter process, are now the source of 45% of the nation’s voter registration activity – and the election officials who administer the elections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4959" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Welcome-to-CO-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Welcome-to-CO-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Welcome-to-CO-768x509.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Welcome-to-CO.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Colorado, in particular, has stood out as a state that has implemented one of the more modern, collaborative, and user-friendly motor voter registration systems in the country.</p>
<p>In five years, Colorado implemented motor voter registration upgrades including updated policies and technology, and successfully transformed an inefficient multi-step paper-based system into a modern streamlined electronic automatic voter registration system that complies with the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).</p>
<p>These changes led to a decrease in DMV transaction time by 20 to 30 seconds, contributed (along with a larger DMV IT system modernization) to a four-minute reduction in the DMV’s initial wait time, and increased access and usage of motor voter registration opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>How Colorado made this happen</strong><br />
While each state has its own set of obstacles to navigate – like differing agency priorities, resource shortages, bureaucratic resistance, and technology challenges– <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/resources/colorado-motor-voter-registration-case-study/">Colorado’s story of success can serve as a guide</a> to overcoming these obstacles to serve a state’s citizens and ultimately improve the strength of our democracy. Most notably:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relationship Development</span><br />
In Colorado, relationship development was key. Both Elections Director Judd Choate and DMV Senior Director Mike Dixon recognized and prioritized relationship-building and communication between their offices to address and upgrade the state’s motor voter registration processes. Over several years, the development of a strong and trusted relationship between their teams allowed process upgrades to come to fruition. The initiation of the state’s NVRA Working Group was especially significant, bringing all stakeholders together to provide input and buy-in, and to recognize the potential of the DMV IT system modernization project.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internal Advocacy</span><br />
Differing missions and priorities between agencies do not need to be a roadblock. In<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4960" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CODMV-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CODMV-169x300.jpg 169w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CODMV.jpg 563w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /> particular, while voter registration is one of the core concerns of elections agencies like the Colorado Department of State (CDOS), it is simply one of many responsibilities handled by the DMV—and one for which they often do not receive direct funding. That can make it difficult for an entity like a DMV to prioritize process changes when what’s in place seems to work. The legal memos and explanatory presentations that CDOS prepared for CDOR helped move along the understanding of the need to make process fixes—and the resulting benefits.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investment of Resources</span><br />
More frequently than not, process changes involve the investment of significant resources – both time and money – and these process changes were no different. Fortunately, the Colorado DMV was already planning an IT modernization of its driver’s license system. Including motor-voter registration modifications was a cost-effective method to improve that system as well. The costs for the motor voter changes were easily absorbed into the project. In addition, for those upgrades that were not part of the original DMV system modernization, CDOS paid for the DMV motor voter registration technology upgrades and worked with the Colorado Department of Revenue (which houses the DMV) to write the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead to 2020</strong><br />
Perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from Colorado’s experience is that our systems must constantly adapt and evolve to fit the changing needs of our citizens and voters. In fact, the Colorado legislature recently passed a bill in May 2019 that requires the state to adopt and implement “Oregon style” automatic voter registration by July 2020.</p>
<p>As the state prepares to implement this latest set of changes, it is the perfect time to examine the breadth of the already-implemented process upgrades and the robust data available about their impacts to date. While what works for one state is not a guarantee that it will work in another, Colorado’s efforts provide important lessons for policymakers to consider in devising their own motor voter registration upgrade plans.</p>

							<h2>Election Security Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>This week, West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner</strong> issued a special advisory to local election officials in response to<a href="https://www.journal-news.net/journal-news/special-advisory-issued-to-election-officials-by-secretary-of-state/article_f0e341de-b705-5761-b0b5-2205960a968a.html"> heightened cyber threats</a> due the increased risk of geopolitical tensions in light of the recent actions involving Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world we live in today is one where asymmetric warfare is the norm, and cyberattacks have become the weapon of choice for rogue regimes like Iran,&#8221; Warner said according to The Journal. &#8220;West Virginia&#8217;s mantra to &#8216;protect, detect and correct&#8217; has become the standard protocol used by the nation&#8217;s elections community to thwart cyberattacks. Soleimani&#8217;s death amplifies our state&#8217;s preparations.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New research from the University of Michigan</strong> finds that<a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/bmd-verifiability-sp20.pdf"> voters who use ballot-marking devices</a>—touted as more secure than DREs because voters can confirm their choices on a paper print-out—rarely actually check those ballots after they are printed. Professor J. Alex Halderman, five graduate students and one high school student asked 241 volunteers to participate in a mock election using BMDs. Researchers made sure that each ballot had at least one misprint on it. Among volunteers who were not specifically encouraged to look for errors, only 40 percent even looked at their printed ballots before casting them, only 6.6 percent reported an error to a poll worker and only 7.8 percent mentioned finding an error during an exit survey. “Based on the performance of 241 human subjects in a realistic polling place environment, we find that, absent specific interventions, error detection and reporting rates are dangerously low,” the researchers wrote. “Unless verification performance can be improved dramatically, BMD paper trails, particularly when used by all in-person voters, cannot be relied on to reflect voter intent if the machines are controlled by an attacker.”</p>
<p><strong>Voters in several upcoming primary states</strong>, including California, Minnesota and Utah are struggling with the rules surrounding who is allowed to vote in what primary and what information is made public. In<a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/01/06/california-election-officials-address-confusion-over-no-party-preference-voting-in-states-presidential-primary/"> California</a>, voters registered as No Party Preference are required to request a Democratic ballot if they want to vote-by-mail. That deadline was this week. If they did not request a Democratic ballot they will receive a nonpartisan ballot with essentially no presidential races on it. They can take that ballot to a vote center and request a Democratic ballot. It they want to vote Republican they must register as a Republican by February 17. In<a href="https://www.twincities.com/2020/01/05/voter-privacy-will-put-an-asterisk-on-minnesotas-presidential-primary-secretary-of-state-says/"> Minnesota</a>, under a new law voters have to publicly choose which primary ballot they want and that information will then be available to the state’s four major political parties. And like in California,<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/01/04/utah-has-k-unaffiliated/"> Utah</a>’s unaffiliated voters, about 1-in-3 voters, must register as a Republican by Feb. 3 if they want to vote by mail in that primary and unaffiliated voters who wish to vote in the Democratic primary have until February 25 to request a Democratic mail ballot but they do not need to affiliate.</p>
<p><strong>Following a December ruling by Judge Loretta Biggs</strong> that<a href="https://www.wral.com/counties-will-stop-issuing-free-ids-after-judge-s-voter-id-order/18866227/"> put the state’s voter ID law on hold</a>, the North Carolina State Board of Elections has sent a memo to the 100 county boards of elections outlining steps they need to take in light of the ruling—and the state’s decision not to appeal the ruling until after the March 3 primary. Included in the memo was a directive to county BOEs to stop issuing free photo IDs and to remove any and all signage related to voter ID. Board of Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell told counties that new signage will be arriving soon.</p>
<p><strong>In 2019, New York’s Green Light Law</strong>, allowing undocumented residents to obtain driver’s licenses went into effect. Opponents of the law immediately cited fears of noncitizens being able to register vote as reasons to oppose the law. Last week, the Erie County Board of Elections voted to<a href="https://buffalonews.com/2020/01/03/elections-commissioners-agree-to-5-day-delay-in-processing-voter-applications-to-address-voter-fraud-concerns/"> delay processing all moto-voter registrations</a> by five days to ensure that no noncitizens were registering to vote. According <em>The Buffalo News</em>, the delay will give the County Clerk&#8217;s Office time to review the Election Board&#8217;s application list and flag any that may have been illegally submitted. If the County Clerk&#8217;s Office flags a name, the county Board of Elections will send a letter to the applicant requesting additional proof of citizenship before adding his or her name to the voter registry.</p>
<p><strong>Boone County, Missouri Clerk Brianna Lennon is hoping</strong> to<a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/boone-county-clerk-to-start-voter-education-initiative/article_76e41a96-2cdb-11ea-a4f1-ef047f0f1f5e.html"> use the power of social media to educate voters</a> in the county. Beginning last week, each Friday on the county clerk’s social media accounts Lennon and her staff will host “Facts Friday” where they will post factoids highlighting different aspects of elections including election dates/times, information about polling places and voting rights info. According to <em>The Missourian</em>, the campaign will also include “Why Vote Wednesdays”, with the clerk’s office highlighting different reasons why individuals vote and encouraging others to do so. Lennon described the Wednesday posts as a “fun, educational” way to encourage people to vote. “We’re also trying to create a dialogue about what is preventing people from being more involved in democracy,” Lennon told the paper.</p>

														<p><strong>California:</strong> Senate Bill 57 has died in the Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee. Authored by Sen. Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Nigel) SB57 would have made<a href="http://www.kmjnow.com/2020/01/07/sb-57-to-make-voter-registration-optional-at-dmv-fails-by-partisan-vote/"> voter registration through the DMV</a> optional instead of automatic.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> State Sen. Jeff Brandes (R-St. Petersburg), chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice has proposed SB 1354 that proposes a single checkbox on voter registration forms that includes the statement “I affirm I have never been convicted of a felony, or, if I have been,<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2020/01/06/bill-removes-controversial-voter-application-language-felons/2826222001/"> my rights relating to voting have been restored</a>.”</p>
<p>Brandes has also filed a bill that would require the address on a<a href="https://www.alligator.org/news/proposed-bill-amendment-would-require-matching-addresses-on-florida-voter/article_03f0e390-31f7-11ea-907c-bbe751200d7c.html"> voter’s ID</a> to match that on their voter registration.</p>

The bill has the support of Secretary of State Michael Adams.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: The Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee was set to debate bill S-4315 that would create a<a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2020/01/lawmakers-set-to-repair-njs-vote-by-mail-process-after-state-body-invalidated-it/"> mail-in ballot county reimbursement fund</a> with the secretary of state’s office. The measure would provide money to county clerks to implement two recent laws that had the clerks send 600,000 ballots to voters across the state last fall. It would place $4 million into the fund immediately, more than enough to reimburse the clerks for spending on the ballots in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>A bill allowing New Jersey to move forward with<a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/mosquera-jones-moriarty-bill-allow-online-voter-registration-moves-forward-assembly/"> online voter registration</a> and join 37 other states and the District of Columbia was passed out of an Assembly committee this week.</p>
<p>Sen. James Beach (D-Cherry Hill) is backing away from his proposal that would have allowed county clerks to<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/nj-lawmaker-backs-away-allowing-early-count-mail-ballots/"> open and tabulate vote-by-mail ballots</a> one week before Election Day. The bill,<a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/S4500/4306_I1.HTM"> S4306</a>, was voted out of committee unanimously. Now, Beach says if it comes to a floor vote, he will offer an amendment that removes the provision that allows the early tabulation of mail-in ballots. &#8220;After I looked into it, I’m not so sure it really is a good idea because of safety and security of the numbers,&#8221; Beach told WNYC.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has signed a bill into law that changes the way<a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/9034-ahead-of-2020-elections-cuomo-signed-affidavit-ballot-bill-that-roiled-queens-da-recount"> affidavit [provisional] ballots</a> are counted. The bill would allow election administrators to count affidavit ballots when they “substantially comply” with the requirements for filling them out.</p>
<p>Also in New York, the push to approve<a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/9037-senate-to-move-automatic-voter-registration-early-voting-2020-election-package"> automatic voter registration</a> is set to start as early as press time.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> A bill introduced by Del. Sam Rasoul (D-Roanoke) would bring<a href="https://augustafreepress.com/rasoul-bill-creates-ranked-choice-voting-true-open-primaries/"> ranked choice voting</a> and open primaries to the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam (D) is pushing a proposal in the General Assembly that would allow for 45 days of<a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/01/06/northam-pushes-expanded-early-voting-making-election-day-state-holiday/"> early voting</a> before an election. The proposal would also repeal Lee-Jackson Day as a state holiday and instead make Election Day a state holiday.</p>
<p>Del. Hala S. Ayala has pre-filed a bill that calls for the state’s department of elections to<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virginia-lawmaker-calls-study-blockchain-174913955.html"> study the use of blockchain technology</a> to protect voter records and election results. &#8220;In conducting its study, the Department of Elections shall (i) determine the kinds of blockchain technology that could be used to secure voter records and election results, (ii) determine the costs and benefits of using such technology as compared to traditional registration and election security measures, and (iii) make recommendations on whether and how to implement blockchain technology in practices affecting the security of voter records and election results.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Prosecutors in Mohave County are looking into whether<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/01/05/voters-town-once-run-by/"> as many as 22 people may have voted improperl</a>y in the Colorado City election in 2018. The people in question all seem to be members of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. According to the <em>Salt Lake Union Tribune</em>, after three candidates friendly to the FLDS won seats on the town council questions were raised about the residency of voters.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, a 2018 suit filed by the League of Women Voters of Arizona and Promise Arizona that argued the state’s<a href="https://ktar.com/story/2908344/voting-rights-groups-settle-lawsuit-against-arizona-over-registration-updates/"> lack of automatic voter registration updates</a> to match updated motor-vehicle addresses caused voters to be registered the wrong address has been settled.  Plaintiffs filed a motion in federal court to have the suit against the secretary of state’s office dismissed. The dismissal is contingent on the state providing more effective voter registration services for people updating their information at motor vehicle offices or online.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> A federal<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2020/01/06/whistleblower-karen-spranger-lawsuit-against-macomb-county-ousted-clerk-settled/2825516001/"> whistleblower suit</a> filed by two former employees of Macomb County Clerk Karen Spranger has been settled for $110,000. The employees had sued alleging they were fired in retaliation for ethics complaints they filed against Spranger for her hostile treatment of employees and other violations of county laws and policies. &#8220;For the present, we are done with Karen Spranger,&#8221; County Corporation Counsel John Schapka told <em>The Detroit Free Press.</em></p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Attorney General Josh Stein has said the state will appeal the recent ruling that put a halt to<a href="https://www.wect.com/2020/01/02/nc-attorney-general-will-appeal-voter-id-decision-wont-push-decision-before-primaries/"> voter photo ID</a> in the state, but he said that the state will wait until after the March 3 primary to pursue the appeal. To avoid any further voter confusion in the primary election in which absentee voting begins in just 11 days and to ensure that the primary election proceeds on schedule and is administered in an orderly manner, the Department will not seek a stay of this injunction before the primary,&#8221; he said in a release.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> In a federal lawsuit filed this week, the state Democratic Party and the campaign arms for national Democrats allege that the state is violating the U.S. Constitution and federal and state law by<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/01/06/texas-and-national-democrats-suing-state-over-voter-registration/"> rejecting voter registration applications</a> without an original signature. According to <em>The Texas Tribune</em>, In the lawsuit, the Democrats argue the secretary of state’s signature requirements are unconstitutional and impose “an arbitrary requirement that limits access to the franchise.” While the state allows eligible Texans to submit registration applications in person, by mail or by fax, Texas law “makes no reference” to requiring an original signature, they argue in the legal challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> According to the Moab Sun News, the Utah County officials are reviewing whether to pursue criminal charges against<a href="http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_927022bc-2db4-11ea-8d71-1b8381740621.html"> San Juan County Clerk</a> John David for electioneering. An investigation into claims of electioneering on the part of Nielsen was completed by the Weber County Sheriff’s Office in November. However, the Weber County Attorney declined to take on screening the investigation’s report for possible criminal charges.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The long-running dispute about whether or not to count certain<a href="http://www.spiritofjefferson.com/news/article_8d8904b0-324d-11ea-8113-fb009053cbaa.html"> provisional ballots in a Harpers Ferry June 2019 election</a> continued this week with court briefs filed this week by the secretary of state’s office and two candidates in the disputed race. According to <em>The Spirit of Jefferson</em>, Secretary of State Mac Warner wrote, —as he did earlier in circuit court—that West Virginia law requires the provisional ballots to be accepted. As part of his 11-page brief, Warner states that the ballots should be accepted despite clerical address errors made during voter registrations. “The outcome of this process tilts strongly toward counting votes unless there are concerns beyond merely technical ones,” the secretary of state’s brief states.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Late last week, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, which successfully sued the state Elections Commission to have roughly 234,000 residents removed from the voter rolls is calling for the Elections Commission to be held in<a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/conservative-legal-group-alleges-elections-commission-in-contempt-of-court/article_343fcbe4-050e-5679-8f30-3e2641a75567.html"> contempt of court</a> because they have not yet moved forward with the removal. In the same case, late on Tuesday the Wisconsin Court of Appeals announced that it will<a href="https://fox6now.com/2020/01/07/wisconsin-court-of-appeals-will-not-intervene-in-judges-order-to-purge-states-voter-rolls/"> not intervene</a> with an Ozaukee County judge’s order to immediately purge the state’s voter rolls. The appellate court said it is waiting for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide whether it will hear the case.</p>
<p>Also in Wisconsin, Chad Armstrong, 81, has been charged with<a href="https://wqow.com/2020/01/02/eau-claire-man-charged-for-voting-in-election-he-shouldnt-have/"> election fraud</a> for voting in the 2018 election even though he had been convicted of a felony.</p>
