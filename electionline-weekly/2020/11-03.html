							<h2>9:00 a.m. Update</h2>
														<p>Polls are now open throughout much of the country on Election Day 2020.</p>
<p>Lines formed before the polls opened in many locations, but so far in many places the lines are a volume issue not a technical issue.</p>
<p>There were however some technical issues including in<a href="https://www.news10.com/news/some-voting-locations-having-technical-difficulties-as-polls-open/"> Albany, New York</a> and in<a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/technical-problems-early-on-election-day-2020-already-in"> Syracuse, New York</a>. The problems in the Albany polling place were resolved by 7am and in Syracuse, they switched to manually processing ballots. In<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2020/11/03/voting-machine-mix-up-in-oswego-county"> Oswego County, New York</a>, voters were forced to fill out emergency ballots when there was a mix-up with voting machines.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/spalding-county-experiencing-county-wide-glitch-bringing-down-voting-machines/EPCV6RSBRFBLTJUVQXJZAIFO2U/"> Spalding County, Georgia</a>, voting machines are down countywide after a technical “glitch”.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/indianapolis-voting-live-election-day-updates-polls/6045183002/"> Marion County, Indiana</a> a lack of Wi-Fi and missing keys for voting machines have been reported in some places.</p>
<p>A polling place in<a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-county/2020/11/03/sebastian-polling-place-closed-because-covid-19/6136457002/"> Indian River County, Florida</a> was closed after the supervisor of elections was informed Monday night at 9:30pm that the site itself—an American Legion Post—had been closed due to COVID-19. Voters are being directed to another voting location.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/franklin-county-shifts-paper-pollbooks-after-data-upload-problem/6135788002/"> Franklin County, Ohio</a>, poll workers were forced to shift to paper poll books which could slow the voting process for the state’s largest county. The decision to move to the paper rolls came after an electronic file containing data about who voted early was too large and could not be synced with the e-poll books. &#8220;We can&#8217;t guarantee all the data would be there for all the most recent absentee activity,&#8221; Ed Leonard Franklin Co. BOE director told The Columbus Dispatch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a woman in<a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/pedestrian-struck-affton-polling-location/63-02669db0-a25b-4a84-b311-8dfec3210b3b"> Affton, Missouri</a> was struck and killed by a car outside of a polling place this morning.</p>
<p>And a small shout out to our hometown election officials at the D.C. Board of Elections. The elections dog and I walked by 3 of the cities 95 vote centers this morning and there were no lines at any of them. No early morning lines in DC is sort of unheard of!!</p>
<p>Finally, as we’ll remind you every time we post today, many media outlets update the same link/story throughout the day so if a headline on a link doesn’t match the headline to the story you pull up, scroll down!</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials in<a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/572ab1eb-05b5-47fb-a0fc-9ab4ecbde438"> Kansas City</a> are investigating vandalism at the WWI Museum which is also serving as an Election Day polling place. Early Tuesday, workers found spray paint on stonework near the entrance that said, &#8220;don&#8217;t vote and fight for revolution.&#8221; In a social media response, the museum said, &#8220;We are proud to be a polling location and condemn this attempt at voter intimidation. Our democracy is something that generations of veterans, including those in WWI, have fought to defend. We hope you’ll vote today and make your voice heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>And finally, at 9:57 a.m. it happened. An SUV crashed into a polling place in<a href="https://www.whio.com/news/local/reports-suv-hits-tipp-city-church-serving-polling-location-election-day/M25HLNYVSBGRZI6QF3EKIC3Z7Y/"> Miami County, Ohio</a>. According to WHIOTV, initial reports indicate the driver hit the gas pedal instead of the brake and crashed the vehicle into the building. It was not immediately clear if the crash impacted voting at the location, however reports into this newsroom indicate voting is still continuing as normal at the polling site.</p>

We shouldn’t have been there, absolutely, and they’re gone.” She wasn’t sure how long they were there, but said as soon as a reporter called, the lieutenant in charge was told to end the training.</p>

							<h2>5:00 p.m. Update</h2>
														<p>We start off this update with some very, very sad news. <a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/crime/2020/11/03/former-elections-commissioner-elaine-manlove-killed-crash-tractor-trailer/6136593002/">Former Delaware Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove</a>, who retired in June 2019, was killed in a car crash yesterday. We’ll have more in the newsletter this week, but for those who have been around this business for a while, <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2019/06-20/">Elaine</a> was one of the absolute best and this is just so incredibly sad.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/us/politics/an-armed-man-is-arrested-outside-a-north-carolina-polling-place.html">North Carolina</a>, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department said they arrested an armed man Tuesday who returned to a polling place after being banned from the site earlier in the day. They said in a statement that he voted at the site but “continued to loiter” afterward, prompting a call to the police. He was asked to leave by a supervisor at the polling place and was banned from returning, the police said. He left but later returned and was arrested and charged with second-degree trespassing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-nws-voter-accidentally-injured-with-gun-slate-belt-polling-site-20201103-ikc24r5e7fe6vebuhvfga3gibm-story.html">Northampton County, Pennsylvania</a>, a voter on his way to vote accidentally shot himself outside the polling place. “The gentleman was emptying his sidearm so that he would not have a loaded weapon in the polling place,” Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure confirmed. McClure said the man called 911 and drove himself to the hospital. He added that no one in or around the polling place heard or was aware of the incident. Northampton County became aware, McClure said, because it is responsible for the 911 system.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Petrese Tucker has granted 4th Congressional District candidate Kathy Barnette’s motion to temporarily hold off counting potentially defective mail-in ballots in <a href="https://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/story/news/2020/11/03/pennsylvania-election-lawsuit-montgomery-county-kathy-barnette/6140552002/">Montgomery County, Pennsylvania</a>. Tucker granted Barnette’s motion for a temporary injunction preventing the county from allowing any more voters to fix ballots that might otherwise have not been counted. The federal lawsuit filed by Kathy Barnette early Tuesday afternoon alleges the Montgomery County Board of Elections violated the state&#8217;s election code by inspecting ballots early.</p>

							<h2>8 p.m. Update</h2>
														<p>Polls are now closed/closing most of the Eastern and Central times zones.</p>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/investigations/2020/11/03/postal-service-blows-deadline-check-missing-mail-ballots/6149643002/">blew a court-ordered deadline</a> Tuesday to sweep mail-processing facilities in more than a dozen states for missing election ballots that could number in the hundreds of thousands. The sweep was to happen in 12 postal districts, including in battleground states Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan gave the agency until 3:30 p.m. to finish the task. The Postal Service said in its update to Sullivan at 4:30 p.m. that it was unable to conduct the sweep because it would have “significantly” disrupted its Election Day activities. Instead, the agency said, it would continue its preplanned daily review process in its 220 facilities nationwide that process ballots and would try to deliver any remaining ballots.</p>
<p>Republicans and the president’s re-election campaign asked the <a href="https://mynews4.com/news/local/nevada-high-court-asked-to-stop-vegas-area-mail-ballot-count">Nevada Supreme Court</a> to fast-track an appeal aimed at stopping the count of mail-in ballots in the Las Vegas area. Justices did not immediately set an Election Day hearing on an issue that could affect reporting the vote in Clark County and Nevada, with six electoral presidential votes at stake. Documents filed almost six hours after polls opened pleaded with the seven justices, who are seated in nonpartisan elections, to allow campaign-enlisted count-watchers to “meaningfully observe” operations at the busy Clark County elections office in suburban Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Due problems with voting machines countywide, <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/spalding-county-experiencing-county-wide-glitch-bringing-down-voting-machines/EPCV6RSBRFBLTJUVQXJZAIFO2U/">Spalding County, Georgia</a> has extended its polling place hours till 9 p.m. countywide. Voters who arrive from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. can cast a provisional ballot marked for extended voting times. Those votes will not be tabulated until Friday.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Mary C. Jacobson denied a request from the <a href="https://www.law360.com/newjersey/articles/1325499/nj-gop-loses-bid-for-count-of-mail-in-ballots-at-polls">New Jersey</a> Republican State Committee for an order directing poll workers to provide the total number of vote-by-mail ballots received at polling sites in the same way that state statutes require them to turn over the number of voters who used voting machines and provisional ballots.</p>
