														<p><strong>Happy Anniversary</strong><br />
<em>League of Women Voters celebrates 100 years</em></p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.lwv.org/about-us/staff-leadership/virginia-kase">Virginia Kase</a>, CEO<br />
League of Women Voters</p>
<p>Tomorrow the League of Women Voters of the United States celebrates <a href="https://www.lwv.org/about-us/history">100 years of empowering voters and defending democracy</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5125" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5125" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5125" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV1-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV1-300x233.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV1-768x595.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-5125" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Democratic convention 1920.<br /></em></p></div>
<p>Founded by suffragists on February 14, 1920, the League was established six months before the 19th Amendment was finally ratified.</p>
<p>Their mission at the time: to help the soon-to be enfranchised 20 million American women exercise their right to vote. Ten decades later, we are active in all 50 states with more than 750 affiliates around the country.</p>
<p>But as we celebrate our organization’s milestone and commemorate the centennial of women’s voting rights this year, we acknowledge that not all women were able to exercise their Constitutional right to vote in in 1920. Native Americans as a whole were not even afforded full citizenship until 1924 and even then, some were not able to vote because that right was governed by state law. Women of color and women with limited education and income faced barriers at the polls in the form poll taxes, literacy tests, and other voter suppression efforts including, in some cases, violence.</p>
<p>Even today, too many eligible voters are excluded from the process through modern day voter suppression efforts.</p>
<div id="attachment_5126" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5126" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5126" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV2-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV2.jpg 384w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><p id="caption-attachment-5126" class="wp-caption-text">League participates in voting is people power project in Flint, Michigan.</p></div>
<p>Since the Supreme Court gutted key provisions of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, we have seen an increase in attacks on the right to vote. Excessive voter roll purges, strict voter photo ID requirements, and cuts to early voting and same day registration are just a few ways politicians have limited access at the polls.</p>
<p>Misinformation campaigns and unscrupulous actors on social media and other digital platforms add to voter confusion.</p>
<p>That’s why the League is still here.</p>
<p>Over the last century, we’ve fought to protect voters, establish fair redistricting processes, secure our elections, and provide equal access to the ballot—all while maintaining our commitment to nonpartisanship and fostering an informed electorate. <a href="https://www.lwv.org/blog/2018-election-impact-report">In 2018, we reached 10 million voters</a> through our voter registration activities, candidate debates and forums, and <a href="http://vote411.org/">our election website, VOTE411.org</a>. In 2020, we are positioned to build on that success as we ramp up our efforts to reach and inform voters.</p>
<div id="attachment_5128" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5128" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-5128" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV4-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="219" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV4-300x205.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV4-768x525.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LWV4.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-5128" class="wp-caption-text"><em>In 1996 the theme of the League&#8217;s GOTV was Head to the Polls.</em></p></div>
<p>As we enter our next century, we are building future leaders to carry this mission forward. Our members, staff, and volunteers are advancing and defending democracy through our organizing, advocacy, legislative, and litigation efforts. We invite those who share our passion for voting rights to join us. There is room for all at democracy’s table.</p>
<p>Today, we ask you to <a href="https://www.lwv.org/women-power-vote-day-action-february-14-2020">celebrate 100 years of Women Powering the Vote by participating in our Day of Action online</a> or at one of more than 350 events happening around the country. Let’s stand in our power together, celebrating the women who came before us, and continue to build a stronger, more inclusive country where everyone can engage in our democracy.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign actors are increasingly sophisticated at using cyber tools and social media to probe and penetrate electoral infrastructure, manipulate public opinion, and cast doubt on the integrity of the election process. On the eve of another presidential election, vulnerabilities in our election systems remain unaddressed. This handbook provides a list of steps that local election officials can implement at relatively little cost to fortify their elections systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With primary season in full swing, time is limited for local election officials to spend large sums of money, pass additional legislation, or make large-scale changes to secure election infrastructure,” said elections integrity fellow David Levine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that Russian government-affiliated hackers probed election systems in all 50 states in 2016 and that Russia, China, Iran and other foreign actors may attempt to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. The</span><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Election-Officials-Handbook.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Official’s Handbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides recommendations for local officials that can be implemented at limited cost to the county or state. From ensuring the local elections website is hosted on a reputable .gov address to testing changes to voting procedures in low-risk settings well before election day, the handbook is designed to help local officials secure their election jurisdictions and promote confidence in our election systems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handbook’s six recommendations include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquire cybersecurity expertise.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form a local election cybersecurity working group. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure the elections website.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigate the potential insider threat.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help protect the integrity of the voter registration process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test changes to election infrastructure in simulated, lower risk settings.</span></li>

Although numbers aren’t official, all signs indicate a near-record high turnout which certainly kept polling officials busy but there were no real reports of lines or problems even at Hanover High School where Dartmouth students cast their ballots. According to The Dartmouth,</span><a href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2020/02/hanover-high-sees-busy-day-at-polls-significant-same-day-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1,015 residents used same-day registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the polls on Tuesday. “I wasn’t even thinking we really had to schedule more than one person at the same-day registration table, but a lot of younger people got up early and came in,” Town Clerk Betsy McClain told the paper.

According to The New York Times, the report said officials feared getting caught up in a heavily politicized environment and undermining public confidence in the electoral process. The committee recommended that elected officials and candidates should use “the absolute greatest amount of restraint The top Democrat on the committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, said in a statement that there were many flaws with the U.S. response to the 2016 attack, “but it’s worth noting that many of those were due to problems with our own system – problems that can and should be corrected.&#8221; He said he was particularly concerned that the fear raised by the Obama administration, that warning the public of a foreign attack could backfire politically, “is still present in our hyper-partisan environment.”</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Whether you live in a condo in the city or a cul de sac in the suburbs</strong>, odds are you’ve had a package stolen. According to one consumer marketing group, at least</span><a href="https://www.crresearch.com/blog/2019-package-theft-statistics-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 36 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans have reported having a package stolen. And it seems like voters in Florence Township, Michigan may have been a victim as well. St. Joseph County Clerk Lindsay Oswald shipped the township’s ballots to Clerk Alissa Bowers’ home on Jan. 21 via UPS and they never showed up, but on February 3 a resident notified clerk’s office to let them know that</span><a href="https://wwmt.com/news/local/ballots-found-in-the-road-after-being-delivered-to-florence-township-clerk"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballots were found on the road</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near the clerk’s home. Oswald’s office is busy reprogramming tabulators to they reject the original ballots if anyone tries to cast them and she is also working on “best practices” to make sure that local clerks know when ballots are on their way and that local clerks contact her when they’ve been received. &#8220;My hope is that whatever crime was committed is handled,&#8221; Oswald told WWMT, &#8220;but as far as the security of the election, I&#8217;m completely satisfied that we&#8217;ve addressed all angles to make sure that no more further crimes can be done to affect the election outcome.&#8221;</span></p>

The county will also post billboards and run ads on buses and the lightrail. There will also be ads on radio and Spotify. The campaign, which will be funded through the Allegheny County marketing budget, will run for two months ahead of the April 28 primary and for another two months ahead of the general election on Nov. 3.</span></p>
<p><strong>Under emergency rulemaking from Gov. Doug Burgum (R)</strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/02/06/us/ap-us-native-american-voting-north-dakota.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tribal officials on North Dakota’s five American Indian reservations would be able to verify provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for reservation residents. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, The revised system would allow tribes to quickly verify voters, rather than the previous system in which voters had up to six days to return with proof of their identity, possibly discouraging some voters from following through. The order also codifies in state rules the ongoing process of incorporating information from tribal IDs into new electronic poll books that will be used beginning with the June 9 primary election. Secretary of State Al Jaeger Jaeger said ballots marked by tribal members may now be verified by a tribe in conjunction with a local election board. “Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa would like to acknowledge appreciation of collaboration and communication” with the state, Tribal Chairman Jamie Azure said in a statement.</span></p>

Voter advocacy groups in Illinois are expressing concerns about what may happen to the noncitizens who were registered to vote. “It’s disappointing because the situation could have been avoided,” Lawrence Benito, head of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights told the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. “They voluntarily told people they were noncitizens. It was not their fault.” According to the paper, Whether that individual, or others yet to surface, could face criminal charges boils down the will of prosecutors. Experts say there’s little chance of charges being filed around Chicago, where the Cook County state&#8217;s attorney is a Democrat. However, authorities in more conservative pockets might be more inclined to act. Election officials said they have not been contacted by law enforcement.</span></p>

Republicans defeated the measure, arguing that the secretary of state could not verify the information on the IDs, which are issued by the tribes. They were also concerned that not every tribal ID provides an address, which could allow people who live outside the state to vote in South Dakota elections. On Wednesday, Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Virginia, by a 57-42 the House backed House Bill 1103 that will allow local jurisdictions to decide whether or not to conduct local elections using</span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/house-backs-bill-to-allow-ranked-choice-voting-in-local/article_95344103-da26-56f0-b23f-662a6086c823.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The measure moves to the Senate where a Senate-initiated version of the bill was killed in committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators are considering a bill that would</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/post/when-should-polls-close-election-day#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extend polling hours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 8 p.m. Polls in Virginia are some of the earliest to open at 6 a.m., but they close at 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By a 53-44 vote the House has approved HB201 that would allow</span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/house-backs-same-day-registration-and-repeal-of-voter-id/article_c9deb23f-3dae-5237-9779-264347d461a4.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> same day voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Voters would be able to show voter registration documents, bank statements, paychecks or any government document that shows the name and address of the voter. Voters who do not show valid identification when signing in to vote would be required to sign a sworn affidavit stating that they are who they claim to be. The signed statement subjects the person to Class 5 felony penalties if the statement is false.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Gov Jim Justice (R) has signed a bill into law that will allow counties to offer</span><a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/02/06/physical-disabilities-voting-bill-wv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters with disabilities to vote via online technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the same as those the secretary of state’s office has been using to allow military and overseas voters to cast their ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3947" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Wisconsin-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> The Milwaukee county supervisors have voted to</span><a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/milwaukee-co-leaders-vote-to-increase-funding-for-voter-registration-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase funding for voter registration resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from $50,000 to $100K. “This gives us more resources to do more and reach more people,&#8221; Executive Director of the Milwaukee Co. Election Commission and Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson told WDJT. &#8220;We are planning a very robust voter education outreach program and we hope this will help voters feel comfortable going to the polls, understand what they need when they go to vote and making sure they’re registered.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wyoming:</strong> The House is considering a bill that would clearly state that</span><a href="https://oilcity.news/wyoming/legislature/2020/02/12/wyoming-house-working-on-bill-that-secures-tribal-id-cards-as-valid-for-voter-registration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tribal IDs are a valid form of ID when registering to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The House approved the bill on first reading and must do so on two more readings before the bill is then sent to the Senate. The legislation says: “a tribal identification card issued by the governing body of the Eastern Shoshone tribe of Wyoming, the Northern Arapaho tribe of Wyoming or other federally recognized Indian tribe that contains the applicant’s driver’s license number, if the applicant has a driver’s license, and the last four (4) digits of the applicant’s social security number” would be considered valid forms of ID for voting registration.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Federal Judges:</strong> Several media outlets have stories this week about the recent</span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-is-elevating-judges-who-could-gut-the-voting-rights-act-185115809.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointment of federal judges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who have openly expressed their dislike of the Voting Rights Act. The nominations were “an opening salvo to 2020,” and not a welcome one at that, Lena Zwarensteyn, an expert on the judiciary at the progressive Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights told <em>Yahoo News</em>. She worried that these jurists were advancing “really extreme arguments when it comes to voting rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arizona:</strong> The 9th U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that Arizona’s 2016 ban on</span><a href="https://www.knau.org/post/arizona-ballot-harvesting-ban-effect-presidential-primary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot harvesting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the court overruled in January, can remain in place for the March 17 presidential preference primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> Officials have arrested 27-year-old Gregory William Loel Timm and charged him with</span><a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/02/08/police-van-drives-through-republican-partys-voter-registration-tent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two counts of aggravated assault on a person over 65-years old, criminal mischief and driving without a license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On February 8 Timm struck a tent where volunteers with the Republican Party were registering voters. Lt. Larry Gayle said after driving through the tent, the driver, now identified as Timm, stopped, took a video and “flipped off” the people who were inside the tent before driving away. Investigators have been monitoring social media to see if the video shows up. No injuries were reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> Federal District Judge Eleanor L. Ross disagreed with Gov. Brian Kemp who is a defendant in a 2018 lawsuit filed while he was still secretary of state. The suit alleges that Kemp used a</span><a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/federal-district-judge-deals-blow-to-gov-kemp-on-voter-roll-purge/85-4c3f14c9-0b55-44d2-91f0-d437ba6bad7f"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> racially-biased methodology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for removing as many as 700,000 legitimate voters from the state&#8217;s voter rolls during a period between 2016 and 2018. Kemp had demanded a summary judgement because the plain meaning of the language in the NVRA does not encompass the Crosscheck lists (because the Georgia SOS never fully utilized them). &#8220;The Court disagrees,&#8221; Ross said in her summary, &#8220;finding sufficient evidence in the record that would cast a genuine dispute as to the material facts on this issue.&#8221; In her conclusion, the judge said she is considering a summary judgment finding against Kemp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Georgia, U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ruled this week that plaintiffs in a lawsuit alleging that metro Atlanta’s four largest counties</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-over-long-election-lines-georgia-dismissed-with-warning/UZfnUP4Llak7QuSR6W64DJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> failed to provide enough polling places, voting machines and staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 2018 election, didn’t show how the court should intervene beyond ordering election officials to comply with the law. “This court does not sit as a guarantor of a flawless election,” Totenberg wrote. “The court is sensitive to and concerned with the potential for voter disenfranchisement that was felt in 2018. However, plaintiffs’ allegations fail to concretely establish how the court can effectively redress the asserted injuries.” Totenberg wrote that if county election officials can’t carry out their duties in this year’s elections, the plaintiffs could file another lawsuit on behalf of affected voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota has filed suit against Secretary of State Steve Simon alleging that state voting laws discriminate against voters who may need assistance. State law forbids political candidates from assisting any voters with their ballots, including in circumstances when the voter has a disability or language barrier. It is also a crime in Minnesota for one person to help more than three people vote, even if they have challenges doing so on their own. The suit argues that these state laws</span><a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4932197-ACLU-MN-sues-Minnesota-claims-state-voting-laws-violate-federal-Voting-Rights-Act"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violate the federal Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which &#8220;explicitly allows people who need assistance to choose who will help them to ensure voters are not disenfranchised because of disability or language barriers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> North Carolina</strong>: A transgender woman, identified as Jane Doe in the lawsuit, has filed suit against the North Carolina State Board of Elections and the Mecklenburg County board of elections claiming that she was<a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article240227061.html"> denied equal protection</a> under state law and endured emotional stress when an elections official in Cornelius questioned her identity in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Judge Daniel Hovland, of Bismarck, ruled this week, that the Spirit Lake Nation, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and six enrolled tribal members have the legal standing to sue Secretary of State Al Jaeger over the laws, which require voters to</span><a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4929868-Judge-denies-states-motion-to-dismiss-voter-ID-suit-brought-by-tribes"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> present a form of identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that lists a valid residential address.</span></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Online Voting</strong>: Researchers at MIT say they have</span><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/voting-voatz-app-hack-issues-0213"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uncovered security vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a mobile voting app used by West Virginia and several counties throughout the country. According to <em>MIT News</em>, the security analysis of the application, called Voatz, pinpoints a number of weaknesses, including the opportunity for hackers to alter, stop, or expose how an individual user has voted. Additionally, the researchers found that Voatz’s use of a third-party vendor for voter identification and verification poses potential privacy issues for users. According to <em>MIT News</em>, researchers disclosed their findings to CISA and worked with CISA to ensure that impacted elections officials and the vendor were aware of the findings before the research was made public. This included preparing written summaries of the findings with proof-of-concept code, and direct discussions with affected elections officials on calls arranged by CISA.</span></p>
<p><strong>Websites:</strong><a href="http://circle.tufts.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CIRCLE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has launched a new website. Along with a much-needed visual upgrade, the new CIRCLE site is easier to navigate and better reflects and communicates the most relevant and timely strands of the organization’s work. CIRCLE has also redesigned its weekly newsletter to go with it, bringing back a name—Around the CIRCLE—from years past as the organization move toward the future!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Idaho:</strong> Last week local elections officials expressed concerns about the</span><a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/local_news/local-officials-now-optimistic-about-voter-registration-software/article_55e57678-49cd-11ea-a248-dbed814cc999.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state’s new voter registration system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is set to roll out in March. They were concerned about the system’s readiness for a March 11 debut and what they considered a lack of response from the secretary of state’s office. Now, after a meeting from clerks around the state and the secretary of state, Bannock County Clerk Jason Dixon told KPVI that the results of the meeting were “very encouraging.” Dixon says a software update fixing 35 system issues should be rolled out in the next few days, and training for counties across the state on the new software begins this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maryland:</strong> Following issues with a state-run</span><a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2020/02/state-hits-pause-on-controversial-wireless-network-to-transmit-voter-information/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wireless network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used to transmit voter information from polling places to the state during a special election last week, the state board of elections announced that it will not require the state’s six largest counties to use the wireless network during the 2020 election cycle. n a statement, Nikki Charlson, the deputy director at the Maryland State Board of Elections, said the decision not to require the six jurisdictions to use the system was made “to give voters full confidence that their voting experience will be safe, timely and secure.” “For Tuesday’s special primary election for the 7th Congressional District, a network was used to connect electronic pollbooks to SBE’s server. While the vast majority of voters voted without issue over 13 hours, a small number of voters encountered delays due to the implementation of this system,” the statement said. “Our electronic pollbooks are not connected to the voting system and do not impact election results, yet we are not satisfied when any voter encounters an unnecessary delay. As such, the local boards of elections will not be required to implement this system in the 2020 Primary or General Elections.”</span></p>

At the Jan. 8 City Commissioners&#8217; Sunshine Meeting, Commissioner Omar Sabir made a motion to create the app. Now he says they&#8217;re working on the procurement process, allowing the public to submit suggestions to the Commissioner&#8217;s Office about what features the app should include. &#8220;We want suggestions about what you want to see in this mobile app,&#8221; Sabir told WKYW. &#8220;So if we do it together it will build excitement.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/democracyworks/view/P_AAAAAAGAAFGMG6qafFRhVi?trackingTag=electionLine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democracy Works— We are currently looking for developers for all our projects, at a variety of levels. Experience with the technologies listed below is helpful, but not necessary; we hope you&#8217;ll bring excitement to learn what you haven&#8217;t seen yet. We support junior team members by explicitly setting aside time for learning, and providing training from a more experienced developer. In addition to full-time hires, we’re also looking for two senior, temporary hires for the Voter Engagement team to work with us until the end of 2020 as we prepare for the November general election. Candidates joining our Voter Engagement team will work on TurboVote and the Democracy Works API. You&#8217;ll join eight other software developers and an engineering manager to collaborate with the product and partnership teams in building software that helps voters and future voters. The technology that underpins this work is mostly microservices written in Clojure running in Docker containers on Kubernetes hosted on AWS. These services communicate over RabbitMQ and store their data in Datomic. The web front-ends are written in ClojureScript backed by React. Candidates joining the Election Administration team will be working on either the Voting Information Project (VIP), or Ballot Scout. For VIP, you&#8217;ll join two other software developers to collaborate with the product and data collection teams in building software that helps collect, validate, QA, and publish data about elections, which in turn service millions of queries in major election years. For Ballot Scout, you’ll join a team of two that enables seamless tracking of ballots through the United States Postal Service and allows both voters and election administration officials to monitor progress of the ballots to and from election offices. The technologies that underlay these systems are written in Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript, Python, and Go, with an emphasis in moving active development towards Clojure and Clojurescript. Infrastructure is hosted on AWS, and developers are beginning the process of migrating to a Kubernetes based deployment. <strong>Salary:</strong> $90K to $130K. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,</span><a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/democracyworks/view/P_AAAAAAGAAFGMG6qafFRhVi?trackingTag=electionLine"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
