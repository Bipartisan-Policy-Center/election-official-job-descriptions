							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Career pathways and origination stories</strong><br />
<em>How America’s local election officials got there</em></p>
<p>By Paul Gronke, Paul Manson, and Jay Lee<br />
<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/">Early Voting Information Center at Reed College</a></p>
<p>In a new series of blog posts, we will share highlights from our 2019 Survey of Local Election Officials, a joint collaboration between Democracy Fund and the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College. The DF/RC team are appreciative of the LEOs who took time out of their busy schedules to answer the survey. In 2019, 3000 LEOs were randomly selected to take the survey and 876 responded. For more information about how the survey was conducted,<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/?page_id=2926"> visit the study website</a>.</p>
<p>We like to describe local election officials in the US as the “<a href="https://democracyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2019_DemocracyFund_StewardsOfDemocracy.pdf">stewards of democracy</a>.” LEOs comprise more than 8,000 local government employees and elected officials in municipalities and counties across the country, with a diverse range of pay, training, and experience.</p>
<p>They also differ greatly in the scope of their duties. Only 17% told us that they spend “all or almost all” of their time on elections-related work, while 61% said that elections work constitutes “less than half” of their workload.</p>
<p>Staff support is non-existent in many small jurisdictions. Forty-seven percent of LEOs told us that their staff size is one. They are the only person working on elections in their jurisdiction!</p>
<p>The portfolio of LEOs may include supporting local councils and commissions, judicial administration, collecting taxes, recording property transactions, issuing marriage licenses, managing public records requests, even issuing dog licenses and recording burials.</p>
<p>One important finding from the survey is that, for all the diversity across states and localities, most LEOs have substantial on-the-job experience. Half of the officials in our survey told us that they have been working in election administration since 2006, with several officials telling us they have served more than 50 years.</p>
<p>We asked our respondents where they came from just before their first job in election administration (because we offered respondents a wide set of choices, the percentages in the table may add up to more than 100%). Nearly half came from a non-elections private sector job (49%), with a slightly lower percentage (42%) coming from the public sector. Most of those coming from the public sector moved from other positions in local government. The other paths to election work are highly varied: volunteerism, political parties and campaigns, and straight out of school.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6000" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO1.png" alt="" width="878" height="804" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO1.png 878w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO1-300x275.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO1-768x703.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px" /></p>
<p>Comparing the responses across jurisdiction size, LEOs in smaller jurisdictions were much more likely to report that they were working in the non-elections private sector before starting their work in election administration, while those in the large jurisdictions (100,001 &#8211; 250,000) were notably more likely to tell us they came from state or federal government positions or from political parties and campaigns.</p>
<p>One reason that these origination stories may vary across jurisdiction size is because the office of local election official is three times as likely to be an elective position in small municipalities and counties than in the largest jurisdictions, 67% vs. 21%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5999" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO-graphic-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="319" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO-graphic-2.png 640w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LEO-graphic-2-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Of those elected, 45% were elected in partisan races for their office. For smaller jurisdictions, almost 70% are elected to their position, while for larger jurisdictions over 70% are appointed.</p>
<p>Local election officials in the United States, for all of their diversity of duties, are a group of experts who have crucial and insightful opinions about elections and voting. They follow a varied path into election administration, but once they get there, many hang around.</p>
<p>LEOs are uniquely positioned to share their perspectives about change and reform to our elections system. The DF/RC LEO Survey is designed to elevate and amplify these opinions in the ongoing debates over election reform. We will be discussing these opinions in the next few weeks.</p>

							<h2>Filling the Technology Gap</h2>
														<p><strong>Inyo County, California launches new voter-friendly website<br />
</strong><em>USDR, CTCL help fill technology gap for local elections</em></p>
<p><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/08-27/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5974" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR3-300x175.jpeg" alt="" width="336" height="196" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR3-300x175.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR3-1024x599.jpeg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR3-768x449.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR3-1536x898.jpeg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR3.jpeg 1815w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" />Last week</a> we brought you news from<a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"> U.S. Digital Response</a>, an NGO that provides vetted, pro bono technologists who can handle the heavy-lifting of designing and implementing low-risk solutions in a matter of days or weeks, for free. USDR’s services range from help with elections websites to automating the vote by mail application process to answering voters questions efficiently to managing poll workers and beyond.</p>
<p><a href="https://elections.inyocounty.us/">Inyo County, California</a> was one of the first local elections offices to call on USDR for their services to help the county with its website. The newly designed site launched last week.</p>
<p>“Elections are chronically underfunded, especially so for small jurisdictions like Inyo County. Thankfully, there are several non-governmental agencies, like USDR, that have stepped in to fill the technology gap, to help voters around the country –whether from rural, suburban or urban communities – get access to the information and technology tools they need to exercise their right to vote,” said Kammi Foote, Inyo County Clerk/Recorder &amp; Registrar of Voters.</p>
<p>Like elections offices around the country Foote and her staff are busy preparing for November and while this doesn’t seem like the ideal time to roll out a new site, Foote felt it was important, especially since she had the help of USDR and the<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/"> Center for Tech and Civic Life</a> (CTCL).</p>
<p>“Access to accurate information is crucial, and with so many changes with the normal voting process, we felt it was well worth the effort to invest in an enhanced website ahead of the election – even if it meant a little extra work on our end. Working with USDR and CTCL made the process efficient and streamlined,” Foote said.</p>
<p>According to Foote,  due to the personal tech support, the pre-populated template and the well written instructions, it only took her less than one week of dedicated time to transfer all of the information from the previous website and have it live for the voters of Inyo County to view.</p>
<p>“I know adding one additional task to your election planning agenda may seem overwhelming, but USDR and CTCL have made the process seamless and proficient,” Foote said “The voters in your area will be thankful to have easy access to all of the information they need to vote, including the many changes they might expect in this upcoming Presidential election.”</p>

While many states have seen an increase in absentee and early voting during the pandemic, for Massachusetts which only recently began offering early voting, the 2020 primary really was<a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2020/08/31/in-massachusetts-an-unprecedented-primary-day-awaits"> unprecedented</a>. While most voters chose to vote by mail, some voters did turn at<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/09/01/massachusetts-2020-primary-election-in-photos"> the polls</a> on Tuesday and overall things went well. &#8220;<a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2020/09/02/galvin-stands-by-mass-s-first-ever-election-by-mail">It was a success</a>, I think was a<a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2020/09/massachusetts-2020-primary-more-than-14-million-cast-ballots-but-elections-officials-say-new-process-has-some-kinks-to-work-out.html"> good day for democracy</a>, it was a good day for Massachusetts. Comparative to other states, we did pretty well,” Secretary of State William Galvin said of the election, which likely set a new record for the number of ballots cast at over 1.5 million. There was some confusion about the commonwealth’s new hybrid voting system. Boston-area television stations reported voters showing up at the polls with their voted mail ballot looking to<a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/some-claim-they-had-issues-casting-their-votes-first-statewide-election-since-pandemic/4HSWQV2MMFDT7DPXCYE2CMGPOE/"> drop it off</a>, which was not an option.<a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/election-day-pandemic-brings-new-look-same-feel-mass-voters/7ENMY27FFVGGDDCFPTBHO5S2EU/"> Boston</a> election officials said they were experiencing heavy call volumes on the absentee ballot line for voters who requested a ballot and were showing up to vote in person.The same situation, voters showing up with their cast ballots at the polls, caused some confusion in<a href="https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/north-attleboro-election-results-delayed/article_49e8c533-a4eb-5b6b-9a00-c4444bcae67e.html"> North Attleboro</a>. Poll workers in<a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20200902/2-ballots-pose-challenge-in-yarmouth-election"> Yarmouth</a> faced an additional hurdle of providing two balltos to voters—one for the primary and one for a local election which caused some issues including running out of local ballots at one polling place. Secretary of State Galvin had to seek court permission—which was granted—for certain cities and towns to<a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/09/02/4th-district-more-time-to-count-ballots-william-galvin/"> continue counting</a> ballots that had<a href="https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20200902/franklin-election-officials-continued-to-count-ballots-on-wednesday"> arrived by the deadline</a>. Galvin said he sought court authorization to make sure the process remains transparent. The day was not without at least one “tragedy” though.<a href="https://www.telegram.com/news/20200901/hand-sanitizer-part-of-electoral-process-on-primary-day-in-worcester"> Worcester</a> voter Ellen Jankewicz told the Telegram about a glaring omission. “I miss the ‘I voted’ sticker,” Jankewicz told the paper.</p>

According the <em>Valley News</em>, starting with the March presidential primary, ballots would be translated into six languages at the Burlington and Winooski polling locations. Both cities have substantial numbers of people whose first language is not English. However, translated ballots were requested only twice in Winooski, both in Arabic, said Town Clerk Carol Barrett. In Burlington, no one at all requested a translated ballot, City Clerk Amy Bovee said. The state has no obligation to provide translated ballots. But, as a second-generation American — Condos said his grandparents emigrated from Greece — this initiative was personal for him. He said it was simply “the right thing to do.”  “People are not making good use of it because of a lack of education,” said Raghu Acharya, a longtime Winooski advocate originally from Bhutan. The languages are: French, Arabic, Burmese, Swahili, Nepali and Somali. The Winooski city clerk, said there had been no widespread promotion of the translated ballots before the Aug. 11 primary and, the Burlington city clerk, said signs advertising the ballots were posted on the polling place doors and information about the ballots was on the city clerk’s website. After the November election, he said, his office plans to regroup with the steering committee that has helped guide the translated ballot work. “Do we wish that we could do more? Absolutely,” Condos wrote. “We are grateful for the support and guidance our partners have provided in this work, and look forward to discussions of how we can grow upon what we have done so far.”</p>

Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams has<a href="https://www.wtvq.com/2020/09/01/brewers-helping-recruit-poll-workers-for-november/"> formed a partnership with the Kentucky Guild of Brewers</a> to help get the word out. Together they designed beer labels that solicit volunteers to work the polls and encourage Kentuckians to register to vote. The labels have QR codes directing to govoteky.com where imbibers can register to vote and apply to be a poll worker. The campaign, SOS From Your SOS, is now being carried by four Kentucky breweries. “When we are asked to help the Secretary of State with the ‘SOS From Your SOS’ project, Dreaming Creek Brewery jumped at the chance,” Charley Hamilton, owner of Dreaming Creek Brewery, said. “We along with several other microbreweries around the Commonwealth were eager to help support the initiative by getting custom labels to help promote and make the information easily accessible through QR codes. With COVID-19 still a strong concern going into voting season, poll workers are in short supply. This initiative will hopefully bring attention to this and get some new folks to help out working the polls come voting time.”</p>

According to an article in <em>The Denver Post</em> residents in<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/02/2020-colorado-election-judges-volunteers/"> Colorado</a> have stepped up in a huge way and signed up to be election judges. “We’ve seen a remarkable response. We’ve have had hundreds per county,” said Pam Anderson, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association. Anderson told the paper that not only the numbers of people signing up good, but clerks are also seeing a broader range of ages and backgrounds of people signing up. Elections officials in the<a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/09/01/after-fear-of-a-shortage-d-c-area-election-officials-say-people-are-now-stepping-up-to-work-the-polls/"> Washington Metropolitan Area</a> have also seen a dramatic increase in poll worker sign-ups after fearing a shortage. “We have too many right now, to be honest,” Eric Olsen, the deputy director of Arlington County’s Board of Elections told <em>DCist</em>. “I can’t remember an election where I felt where we had this many people.” At the DCBOE Executive Director Alice Miller told <em>DCist</em> that the city needs about 4,000 poll workers for early and Election Day voting. So far the city has trained 1,300 and there are another 4,000 in the queue to be trained.</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p>The<a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/"> United States Postal Service Office of the Inspector General</a> released an<a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/processing-readiness-election-and-political-mail-during-2020-general-elections"> audit report</a> on the Postal Service’s readiness for the 2020 elections this week. The report identifies concerns surrounding integrating stakeholder processes with Postal Service processes to help ensure the timely delivery of election and political mail. Areas of concern include: ballots mailed without barcode mail tracking technology; ballot mailpiece designs that result in improper processing; election and political mail likely to be mailed too close to the election, resulting in insufficient time for the Postal Service to process and deliver the mailpieces; postmark requirements for ballots; and voter addresses that are out of date. The report offers best practices and recommendations to mitigate such concerns. The report finds that 94.5 percent of identifiable Election and Political Mail was delivered on-time nationwide from April 2020 through June 2020, a decrease of 1.7 percentage points compared to the same time period in 2018.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://healthyelections.org/"> Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project</a> released a<a href="http://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2020-08/WhatQueueingMeansPollingPlacesCOVID19.pdf"> report</a> on polling place line management during the COVID-19 pandemic last week. The report, <em>What Queuing Theory Says about Managing Polling Places Amid COVID-19</em>, summarizes findings from research in this area before the pandemic and discusses ways to change queue length in light of social distancing, including changes to the arrival of voters, the number of poll workers, service time, and increased variability.</p>

The guidelines and accompanying commentary cover voter education, rights and responsibilities, voter registration, absentee voting, early in-person and Election Day voting, voter verification, ballots, recounts, challenges to elections, emergency management, and other aspects of election administration. The guidelines include model statutory language on provisional balloting.</p>

The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which provides states with election security protections, issued a joint statement saying they hadn&#8217;t seen cyberattacks on election infrastructure in 2020 and noting that &#8220;a lot of voter registration data is publicly available or easily purchased.&#8221; A thorough review conducted by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future found nothing that wasn&#8217;t already publicly available, company spokesperson Caitlin Mattingly said according to NBC News.</p>

In the letters, the chief of the intelligence office, John L. Ratcliffe, framed the move as an attempt to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/us/politics/election-security-intelligence-briefings-congress.html">ensure clarity and consistency</a>” in intelligence agencies’ interactions with Congress and to crack down on leaks that have infuriated some intelligence officials. “I believe this approach helps ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that the information O.D.N.I. provides the Congress in support of your oversight responsibilities on elections security, foreign malign influence and election interference is not misunderstood nor politicized,” he wrote, according to<a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/letter-from-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence/728f2b21d6a4b371/full.pdf"> a copy obtained by The New York Times</a>. “It will also better protect our sources and methods and most sensitive intelligence from additional unauthorized disclosures or misuse.”</p>

Phil Murphy signed several bills into law that will<a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/pointpleasant/gov-murphy-signs-5-nj-bills-law-safeguarding-voting-rights"> help with the voting process</a> this November. The following bills were signed into law: A4475/S2580– Requires county boards of election to establish ballot drop boxes in each county at least 45 days before election; revises procedures concerning mail-in ballots for 2020 general election. A4276/S2598 – Establishes &#8220;The Ballot Cure Act&#8221; requiring election officials to notify voters within 72 hours of receiving their ballot – or within 48 hours of Election Day – to provide an explanation for the potential rejection and an opportunity to repair the defect. A4320/S2633 – Extends ballot receipt and election certification deadlines; increases certain messenger and bearer ballot limits; requires certain information to increase public awareness and use of voting by mail.</p>

The legislation states that “no public official shall cause an election to be conducted other than in the time, place, and manner prescribed by the Revised Code.” The only exception would be in cases of enemy attack. The bill comes after Gov. Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose attempted to reschedule the March 17 primary for June 2.</p>

Among the proposed changes to election law: Reset the deadline for applying for mail-in or absentee ballots to 15 days before the election; Allow voters to drop off mail-in or absentee ballots at polling places on Election Day as well as at the county election office or at a designated location in the county courthouse any day it is open up through Election Day; Allow county election officials to begin opening ballots, verify voter signatures and start processing mail-in and absentee ballots three days before the election; Permit poll workers to come from outside the county where a polling place is located. The bill was<a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/house-oks-changes-to-mail-in-voting-law-wolf-threatens-veto/"> approved</a> 112-90 on a near party-line vote. Gov. Tom Wolf (D) has said he will veto the legislation.</p>

However, the Senate also voted to eliminate the State Election Commission’s plans to add more drop boxes for collecting ballots and keep the absentee ballot witness signature — one measure a judge removed before the June primary citing the danger of forcing voters to make contact with other people during COVID-19. The expansion is similar to what lawmakers did in May ahead of the June primary when, after a spike in COVID-19 cases in the state, counties decided to consolidate precincts. The legislation now moves to the House which will not return until September 15.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5133" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Virginia-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Virginia:</strong> Virginia&#8217;s General Assembly passed measures to<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virgina-voting-ballot-drop-boxes/2020/08/28/2a50f55a-e7cf-11ea-97e0-94d2e46e759b_story.html"> broaden access to absentee voting</a> in this fall&#8217;s presidential election, including the creation of ballot drop boxes that Republicans warned would be an invitation to fraud. Each measure would set aside $2 million for prepaid postage on mail-in ballots and instruct registrars to allow voters to correct ballot errors that might keep an absentee vote from being counted. The bills also would remove the requirement for a witness to certify a ballot signature and mandate drop boxes at voting precincts as an alternative to putting absentee ballots in the mail. Once the Senate and House of Delegates take up each other’s version, the matter will go to Gov. Ralph Northam (D) — who supports the legislation — for his signature.</p>

Secretary of State John Thurston, said the initiative campaigns did not comply with a state law requiring them to certify that their signature gatherers passed criminal background checks. The groups argued that they complied with the background check requirement and accused the state of blocking them merely because the word &#8220;passed&#8221; wasn&#8217;t used in affidavits they submitted.</p>

The lawsuit follows a conclusion by Brnovich in July that cities have no legal right to maintain their own election dates when turnout is low. Tucson officials disagree and have refused to budge. So now the attorney general hopes to force the issue. But it remains to be seen whether Brnovich will have any better luck in court than he had before. According to Capitol Media Services, at the heart of the battle is a 2012 law that declared that all elections must be conducted in even-numbered years, and only on dates spelled out by the legislature. But the state Court of Appeals concluded that there were no legislative findings to support the action overriding the decisions of charter cities like Tucson.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, The Arizona Center For Disability Law has sued Cochise County alleging that the county’s refusal to implement<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1615060/arizona-center-disability-law-sues-cochise-county-over-curbside-voting-ban"> curbside voting</a> is in violation of the American With Disabilities Act. Sey In is a staff attorney with ACDL and represents a client with multiple disabilities impacting her ability to walk. In says the client was denied a request to vote curbside in Cochise County in 2018, violating her rights under the ADA providing for a reasonable modification. “Voting on election day in person is an important right,&#8221; In told KJZZ, &#8220;and people with disabilities should be given all the same voting options as non-disabled people.” ACDL filed the lawsuit in federal court in Arizona, seeking a preliminary injunction against the policy.</p>

The<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-considers-whether-to-change-georgia-absentee-ballot-deadline/BQ4RW3VNGZGFXOYUKCK3JGWPHE/"> decision</a> will likely result in tens of thousands of ballots being counted after Nov. 3 that would have otherwise been rejected, enough to swing close elections. The ruling invalidates Georgia’s requirement that ballots had to be received at county election offices by 7 p.m. on Election Day. “Extending the deadline would ensure that voters who receive their ballots shortly before Election Day are able to mail their ballots without fear that their vote will not count,” Ross wrote in her 70-page order.</p>

Pratt ruled Aug. 24 that the secretary of state must notify voters they will be purged due to a suspected change in address and, if they fail to respond, wait two federal election cycles before removing them.  Government watchdog Common Cause alleged in a lawsuit that purging voters without notice violates federal protections that essentially require states to notify voters and confirm a change of address. Pratt agreed, saying the harm to voters who have unknowingly and wrongly lost their eligibility far outweighs any possible harm to the election process.</p>

Their suit claims that Mississippi election laws could<a href="https://www.islandpacket.com/news/health-care/article245311505.html"> force people to choose between their health and their constitutional right to cast a ballot</a>. It says that the defendants — Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson and Attorney General Lynn Fitch — “have failed to take necessary steps to protect Mississippi voters’ fundamental right to vote despite the public health risks of voting in person during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The new lawsuit is similar to one filed Aug. 11 in state court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and Mississippi Center for Justice, which was also brought against Watson. One of the plaintiffs in the federal court lawsuit is the husband of a woman who is a plaintiff in the state court suit. [Editor&#8217;s Note: We know this isn&#8217;t the state flag yet, but we really like it and hope voters approve in November.]</p>

Steve Bullock<a href="https://www.riverbender.com/sports-news/details.cfm?id=315542"> gave counties the choice</a> to conduct the November election entirely by mail amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit alleges Bullock&#8217;s directive would dilute the integrity of Montana&#8217;s election system. The lawsuit in Montana names Bullock and Republican Secretary of State Corey Stapleton as defendants. “This template lawsuit appears to be part of a pattern of lawsuits across the country by Republican Party operatives to limit access to voting during the pandemic,&#8221; Bullock said in a statement. “Voting by mail in Montana is safe, secure, and was requested by a bipartisan coalition of Montana election officials seeking to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and keep Montanans safe and healthy.”</p>

Martin announcing the August indictments. The charges include voting by a non-citizen, claim of United States citizenship by non-citizen, false statement in a voter registration application, false statement in an immigration document, false statement in a naturalization proceeding, false statement to a federal agent and procuring naturalization contrary to law.</p>

Attorneys filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Cleveland that requests an injunction to prevent the move that advocates say violates residents’ constitutional voting rights. The suit came a day after the Ohio Democratic Party filed a similar<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2020/08/voting-rights-groups-sue-ohio-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-over-drop-boxes-for-voters.html"> suit in Franklin County Common Pleas Court</a>.

Trump is asking a Pittsburgh federal Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan to order the state and county election officials all across Pennsylvania to<a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/trump-campaign-asks-pittsburgh-federal-judge-for-injunction-seeking-segregation-of-mail-ballots-cast-via-drop-boxes-access-to-video-monitoring/33854827"> &#8220;segregate&#8221; and not open or count certain of state&#8217;s vote-by-mail ballots</a> in the fall general election. They include mailed ballots returned through drop boxes, those missing an inner secrecy envelope or containing any marks on them, or delivered in-person by someone other than the voter, unless the voter is disabled. lawyers also want a court order to retain and make available for periodic review any and all digital images and video used to monitor drop boxes and locations, including county election offices used for return and collection of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will take up<a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/pennsylvania-high-court-takes-over-another-election-lawsuit/33864087"> another election-related lawsuit</a>, it announced Tuesday, this one filed by the state Democratic Party amid a partisan fight over fixing glitches and gray areas in the battleground state&#8217;s fledgling mail-in voting law. The Democratic Party’s lawsuit asks the court to order an extension of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Election Day deadline to count mailed-in ballots, a similar request to one in a lawsuit already taken up by the state Supreme Court. It also asks the court to allow mailed-in ballots to be counted if they are returned without a secrecy envelope, to allow voters to fix problems with their mail-in ballot before it is discarded, and to uphold the requirement in state law that poll watchers be registered voters from the county. In addition, it asks the court to allow the use of drop boxes &#8212; which Philadelphia and its heavily populated suburbs used in the primary to help relieve the pressure from an avalanche of mailed-in ballots &#8212; as well as satellite election offices. Briefs are due Sept. 8, the state Supreme Court said.</p>

A new lawsuit that aims to change the system before the November general election calls the restriction on sharing the form, which is freely available on the Secretary of State&#8217;s website, a limit to free speech. The new filing joins a pair of cases at both the state and federal level aimed at expanding access to voting-by-mail during the novel coronavirus pandemic as record numbers of absentee ballots were returned in the August primary election. A Memphis labor organizer, the Tennessee State Conference of the NAACP, the Equity Alliance, the Memphis A. Phillip Randolph Institute and voter advocacy organization Free Hearts filed the federal lawsuit Friday in Nashville. In the lawsuit, the groups argue the law &#8220;serves no purpose, unreasonably restricts how they can engage voters and &#8220;imposes an extraordinarily burdensome restraint on (their) right of free speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson in Nashville rejected a request for a preliminary injunction of a<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/01/judge-wont-block-tennessee-mail-voting-signature-law/5683574002/"> ballot verification law</a>, ruling late last week that the record shows the risk of ballot rejection through the verification process is exceedingly low, whether it&#8217;s proper or erroneous. He also wrote that voters have other options, including voting in-person early or on Election Day. The groups challenging the law have sought the right for voters to fix signature issues before ballots are rejected. &#8220;Although the signature-verification requirement does represent some kind of obstacle between placing a vote and having it counted, the mere existence of such an obstacle does not mean that Plaintiffs are excluded from voting,&#8221; Richardson wrote.</p>

Garcia found that DPS is “legally obligated” to allow voters to simultaneously register to vote with every license renewal or change-of-address application, and ordered the state to set up a “fully operable” online system by Sept. 23. The Texas attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the state is likely to appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>A Fifth Circuit panel heard arguments this week over a law that<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/fifth-circuit-urged-to-expand-mail-in-voting-in-texas/"> limits mail-in voting</a> to people 65 and older, with an attorney for the state Democratic Party arguing the restriction constitutes discrimination. Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins argued on behalf of Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and Secretary of State Ruth R. Hughs, the Republican defendants in a lawsuit filed in April by Texas Democrats.   He defended the law at issue, saying that allowing the elderly to vote by mail does not take rights away from any other group of people and “doesn’t abridge anyone else’s right to vote.” Chad Dunn, general counsel for the Texas Democratic Party, disagreed and called the law discriminatory. “What the state can’t do by statute is say a bracket of people based on their age get a voting benefit while others” do not, Dunn told the judges.</p>
<p>Attorney General Ken Paxton, at the request of the secretary of state’s office has sued Harris County after county election officials refused to drop plans to<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/31/texas-harris-county-mail-in-ballot/"> send absentee ballot applications</a> to all registered voters, not just those over 65. Paxton is asking a state district court to bar Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins from proactively providing the applications to every registered voter in the county, alleging Hollins does not have the authority under state law to carry out the plan. There is no state law that specifically prohibits election officials from sending out mail-in ballot applications to all voters. Instead, Paxton argues that county clerks are only “expressly empowered” by the Texas Election Code to send out applications to voters who request them, “but there is no statute empowering County Clerks to send applications to vote by mail to voters who have not requested such an application.”<a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2020/09/01/380954/paxton-charges-hollins-with-breaking-texas-election-law/"> Following the filing</a> of the suit, the county agreed to only send ballot apps to those 65 and older, for now. On Wednesday<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/02/Harris-County-absentee-ballott/"> the state’s Supreme Court</a> made it official by temporarily blocking the county from sending the apps.</p>

														<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: The secretary of state’s office has<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-launches-paperless-absentee-ballot-request-website/ABFFNDFJQREU3ECQCO52RW5DW4/"> launched a website</a> allowing voters to apply for absentee ballots online and eliminating the need to download and mail-in a form. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the website reduces the risk that election officials will overlook absentee ballot applications or incorrectly type in voters’ information, problems that surfaced before Georgia’s June 9 primary. The site instantly transmits ballot requests to county election officials, avoiding potential delays in mail delivery. Voters can choose to receive an automatically generated email confirming that their request has been received.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The State Board of Elections recently launched<a href="https://www.wnct.com/local-news/nc-state-board-of-elections-launches-website-to-help-voters-navigate-election-options/"> a new website</a> that will help North Carolinians easily navigate registering, voting and ballot casting options for upcoming elections. “At the State Board, we wanted the best user experience for voters and candidates in North Carolina,” said Karen Brinson Bell, State Board executive director. “We believe the new website is a huge leap forward in keeping voters informed about elections.” The website was designed to be an easier resource for users to operate and also a more mobile-friendly site. Through the website, voters can: Learn more about registering to vote; Check registration and your sample ballot (when available); Learn the three options for voting in North Carolina; Find important election dates and deadlines; Request an absentee ballot (An online portal will be available by September 1); View election results and a greatly expanded and more user-friendly data section; Search campaign finance reports; and Read press releases</p>

The session also provides resources, services, and best practices to manage public communications risks. <strong>When</strong>: Sept. 4. <strong>Where</strong>: Online.</span></p>

What did we learn from the states, starting from Iowa’s caucuses in February all the way through September’s state primaries? We’ll discuss the timing for primaries, whether state and presidential primaries are best run jointly or as two separate events, how ranked-choice voting performed this year, independent voters&#8217; role in political party decision-making and more. Expect to take away ideas for 2022 or 2024. Speakers include: Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, Rob Richie, president and CEO of FairVote and Scott Saiki, Hawaii Speaker of the House and NSCL president-elect. <strong>When</strong>: Sept. 9, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

A great deal of misinformation is spreading, and voters do not know where to look for trusted information. Increases in by-mail voting and safety concerns about voting in polling places have led to confusion about the best options to vote. All of these changes will likely lead to slower results reporting and the possibility of one or both parties dismissing official totals as fraudulent or illegitimate.  Please join The Bipartisan Policy Center as we discuss what’s fact and what&#8217;s fiction, and what we can still do to maintain the integrity of our elections this November. Featured Participants: Donna Brazile, Michael Steele, and Laurel Lee, Florida Secretary of State.
