														<p><strong>‘I’m a lawyer and I’m here to help’</strong><br />
<em>New CLE program encourages Ohio attorneys to serve as poll workers</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>“I’m a lawyer and I’m here to help,” are words that could potentially strike fear into any election official’s heart, but in Cuyahoga County, Ohio it’s music to county election officials’ ears.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5074" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cuyahoga-1024x639.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="201" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cuyahoga-1024x639.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cuyahoga-300x187.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cuyahoga-768x480.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cuyahoga.jpg 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" />The<a href="https://boe.cuyahogacounty.us/"> Cuyahoga County Board of Elections</a> has long relied on using attorneys as poll workers (poll election officials (POEs) as they are referred to in Ohio) at some of it’s more than 325 polling places countywide.</p>
<p>“Attorneys who want to help us conduct robust, accessible elections often sign up with campaigns or as nonpartisan observers. It does not occur to them to serve as PEOs. Legal observers play a valuable but limited role on Election Day,” said John Kennick, election official at the Cuyahoga BOE. “Observers cannot advocate for voters or step in if they see something wrong. As PEOs, attorneys have direct authority.”</p>
<p>For several years, the BOE has had between 5-10 lawyers who have worked as poll workers. When possible, those attorneys were assigned to locations that may have presented some sort of &#8220;issue&#8221; in the past.</p>
<p>“By issues, we typically mean locations that either had long lines or specific feedback from poll workers/voters that the service at that particular location wasn&#8217;t up to the standards that we would expect from our polling locations,” explained Peter James assistant manager, Election Officials Department.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Precinct-Election-Official-Continuing-Legal-Education-Instructions.pdf">a new program</a> spearheaded by the<a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/"> Ohio secretary of state’s office</a> and the<a href="https://www.oaeo.us/"> Ohio Association of Election Officials</a>, in conjunction with the<a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/"> Ohio Supreme Court</a> is helping Cuyahoga and other counties recruit more of them.</p>
<p>Under the program, attorneys who train as POEs and complete additional election worker course work are eligible to receive CLE (continuing legal education) credits. In Ohio, attorneys and judges<a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/AttySvcs/CLE/"> must receive a certain number of CLEs</a> depending on their skill level/area of practice.</p>
<p>“Last year, we organized a working group of election officials to help find creative ways to attract interested individuals who are interested in learning more about being a part of this important day,” explained Maggie Sheehan, deputy press secretary for the secretary of state. “One of those ideas was to allow attorneys that attend a county board of election’s Precinct Election Official (“PEO”) training program to receive Continuing Legal Education (“CLE”) credit. In order for a county’s training program to qualify for CLE credits, the training must be approved by the Ohio Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>Following the completion of the 2019 election, staff at the Cuyahoga County BOE began working on its <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cuyahoga-Application.pdf">application</a> to the Ohio Supreme Court. While completing the application process and setting up the curriculum took time, there were few costs involved and not much added stress for BOE staff.</p>
<p>“After the application was submitted on Nov. 18 we provided some more supplemental material, and the application itself was approved on Dec. 27,” explained James. “That was the process of getting approval. The process to actually create the training curriculum has taken longer. That began in earnest after we submitted the application (we had to work under the assumption that it would be approved in order to be able to implement the training in time for the March 17 election) and has continued all the way up until today.”</p>
<div id="attachment_5098" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5098" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-5098" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CuyahogaCo-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CuyahogaCo-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CuyahogaCo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CuyahogaCo-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CuyahogaCo-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CuyahogaCo.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-5098" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Rob Frost, Cuyahoga Co. BOE member and an attorney, leads a training for attorneys in the new CLE program.</em></p></div>
<p>The CLE curriculum meets all of the statutory criteria for training as a PEO and then goes into deeper detail about drawing precincts and establishing polling locations, voter registration, and maintaining the voter database in compliance with NVRA, including the notification process and circumstances that would lead to cancellation.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re covering the topics we thought attorneys would find interesting and want to know about. Ballot production and tabulation, early and absentee voting, physical security, and election audits are also covered,” explained Kennick. “Election law feels obvious to seasoned Board employees, but it&#8217;s much less known beyond these walls. Although our immediate goal of the program is to recruit and train attorneys to serve as PEOs, this is also an exposition on elections agencies.”</p>
<p>According to James, the response by attorneys to the POE program has been good or better than they expected.</p>
<p>“At the moment, we have 29 attorneys signed up for the two classes…” James said. “We have only really pushed the CLE classes the past few weeks because we needed to be sure the application was approved.”</p>
<p>Once the attorneys are trained, the county is eager to put them to work. Following the November 2019 election, BOE staff poured through a tremendous amount of information to evaluate how each individual polling location performed. This ranged from surveys completed by poll workers and voters, calls received on Election Day, statistical reports and audit logs from voting equipment, etc.</p>
<p>“Based on this information, we set up a scoring system that rates each polling location. Locations that didn&#8217;t perform as well as others in November are potential locations we will target for attorneys to be placed in,” James explained. “The thought is that having more professional people at a polling location increases the chances that the workers, in general, are better able to troubleshoot issues that come up and or can process information more quickly.”</p>
<p>James said that in some ways, the BOE wants attorneys serving as poll workers to step forward, but of course, it has to be done in an appropriate way and a way that doesn’t intimidate other poll workers.</p>
<p>“Our main challenge will be to train the attorneys to step in when needed but don&#8217;t go into the election thinking they are really any different than the other poll workers in that location,” James said. “The reverse is true as well. We&#8217;ll tell the workers in a location with an attorney that he/she is there to assist, and don&#8217;t hesitate to lean on them if needed, but not to feel like they are there to &#8220;keep an eye&#8221; on them or to do any more than you would ask of another worker.”</p>
<p>James explained that while finding enough POEs is always difficult, extenuating factors have made it even more difficult in 2020 so the new CLE program could not have come at a better time.</p>
<p>“Finding enough workers is a challenge,” James said. “Now this year, with the Census hiring temporary workers at a pay rate significantly higher than what we can pay, it makes our recruiting efforts even more difficult. Then on top of it, the Primary Election in Ohio is on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, which not only lessens the pool of people who might consider working but has also resulted in some regular poll workers not being able to work this particular election.”</p>
<p>While the BOE is busy rolling out the new poll worker program for attorneys, election official Kennick said they don’t plan to stop there.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s uncommon to find professionals who are able to take time away from work to serve in an election, but we&#8217;re trying to change that. Social workers, accountants, and financial professionals, to name just a few, need some version of continuing education to maintain their licenses,” Kennick said. “This is our first full program meant expressly for a professional audience, but I do not think it will be our last.”</p>

							<h2>Research and Report Summaries</h2>
														<p><strong>Blocking the Ballot Box: Ending Misuse of the ADA to Close Polling Places</strong><br />
<em>National Disability Rights Network</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5093" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-05-at-2.27.58-PM-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-05-at-2.27.58-PM-233x300.png 233w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-05-at-2.27.58-PM.png 734w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" />A new report by the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) shows many of America’s polling places remain inaccessible to people with disabilities. The report, entitled<a href="https://www.ndrn.org/resource/blocking-the-ballot-box/"> Blocking the Ballot Box: Ending Misuse of the ADA to Close Polling Places</a>, also examines an alarming new trend in which jurisdictions are misusing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to close polling places, a practice that NDRN vehemently opposes.</p>
<p>The ADA requires all polling places to be accessible to people with disabilities and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandates that all Americans have the right to a private and independent vote. When the United States Supreme Court in Shelby County v Holder struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required federal approval before changes could be made to election procedures, jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of discriminatory voting practices saw an opportunity — blaming their polling place closures on the ADA and access needs of voters with disabilities.</p>
<p>“After the Supreme Court struck down protections in the Voting Rights Act, counties and cities began citing ADA concerns as the reason for closing, relocating, or consolidating their polling places,” said NDRN Executive Director Curt Decker. “The ADA was never meant to be used in this way and we challenge any jurisdiction that attempts to close a polling place because it is not ADA compliant.”</p>
<p>In this report, NDRN spoke to and visited counties with recent Department of Justice (DOJ) settlements for polling place accessibility. NDRN found these counties were working to be more accessible while keeping polling places open. Alternatively, counties that did not have a recent DOJ intervention and had not shared ADA surveys of their polling places or any collaboration with the disability community, seemed more likely to attempt closing polling places.</p>
<p>“The idea that making polling places accessible is too expensive and forces closures is a lie,” continued Decker. “The solution to inaccessible polling places is not to close them…it is to make them accessible. It’s clear to us from this investigation that these counties are not interested in improving accessibility. They are simply looking for excuses to close polling places and making it harder for people to vote.”</p>

According to StateScoop, the guidebook lays out three scenarios and each scenario comes with its own step-by-step series of challenges, testing participants’ ability to muster an incident response and figure out if they can resolve the situation internally, or if they need to call on assistance from their state government, the federal government or a vendor.</p>

Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And then of course there are the elections officials in Iowa. On the day of the caucuses, Secretary of State Paul Pate was forced to put out a statement</span><a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2020_02_03.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refuting assertions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Judicial Watch that the state’s voter rolls are bloated and of course on the day after the caucuses Pate had to put out a statement clarifying who runs caucuses and who runs elections in Iowa.  “The Iowa Secretary of State’s Office and county auditors have no official role in the Iowa Caucuses,” Pate said in the</span><a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2020_02_04.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The accuracy of the Iowa Democratic Party’s vote totals is much more important than the timeliness of releasing the results. I am glad to hear they have a paper trail for their votes, just as we use paper ballots in all official elections in the State of Iowa.” Although caucuses aren’t run by elections officials, there are</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/802883801/lessons-learned-from-the-iowa-caucuses-and-danger-signs-ahead"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> things that can be learned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A new way to access the state’s voter registration database</strong> is having Sedgwick County, Kansas</span><a href="https://www.kmuw.org/post/sedgwick-county-election-official-backs-support-open-polling-year"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reconsider its push to move to vote centers for the 2020 election cycle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although the Legislature approved the move to vote centers in 2019, and is currently pushing to allow that change to happen in 2020, Sedgwick County Election Commissioner Tabitha Lehman told KMUW that she’s not longer pushing for the change this year because the state wants to provide new computers that will allow direct access to the voter registration database. “We will need to add a minimum of 30 work stations to our office,” Lehman told Sedgwick County commissioners Wednesday. “I’m concerned about space, limited network ports, bandwidth issues with peak election cycles … my biggest concern is our power issues at the building.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>This week, the Arlington, Virginia electoral board voted</strong> 3-0 to allow representatives of political candidates to</span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/arlington/those-working-the-polls-could-have-a-little-more-flexibility/article_41b308b6-46b0-11ea-9cb1-57bdb64945c8.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hand out sample-ballot literature inside some precincts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to <em>Inside NOVA</em>, the measure targets polling places – such as at senior-living facilities and high-rise apartments – where many voters are unlikely to go outside on their way from their units to the ballot box. “We want voters to be able to obtain a sample ballot, from either party or independents,” Electoral Board Chairman Charlene Bickford said. “That’s our goal – to make sure people have access.” State law had previously banned electioneering inside of any building hosting a polling place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>And then there was one.</strong> This fall, residents in the Cape Cod town of Truro, Massachusetts will cast their paper primary ballots using an</span><a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20200130/truro-makes-move-to-electronic-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electronic ballot scanner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of dropping their ballots into a metal ballot box like they’ve been doing since 1964. “I think this is a step in the right direction to modernize and streamline the process,” Town Manager Rae Ann Palmer said according to the <em>Cape Cod Times</em>. Assistant Town Manager Kelly Clark told the select board that it will save poll workers hours of hand counting ballots. Wellfleet made the move to electronic tabulation last year and with Truro’s recent unanimous vote that leaves Provincetown as the only town on the Cape still counting ballots by hand. “Honestly, we will not be doing that,” Town Clerk Darlene Van Alstyne told the paper. “Not anytime soon, at least.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey has signed legislation into law that should help speed up the</span><a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1427376/ducey-signs-bill-speed-ballot-counting-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot counting process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SB 1135 was unanimously approved with an emergency clause in both the House and Senate. Maricopa County election workers will be allowed to use a new electronic method to fix ballot errors in March, rather than make corrections by hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> Under Senate Bill 207, that was approved by the Assembly 60-12 this week, voters would be allowed to</span><a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article239998733.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change their party preference or residence within two weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of an election without having to re-register to vote. If signed by Newsom, SB 207 would immediately become law, meaning it would apply to the 2020 California primary election, as well as the 2020 general election in November.</span></p>

The bill would still permit same-day voter registration on Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Virginia:</strong> By a 65-35 vote, the House of Delegates has approved a bill that will allow for</span><a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2020/01/va-house-approves-significant-absentee-voting-expansion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and extend the deadline for absentee ballots to arrive and be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate has approved a bill that would repeal the state’s current</span><a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/02/05/voters-in-virginia-may-no-longer-need-to-carry-photo-ids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter ID requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If enacted, voters in Virginia could present any government document containing their name and address — such as a copy of a current utility bill, government check or a paycheck and not just a government-issued photo ID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington:</strong> The Legislature is considering a bill that would put requirements on organizations or people other than family members who</span><a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/feb/05/senate-panel-considers-election-security-measures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collect a person’s ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and drop it in the mail or in a drop box.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Orlando Garcia has ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to register three voters based on their online driver’s license address.

Bannock County Elections Administrator Julie Hancock told KPVI the new system “lacks functionality”. Bannock is one of twelve counties that will test the new software in conjunction with the old software during the presidential primary, March 10. The $4 million system was supposed to be in place for the all counties to use during the primary. Bonneville County Elections Supervisor Brenda Prudent told KPVI, the software doesn’t comply with Idaho laws, and she’s also had issues with simple processes like absentee ballots and adding a person into the voter registration system.</span></p>

Both agencies are currently revising their data sharing agreement and matching parameters to avoid this error in future data exchanges. Upon identifying the potential problem in November 2019, the Board ceased sharing IDOC matches with local election authorities and began the process of identifying individuals who may have been affected by the error,” the SBOE said in a statement.</span></p>

According to <em>Maryland Matters</em>, Howard County officials reported that its pollb ooks were running slowly. Around 5:30 p.m., county and state officials decided to disconnect the poll books from the wireless network, which improved their speed. Until the disconnection, data from the poll books was properly transmitting to the database in Annapolis, Nikki B. Charlson, the state elections board’s deputy director, said Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
