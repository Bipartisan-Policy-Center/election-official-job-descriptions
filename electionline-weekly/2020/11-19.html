							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Every election has a story to tell</strong><br />
<em>Story of 2020 still being written, but some chapters are done</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick, senior advisor<br />
The Democracy Fund</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5564" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VotingMask.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Every election has a story to tell. Coming into the 2020 election, officials worked to take the necessary steps to ensure a positive voter experience, in light of the extreme enthusiasm for this presidential cycle and anticipated high voter turnout in the midst of a global pandemic. Election officials around the country considered whether existing resources were sufficient, if their forecasted budget covered potential additional supplies and staffing, and how to most efficiently handle registration. These additional considerations were tackled on top of the need to strengthen cyber defenses and thwart attempts by foreign adversaries to shake our trust in the American electoral process that arose from the 2016 election.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Lessons</strong><br />
A few weeks into the Presidential Primary season, a global pandemic hit the nation—highlighting the dramatic differences between states with early election dates and those with elections later in the spring. The issues that arose during the primaries highlighted the need for election administration to adjust and rise to the unprecedented challenges presented by a nation simultaneously battling a pandemic. Elections offices were strained by – and struggled to fulfill – an extreme rise of ballot applications from the massive shift to absentee and vote by mail. Poll worker shortages, polling location denials, and limited early voting restricted in- person voting options and resulted in voters waiting in line – in masks and protective gear – for hours. In many jurisdictions, their prescriptive state laws dictated – in some cases prevented officials from serving their voters to the best of ability – what type of facilities could be used as polls and who could serve as a pollworker and in which locations.</p>
<p><strong>Voters Needed Options</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5823" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Maine-Poll-workers.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Some states, however, were better positioned with laws, processes and resources in place that prioritized voters’ varied needs. States that provided voters with more options in terms of when and where to vote were best able to pivot during the pandemic to spread out when ballots were cast throughout the voting period of the election—enabling voters to fulfill their civic duty while still combatting the spread of COVID-19.  Election Day became the “last day to vote” in those states, not the only day to vote. Those states that took decisive actions to listen to their state and local election officials on how to best conduct the election, led to more than 100 million ballots cast before Election Day—more than half of the total turnout.</p>
<p><strong>Democracy Delivered</strong><br />
Although the final official numbers are not yet in from every state, we know that more voters than ever opted to have their ballot handed to them by their United States Postal Service (USPS) mail carrier rather than a pollworker, and that the dedicated public servants at USPS delivered the majority of ballots within their<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/05/usps-late-ballots-election/"> First Class delivery standard of two to five days</a> with the average ballot tracking at two days for local voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5579" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-Mailbox-193x300.png" alt="" width="193" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-Mailbox-193x300.png 193w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-Mailbox.png 386w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" />However, there were still challenges. In some jurisdictions this year, USPS leadership agreed to manually pull ballots out of the mailstream and deliver them locally rather than processing through the normal automated process at centralized processing plants. This caused confusion around ballot tracking, and led some to believe – and promote the false narrative – that ballots were lost rather than simply not scanned due to the manual delivery. Additionally, tens of thousands of ballots were mailed after USPS’s recommended timeline – one week before ballots were due – with many mailed on Election Day in states that reject ballots not received by the time the polls close.</p>
<p><strong>Democracy Under Attack</strong><br />
As in the 2016 election, we saw continued efforts to undermine confidence in the system in an attempt to dissuade participation and discredit the outcome of the race. More than 400 lawsuits were filed either seeking to restrict or expand voters’ options. This tension extends to policies either lauded as serving the electorate well or attempts to wrongly influence the election including practices like drive-thru voting, ballot drop boxes, mailing of ballot applications to all registered voters, mailing ballots to all registered voters, paying for postage, expansion of in person voting, expansion of early voting, use of postmarks or other information from USPS to demonstrate the ballot had been mailed before the close of the polls.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6255" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-768x512.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic”. This is part of the common oath that the thousands of election administrators and close to a million pollworkers take each election.  Indeed, it is part of the oath of office many of our elected officials swear to, including those in Congress and the Vice President of the United States. I cannot think of another election where the oath was so tested, where the mettle of the legions of Americans who make our Democracy function were challenged and their integrity maligned as it was this year. A year when election officials were faced with ensuring the sanctity of the ballot was protected as fires raged, hurricanes battered our shores, tornadoes struck, and almost a quarter million Americans lost their lives in a global pandemic. A year when philanthropy stepped in and provided resources in excess of what our sitting Congress saw fit to allocate. A year when too often partisan rancor impeded the practical solutions provided by state and local election officials. A year when more Americans than ever before made certain that their voices were heard at the ballot box. Yes, a year that we should be celebrating the tenacity of the American Voter and those who serve them in defiance of all these odds.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Experiment</strong><br />
The story of this election is still being written. When it is done, we must carry forward the lessons learned this year, and not fall into the trap of returning the status quo. In the months ahead, many states will rightfully consider codifying the voting options used this year, and work to remedy the disconnect in some laws with USPS processes—including ballot application deadlines and “postmark” definitions. In a year full of immense challenges, there have been huge accomplishments and devastating challenges. We must now commit to adopting those that were successful and remedying others that were not to ensure voters are better served in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Recounts</strong>:<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-vote-discrepancies-reconciled-on-last-day-of-recount/NB7BD5L5F5F4NI43H2YSS6LMLA/"> Georgia</a> completed its manual recount this week with President-Elect Joe Biden still up by 12,781 votes although President Donald J. Trump did gain about 1,400 votes. There’s no indication of broader problems beyond three counties that didn’t load all votes from memory cards and one county that didn’t rescan all ballots after an optical scanner was replaced because of a technical issue, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system manager told The Atlanta Journal Constitution. Three of the four counties that had issues are Republican-leaning politically. When the recount and audit exposed issues, election workers fixed them before results are finalized, Sterling said. “The system is working the way it’s intended,” Sterling said. “These people are operating under the highest level of stress, in the most contentious election in their work life in the United States and in Georgia. So for the most part they are doing a really good job on this.” Trump requested a partial recount in<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/18/trump-campaign-seek-partial-recount-wisconsin/6339193002/"> Wisconsin</a> this week with the focus on Milwaukee and Dane counties. Trump&#8217;s campaign paid the state $3 million and filed a petition for the partial recount on Wednesday. The Wisconsin Elections Commission authorized the recount just before midnight Wednesday. The recount petition alleges mistakes and fraud&#8221; were committed all over Wisconsin but particularly in Madison and Milwaukee. The petition does not provide specific examples of mistakes or fraud. A recount in Milwaukee County is estimated to cost about $2 million, according to the state Elections Commission. Dane County would cost about $740,000.</p>

<p><strong>Certification</strong>: Since it’s 2020, of course something as mundane as certification has become a thing. In<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-arizona-phoenix-elections-a2fe6a6f32ce125fa1baa2df61b14d51"> Arizona</a> the state GOP is pressuring county officials statewide to delay certifying their election results despite no evidence of legitimate questions about the vote count. According to The Associated Press, in northwestern Arizona, Mohave County officials postponed their certification until Nov. 23, while other counties press ahead. The state GOP has also filed suit in Maricopa County stop certification. In<a href="https://www.wilx.com/2020/11/18/michigan-secretary-of-state-all-counties-have-voted-to-certify-election-results/"> Michigan</a>, while all counties have now certified their results, it wasn’t without drama. In<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/us/politics/michigan-certify-election-results.html"> Wayne County</a>, the board of canvassers first deadlocked on certification with Republican canvassers insisting many precincts in the county had conflicting figures for the numbers of votes cast and the number of voters they recorded as having participated, even though the disparities mostly involved a small number of ballots. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, at one point, a Republican board member, Monica Palmer, made a motion to “certify the results in the communities other than the city of Detroit” — a move that would effectively disenfranchise one of the nation’s major predominantly Black cities. Bowing to public pressure the board backtracked and certified the results. However, at press time, two Republican members of the canvassing board are<a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-local-elections-arizona-michigan-29da6aac9cc41e47f3095855e7af7031"> seeking to rescind their certification</a>. According to The Associated Press, the person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support. Then, on Wednesday, Palmer and Hartmann signed affidavits saying they believe the county vote “should not be certified.”  And while not controversial, it is so 2020.<a href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/virus-outbreak-delays-westmoreland-vote-certification/"> Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania</a> has had to delay certification of its results due to a coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3515" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Arizona-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Threats to Democracy</strong>: Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) have both gone on the record about threats made to their or their family’s personal safety from people disgruntled by the results. In<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/526559-arizona-secretary-of-state-calls-on-trump-members-of-congress-to-stop"> Arizona</a>, Hobbs’ home address and other personal information were posted on social media. She has received at least one death threat and a group recently<a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/video-group-chants-we-are-watching-you-outside-arizona-secretary-of-state-katie-hobbs-home/75-a569ae35-3b62-424e-88f8-f03ca8b89458"> protested outside of her home</a> chanting “We are watching you.” In a statement Hobbs said that the “ongoing and escalating threats of violence” against her, her family and her office are “utterly abhorrent,&#8221; pledging that the “continued intimidation tactics will not prevent me from performing the duties I swore an oath to do.” She specifically faulted Trump and other elected officials for fueling distrust in the voting system. “There are those, including the <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3519" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Georgia-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />president, members of Congress and their elected officials, who are perpetuating misinformation and are encouraging others to distrust the election results in a manner that violates the oath of office they took,” Hobbs said. “It is well past time that they stop. Their words and actions have consequences.” In<a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-secretary-of-state-dealing-with-death-threats-says-recount-tracking-towards-biden-win-in-georgia"> Georgia</a>, Raffensperger said that death threats actually came to his wife’s cell phone. &#8220;What&#8217;s really troubling about it is when threats actually came into my wife&#8217;s you know cell phone,&#8221; Raffensperger told Fox 5. These are some of the threats sent to Raffensperger&#8217;s wife&#8217;s private cell phone number: &#8220;You better not botch this recount. Your life depends on it.&#8221;  &#8220;Your husband deserves to face a firing squad.&#8221; &#8220;The Raffenspergers should be put on trial for treason and face execution.”</p>

Late last week Knotts tweeted out, “Hardest thing I’ve done as an elections administrator: present a challenge against the absentee ballot cast by my mom. In NC, the qualifications to vote are judged on election day. She passed away from glioblastoma after submitting her ballot but before Nov. 3 #electionintegrity.” “I couldn’t even bring myself to start doing the briefings on the challenges and I couldn’t figure out why,” Knotts told the News &amp; Observer. “Then I opened the folder, saw her name and realized I had been putting it off.” Knotts told the paper this election has been hard on her and her staff. The allegations and suspicion hurt them. “I wanted people to trust the process and know that not just me, but all election administrators, worked hard for this,” Knotts said. “We really want people to have trust in the system.” Knotts’ story took off, especially after she was interviewed by the News &amp; Observer. We’ve seen it published all over the country. Hopefully Americans can learn something from it.</p>

That way, every voter, regardless of age, background, or ability, can easily participate in the electoral process.</p>

On behalf of the Board of Supervisors and all of the residents of Henry County, I extend my deepest condolences to her family and friends.” Stone began those responsibilities as an assistant general registrar in 1975, during the presidency of Gerald Ford, and she just served her 12th presidential election. She was named general registrar in 1979, when Jimmy Carter was in the White House. She also oversaw 11 governors’ races and hundreds of state and local elections. “Liz was the quintessential public servant,” County Administrator Tim Hall said in a press release. “She was most diligent about ensuring democracy through constitutionally sound and fair elections. “She possessed the highest sense of integrity and commitment. I loved working with Liz, and I will miss her.”</p>

Trump said on Twitter: “The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud — including dead people voting, Poll Watchers not allowed into polling locations, ‘glitches’ in the voting machines which changed votes from Trump to Biden, late voting, and many more.

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are introducing a new bill to protect future elections. It’s called the<a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2020/11/13/loeffler-perdue-introduce-bill-to-review-2020-election/"> Securing America’s Future Election and Votes Act</a>. It would create a bipartisan commission to review the 2020 election and report to Congress recommendations to strengthen election integrity for the future. Nine Republicans and nine Democrats would be appointed to the commission if the bill passes. The commission would investigate: The effects of national emergencies like the coronavirus on our election system, the security risks facing mail-in ballots, and the extent of voter fraud in our election system. The commission would also develop best practices for mitigating fraud and increasing election security at the local, state, and federal levels.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, (R-Pennsylvania), introduced legislation that requires states to install video surveillance of ballot drop boxes, permits poll watching by at least two campaign representatives, prohibits ballot harvesting and requires a full audit of municipal voting systems.  The bill also includes a provision requiring that election officials count and record mail-in and absentee ballots immediately upon receipt, with the results kept secret until the polls have closed on Election Day. The bill, called<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/11/17/Pennsylvania-butler-rep-mike-kelly-legislation-requires-mail-in-vote-count-before-Election-Day/stories/202011170116"> The Protect Election Integrity Act of 2020</a>, will update federal election law to “restore their trust, which is essential to the health of our republic,” Kelly said in a statement.</p>

Kahle said the legislation would improve the integrity of Michigan’s elections by keeping the qualified voter file up to date. Under current laws, county clerks forward death information and people’s last known address to municipal city or township clerks, who are supposed to check their files and cancel the voter registration for anyone who dies.</p>

Nathan Dahm filed a series of<a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-state-senators-file-series-of-election-integrity-bills"> election integrity bills</a> this week. Senate Concurrent Resolution 1 measure would call on the legislatures of each state that did not report results on Election Day to use their power to audit and recount their election results. The legislation would call on state legislatures to follow the constitutional provision allowing them to select electors. It also would call on Congress to use their constitutional powers to pass national voter ID laws and require paper ballots. Senate Bill 33 would refocus the Electoral College in Oklahoma by requiring the legislature to select future electors unless Congress passes election integrity bills, including national voter laws. State Sen. David Bullard authored Senate Bill 32, which was co-authored by Dahm. The proposed bill would prohibit the implementation of any national popular vote system to be used for the Electoral College to cast their votes for the state of Oklahoma. Senate Bill 34 would require the secretary of the Oklahoma State Election Board to complete an audit of random election results to verify the paper ballots cast in the audited election match the electronic election results tabulated and tallied by the electronic election machines.  According to officials, the measure would apply to school board elections in February, municipal elections in April, primary elections in June, run-off elections in August, and the general election in November.</p>

The resolution tasks a bipartisan committee that holds subpoena power with compiling a report on issues and “inconsistencies,” and hiring a firm to audit the vote to ensure “the accuracy of the results,” the measure’s sponsor said. While the Department of State plans to undertake a similar review, GOP lawmakers said the work outlined in the resolution would be independent from Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, who they noted is named in several election lawsuits brought by the Trump campaign.</p>

I’m going to vote by mail. I’m going to vote the old fashioned way,’” said Mike Winder, R-West Valley City and the proposal’s sponsor. “It just gives you the voter options.” Rep.

That was done with no irregularities found. But attorney Jack Wilenchik representing the Arizona Republican Party says state law requires that the sample has to be done of at least 2% of all the precincts. In Maricopa County, he said, with 748 precincts, that would require checks at 15 separate precincts. Only thing is, Maricopa County &#8212; and some others &#8212; use &#8220;voting centers&#8221; rather than requiring residents to cast a ballot at the specific precinct in which they live. This year, Wilenchik said, there were about 175 of these. And what that means, he said, is that an audit of 2% of 175 voting centers is not sufficient, regardless of how many people voted at each one. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Hannah Jr.<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2020/11/18/judge-promises-quick-decision-in-latest-arizona-gop-attack-on-election/"> appeared skeptical</a> of GOP arguments that the county’s audit of ballots from its voting centers runs counter to state law, which requires an audit by precinct – even though the county did not have precinct-based voting this year. He said he would provide his ruling at press time.</p>

Heckman’s ruling places a permanent injunction against the Governor that prevents him from changing existing state law, even during a pandemic. The ruling does not affect the results of the 2020 general election. California Assemblymembers James Gallagher (R-Yuba City) and Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) brought the lawsuit against Governor Newsom.

The suit, filed Wednesday by voters who supported Trump on Nov. 3, specifically targets Ingham, Washtenaw and Wayne counties &#8220;because they provide enough votes to change the results&#8221; of the election in Michigan, attorney Jim Bopp said.  Invalidating votes in those three counties would mean tossing 1.2 million votes out of the roughly 5.5 million cast in Michigan. Democrat Joseph Biden won Michigan by about 146,000 votes. The voters&#8217; accusation that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, state elections officials, the three counties&#8217; clerks and canvassers mishandled the election is &#8220;ludicrous,&#8221; shameful and poorly contrived, Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum said. The lawsuit was<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/11/16/lawsuit-ingham-washtenaw-wayne-michigan/6311519002/"> voluntarily withdrawn</a> on Monday. A hearing the case was never held.</p>
<p>Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Timothy Kenny ruled claims that Wayne County and Detroit election officials purposely cheated the system to swing the election for Joe Biden are “not credible” and<a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/11/michigan-judge-says-republicans-claims-are-incorrect-and-not-credible-in-voter-fraud-lawsuit.html"> denied a request to stop Michigan’s election results from being certified</a>. In a Nov. 13 ruling, Kenny denied a request from Republican plaintiffs Cheryl Costantino and Edward McCall to stop Wayne County from certifying election results in a lawsuit that alleged election officials cheated the system. Republicans&#8217; motion for a court-ordered independent audit of the results was denied by Kenny, who said “in addition to it being an unwarranted intrusion on the authority of the Legislature, such an audit would require the rest of (Wayne County) and the State to wait on results.” On Monday, the<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/11/16/court-appeals-wont-delay-wayne-county-election-certification/6319951002/"> Michigan Court of Appeals</a> rejected the request to reverse a Wayne County Circuit Court judge&#8217;s Friday ruling allowing the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to complete the audit of the November election and certify the county&#8217;s election results by the Nov. 17 deadline as required under state law.</p>

The four-member elections board, which consists of two Republican and two Democratic commissioners, deadlocked on whether to approve another 157 of the challenged ballots, said Powell, one of the Democratic commissioners, leaving Superior Court Assignment Judge Benjamin C. Telsey to break the tie.</p>

Raymond Cross, a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, said the judge’s decision Oct. 28 to dismiss the case without a hearing denied plaintiffs a chance to respond. Cross brought the case with his sister, the late Marilyn Hudson. He said the appeal also will challenge Judge Daniel Traynor’s decision that the court lacks jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims. Traynor cited a 1975 court ruling involving the Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge Reservation, which determined the quasi-sovereign status of the Indian tribes gives them the ability to determine the extent to which the right to vote is to be exercised in tribal elections, absent explicit Congressional legislation to the contrary.</p>

The state high court&#8217;s ruling overturns an earlier decision that the Trump campaign had called a major win, even while it affected no actual votes in Pennsylvania. But that small win has propelled the Trump campaign in recent days to argue that vote counts across the state have been unfair and prompted them to push suspicions of fraud. The chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Republican Thomas Saylor, wrote that the Trump campaign&#8217;s apparent aim to throw out votes would be disenfranchisement. Saylor wrote in his dissent that he &#8220;fail[ed] to see that there is a real issue here.&#8221; He pointed out that issues over how an election is administered could largely be addressed by courts before the election, and even by trial courts early during ballot counting &#8212; not well after, as the Trump campaign has tried to do.</p>
<p>A Pennsylvania appellate court handed President Donald Trump’s campaign a minor victory, barring counties from including in their final vote tallies<a href="https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/national_world/pa-appellate-court-sides-with-trump-in-fight-over-id-deadlines-for-voters-tossing-small/article_7b8f8f5c-b00d-540b-b462-2d148a6431ed.html"> a small pool of mail ballots</a> from people who had failed to provide required ID by a Monday deadline. In a two-page order, a Commonwealth Court judge struck down a decision by the Wolf administration to give voters more time, post-election, to fulfill the ID requirement. Although state law only requires first-time voters to show ID at the polls, all voters who applied to vote by mail had to be validated their identification against state records by Nov. 9. Two days before the election, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar pushed that date back by three days, citing a court decision earlier this year that allowed late-arriving mail ballots to be counted as long as they had been mailed by Nov. 3 and received within three days of that date. In her order, Commonwealth Court President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt ruled that Boockvar had no authority to do that.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in Philadelphia on Friday rejected an effort led by a Republican congressional candidate to<a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/federal-court-rejects-effort-to-block-late-arriving-ballots-pennsylvania/34670936"> block about 9,300 ballots</a> that arrived after Election Day. The three-judge panel, led by Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Brooks Smith, noted the “unprecedented challenges” facing the nation this year, especially the “vast disruption” caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith said the panel ruled “with commitment to a proposition indisputable in our democratic process: that the lawfully cast vote of every citizen must count.” The ruling involves the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision to accept mail-in ballots that arrived by Friday, Nov. 6, three days after the close of polling places. Republicans have the same issue pending on appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Joseph James ruled on Wednesday that 2,349<a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/11/18/allegheny-county-mail-in-ballots-without-declaration-dates/"> mail-in ballots</a> can be counted because they were received by Election Day even though the voters failed to date the outside. James said, absent any evidence of fraud, count them all. ACLU legal director Vic Walczak said, “Judge James today in his opinion got it exactly right, said there was not even an allegation that these 2,300 voters were improper. Clearly these ballots arrived on time, and there’s absolutely no reason they shouldn’t be counted.”</p>

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Green Bay seeks to change the outcome of Wisconsin&#8217;s election to President Donald Trump&#8217;s favor by excluding the presidential votes from the counties in the state&#8217;s final election certification, alleging without evidence that absentee voting is fraught with widespread fraud. The plaintiffs allege voters in these counties may have bypassed state law requiring voters to provide photo identification by dubbing themselves &#8220;indefinitely confined&#8221; due to the coronavirus pandemic. The suit also takes issue with clerks&#8217; ability to take corrective actions to remedy errors related to witness’s addresses on absentee ballots. The plaintiffs<a href="https://www.wearegreenbay.com/election/plaintiffs-drop-suit-claiming-fraud-in-wisconsin-absentees/"> dropped their suit</a> this week. A court filing didn’t give a reason and an attorney for the voters declined to say why, citing attorney-client privilege.</p>
