														<p><strong>Necessity is the mother of invention</strong><br />
<em>Keeping poll workers and voters safe is a necessity in Neenah, Wisc.</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5357" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.19.48-PM-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.19.48-PM-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.19.48-PM-1024x1022.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.19.48-PM-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.19.48-PM-768x767.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.19.48-PM.png 1220w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At press time, Wisconsin is still planning on holding its April 7 primary. Although more than one million Badgers have requested an absentee ballot, people have still been showing up to vote early and will still be showing up at polling places on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Having voters and poll workers intermingling during a global pandemic has gotten folks creative juices flowing. In the City of<a href="https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Madison-library-book-drops-used-for-absentee-ballot-drop-off--569293661.html"> Madison</a>, the elections office is co-opting library book drops to use them for absentee ballot drops. In<a href="https://waow.com/2020/04/01/woman-makes-hand-sanitizer-for-tomahawk-poll-workers/"> Tomahawk</a>, a local business owner has made hand sanitizer for the town’s poll workers.</p>
<p>And in the <a href="https://www.ci.neenah.wi.us/">City of Neenah</a>, Mayor<a href="https://www.ci.neenah.wi.us/government/about-mayors-office/"> Dean R. Kaufert</a> and his team have built plexiglass barriers to put between poll workers and voters.</p>
<p>“Our Finance Department underwent a recent renovation and installed glass barriers for the customer area. I was walking by that and thought to myself if we built something like that to use in our election process to protect the worker and the voter that would be fairly easy to construct,” explained Kaufert. “I sketched something out on paper and gave it to Pat and 6 hours later had a prototype that we then made slight adjustments to size etc. and I asked him to construct 26 of them.”</p>
<p>The Pat that Kaufert is referring to is Pat Fischer who along with Ron Fedenko are the building maintenance men for the city built the 26 shields in about six hours. It cost the city about $100 to make each shield which Kaufert attributed to the cost of the plexiglass.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5358" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.21.29-PM-300x271.png" alt="" width="300" height="271" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.21.29-PM-300x271.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.21.29-PM.png 462w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Poll workers began using the shields with early voting that started this week and Kaufert said the response has been very positive.</p>
<p>“The comments have ALL been very positive and appreciative that we were innovative and cared about the safety and health of both,” Kaufert said. “Some workers that were considering not working the polls are now going to work because of the steps we have taken.”</p>
<p>Neenah has 14,000 registered voters and almost 7,000 have requested absentee ballots with one day to go. Kaufert said they are predicting about  an 85% turnout due to a local school referendum.</p>
<p>The city has decided to close all six of its polling places and will instead use one, large vote center located in former<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopko"> Shopko</a> location.</p>
<p>“This building is 90,000 square feet and will allow for all to be under one roof while still operating individually and practicing social distancing. All of our previous sites are small and cramped. This building will allow us to spread out,” Kaufert explained.</p>
<p>In addition to the plexiglass shields and social distancing, the city has also found that a nitrate glove will allow people to sign the e-poll book and they have secured enough for everyone that wants one to get one along with the idea of using a Q-tip with tinfoil wrap which Mayor Kaufert found on the Internet.</p>
<p>Kaufert has also appointed an election task force with the council president as chairman with a five person committee to make sure we have not missed anything in order to make the election work.</p>
<p>While Kaufert would have preferred to wait a month or so to hold the primary, the show must go on and he and his team feel they are ready.</p>
<p>“I would have preferred that the election be pushed back 4-6 weeks and strongly believe that was the responsible action,” Kaufert said. “But when the Legislature, elections commission and governor all said no I decided we would do the best we can to protect everyone that will be voting on April 7.”</p>
<p>In parting, he added what will no doubt become the 2020 tagline:</p>
<p>“Wash your hands, don&#8217;t touch your face and Social Distance. Stay safe and healthy!”</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> A special thank you to Mayor Kaufert for taking the time to email us back about what we think is a really great idea. We wish Mayor Kaufert, Neenah Clerk Patty A. Sturn, and all the voters, poll workers and election workers in Neenah and all of Wisconsin the best of luck on Tuesday. Stay safe.</p>

Asa Hutchinson</span><a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2020/mar/29/loss-of-polling-site-will-aid-incumbent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shrunk the number of voting sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 14 to six and then the mayor of Sherrill said the Sherril City Hall could not be used further reducing the number of sites to five. A total of 807 ballots were cast in the runoff elections&#8211;190 voters had cast ballots during the week of early voting and 80 absentee ballots had been received by mail by the cutoff time of 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. A glitch in reading the votes from the personal electronic ballot devices resulted in 278 votes showing in early voting, 88 more than the 190 that were actually cast. The problem was caught when Election Administrator Sven Hipp noticed the discrepancy on one of the readouts and called for a manual count. Election Commissioner Stuart Soffer attributed the problem to the counties aging voting equipment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Public Opinion</strong>: According to a new Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, 57 percent of voters said that</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/490182-poll-voters-say-its-unsafe-to-hold-primary-elections-amid-coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holding primary elections risks exposing too many people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the coronavirus. Sixty percent said that if their state held a primary election this week, the risk of exposure would factor into their decision of whether or not to vote. Seventy-seven percent of voters said they’d support conducting the entire 2020 general election by mail. Fifty-seven percent said voting should be able to take place online. The Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll of 2,410 registered voters was conducted between March 24 to March 26 and has a 2 percentage point margin of error.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> Since the state’s March 17 primary several poll workers in two different counties have tested positive for the COVID-19.

A second worker worked just on the 17th. Another poll worker in</span><a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/03/30/duval-county-poll-worker-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Duvall County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became sick six days after the primary which means they were infectious during the primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> Georgia has already moved its primary from March 24 to May 19</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and now House Speaker David Ralston</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/house-speaker-ralston-wants-georgia-primary-delayed-until-summer/wyBtcqXwpeczSeW5D8Z2eP/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants the primary to be postponed again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until June 23. “Pushing the primary back a month or more gives us more time to allow the situation to improve so that voters can vote in the manner in which they are most familiar,” wrote Ralston according to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>. “I realize you have developed plans to accommodate any continuing public health concerns. While I commend the goal, I respectfully submit that many of these measures deserve full and thorough legislative consideration before implementation.” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has said the</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-primary-should-stay-may-say-elections-chief-and-counties/WXrrMz6kK4mm3x33mKmXUN/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> primary should remain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May. Advocates have raised concerns about the fact that the state will</span><a href="https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20200328/stamps-become-issue-in-georgias-absentee-ballot-plan"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not pay for postage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to return the absentee ballot request nor the ballot itself, which will require $0.65. “Having to go get a stamp is a new cost for people that don’t usually do mail,” Gregg Murray, a political science professor at Augusta University told the <em>Augusta Chronicle</em>. “Have our students used stamps? I don’t know if they have or not. They’ve got to know something about them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Idaho:</strong> Following a request from Secretary of State Lawerence Denney to move the state’s May 19 primary to a later date, Gov.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Indiana:</strong> With the state encouraging as many voters as possible to cast their ballots via absentee for the upcoming primary, Pulaski County is working to give voters a variety of ways to request those absentee ballots including by</span><a href="https://wkvi.com/2020/03/pulaski-county-to-take-absentee-ballot-requests-by-facebook-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sending a request to the county’s Facebook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Christ Whitmire, spokesman for the state’s election commission told the <em>Greenville News</em> that he’s not aware of any other instances where staff and an elections board resigned all at once in his 15 years with the commission. The county has reassigned two employees to work in the elections office. In a letter sent to the local state legislators, the board members said they were resigning because of interference by the county&#8217;s administrator, the legislative delegation and the county council. The letter says the county has understaffed and underfunded its elections operations for years, stretching any director &#8220;beyond human capabilities.&#8221;</span></p>

Among the requests the NCSBOE wants to make Election Day a holiday, boost pay for precinct officials, create a fund to pay for absentee ballot postage, give local elections officials more time to count absentee ballots, reduce or eliminate the need for a notary or public witness on an absentee ballot and allow staff at nursing homes to assist residents with ballots. “We’ll take a serious look at proposals to adjust our elections procedures in response to the crisis,&#8221; Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), co-chair of the Senate Elections committee, said according to WRAL. &#8220;But what we we’re not going to do is pass a Democratic Party wishlist that includes rolling back the protections we put in place after fraud occurred during the last election cycle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The Legislature has approved, and the governor has signed into law, a meaure that</span><a href="https://kelo.com/news/articles/2020/apr/01/city-of-sioux-falls-moves-cityschool-board-election-from-april-to-june/1001919/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> postpones any election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state scheduled from April 14 to May 26 to any Tuesday in June.</span></p>

The changes include how candidates can access the ballot, empowers municipal legislative bodies to change upcoming local elections during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis from floor meetings to Australian ballot, without requiring a full vote of the town and creates emergency powers to allow the Secretary of State’s office, with the agreement of the Governor, to enact the necessary measures to enable Vermonters to vote safely during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis. Such measures could include the mailing of ballots to every registered voter, an extended cutoff for Clerks to receive voted ballots, an expanded window for Clerks to process voted ballots, the creation of secure ballot return stations, or the moving of polling locations, as examples.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5328" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Florida-Welcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Florida-Welcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Florida-Welcome.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida</strong>: U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle warned the state’s attorneys to come up with a process to determine whether felons have paid</span><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-felon-voting-federal-judge-20200326-qz2bmqs5xzhxdexfdqdoiu47gm-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “legal financial obligations”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as required by the law and whether those felons have the ability to pay the court-ordered fees and fines. He said that work needs to be done before an April 27 trial in the case. “If the state is not going to fix it, I will,” Hinkle snapped during a telephone hearing Thursday afternoon according to the Orlando Sentinel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has</span><a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/03/31/federal-appeals-court-refuses-revisit-felons-voting-rights-decision/5096659002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned down a request by Gov. Ron DeSantis for an en banc review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a decision by three-judge regarding the restoration of voting rights to former felons in the Sunshine State. According to the <em>Tallahasse Democrat</em>, the decision intensifies pressure for DeSantis’ administration to come up with a system to determine whether Floridians who register to vote are felons who have outstanding financial obligations, and provide the information to local supervisors of elections, who have the authority to remove people from the voting rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Florida, a three-judge panel of the Fifth District Court of Appeal today unanimously upheld the guilty conviction of Kimberle Weeks, the</span><a href="https://flaglerlive.com/152224/kimberle-weeks-conviction-upheld/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Flagler County Supervisor of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on four counts, throwing out four others on double-jeopardy grounds. The appeal court ordered the circuit court to re-sentence Weeks on the four counts. The excision of the four other counts doesn’t materially change three essential aspects of the case: the appeal court affirmed that Weeks is a felon four times over. Weeks will have to serve a month in jail and up to 18 months’ probation. And she will lose the state pension she accrued while supervisor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kentucky:</strong> The Kentucky Attorney General’s office released an opinion on Monday</span><a href="https://www.richmondregister.com/news/gov-beshear-had-right-to-delay-election-ag-says-in/article_4718ee9e-7971-592e-b47d-9569956dcbef.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upholding Gov. Andy Beshear’s power to delay an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a declared state of emergency. The opinion came at the request of the Honest Elections Project. It says the executive order complied with the statutory “safeguards” imposed by the General Assembly in the specific grant of authority in the statute: the order was issued during a declared state of emergency, it followed the recommendation of the Secretary of State as required, and it moved the primary election to a date “within thirty-five days” from the original date.</span></p>

The clerks said they otherwise face an impossible choice – putting voters’ and election workers’ lives at risk or violating their oath of office – amid the coronavirus pandemic. New Mexico</span><a href="https://www.krwg.org/post/new-mexico-secretary-state-supports-all-mail-primary-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maggie Toulouse Oliver said she supports the move.

It also contends that by refusing to reopen voter registration, the procedures violate federal law that sets the deadline for registration as no earlier than 30 days before an election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> Judge Stacey Trotter of the 358th District Court has</span><a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2020/04/02/new-election-republican-nomination-seventh-district-court-appeals-justice-ordered-by-judge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ordered a new election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Republican nomination of the office of Justice, Seventh District Court of Appeals, Place 4. Trotter’s ruling says election officials in two counties failed to recognize mistakes in ballots, an action they say prevented “1,214 eligible voters from Cochran and Collingsworth counties from participating in this election and voting for and selecting the candidate of their choice.”</span></p>

In this suit, advocates are requesting that absentee ballots returned without the</span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/brief/third-election-lawsuit-against-wec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required witness signature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be accepted. “This requirement poses a significant barrier to absentee, mail-in voting for any self-quarantining eligible voter who lives alone or who does not have an adult U.S. citizen in their household,” the complaint states. “Indeed, for these voters, it will be simply impossible to satisfy the witness signature requirement to cast an absentee, mail-in ballot, and that voter will be denied their right to vote — caught in an unconstitutionally burdensome and unnecessary choice between their life and their liberty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Wisconsin, the state’s Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the state GOP which had brought a suit against Dane County Clerk Scott McDonnell who had said people could mark themselves “</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-supreme-court-sides-gop-over-absentee-voting-guidance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">indefinitely confined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” due to the current pandemic and thus bypass the state’s voter ID law. &#8220;McDonell&#8217;s March 25, 2020, advice was legally incorrect,&#8221; the court wrote in its decision. &#8220;Voters may be misled to exercise their right to vote in ways that are inconsistent with (state law).&#8221;  The court ordered McDonell to stop issuing guidance that&#8217;s different from official language approved by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The commission guidance indicates that &#8220;indefinitely confined status is for each individual voter to make based upon their current circumstances,&#8221; but the status is not to be used simply as a means of avoiding the voter ID requirement.</span></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Misinformation</strong>: <em>The New York Times</em> has an interesting piece about how tech giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google and spent the last three years</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/technology/facebook-google-twitter-november-election.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prepping to protect the 2020 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but in that time the threat has changed. It’s gone from basic Russian trolls to a multitude of players and opportunities to mis/disinform the public. “They’ve built defenses for past battles, but are they prepared for the next front in the war?” Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a think tank that works to counter foreign interference campaigns, told the Times. “Anytime you’re dealing with a sophisticated actor, they’re going to evolve their tactics as you evolve your defenses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vendors</strong>: According to <em>CyberScoop</em>, HackerOne, a company that pairs ethical hackers with organizations to fix software flaws, has</span><a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/voatz-hackerone-bug-bounty-election-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kicked mobile voting vendor Voatz off its platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing the vendor’s hostile interactions with security researchers. A spokesman told CyberScoop that it’s the first time in eight years that HackerOne has expelled and an organization from its bug-bounty-hosting platform. In a statement to CyberScoop, Voatz blamed the change in its relationship with HackerOne on a “small group of researchers who, along with a few other members of the community, believe Voatz reported a researcher to the FBI” — something Voatz says never happened. “We are steadfast in our commitment to continuing our work with collaborative researchers to test the security of our platform,” Voatz said. “We will soon be launching a new public bug bounty program, available to any researcher.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Florida:</strong> Florida’s</span><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/03/30/floridas-voter-registration-system-experiences-intermittent-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online voter registration system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced “intermittent issues” Sunday that could have kept some residents from registering to vote online. Some users who went to</span><a href="https://registertovoteflorida.gov/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> RegistertovoteFlorida.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sunday encountered a 503 error saying the service was unavailable. The Florida Department of State said Sunday evening that some users experienced issues but others have been able to submit voter registration applications. It said Sunday evening that the site appeared to be up and running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The State Board of Elections and N.C. Division of Motor Vehicles have launched a service to allow DMV customers to</span><a href="https://www.wnct.com/on-your-side/consumer-watch/state-board-dmv-partner-to-expand-online-voter-registration-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> apply to register to vote or update existing voter registration information online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a standalone service that does not require the user to complete an NCDMV transaction, such as a license renewal or duplicate, at the same time. The free service comes at a time when many county boards of elections have limited access or are closed to the public, and while residents are being asked to stay home because of the spread of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>West Virginia</strong>: Late last week, Terra Muncy, a Kanawha County registered voter, became the</span><a href="https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2020/03/kanawha-county-woman-casts-first-digital-vote-of-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first resident with a disability to vote electronically from home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It was very simple and straight-forward,” Muncy said. “It didn’t take me very long at all.” Muncy, who is wheelchair-bound, said she received an email from the Kanawha County Clerk’s Office with a link and a PIN number. Once she clicked the link and entered her PIN number, she was taken to a ballot, which she prepared and returned electronically. Voters with disabilities who qualify for the electronic absentee ballot fill out the full absentee voting application. Once approved, they electronically receive their ballot and vote online through a program created by Seattle-based Democracy Live and funded by Tusk Montgomery Philanthropies.</span></p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0 Public Comment Period</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period, and scheduling a virtual public hearing for Friday, March 27.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</span></p>
