							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Day 2020<br />
</strong><em>A state-by-state look at the general election</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Ballots are still being counted, canvassed and certified. Lawsuits are still being filed. And the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html?smid=tw-share">misinformation/disinformation</a> game is still being played by some.</p>
<p>But for all intents and purposes, the 2020 election is basically over and while there were a lot of concerns going in, it really turned out be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/09/933186881/officials-and-experts-say-election-went-unexpectedly-well">a rather unremarkable Election Day</a>. And as we all know, in the world of elections, unremarkable is a good thing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5781" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Last week we did <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/11-05/">a quick round up</a> of what happened on Tuesday, November 3 and this week we’ll take a closer, state-by-state look, but to be honest, it’s been hard to find any actual news in some states. And trust us, we looked!</p>
<p>Although we&#8217;ve posted dozens (hundreds?!) of stories about the ballot-counting process since November 3, we haven&#8217;t included too much of that here because while there has been litigation and lots of screaming and yelling other than a few instances in a handful states, the ballot counting process has been smooth (other than the threats of violence and the aforementioned screaming and yelling).</p>
<p>You can read all of our <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/11-03/">Election Day Dispatches</a> here and of course all the post-Election Day news can be found in our <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/news/">Daily News</a> sections.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama</strong>: With record-breaking <a href="https://www.wvtm13.com/article/2-3-million-alabama-voters-turn-out-for-the-2020-election/34580267">turnout</a> some voters in the Yellowhammer State faced long <a href="https://abc3340.com/news/your-voice-your-vote/merrill-blames-local-election-officials-for-long-lines-at-trussville-polling-locations">lines</a> at polling places and in some counties, election workers were overwhelmed with the number of <a href="https://whnt.com/news/jackson-county-elections-workers-overwhelmed-by-absentee-ballots/">absentee ballots</a> to process. Although there were some initial concerns that ballots had gone missing in <a href="https://altoday.com/archives/37387-hundreds-of-missing-ballots-now-accounted-for-in-tuscaloosa">Tuscaloosa County</a>, it turns out an error in the ballot counting machine made it appear that way.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong>: You know you’re in the largest state in the Union when it takes a while to <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/11/05/every-state-except-alaska-has-counted-more-than-60-of-its-votes-heres-why/">count your ballots</a>. Alaska waits until the week after Election Day to <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/11/09/prioritizing-in-person-voting-has-slowed-alaskas-absentee-ballot-counting-process/">begin tabulating absentee ballots</a> since they have to arrive from an area that is roughly the size of the entire country. While that’s not typically an issue this year with so many people choosing to vote by mail it has been waiting longer for results to come in. What’s still unclear as ballots continue to be counted is whether or not <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/11/11/election-reform-ballot-measure-stays-too-close-to-call-as-elections-workers-tally-more-votes/">Ballot Measure 2</a>, which would, among other things, move the state to a ranked choice voting system will be approved or not.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: While Arizona is one of a handful of states that’s been caught in the <a href="https://kvoa.com/news/2020/11/06/arizona-secretary-of-state-decries-false-misleading-statements-from-president-others-about-vote-count/">post-election ballot-counting turmoil</a> ginned up by president, Election Day itself in Grand Canyon State went off with relatively few issues. Probably the most exciting thing, for us anyway, was the report that animal control had to be called to a <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-notebook-voters-badgered-at-poll-napier-asks-for-nanos-investigation-and-more/article_6add3d83-47a8-5497-aa68-a0d221ef3388.html">Tucson-area polling place</a> when a juvenile badger wandered in. According to The Arizona Daily Star, no election workers were harassed, or ballots eaten, during the incident.</p>

In <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/pulaski-county-election-commission-duplicates-roughly-1200-damaged-absentee-ballots">Pulaski County</a>, the election commission had to duplicate about 1,200 absentee ballots that were damaged. Officials in <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/nov/05/glitch-stalls-count-in-carroll-county/?elections">Carroll County</a> had to input information from about 1,800 absentee ballots after a glitched forced the need to print new ones.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: With <a href="https://www.bakersfield.com/news/as-ballot-processing-grinds-on-more-complete-results-expected-in-several-days/article_9b2902c6-2457-11eb-bece-b38eb467c922.html">ballots still be counting</a> in numerous counties, overall the Election Day in the Golden State <a href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/california/prepared-for-the-worst-californias-election-went-ok/509-a777c852-ba15-45d4-a832-f3ec4184ff91">went well</a>. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-10/la-county-vote-system-gets-high-marks-votes-trickle-in">Los Angeles County</a>, which saw countless problems during its primary earlier this year is getting praise for how well things went on Nov. 3. <a href="https://www.dailybulletin.com/2020/11/03/long-lines-on-election-day-prompt-extra-voting-center-to-open-at-san-bernardino-airport/">San Bernardino County</a> did face long lines on Election Day which forced the county to open an additional vote center at the airport. In <a href="https://voiceofoc.org/2020/11/elections-officials-and-da-investigate-alleged-fake-vote-center-in-westminster/">Orange County</a>, the county DA and the registrar of voters had to investigate an allegedly fraudulent vote center in the city of Westminster.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: For the “smug marrieds” in Colorado, since we <a href="https://littletonindependent.net/stories/its-a-relief-election-day-goes-smoothly,316107">don’t really have anything to report</a>, we’ll include this story about <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/how-did-colorado-get-really-good-at-elections-by-having-really-bad-ones-before/73-364ce63d-8ec6-4039-977f-cf8ca2ccbce7">how bad your elections used to be</a>, which is why they are now good.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut</strong>: Long <a href="https://www.courant.com/politics/elections/hc-pol-connecticut-election-day-live-story-20201103-czffxjxifvalbfmkxlrisxuq3a-story.html">lines</a> greeted some voters in the early hours of voting on <a href="https://www.norwichbulletin.com/story/news/2020/11/04/fears-violence-and-disruptions-polling-places-failed-materialize-connecticut-and-most-nation-tuesday/6158394002/">Election Day</a> in the Nutmeg State, but much of that was caused by the <a href="https://we-ha.com/election-day-in-west-hartford-safety-measures-lead-to-lines-at-polling-places/">need to social distance</a> and not because of any technical problems, although there were some of those issues as well such a <a href="https://www.wshu.org/post/conn-election-officials-work-around-jammed-ballot-scanners">jammed ballot scanners</a>. Absentee voting was so popular, some in the state are pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow for no-excuse absentee voting moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware</strong>: Although there were concerns about <a href="https://delawarestatenews.net/police/police-mostly-unneeded-at-polling-places-tuesday/">violence at the polls</a> on Election Day, police in Delaware were only dispatched to four locations statewide— three on disorderly-person reports and another for a supposed harassment incident. According to DSP spokeswoman Master Cpl. Heather Pepper, “No enforcement action was required for any incident.” Overseeing his first presidential general election, Elections Commissioner Anthony Albence was <a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/post/elections-commissioner-reflects-very-successful-election-delaware">pleased</a> with the overall process.</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Although there were some <a href="https://nbc-2.com/news/politics/2020/11/03/tabulation-machines-at-lee-county-precincts-not-reading-second-page-of-ballot/">minor hiccups</a> on Election Day such the relocation of polling places due to a <a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-county/2020/11/03/sebastian-polling-place-closed-because-covid-19/6136457002/">COVID</a> outbreak and a <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/vote-2020/2020/11/04/live-updates-vote-counting-spills-into-the-weekend/">locked closet</a> in the Jacksonville area there were relatively few problems in Florida on Election Day or election night and many credited that to the overwhelming turnout for <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/11/04/vote-mail-early-voting-florida-election-results/">early voting</a>. As the Orlando Sentinel said in a <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/2020-election/fl-ne-election-2020-florida-fast-vote-reporting-20201105-4vecbsq2tffkfpzd25avu3zz4i-story.html">headline</a>: “No longer a ‘Flori-duh’ laughingstock: How Florida’s vote came in so fast”</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: While the results in Georgia are close enough to trigger an <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-launches-statewide-hand-recount-of-presidential-race/7PWR53SU6BAWDBOFRBJAW6HERA/">automatic recount</a>—by hand no less—Election Day itself was <a href="https://martinsvillebulletin.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/voting-in-georgia-remains-mainly-smooth-with-a-few-hiccups/article_1cca4e03-8d47-5946-91b5-e6e968568bce.html">smooth sailing</a> compared the primary back in June. As is the case with many other states, early voting turnout, which was through the roof in Georgia, contributed to shorter lines and fewer issues on Election Day. There were some polls that were forced to stay open late due to malfunctioning machines early in the day, but those problems didn’t plague voters throughout the day. <a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/voting-machines-in-spalding-county-ga-once-again-operating-after-countywide-outage-due-to-glitch">Spaulding County</a> suffered the brunt of the problems on election morning, but even those were rectified by mid-morning.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong>: Hawaii conducted its first presidential election by mail and overall things <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2020/11/05/what-worked-what-didnt-election-officials-discuss-ways-improve-by-next-election/">went well</a> although for those who chose to vote in person or who needed to <a href="https://www.kitv.com/story/42866854/same-day-voter-registration-contributed-to-long-wait-times-at-voter-service-centers-on-election-day">register and vote</a> on Election Day, there were some <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/11/05/long-wait-for-hawaii-vote-spurs-call-for-more-voter-centers/">delays at vote centers</a>. At one vote center on Oahu, the last voter cast their ballot at 11:30 p.m., four and half hours after polls had officially closed.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho</strong>: Idaho saw a <a href="https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/idaho-sees-record-high-voter-turnout-secretary-of-state-reports/article_90817b8b-0d1b-5d9b-b8c5-2bb8f0dff3dd.html">record-high turnout</a> for the November 3 general election and there were <a href="https://www.postregister.com/idaho-elections-official-report-mostly-smooth-day-so-far/article_3a9ebc78-723c-52df-81d8-47c440123f9c.html">very few</a>, if any, reports of problems. The state did have to deploy some <a href="https://www.idahopress.com/news/elections/idaho-flies-in-some-emergency-poll-workers-for-election-day/article_e99e2f5f-2495-5aca-9fd3-933885d6f208.html">emergency poll workers</a>, including flying them from one location to another, in order to fill in.</p>

A technical snafu, voting machine errors and an onslaught of data contributed to election night reporting delays in <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20201104/a-very-stressful-situation-why-election-night-results-were-delayed-in-dupage-lake-counties-">DuPage and Lake</a> counties</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong>: Although Election Day got off to a bumpy start in a few spots with long <a href="https://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/local/2020/11/03/election-day-live-updates-muncie-indiana-results/6089917002/">lines</a> and technical <a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/election-day-in-nwi-starts-with-long-lines-minor-glitches-at-polling-locations/article_6b56bbce-693c-533e-a355-e7baf8bb6be1.html">glitches</a> things went relatively well. <a href="https://www.wndu.com/2020/11/03/st-joseph-county-debuts-vote-centers-on-a-busy-election-day/">St. Joseph County</a> had a successful roll out of vote centers.

In <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/local-nurse-saves-womans-life-while-volunteering-at-polling-location/">Marion County</a>, a local nurse who was serving as a poll worker at the Lucas Oil Stadium site in Indianapolis saved a voter’s life went the woman passed out and became unresponsive.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong>: There were reports of a few Election Day <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/election-day-voting-2020-iowa-polling-places-linn-johnson-county-20201103">lines</a> in some areas, but there weren’t any reports of real problems or <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/11/03/latest-iowa-election-2020-election-day-live-updates-voting-issues-problems-president-congress-state/6125064002/">confrontations</a> at the polls. “I know there&#8217;s a couple of trucks around here that have got the big flags on the back and they’ve circled around and go up and down the highways but we&#8217;ve not heard of anybody affecting a polling place at all,” Warren County Auditor Traci VanderLinden said. Some Iowans were the <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/iowa-elections-officials-report-few-election-day-hiccups/6126273002/">target of robocalls</a> telling voters in several states to stay safe at home, but it didn’t seem to impact turnout. Recounts were required in <a href="https://www.kwqc.com/2020/11/06/secretary-of-state-orders-hand-count-audit-of-election-results-in-jasper-county-precinct-recount-of-countywide-results/">Jasper County</a> and <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2020/11/10/secretary-of-state-orders-audit-of-lucas-county-precinct-due-to-error-requests-countywide-recount/">Lucas County</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: In <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article247020332.html">Johnson County</a> a poll worker said their supervising judge discriminated against them because they are gay. Interim Election Commissioner Connie Schmidt apologized for what happened to the poll worker. “I think anybody that serves as a poll worker is my hero,” Schmidt told the Kansas City Star.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Although some polling sites saw a <a href="https://local12.com/news/local/steady-stream-of-voters-seen-at-northern-kentucky-polling-places">steady stream</a> of voters, there were not dramatic posts to social media as polls closed with people banging on polling place doors like zombies as we saw in the primary. Secretary of State Michael Adams is <a href="https://www.murrayledger.com/news/local/faulkner-responds-to-adams-proposals-for-future-voting-changes/article_aeab8014-22ed-11eb-bd6b-af196c0e51ba.html">proposing that some of the changes</a> implemented to make Election Day 2020 easier in light of the pandemic, should be put into place permanently.</p>

Louisiana will have several runoffs in December.</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>: While some in Maine had to <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/11/03/politics/mainers-brave-snow-and-wind-to-vote-in-election-with-likely-historic-turnout/">brave the weather</a> to get to the polls on Election Day, that didn’t seem to impact turnout, especially given the large absentee vote. Some voters that did show up on Nov. 3 to vote were faced with <a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/maine-election-results-updates-nov-4/34571436">long lines</a> but they were attributed to COVID protocols and not any technical issues. Irregularities and vote counting problems were <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2020/11/03/irregularities-vote-counting-problems-all-but-nonexistent-in-maine/">all but nonexistent</a> according to the Press Herald.

<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: Although Maryland did not mail every voter a ballot like they did in the primary, many voters chose to cast their ballots by mail for the general election. For those that did show up at the polls on Election Day, in many of the state’s counties and Baltimore City, there were <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2020/11/03/todays-been-an-astronomical-day-elections-chief-says-of-voters-still-lined-up-in-calvert-county/">few reports of problems</a>. There were some issues with <a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2020/11/data-transfer-error-in-maryland-causes-some-ballots-in-5-jurisdictions-to-remain-uncounted/">ballot counting</a> after the polls closed. The state saw a <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/elections/bs-md-pol-voter-registration-same-day-20201106-2r5xzbbvp5awrj5kfdcrlvgpt4-story.html">record-number of same day registrations</a> which did not seem to impact lines. And something we would like to see in more places, Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot <a href="https://patch.com/maryland/across-md/franchot-swallows-his-words-offers-beer-apology-elections-officials">apologized</a> to Election Administrator Linda Lamone for calling for her resignation before the election. &#8220;I promised the state Board of Elections, particularly Linda Lamone, whose resignation I mistakenly called for, I guess, a while ago, and deputy administrator Nikki Charlson,&#8221; he began, &#8220;that if they and the local boards could show us a diligent and dedicated [and] successful election, against my skepticism, which has obviously been demonstrated … I promised on Sept. 23 I would deliver — if I was wrong and everything went well — a few well-earned six-packs of Maryland craft beer, later this week, as a small token of my gratitude.&#8221; Cheers to Linda and Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts</strong>: Although Massachusetts voters mailed their ballots in record numbers, many still did show up on Election Day causing <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/03/metro/mass-voters-pack-lines-polls-election-day-2020/">lines in some locations</a>. The Commonwealth was one of the few places where voters wearing <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2020/11/election-2020-massachusetts-voter-who-wore-black-lives-matter-shirt-successfully-casts-ballot-after-initially-being-turned-away-from-polls.html">Black Lives Matter</a> gear reported initial problems with being able to cast a ballot at the polls. The voters were eventually able to vote. After the polls closed, <a href="https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/in-north-attleboro-a-frustrating-election-night-blamed-on-thumb-drive/article_eeb044ec-69a6-5d37-a28d-955c31c33b7a.html">North Attleboro</a> had a frustrating election night due to a thumb drive. <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/11/04/question-2-ranked-choice-voting-defeat">Ballot Question 2</a>, which would have moved the state to a ranked choice system failed.</p>

There were reports of <a href="https://nbc25news.com/news/local/long-lines-already-forming-in-flint">long lines</a> in Flint. Pontiac and Grand Rapids had to request <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/michigan-election-2020-live-updates-results-polls-vote/6060916002/">additional poll workers</a>.

Michigan also shattered a <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/michigan-nearing-19000-same-day-voter-registrations-shattering-record.html">same day voter registration</a> record with more than 19,000 people registering and voting for the first time.

Antrim’s problems arose from a software update issue and were corrected by ED +3.</p>

<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: As one of the few states not to offer early voting or make any major changes to accommodate voters due to the pandemic, Mississippi saw <a href="https://www.wapt.com/article/mississippi-general-election-results-november-2020/34416650">long lines</a> in some places line <a href="https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2020/11/03/large-turnout-in-adams-county-for-tuesdays-election-with-a-few-glitches/">Adams County</a>. <a href="https://www.oxfordeagle.com/2020/11/03/lafayette-county-sees-long-lines-record-turnout-for-election-day/">Lafayette County</a> also reported long lines.

Although there has been some talk to bringing early voting to the Magnolia State, the governor said he would veto any early voting bill that crosses his desk.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong>: Election day <a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/election-updates-mo-secretary-of-state-says-election-went-smoothly-in-missouri/article_5fdb18bc-1dea-11eb-9961-2756c7ca08ea.html">went smoothly</a> in the Show Me State although there were some interesting stories. A polling place at the WWI Museum in <a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/572ab1eb-05b5-47fb-a0fc-9ab4ecbde438">Kansas City</a> was vandalized overnight before Election Day. Workers found spray paint on stonework near the entrance that said, &#8220;don&#8217;t vote and fight for revolution.&#8221; More than a dozen voters in <a href="https://www.radio.com/wwl/news/st-louis-funeral-home-offering-free-rides-to-vote-in-limo">St. Louis County</a> took advantage of a funeral home’s offer of free rides to the polls.

The worker had been diagnosed on Oct. 30 but failed to divulge the information. Additionally, nearly half of the employees of the <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article247085747.html">Jackson County</a> election board are now out of the office because of COVID. In <a href="https://www.radio.com/news/missouri-voters-life-saved-who-collapsed-at-polling-place">Wentzville</a> a the principal at a local high school serving as a polling place saved a voter’s life when the voter collapsed and was unresponsive. While readers of electionline know full well, car crashes into polling places are a bit of a thing, what transpired in <a href="http://www.howellcountynews.com/local/two-crashes-polling-place-election-day">Howell County</a> may be a first. At the YMCA serving as a polling place while police were responding to the report of one crash in the parking lot—a driver fell out of her car and the car rolled into a parked car—another crash occurred when a bystander to the first crash went to move his car and his prosthetic leg got stuck and he crashed into another car which then crashed into the polling place. No one was hurt and voting was not affected. Incumbent Secretary of State <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article246818802.html">Jay Ashcroft</a> was re-elected to another term.</p>

<p><strong>Nevada</strong>: With many Nevadans choosing to vote by mail, there weren’t too many Election Day issues to report. A <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/judge-grants-order-keeping-some-clark-county-polls-open-until-8-p-m-2173327/">judge</a> did keep some <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/clark-co-registrar-of-voters-admits-polling-sites-experienced-technical-issues">Clark County</a> polling sites open until 8 p.m. Although the county had not anticipated keeping the polls open, the courts did.

Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the scene outside of ballot-counting sites after the polls closed. Like some other swing states, Nevada elections workers have tireless counted ballots since election night only to be <a href="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article246993492.html">threatened and harassed</a> by angry voters who don’t understand how long it takes to count mail ballots.</p>

Some voters did report feeling <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/some-nh-voters-felt-anxious-about-maga-hats-trump-truck-polling-site">intimidated</a> that other voters were allowed to wear MAGA hats into polling places.

<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: With all voters in New Jersey receiving a ballot in the mail, Election Day was <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2020/11/nj-election-2020-mail-in-in-person-voting-election-day-some-glitches-voter-confusion/">relatively quiet</a> and although ballot counting took longer than normal, there were no reports of problems with the <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/11/njs-first-primarily-vote-by-mail-general-election-went-off-without-a-hitch-as-counts-continue-elections-officials-say.html">new statewide vote by mail system</a>.

None of the poll workers exhibited any symptoms and since they would have to quarantine at home, they decided to continue counting ballots in the trailer. A Democrat, a Republican and a sheriff’s officer brings them ballots for counting and three representatives collect the ballots at the end of the day and return them to a secured room. We love their dedication!</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: There was record turnout in New Mexico, but there weren’t record problems, in fact there were <a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/elections/new-mexico-officials-report-voting-record-few-issues-at-polls/article_309d67d8-1d24-11eb-80cb-af66650d105b.html">very few issues reported</a> at the polls at all. Statewide, nearly 915,000 voters took part in the election, surpassing New Mexico’s record ballot count in 2008 by about 81,200 votes. The vast majority of voters in Tuesday’s election cast ballots in person during the early voting period that ended Saturday or by absentee ballot. “We didn’t have any incidents, anything real in terms of like voter intimidation or problems at the polls,” Alex Curtas, spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said. “There were some lines here and there, some technical little glitches we had to deal with throughout the day. But nothing systemic, nothing that I think impacted anybody’s ability to vote, so that’s really amazing.”</p>

That didn’t mean the day was without issue. In several areas including <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/some-voting-locations-having-technical-difficulties-as-polls-open/">Albany</a> and <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2020/11/03/voting-machine-mix-up-in-oswego-county">Oswego County</a> early voting technical problems with voting machines plagued the process. There was a report of at least one dispute that erupted outside of a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/dispute-brooklyn-polling-caught-camera-000030739.html">Brooklyn</a> polling place. Also in <a href="https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2020/11/04/an-accident-shuttered-this-brooklyn-polling-site-then-community-members-stepped-in/">Brooklyn</a>, a polling site didn’t open until 8a.m. because the site’s board of elections coordinators were in an accident on the way to the site. Eventually experienced poll workers arrived to help out. The biggest news out of New York seems to be happening this week because that’s when most of the mail ballots started to be tallied.

<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: While much of the focus has been on a handful of other states, North Carolina elections officials have spent the last nine days <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/politics/with-the-nations-focus-elsewhere-north-carolina-is-still-collecting-counting-and-too-close-to-call.html">processing and counting absentee ballots</a>. Due to the high mail ballot turnout, Election Day itself was relatively quiet with polls in some parts of the state reporting <a href="https://wcti12.com/news/local/most-enc-counties-report-slower-day-at-the-polls-after-early-voting-surge">slower than normal</a> turnout after the early morning rush. It wasn’t entirely without issues though. Incorrect ballots were delivered to some precincts in <a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/11/03/wrong-ballots-delivered-to-bladen-precinct-changes-in-polling-sites-across-the-cape-fear/">Bladen County</a>.

Bovett said the clerks are “very concerned” about the Oregon Centralized Voter Registration system.“It’s the primary weak point of our current election system, and is in desperate need of replacement,” Bovett wrote. In response, Fagan she will <a href="https://www.eastoregonian.com/news/state/new-secretary-of-state-to-examine-election-system-warnings/article_5275f574-2444-11eb-b435-ef50d1786741.html">examine the warnings</a> &#8220;Oregon&#8217;s former Elections Director, Steve Trout raised critical warnings that concern me as Oregon&#8217;s next Secretary of State,&#8221; Fagan tweeted late Tuesday, Nov. 10. &#8220;I spoke with Mr. Trout personally this week and we plan to speak later this week and go through his memo together, line by line.&#8221;</p>

Launched prior to the election to help voters navigate domestic and foreign misinformation, the website has now essentially morphed into a post-election fact-checking operation for the outgoing president and his supporters. Krebs is also using his personal Twitter account to combat the misinformation. “He volunteered to jump on a grenade that no one wanted to jump on,” said former Facebook chief information security officer Alex Stamos, referring to Krebs’ early commitment to making the fight against disinformation a key CISA mandate.</p>

Rick Scott (R-Florida) has introduced a bill that would change how the country conducts elections. The Verifiable, Orderly, &amp; Timely Election Results (VOTER) Act would create standards for various vote-by-mail systems that exist across the country and would require <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/video/869697">all eligible ballots to be counted and reported within 24 hours after polls close</a> on Election Day, according to a press release from Scott&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Georgia U.S. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are co-sponsoring a bill to ensure fair elections. Loeffler first introduced the <a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2020/11/11/loeffler-election-security-bill-gains-co-sponsors/">Securing Our Elections Act</a> in September. It would increase criminal penalties for interfering with the election system, including illegal voting, voter intimidation or ID theft. Under the measure, the current penalty of up to five years in prison would go up to 15 years and up to a $100,000 fine. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) also have joined as co-sponsors.</p>

John Rogers (D) has announced that he will be pre-filling legislation to allow for <a href="https://www.wbrc.com/2020/11/04/state-rep-john-rogers-says-hes-working-get-early-voting-alabama/">early voting</a>. “It’s a constitutional right to have the right to vote and we should make it easier. By early voting you make it easier for folks to get to the polls and vote,” Rogers said. His Republican colleague, Rep. Danny Garrett agrees. “I think you could have a process that works that allows people an opportunity to vote and we certainly want people to vote. We want them to exercise that right, and I think we should accommodate them just like we do accommodate people in other areas of life,” Garrett said.</p>

More than 68% of eligible Californians voted in the General Election, which was the highest turnout since at least 1960. Now that we know these changes were successful, I will introduce a bill in the new session to make permanent the key provisions of AB 860.”</p>

According to Hildebrand, at issue is what election officials refer to as DREs, or direct-recording electronic machines, which do not give individual paper record for each vote cast. He said despite national criticism and legal action, the machines are still being used in Kansas counties. He said his <a href="https://www.wibw.com/2020/11/10/kansas-senator-works-to-introduce-new-election-fraud-protection-bill/">bill would make the use of DREs illegal</a> in Kansas. “The fact that DRE’s are extremely vulnerable to fraud is not a question,” explains Hilderbrand, “Experts unilaterally agree they are bad practice, but Kansas is moving way too slowly in upgrading machines. Protecting our election process is understandably of the utmost importance to Kansas voters.”</p>

Robert Singer and Assemblymen Sean Kean, Edward Thomson have introduced legislation that they say is needed to prevent the confusion and election result delays caused by the governor’s executive order to conduct this year’s election primarily by mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus crisis. Unveiled on November 5, the identical bills (SCR136/ACR197) propose a constitutional amendment to provide registered voters with <a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/belmar-slash-lake-como/articles/local-lawmakers-introduce-measure-to-clean-up-vote-by-mail-mandate-mess">right to cast ballots in person</a> at polling places on Election Day and requires that mail-in ballots must be requested by voters before they receive them in the mail.</p>

The bill, set to be introduced later this week, would allow absentee ballots to be processed and counted as they arrived. “We have to address the fact that now with absentee voting being over 25% of the vote, we are in a new world and have to update how we count mail-in ballots,&#8221; said Carlucci. &#8220;The fact that we cannot call local races until weeks after Election Day is obscure and confusing to the public. Now we need a political interpreter to tell us who might have won and who has a chance.&#8221;</p>

Goodwin said voters who cast ballots in person and spoil their ballot are given an opportunity to fix it. “I think the same should be true for people doing absentee ballots,” Goodwin said. About 1% of mail-in ballots received were rejected, said Tulsa County Election Board Secretary Gwen Freeman. Tulsa County Election Board member Bruce Niemi supports a route for those who have defective mail-in ballots to correct the errors and have the ballot counted. “There are a lot of hoops to jump through in order to have a correct affidavit and identification or notarization before that ballot is counted,” he said. The state has the computer technology now to identify and notify voters who sent in defective mail-in ballots, he said.</p>

According the Texas Tribune, mail-in voting and voter registration emerged as two key focal points in bills filed by members of both parties. There was also legislation focused on countywide voting centers, voter identification, access for voters with disabilities, straight-ticket voting and designating any day an election is held statewide, including primaries, as a state holiday. One of those bills, House Bill 25, would prohibit elections officials from automatically sending mail ballot applications to voters.</p>

Mahoney dismissed a suggestion by a lawyer for the president’s re-election campaign to postpone legal arguments in the case for more than two weeks – a timeline that a lawyer for the Arizona Democratic Party argued could delay the final vote tally for Arizona. Thomas Liddy, a lawyer for Maricopa County, asked the judge to move swiftly to restore confidence in the system. “The voters have a right to know that the allegations flying around the internet about <a href="https://www.wifr.com/2020/11/06/judge-orders-trump-campaign-and-maricopa-officials-to-come-up-with-plan-in-sharpie-lawsuit/">Sharpies</a> being dropped from black helicopters to cheat people out of their votes is fake.

At issue, according to court documents obtained by the Herald Journal, is whether White County Clerk Laura Cosgray and the White County Elections Board had the authority to hire two outside law firms for services rendered during the June 5 primary election and whether the White County Commissioners should pay the bill for those services.</p>

Reached Monday afternoon, Winfrey said she is not doing any media interviews. The city of Detroit, Wayne County and the Michigan Democratic Party <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/republicans-in-voter-fraud-lawsuit-dont-understand-how-elections-function-city-of-detroit-says-in-response.html">responded to voter fraud allegations</a> on Wednesday, Nov. 11, submitting more than 230 pages to retort the claims made in Wayne County Circuit Court by Republican poll challengers.</p>

Some people say this obstruction made it difficult or impossible to observe the counting.</p>
<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals warned the president’s re-election campaign Monday that his <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/09/trump-campaign-appeal-stalls-michigan-court-demands-missing-documents/6223206002/">appeal seeking a stop</a> to the counting and certification of Michigan&#8217;s election results would be dismissed because of a failure to attach necessary filings. Lawyer Mark &#8220;Thor&#8221; Hearne told The Detroit News he plans to file the additional documents Monday afternoon. He had filed an appeal with the court on Friday after state <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/11/05/dnc-seeks-intervene-trump-campaign-michigan-lawsuit/6172148002/">Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens denied a preliminary injunction</a> seeking to stop the counting of ballots. But Hearne&#8217;s filing lacked copies of Stephens&#8217; order, the lower court docket or register of actions, a transcript of the lower court hearing and additional copies of a brief, according to a Monday letter from the appellate court.</p>

Allen v. Graham was filed by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Covington and Burling law firm representing Sylvester Allen Jr., Dejuana Bigelow, Tabatha Davis, and a group called Future Alamance. It is not focused on the organizer of the “I am Change” march Oct. 31, Drumwright, but on participants who in some cases missed their chance to register and vote on the last day of same-day registration. Other plaintiffs missed the a last chance at early voting but still had the opportunity to vote on Election Day and others just got pepper sprayed participating in a peaceful demonstration and march to the polls. The suit also names the county, city and 30 unidentified police officers and sheriff’s deputies as defendants as well as Cole and Johnson.</p>

County Commissioner Bob Harvie and County Solicitor Joseph Khan said that some observers took the information to try to alert the voters so they could then go to the polls to cast a provisional ballot. &#8220;We were successful. The case was thrown out and the county’s practices continued through the day,” County Solicitor Joseph Khan said Wednesday during the county commissioners meeting.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court directed Pennsylvania election offices to comply with a state ruling to <a href="https://www.wgal.com/article/us-supreme-court-agrees-with-pa-sec-boockvar-on-mail-in-ballot-counting-process/34605159">segregate mail-in ballots</a> received after 8 p.m. on Election Day because of pending legal challenges from Republicans. The ruling was moot however PA Sec. of State Kathy Boockvar issued the same over one month prior to Election Day and there are no counties that are not complying.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Court Judge P. Kevin Brobson rejected an eleventh-hour request by Republicans to block counties from <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/spl/pennsylvania-election-2020-provisional-cured-ballots-court-ruling-20201106.html">counting provisional ballots</a> cast by voters whose mail ballots contained mistakes and were going to be disqualified. Brobson ordered those ballots be separated, but said they could be counted if they are found to be eligible through the normal process counties use to verify provisional ballots.</p>
<p>The president’s re-election campaign filed in the United States District Court against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and several county elections boards including Allegheny, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia seeking to stop the Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/pennsylvania/trump-legal-team-files-lawsuit-to-stop-certification-of-election-results-in-pa/article_c7789dc4-22f8-11eb-8e0b-23f5aaae07ff.html">results from being certified</a>. The lawsuit claims, &#8220;defendants, the very officials charged with ensuring the integrity of the election in Pennsylvania, have so mismanaged the election process that no one, not the voters and not President Trump&#8217;s campaign, can have any faith that their most sacred and basic rights under the United States Constitution are being protected.&#8221; The suit goes on to say the election was &#8220;shrouded in secrecy&#8221; and also charges that &#8220;Democratic-heavy counties violated the law by identifying mail-in ballots before Election Day that had defects and allowed the voter to fix it to ensure their vote counted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claiming they have verified evidence of illegalities, three Centre County residents and one Montour County resident want a federal judge to <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/elections/2020/11/3-pa-residents-sue-gov-wolf-election-official-over-alleged-voting-irregularities.html">invalidate the results</a> of the presidential election in certain Pennsylvania counties. On Wednesday, they asked Judge Matthew W. Brann to consolidate their complaint with that of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and two individuals that raises similar issues. The new complaint contends there is evidence illegal ballots were included in the vote totals to change or place in doubt the result of the presidential election in Pa. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election by most major media outlets on Nov. 14. Pirkle, Dannerth, Danks and Flynn do not allege any voter fraud in their counties but cite unsubstantiated allegations in Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware and Allegheny counties.</p>

<p>The Texas Supreme Court declined a request from the Travis County Republican Party to intervene in a case that alleges the county’s central counting station is violating state law by forcing <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/tx-attorney-general-travis-county-clerks-office-poll-watcher-sequestration-a-criminal-act/">poll watchers</a> to observe ballot counting from a “media room.” The court denied the party’s petition for a writ of mandamus five to four late Sunday. In a Nov. 8 filing, Attorney General Ken Paxton had argued that poll watchers must be permitted to observe ballot counting by election officials, under the Texas Election Code. Holding watchers in a separate room “violates the Election Code,” the AG’s office wrote in the filing.</p>
