														<p><strong>How COVID-19 is influencing voters’ views of election administration, reforms </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Tom Bonier, TargetSmart CEO &amp;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Lazarus, TargetSmart Director of Research Solutions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most American voters are concerned that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak will prevent U.S. citizens from participating in the 2020 elections. As a result, huge majorities are supportive of a broad array of reforms to ensure it is safe to vote come November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings are drawn from a nationwide study of registered voters in the United States to see how the American public is thinking about this year’s elections in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. This mixed-mode, phone/web survey was administered from April 8-11, 2020 by the data collection specialists at </span><a href="https://www.dynata.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and reached 1,200 registered voters matched to the TargetSmart voter file. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope this poll will be a resource to election administrators, academics and elected officials across the country. That’s why we’ve released the</span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/Analysis/covid_national_survey_april_2020/covid_toplines.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toplines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/Analysis/covid_national_survey_april_2020/covid_crosstabs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crosstabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/Analysis/covid_national_survey_april_2020/covid_slides.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis slides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a full statement on the poll’s </span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/Analysis/covid_national_survey_april_2020/covid_methodology.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">methodology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the key takeaways:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study reveals that voters express profound concerns about the impact COVID-19 will have on our elections. Overall, about as many American voters are concerned that the coronavirus outbreak will prevent citizens from voting in this year’s elections (63% very or somewhat concerned) as express concerns about losing income due to the pandemic (61% very or somewhat concerned). See Figure 1 below.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5405" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.35.02-PM.png" alt="" width="896" height="496" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.35.02-PM.png 896w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.35.02-PM-300x166.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.35.02-PM-768x425.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a substantial proportion of American voters (46%) are at least somewhat worried that they, or someone in their immediate family, might catch the coronavirus while voting at the place where they usually cast their ballot while just 1-in-4 American voters (25%) are not worried at all about these dangers.</span></p>
<p><strong>As a result, this poll strongly suggests that American voters want policy makers and elections administrators to act to ensure that all citizens can vote safely in the 2020 elections.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwhelming majorities believe it is important for state and local government to provide alternatives to in-person voting (46% very important, 32% somewhat important, 18% not important) and for the federal government to provide additional funding to states and counties to cover the increased costs of conducting elections due to the coronavirus outbreak (45% very important, 32% somewhat important, 18% not important). See Figures 2 &amp; 3 below.</span></p>

<p><strong>What’s more, as shown in Figure 4, a wide range of specific reforms currently under consideration are broadly-to-almost ubiquitously popular with American voters across the political spectrum.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include expanded access to early voting and vote-by-mail (as well as pre-paid postage), increasing the number of in-person polling places to minimize lines, allowing voters to cast a ballot at any voting precinct in their county, extending voter registration deadlines and allowing same-day registration, and ensuring all working citizens get paid time off for voting. The only reforms we tested that are met with significant skepticism are online voting and delaying the November election.</span></p>

The governor said he&#8217;ll work with local governments that want to move elections. &#8220;Certainly, anyone that requests to me pushing off to August, I don&#8217;t think there is any election that couldn&#8217;t be done in August,&#8221; said DeSantis. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d lose much. So, I am happy to work with them on that.&#8221;</span></p>

The Party also asked that officials stop rejecting ballots with mismatched signatures and suspend prosecution of those accused of “ballot harvesting” — or illegally handing in a ballot on someone else’s behalf. According to the <em>Reno Gazette Journal</em>, Deputy Secretary of State Wayne Thorley on Tuesday issued a point-by-point response to those requests. “The Nevada State Democratic Party asks me to ignore laws that were enacted by the Nevada Legislature,” Thorley wrote. “I am asked to disregard long-standing voter integrity provisions found in NRS 293.325 and 293.330, including the restriction on ballot harvesting.  I am also asked to extend the signature cure deadline despite the hard deadline that exists in NRS 293.333.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utah:</strong> According to Utah Public Radio, the Legislature will call itself into special session later this week to consider a number of items including</span><a href="https://www.kuer.org/post/utah-legislators-plan-special-session-consider-modifying-local-health-orders-and-person-voting#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding vote by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lawmakers are looking at removing the requirement to hold in-person elections, and instead allow counties to decide whether to open polling places or only utilize vote by mail. “If they don&#8217;t want to, if they don&#8217;t feel like they can do it safely, they don&#8217;t have to,” House Speaker Brad Wilson said. “We&#8217;re going to give them more time to have people mail their ballots in.” More than 90% of voters already vote by mail, according to Utah’s Director of Elections Justin Lee. </span></p>

Secretary of State Laurel Lee issued a new directive to supervisors of elections this month that led to the lawsuit’s dismissal. In the April 2 directive, Lee wrote that the law “should be understood to require that the early voting sites collectively within a county provide sufficient nonpermitted parking to accommodate the anticipated amount of voters who require parking in order to access those sites.” Lee added, “This does not mean that every early voting site must have a certain number of nonpermitted parking sites available.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> On behalf of five Gwinnett County organizations, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law has filed suit demanding that</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/lawsuit-demands-spanish-absentee-ballot-applications-gwinnett/3Earr6IjzbeJ5NWGReJ6AJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballot materials be provided in Spanish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The suit claims that the decision not to send absentee ballot applications in Spanish requires them to divert time and resources that would go to other priorities to educating Spanish-speaking voters about how to complete applications and how to navigate voting by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Hillsborough Superior Court Judge David Anderson has</span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/controversial-new-hampshire-voting-law-struck-down-superior-court#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struck down SB3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saying that it’s unconstitutional and unreasonably burdens the right to vote. In a ruling issued this week following a lengthy hearing process in</span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/hearing-controversial-nh-voting-law-sb3-wraps"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/what-nh-voters-need-know-following-trial-over-sb3-voting-law#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Anderson said the state failed to prove that the law was necessary to protect the integrity of New Hampshire’s elections or prevent voter fraud. The judge said, there is no proof such fraud is a serious problem in New Hampshire — and instead, the law added complexity and confusion that could dissuade people from voting.</span></p>

In the petition, 27 of the state’s 33 county clerks requested permission to close polling places and conduct the election by mail. The New Mexico Constitution places the time, place, and manner of voting in the hands of the state legislature which cannot meet due to the pandemic. Chief Justice Judith K. Nakamura made clear that the court had come to a unanimous decision on the matter, and pointed out that, “obviously this is a very difficult case, which is evidenced by the fact that the other branches of government have chosen not to act, and have come to the court for relief.”  “The relief that is requested is specifically prohibited by New Mexico Statute Section 1-6-5F, which says that a mailed ballot shall not be delivered by the county clerk to any person other than the applicant for the ballot,” Nakamura said. Instead, the court directed the county clerks to mail absentee ballot applications to voters to encourage people to vote that way, rather than in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Judicial Watch has filed suit in federal court in Charlotte against the boards of elections in</span><a href="https://www.rhinotimes.com/news/guilford-county-sued-for-having-more-voters-than-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Guilford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article241895126.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mecklenburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counties arguing that county officials aren’t complying with laws demanding they carry out a program that reasonably attempts to</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-carolina/articles/2020-04-09/group-sues-for-more-robust-n-carolina-voter-roll-cleanup"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cancel registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of people deemed ineligible to vote. The suit also argues the defendants also have failed to hand over records showing how the program is being implemented.</span></p>

In a written opinion, justices said the campaign behind the measure, Ohioans for Secure and Fair Elections, “has a clear legal right to certification of the proposed amendment&#8221; as a single issue, and that the Ohio Ballot Board “has a clear legal duty to make that certification.&#8221; They ordered the ballot board to meet within seven days to do so.</span></p>

His ruling could greatly expand the number of voters casting ballots by mail in the upcoming July primary runoff elections. An appeal is expected.</span></p>

According to ADOT, &#8220;the introduction of this state-of-the-art computer system has been planned for nearly five years and is required because the current platform used by MVD has elements that are more than 35 years old and are no longer sustainable.&#8221;</span></p>

Gary Herbert and Elections Director Justin Lee a letter saying that “all internet voting systems and technologies are currently inherently insecure” and that “no mobile voting app is sufficiently secure to permit its use.” “Internet voting is not a secure solution for voting in the United States, nor will it be in the foreseeable future,” the letter reads. “We urge you to refrain from allowing the use of any internet or voting app system and consider expanding access to voting by mail and early voting to maintain the security, accuracy, and voter protection essential for American elections in the face of this public health crisis.” According to Lee, the state is not considering implementing online voting during the pandemic. “It’s not really anything that we have specifically looked at,” the state elections director said, “particularly because we’re already a vote by mail state. And in the recent elections, over 90% of voters are voting by mail. So we seem to be covering most voters through the mail.”</span></p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0 Public Comment Period</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</span></p>
