														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Gail Pellerin</strong><br />
<em>After 27 years on the job, Pellerin leaves on a high note</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />

<div id="attachment_6354" style="width: 449px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6354" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6354" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP1-300x213.jpg" alt="" width="439" height="311" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP1-300x213.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP1-768x544.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6354" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Shmuel Thaler</p></div>
<p>After 27 years in the elections world,<a href="https://www.votescount.us/"> Santa Cruz County, California</a>’s Gail Pellerin is stepping down effective December 30 at the end of what she called “an extraordinary year” and certainly at the end of an extraordinary career.</p>
<p>“November 3, 2020 was my dream election! Turnout was at an all-time high, everyone was talking about voting, enthusiasm was off the charts, and voting was cool!!” Pellerin said. “I think I would be disappointed to conduct another election that did not equal that same level of voter interest in engagement.”</p>
<p>Pellerin began her career as a journalist. She went on to be a legislative staffer for the California General Assembly before she became Santa Cruz County’s election manager from 1993 to 2004. In 2004 she was appointed clerk/registrar of voters was elected to her fourth term in 2018.</p>
<p>“For years Gail has been something like a den mother to California’s elections community. She is admired and valued by election officials and voter advocates alike for her leadership, enthusiasm and commitment to voters,” said Kim Alexander, president and founder of the<a href="https://www.calvoter.org/"> California Voter Foundation</a>.  &#8220;She brings joy and smiles wherever she goes and reminds us that voting is a sacred and special act, and something to be treasured and protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pellerin served as president of the<a href="https://www.caceo58.org/"> California Association of Clerks and Election Officials</a> from 2010 to 2012, has served on the secretary of state’s Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee since 2006, and has been a member of the<a href="https://futureofcaelections.org/"> Future of California Elections</a> since 2011.</p>
<p>“Gail has always fought to put voters first. In her years of service in Santa Cruz County, she has integrated voting into the community, creating inclusive opportunities for citizens to participate in our democracy,” said California<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/"> Secretary of State</a> Alex Padilla. “Santa Cruz County has been lucky to have such a staunch advocate for voting rights helming their elections for years. I have been lucky to partner with Gail as Secretary of State and wish her best in her retirement.”</p>
<p><strong>Why have you decided to step away at this time, and hindsight being 20/20 (ha, no pun intended) do you wish you had done this before 2020?!</strong><br />
I would not have wanted to miss the 2020 general election! It was an extraordinary year, and it was amazing to see so many people come together to make the election a great success.</p>
<p>I had been thinking for about a year that November 3, 2020 would be my last election. I have had the incredible opportunity to work with many creative and talented people to implement great programs like candidate information nights, expanded early voting, Voting Matters Zoom events, our latest hit the VoteMobile, passport Saturdays, clerk services in Watsonville, and weddings in the park. I have worked in some capacity for 45 years, and I am ready to take a break and serve in what I believe is the most important role – a vocal and active citizen.</p>
<p><strong>What do you see as the core competencies of a U.S. election official in 2020, and what has been really helpful for your professional development since you started in election administration 27 years ago?<br />
</strong>You have got to be a good listener. It is also important to be trustworthy, accessible, a good communicator, a team leader, a clear decision maker, ethical, fair, and honest. My job is to represent all the voters of my county, not just the ones who think like I do. It is essential for an elections official to be nonpartisan and ensure that all voters regardless of language, ability, or political party affiliation have barrier-free access to voting.</p>
<p>I got my start in elections working as the Elections Manager for my predecessor Richard Bedal. He instilled the main values I continue to hold to this day: listen to others and respect their opinions, never ask someone to do a job you are not willing to do yourself, be honest and transparent in everything you do, and you can always close the door to your office and take a nap.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of our California Association of Clerks and Elections Officials (CACEO). I remember one of my first meetings and a long-time elections official asked me “What do you know about elections?” I answered her, “Not as much as you. I hope to learn whatever I can from you and the other experts in the room.” And, that’s exactly what CACEO does. We have trainings, workshops, collaborations, committees, conferences, a dynamic website and an email distribution list where we can learn from each other, share successful projects, and ask questions. None of us can do this job alone, we need to rely on each other for feedback and guidance.</p>

<p>Another amazing organization is the Future of California Elections (FOCE). I was fortunate to be a part of this unique collaboration when it was first created in 2011. Imagine a group of elections officials, civil rights organizations, and election reform advocates in a room working on policy together and finding common ground on ways to improve California’s election system. There were some doubts in the beginning, but FOCE proved to be an extraordinary group that impacted California election policy, improved voter education, assisted elections officials in implementing new voter programs like same day registration, online voter registration and vote center election models, and identified ways to improve language and disability access for voters. Thanks to FOCE, I have developed lifelong friendships and together we accomplished great improvements for the voters of California.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to those who believed in me and supported me over the years. I have learned so much from them. For the others, I am grateful to them for challenging me to think of things in different ways and to be a more open-minded person.</p>
<p><strong>How has the role of technology changed over the course of your career, and how do you imagine it will change 30 years into the future?  </strong><br />
Huge! I remember when we used to have a Data General machine, and we had to load tapes every night and run a back up of our system.</p>
<p>Technology has made it possible to conduct safer, more accurate and more accessible elections. It has also made our jobs more complex and has made good, clear written instructions in plain language and extensive training essential.</p>
<p>I suspect in the next 30 years we will see more tech tools to make all aspects of the voting experience more efficient and easier. As more people vote using a mailed ballot, I suspect we may find something better than signature comparing in order to qualify a ballot for counting.</p>
<p>I would also like to see more states, including California, join ERIC, the Election Registration Information Center, to allow us to compare voter registration data between states. I think it is imperative that we have a system to track voters who might be registered in multiple states.</p>
<p>It’s clear that you enjoy all aspects of your county clerk role … what have elections taught you about how to manage those other responsibilities &#8211; and vice versa?</p>
<p>Conducting elections is certainly the more stressful part of my job. One valuable lesson I have learned over the years, is everyone has a story. It’s unfair to judge someone based on one encounter. The other day we had a disgruntled observer in our office who caused a lot of commotion. I was able to calm him down and we walked out together. I asked about his health and his family, and it turns out his son is very ill. We are all human. We all lose our temper. Sometimes we all need someone to go the extra mile and help us out. If I can help you, or reduce your burden, I will do it if I can. I have gone to people’s homes or hospitals to conduct marriage ceremonies for a partner who is dying. I have gone to a family’s home to help them file paperwork because they were overwhelmed with caring for a disabled child. It’s important to meet people where they are, understand how you can help them, and help if you can. I have never lost sight of who pays my salary – the taxpayers. And, when I do upset someone and they ask to speak to my boss, I tell them to speak to themselves, because the voters are my boss.</p>
<p><strong>What’s one thing that you wish policymakers in California and Washington, DC knew about the election process? </strong><br />
Maybe they know this after this last election, but I hope that our policymakers trust elections officials and believe we do everything in our power to conduct fair and accurate elections. Clerical mistakes are not fraud. Just because you lose your election, it does not mean the vote is not accurate. When making decisions that impact election laws, talk to the people who must implement your ideas and listen to their feedback. It is important to give us the necessary tools, so we can deliver democracy to our voters.</p>
<p>For democracy to prevail, we must remove barriers to voting and support the right of all citizens to make their voices heard. I am opposed to policies that are designed to restrict access or make it easier for one group of voters to vote over another group.</p>
<div id="attachment_6356" style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6356" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6356" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="284" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GP3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6356" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit: Gail Pellerin</em></p></div>
<p>I would also like to see some uniformity, if possible, among all the states. I think there can be some agreement on some issues pertaining to mailed ballots: last day to request a ballot be mailed to a voter, requirements for qualifying a ballot in the mail, ability for elections officials to process mailed ballots before Election Day, and the deadline for when ballots postmarked on or before Election Day can be received by the elections official and counted.</p>
<p><strong>How did your experience observing elections in other countries help you do your job better in Santa Cruz? </strong><br />
I was honored to have been invited to Artsakh twice to observe their elections. It breaks my heart what that country has endured this year with the resurgence of the war with Azerbaijan. The people of Artsakh are the warmest, kindest, most charitable people I have ever met. If they invite you over for dinner, beware that they will not let you have an empty plate of food or an empty glass. When you are done, you must leave a full plate or a full glass.</p>
<p>One thing I observed in Artsakh is their respect for those representing another political party or viewpoint. As a young country trying to obtain recognition as an independent nation, they conducted their elections in a manner that ensured all voices from all parties were heard.</p>
<p>I think that is a valuable lesson. Every person has a right to be heard. As County Clerk, I think it is very important to listen to those who do not think you are doing a good job, or do not like the way something is being done. You do not always learn by surrounding yourself with people who agree with you. You learn and grow the most from those who do not agree with you.</p>
<p>My experience in Artsakh also taught me resilience and determination. From the old woman in the babushka who pulled herself and her cane up a flight of stairs to vote to the voting location that still stood among a pile of war-torn buildings &#8211; voting is essential. It is the foundation of democracies throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to women entering the elections world to help ensure they are treated equally in the workplace and receive equal pay for their job performance compared to men in similar governmental roles? </strong><br />
Speak up, speak clearly, and maintain eye contact. Your voice matters. Do not second guess your contribution to the conversation.</p>
<p>I have used a few key phrases in my career that have helped me:</p>
<p>“Let me speak.”<br />
“I just said that.”<br />
“No explanation needed.”</p>
<p>I find it frustrating that as women, we are often our worst critics. Women who are considering running for office, will look at and evaluate all the qualifications. If they do not feel they hit the mark on all of them, they take a pass. I do not think men, in general, do the same thing. There are those who will run for office even if they do not have any experience or qualifications.</p>
<p>The gender wage gap still exists and is most severe for women of color. It’s a travesty that women continue to be paid less than their male counterparts. When I became County Clerk, they reconfigured the office of County Clerk-Recorder-Treasurer-Tax Collector. They made County Clerk-Registrar of Voters one position, merged Recorder with the Assessor and created a separate office of Treasurer-Tax Collector. At that time, the two males in the two offices were paid tens of thousands more than me. It took me years to advocate for a wage increase to be paid closer to what the other elected officials were paid. The sad news is, they also advocated for wage increases, and as of today I am still paid tens of thousands less than the Assessor-Recorder who is male. The good news is, the Auditor-Controller-Treasurer-Tax Collector is now one office and is led by a woman, and she gets paid more than the Assessor-Recorder!</p>
<p>My advice on achieving pay equity is to continue to advocate and make a case for equal pay. Be persistent. In hindsight, I should have gone back and asked for more compared to what my colleagues get paid. However, I honestly believe the taxpayers are paying me a very good wage for my work, and I would rather advocate for those on my staff to get higher wages.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’re an avid photographer – what, to you, are the most photogenic parts of the election process?</strong></em><br />
Without a doubt, the people! My elections team doing the many tasks they do to pull off an election. The poll workers doing the many tasks they do to make sure people have access to voting. The poll worker assisting a voter. The 18-year-old voter. The first-time voter. The new citizen voter. The convalescent voter. The visually impaired voter. The voter using a ballot in another language. The voter dressed in full patriotic regalia. The voter on a bike dropping off their ballot. The voter using a wheelchair. The voter in drag. The military voter. The family voting together. The voter in the hospital. The wonderful ways a voter displays their “I voted” sticker. And, if I can figure out a way to include my dog, Darwin, in a photo, I will!</p>
<p><em><strong>What final words of wisdom do you have for your elections/clerk colleagues and peers? </strong></em><br />
No election is perfect. Your most important job is to count votes accurately and conduct fair, accurate, transparent, secure and accessible elections. When it gets tough, it’s important to have a really good sense of humor and a big stash of chocolate.</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s next for you? Besides of course, sleeping in on all Election Days?<br />
</strong></em>I am going to enjoy every day being Saturday for a while! I am lucky to live in a beautiful area where there are so many places where I can hike, ride a bike, or play with my dog. I definitely want to focus on my health and nutrition – I’ve got that COVID 15 to work off! I would love to travel when it’s safe, catch up with my book club, and I’m looking forward to spending some quality time with family and friends.</p>
<p>Rest assured, I will be an active and vocal citizen. There has never been a woman from Santa Cruz County elected to an office higher than countywide. I hope to be instrumental in changing that in the future.</p>

The Clearinghouse Awards, also referred to as the “Clearies,” honor the enterprising spirit and hard work of election officials across the country. In the challenging circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis, the Clearies offer the opportunity to recognize the resourcefulness of officials who adjusted their efforts to account for the ever-evolving pandemic. This year, the EAC is also pleased to offer a new category distinguishing cybersecurity and technology initiatives that improve election security of voting systems and strengthen U.S. elections.</p>
<p>The EAC will present awards in the categories of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities,</li>
<li>Outstanding Innovations in Elections,</li>
<li>Best Practices in Recruiting, Retaining, and Training Poll Workers,</li>
<li>Creative and Original “I Voted” Stickers, and</li>
<li>Outstanding Innovation in Election Cybersecurity and Technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jurisdictions of all sizes are encouraged to submit their work. Entries must be received by Friday, January 8, 2021. Submissions will be judged on innovation, sustainability, outreach, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and the generation of positive results.</p>
<p>“The 2020 Clearie Awards will help recognize the innovation and hard work of election officials across the nation during an extremely well-run general election with record turnout,” said EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. “Election officials did an amazing job this fall as they navigated unprecedented health concerns due to COVID-19, a substantial increase in early and mail or absentee voting, and poll worker shortages. The best practices developed from 2020 will be highly valuable for future elections. The EAC Commissioners look forward to honoring these hard-working public servants who do so much to serve voters and further our democracy.”</p>
<p>The 2020 Clearies will build on the successes of past years, encouraging innovations in election administration and publicizing achievements across the elections community. Under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the EAC is charged with serving as a clearinghouse for election administration information. The Clearies and the efforts they celebrate play an important role in helping the EAC fulfill this mission.</p>

In Michigan, armed protestors gathered outside of<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/07/943968694/michigan-secretary-of-state-on-how-an-armed-group-protested-in-front-of-her-hous"> Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson</a>’s home on Sunday evening. “You know, while you&#8217;re in this great uncertainty where &#8211; and focused on protecting your family, I realize that the threats really weren&#8217;t aimed at me. They were aimed at our voters. And then the requests were to overturn an election, where the voters clearly spoke. And my job as the state&#8217;s chief election officer is to protect and defend our voters, every single one of them, regardless of how they vote. And so my mind focused on that, and then my heart focused on my kid,” Benson told NPR. The<a href="https://wkow.com/2020/12/09/wisconsin-elections-commission-chair-says-shes-been-threatened/"> chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Ann Jacobs</a>, says she&#8217;s been the target of threats. Jacobs told The New York Times, &#8220;People on Twitter have posted photography of my house.&#8221; She said another message mentioned her children and suggested crowds would show up at her door. On Monday, the Arizona GOP promoted the idea of dying for the “Stop the Steal” movement to which<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republican-party-twitter-election-results-death-overturn/"> Secretary of State Katie Hobbs</a>, who herself has been threatened, responded via Tweet with, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been saying since 11/4 that these unfounded detached from reality conspiracy theories and those fueling them are dangerous and here we are,&#8221; Arizona&#8217;s Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted Tuesday in response. In an<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-danger-is-growing-that-trumps-lies-about-the-election-will-lead-to-violence/2020/12/09/cf71d6f0-3a61-11eb-9276-ae0ca72729be_story.html"> op-ed</a>, The Washington Post wrote: “…[the president] is creating a new playbook for failed candidates: Rile the base; delegitimize your opponent’s victory; pressure state officials to flip the results. This strategy could be far more potent in a closer election. It threatens the foundations of U.S. democracy.”</p>

Bill Turner told NPR. &#8220;This grant really was a lifesaver in allowing us to do more, efficiently and expeditiously,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It probably would have taken a very long time if we didn&#8217;t have the resources to do this.&#8221; NPR spoke to two scholars with differing opinions on the future of funding. Rachael Cobb, associate professor of political science and legal studies at Suffolk University in Boston though the grants were great as a onetime thing, but cautioned that continuing to use private money for such purposes &#8220;sullies [the election] in a way that we don&#8217;t need it to be sullied at all.&#8221; David Kimball, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said that without the grants, &#8220;it certainly would have taken them a lot longer to process and count those absentee ballots, which would have only made this post-election period more unbearable.&#8221;</p>

Students will analyze how laws governing the administration of United States elections guided thinking about changes to election administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will cover topics including voting rights, mail-in ballots, voter registration, felon disenfranchisement, and redistricting.  Students will begin by studying the Constitution, voting laws, and court cases to build a foundation in election administration. They will then examine how these laws guided election administrators and courts in the 2020 primaries and presidential election when the country saw an unprecedented increase in mail-in voting.</p>

He was 79. Horton served on the Englewood Water District board, was on the Charlotte County School Board for 12 years, a county commissioner for eight years and ended his career in 2008 as Charlotte&#8217;s supervisor of elections. “He will be remembered as a nice person and a decent human being,” Sarasota County Commissioner Shannon Staub told the Herald-Tribune. “I can tell you that although he spent a lot of years in the field of politics, it was never about politics for him. It was about getting a job done right. He was there to serve and he was serious about serving and he tried to do what he felt was the best thing for the county and the citizens. He made himself available anytime. He always did it with a smile on his face.” When he was the county’s supervisor of elections, he led an effort to save the historic Charlotte courthouse, which was built in 1928 in Punta Gorda. At the time, it was an unpopular cause but Horton’s respect for history spurred him to lead efforts to save the yellow-brick building that had fallen into disrepair.</p>

The historic turnout for the 2020 election was 80.7% (as of early December) despite the pandemic. SB 423 and this year’s successor, SB 29, set statewide minimum standards for counties to conduct safe and accessible in-person voting procedures in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both voters and election workers need to be guaranteed a safe environment in order to conduct elections. This bill will guarantee that all eligible voters living in jurisdictions conducting elections in 2021 will be mailed a vote-by-mail ballot in order to give the option for individuals to vote at home if they wish. SB 34 – Increased Penalties for Unofficial or Fraudulent Vote Centers, in light of reports from the fall of unofficial ballot boxes and unofficial vote centers operating illegally, Senator Umberg introduced SB 34 to clarify the basic guidelines for the operation of ballot drop boxes and vote centers. SB 35 – Extension of the Polling Place Buffer Outside of Polling Places, with the need for social distancing, some areas of California this November saw lines that extended beyond the front door of polling places. Current law prohibits electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place, but reexamination of that distance is necessary after some allegations were made about campaigning and intimidation as voters waited in line outside to vote.</p>

House Bill 15 would eliminate the state’s restrictions on absentee voting, striking the specific list of reasons allowing an individual to vote remotely. The second leg of a constitutional amendment, it would add to the constitution a line stating, “The General Assembly shall enact general laws providing the circumstances, rules, and procedures by which registered voters may vote by absentee ballot.” House Bill 25 would authorize same-day voter registration, letting a Delawarean register and cast his or her ballot on Election Day. Current law sets the last day to register before an election as the “fourth Saturday prior to the date of the election.” House Bill 30 is the latest effort to shift the date of Delaware’s primary election, currently the second Tuesday after the first Monday in September, to coincide with the April presidential primary, even in off years. Delaware holds its presidential primary on the fourth Tuesday in April.</p>

State Senator Bob Onder wants to put an end to a provision in state law allowing voters without certain identification to still vote by signing a statement saying they are who they say they are. Onder, a Republican from Lake St. Louis, is also proposing to create new provisions about the use of provisional ballots when voters do not have proper identification to vote.</p>
<p>State Senate Bill 17 would allow voters to<a href="https://www.ky3.com/2020/12/09/proposed-state-senate-bill-could-allow-missourians-to-vote-absentee-without-needing-a-reason/"> cast an absentee ballot without an excuse</a>. St. Louis state senator Jill Schupp proposed the bill in order to provide that same flexibility every election. ”Clearly it will provide additional flexibility because currently you have to have a reason,” Schoeller said. “Of course after the end of this year the seventh reason, the COVID-19 reason would go away.” Though Schoeller said he and many other voters likely prefer to vote in person so they can see their ballots go into the machine, he said absentee voting could become especially helpful for people who may not qualify for reasons currently listed on a ballot.</p>

Jeff Wheeland (R-Lycoming) has reintroduced House Bill 1579, legislation to apply<a href="https://gantdaily.com/2020/12/05/wheeland-reintroduces-bill-to-strengthen-voter-id-law/"> voter ID</a> requirements to each and every election, including photo and non-photo options as acceptable forms of ID. Under the bill, the forms of ID that would be acceptable are the same as the options that are currently available to first-time voters in Pennsylvania. They include the following forms of photo and non-photo ID: Driver’s license or PennDOT non-driver ID card; Photo or non-photo ID card issued by other state agency; Photo or non-photo ID card issued by the U.S. government; Student ID with photo; Employee ID with photo; Armed Forces of the U.S. ID card; Firearm permit; Current utility bill; Current bank statement; or Government check. If a voter is unable to present a valid photo ID, he or she would be required to present two forms of non-photo ID from among those listed above.</p>

The proposal, which lawmakers are poised to send to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk within the first two weeks of the legislative session, would also give school officials the same flexibility for budget votes, which also typically happen in person. Town Meeting Day is March 2, and Sen. Jeanette White, D-Windham, told a joint meeting of the House and Senate Government Operations Committees on Friday that she hoped the legislation could reach the governor’s desk by Jan. 19 — two weeks after the legislative session begins.</p>

Krebs charges he was<a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/12/08/former-cybersecurity-chief-sues-trump-campaign-and-others-charging-defamation/"> defamed</a> by diGenova, who said on Newsmax that Krebs “should be drawn and quartered” or “shot at dawn” following Krebs’ statement. Krebs says such punishments are the “fate of a convicted traitor” and are the basis for his defamation accusation. The lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County, Md., circuit court, seeks an injunction ordering Newsmax to remove the diGenova interview from its website, as well as monetary damages. Krebs charges he has been the victim of death threats following DiGenova’s remarks, which diGenova has said were “hyperbole.”</p>

Marks of the Middle District of Alabama has ruled in favor of Secretary of State John Merrill and other officials in a lawsuit challenging the Alabama law that<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/12/federal-judge-upholds-alabama-law-on-felon-voting-disenfranchisement.html"> disqualifies felons from voting</a>. Greater Birmingham Ministries joined with individuals who had been convicted of felonies in challenging the law as unconstitutional, claiming that it was racially discriminatory, discriminated on the basis of wealth, and violated due process because it was applied retroactively. They were represented by the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, D.C., and other attorneys. The plaintiffs updated their claims in 2017 after the Legislature changed the law. Marks granted the state’s motions for summary judgement. “In 2017, our office worked with the Alabama Legislature to clearly define the crimes of moral turpitude, which, upon conviction, prohibit an individual from being eligible to vote,” Merrill said in his statement on Marks’ ruling. “In defining the 60 crimes of moral turpitude, we created a consistent standard among all 67 counties, as opposed to leaving the interpretation up to each county’s Board of Registrars. After an individual completes his or her sentence and pays all fees and fines associated with the original sentence, he may apply to have his voting rights restored.”</p>

In a<a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20422031-pruitt-v-meyer-complaint"> complaint</a> filed Wednesday, attorney Stacey Stone claims the state failed to properly provide notice when the Alaska Division of Elections moved a polling location from Muldoon Town Center to Begich Middle School. The suit also claims the Division of Elections failed to provide adequate election security after the Alaska Supreme Court temporarily invalidated the state law requiring absentee ballots to be co-signed by a witness. The lawsuit asks that the results be recounted after particular ballots are thrown out. If the court isn’t willing to do that, the suit asks for a new election. State law allows the case to be appealed immediately to the Alaska Supreme Court, and Stone filed the appropriate documents on Wednesday.</p>

But their 100-plus-page complaint and preliminary arguments did little to convince Humetewa, who deemed the relief sought by the group &#8220;extraordinary.&#8221;  &#8220;If granted, millions of Arizonans who exercised their individual right to vote in the 2020 General Election would be utterly disenfranchised,&#8221; she wrote.  &#8220;Such a request should then be accompanied by clear and conclusive facts to support the alleged &#8216;egregious range of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties &#8230; at the direction of Arizona state election officials,'&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Yet the Complaint’s allegations are sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence, and Plaintiffs’ invocation of this Court’s limited jurisdiction is severely strained.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the three remaining lawsuits challenging Arizona’s presidential election results was withdrawn after the secretary of state’s office threatened to pursue legal fees and sanctions against the attorney involved. The case, filed on behalf of four plaintiffs who identified themselves as members of something called the Arizona Election Integrity Association, included charges that Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg funneled money to election officials in nine Arizona counties through the Center for Tech and Civil Life in a way designed to deliberately skew the vote here for Biden.

The suit was swiftly dismissed after a hearing the day before by Judge Timothy Batten in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Batten expressed strong skepticism to Powell&#8217;s arguments throughout the hearing, and one thing he returned to multiple times was the jurisdictional issue of whether the suit should have been brought in state court. He also said that the relief Powell seeks with her suit &#8211; among other things, invalidating Georgia&#8217;s 1 million absentee ballots and declaring President Trump the winner in the state &#8211; is something &#8220;this court cannot grant.&#8221; He characterized it as &#8220;the most extraordinary relief every sought in a court in an election.” It&#8217;s unclear if the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta will hear the case. The 11th Circuit affirmed the District Court&#8217;s dismissal of another election challenge, brought by attorney Lin Wood, last weekend.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has filed suit in Fulton County Superior Court seeking to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/election/republican-lawsuit-would-limit-use-of-ballot-drop-boxes-in-georgia/7GBT2RX7N5DGXDDV6IONWEE5B4/"> curtain the use of ballot drop boxes</a> in the January runoff. In a lawsuit the Republican National Committee and the Georgia Republican Party seek to allow voters to return ballots at drop boxes only during normal business hours, not 24 hours a day. Among other things, the lawsuit also seeks greater access for party monitors to observe vote counting and related activities in the Jan. 5 runoff that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.</p>

In the meantime, Peterson agreed to hold one hearing on December 23 to discuss a motion to dismiss the case by the attorney representing the LaSalle County Clerk&#8217;s Office Matthew Krueger. The motion to dismiss takes issue with Larry Smith, the Republican Central Committee Chairman, being referred to as a &#8220;voter&#8221; instead of a &#8220;qualified voter&#8221; in the petition asking the court to order a recount of vote-by-mail ballots.</p>

Instead, they say they should be allowed to use electronic options that let them vote privately. The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in the Southern District of Indiana</p>

The plaintiffs are suing to nullify the results, claiming widespread voting fraud and illegal acts by lawmakers. They claim the governor and state lawmakers violated the state Constitution by expanding absentee and early voting, among many other claims. Burroughs said the plaintiffs should have sued before the election if they were worried about expanded voting. &#8220;What you don&#8217;t get to do is look at an entire arrangement for voting and not say a word until you lose the election, and then complain about the process,&#8221; Burroughs told Moran, who was speaking on behalf of the group, during a hearing this week.</p>

Angelic Johnson and Linda Lee Tarver, both members of Black Voices for Trump, petitioned the state Supreme Court directly on Nov. 26. They sought a range of court actions, in addition to an audit, including: a declaration that Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had violated their constitutional rights; seizure of ballots, ballot boxes and poll books; appointment of a special master or legislative committee to investigate claims of fraud related to the counting of absentee ballots at the TCF Center in Detroit,  and an injunction preventing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from certifying Michigan&#8217;s presidential election results, which has already happened. The three Democratic-nominated justices — Chief Justice Bridget McCormack and Justices Richard Bernstein and Megan Cavanagh — were joined by Republican nominee Elizabeth Clement in denying the requested actions without first hearing oral arguments. Justices Brian Zahra, David Viviano and Stephen Markman dissented, saying the court should call for additional briefings and oral arguments and hear the case fully on an expedited basis.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Jonker, the chief judge of the federal court in Grand Rapids has<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/12/08/chief-judge-rips-voter-fraud-court-filing-michigan-sheriff-dar-leaf/6487646002/"> denied a request for an emergency order</a> from a Michigan sheriff, saying documents the sheriff filed Sunday are so legally deficient it is not even clear he has started a court action. Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf sought a temporary restraining order directing local clerks not to comply with a routine post-election memorandum from the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office telling them to delete certain records related to the Nov. 3 vote. Rather than clearly showing irreparable harm unless immediate court action is taken, as required to obtain an injunction, Leaf and his co-plaintiffs &#8220;invite the court to make speculative leaps toward a hazy and nebulous inference that there has been numerous instances of election fraud and that defendants are destroying the evidence.</p>
<p>Wayne County Judge Timothy Kenny<a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/12/judge-denies-request-for-wayne-county-election-audit-citing-audit-already-planned-by-secretary-of-state.html"> denied a request to audit</a> the county’s election results before Michigan’s electors cast their vote for Joe Biden next week, citing an already-planned audit by the Secretary of State. Kenny said a group of voters who sued Detroit-area election officials are entitled to seek an audit, but not one supervised by county officials. The Secretary of State committed to performing a risk-limiting audit, and Kenny said plaintiffs could pursue a case again in the Court of Claims if the state does not follow through. “This court finds no legal authority that permits the Wayne County Clerk to conduct an audit of Wayne County election results or that separates the audit from the oversight of the Secretary of State,” Kenny wrote in his order. “Since the Secretary of State has made a public commitment to do an audit of the Wayne County vote, plaintiff’s motion for the audit is premature.”</p>

The petition was filed on Nov. 24, three weeks after the 2020 election and just hours before the state canvassing board met to certify the results. In a ruling signed Dec. 4 by Chief Justice Lorie Gildea, the high court denied the request on the grounds it was improperly served to respondents and that a recount would be overly burdensome and “cast an unacceptable degree of uncertainty over the election.”</p>

One leading Black mayoral candidate — Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who once supported the system — now says it’s being rushed. Seventy-four percent of New York City voters approved ranked-choice voting in 2019.  But with the mayoral primary less than seven months away, some campaigns are worried that the system could hurt Black candidates. They argue that a traditional approach would increase the chances of a runoff, where a Black candidate might perform better in a contest with only two names on the ballot. Critics also question whether the city’s problem-prone Board of Elections can roll out such a complicated system during a once-in-a-century pandemic.</p>

In the Pennsylvania case, the justices said they would not block a ruling from the state’s highest court that had rejected a challenge to the state’s use of mail ballots on Nov. 3. The request that the Supreme Court intercede had faced substantial legal hurdles since it was filed long after the enactment of a 2019 statute that allowed mailed ballots and was based on questions of state, rather than federal, law.</p>

In a four-page opinion, Commonwealth Court President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt dismissed the suit brought by a group of nine GOP state lawmakers, led by Rep Daryl Metcalfe, saying they had waited too long to file their challenge.  They “are unable to demonstrate a clear right to relief or likelihood of prevailing on the merits because their underlying action … is really an improper and untimely election contest,” she wrote.</p>

The suit, filed last week in federal district court on behalf of the Tennessee NAACP and five Tennesseans who were unable to restore their rights, seeks court intervention in the state&#8217;s process to help those eligible residents restore their rights. As it stands, Tennessee&#8217;s process can vary from county to county and lead residents on what the lawsuit calls a &#8220;wild-goose chase.&#8221; &#8220;A person with the same facts surrounding their conviction and service of the terms of their sentence may get a different result depending on their county of conviction and which official in that county is making the determination of their eligibility,&#8221; the lawsuit claims.</p>

Hagedorn let loose on the petition by a group called the &#8220;Wisconsin Voters Alliance,&#8221; which asked the court to reject the more than 3 million votes cast in November&#8217;s election, require the Legislature to choose its own presidential electors and require the governor to approve them. Hagedorn said such a move would be without precedent in American history. &#8220;One might expect that this solemn request would be paired with evidence,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Instead, the evidentiary support rests almost entirely on the unsworn expert report of a former campaign employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Pamela Pepper, the Chief United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.<a href="https://wxow.com/2020/12/10/election-lawsuit-involving-la-crosse-co-gop-chair-dismissed/"> dismissed a lawsuit</a> brought by the head of the La Crosse County Republican Party seeking to overturn the certification of the November election for president.  The lawsuit was filed December 1 by former Trump team attorney Sidney Powell in federal court in Milwaukee.  The suit was brought originally on behalf of two plaintiffs, La Crosse County GOP chair Bill Feehan and 3rd District congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden. Pepper issued a lengthy response in her dismissal of the lawsuit. A copy of the dismissal can be read below.  She began her order, in part, &#8220;The election that preceded this lawsuit was emotional and often divisive. The pleadings that have been filed over the past week are passionate and urgent. People have strong, deep feelings about the right to vote, the freedom and opportunity to vote, and the value of their vote. They should. But the legal question at the heart of this case is simple. Federal courts have limited jurisdiction. Does a federal court have the jurisdiction and authority to grant the relief this lawsuit seeks? The answer is no.&#8221; She continues, &#8220;Federal judges do not appoint the president in this country. One wonders why the plaintiffs came to federal court and asked a federal judge to do so. After a week of sometimes odd and often harried litigation, the court is no closer to answering the &#8220;why&#8221;. But this federal court has no authority or jurisdiction to grant the relief the remaining plaintiff seeks. The court will dismiss the case.&#8221;</p>

According to The New York Times, the company said it was making the change because Tuesday was the so-called safe harbor deadline — the date by which all state-level election challenges, such as recounts and audits, are supposed to be completed. YouTube said that enough states have certified their election results to determine that Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the president-elect.</p>
