</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources to help elections officials navigate an ever-evolving situation</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5210" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="214" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-300x170.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-768x436.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" />The never-ending news cycle went into overdrive when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. Schools closed, primaries got rescheduled, telework and social distancing became a thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an ever-evolving situation with things changing by the minute. We realize it can all be a bit overwhelming and officials may not know where to turn for the information that need, so we’ve done our best to pull together the latest information from our partners like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the National Disabilities Rights Network and their guidance on how to be an election administrator during this pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also scrolled through electionline’s Resources and Trainings page to bring you some information that might need in the coming days, weeks, months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll do our best to keep the information as up-to-date as possible, but if you see that we’ve got old information or there’s something new to add, please drop us a line: mmoretti@electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. Social distance. Don’t panic.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC launched a</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/coronavirus-covid-19-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page dedicated to information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on coronavirus (COVID-19), contingency planning, and other online resources for election officials. As part of the EAC’s clearinghouse function, staff is collecting and posting resources from voting system vendors, state election offices, and federal agencies on coronavirus and contingency planning. These resources include vendor recommended cleaning guidelines for election technology, CDC guides on the virus, materials election offices have developed on coronavirus for staff and voters, and more. The EAC is planning to add and update materials as they become available.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASS has released an</span><a href="https://www.nass.org/resources/issue-briefing-election-emergencies-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Issue Briefing: Election Emergencies &amp; COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, or the novel coronavirus, in the United States has renewed questions about the administration of elections in emergency situations. This document is intended to provide a general overview of state policies on this topic, as well as an update on efforts by election officials to deal with potential issues posed specifically by COVID-19.  </span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the changes to voting being thought about during this time, the National Disabilities Rights Network has put out a</span><a href="https://www.ndrn.org/resource/statement-on-elections-accessibility-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the importance of safety while at the same time taking accessibility needs into consideration. The statement includes considerations for enhancing options for remote voting as well as considerations for maintaining in-person voting.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCSL has added two pages to its site with plenty of information for elections officials and legislators navigating these strange waters.</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/state-action-on-covid-19-and-elections.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> COVID-19 and Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a look at policy options to ensure fair elections in times of public health emergencies. NCSL does not recommend legislative changes or provide opinions on policy options, but the organization gathered ideas that have surfaced in response to the COVID-19 threat. The organization also has a page, which they are updating regularly on</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-emergencies.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Emergencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the talk of social distancing, states are considering what to do about their upcoming primaries, runoffs, local elections and of course November 3. Many are considering expanded absentee options or moving entirely to</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/voting-by-mail-is-the-hot-new-idea-is-there-time-to-make-it-work.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A lot, and we do mean A LOT has been opined about the move to vote-by-mail this week (See Opinions This Week) but from a nuts and bolts sense, the</span><a href="https://www.voteathome.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National Vote at Home Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a</span><a href="https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NVAHI-Reference-Library.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reference library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (updated 3/16/2020) that provides some practical information about moving to vote by mail.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5301" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CTCL.png 526w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Center for Tech and Civic Life</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTCL has a host of information, tools and webinars available to elections officials that are always useful, but especially now.  As the number of voters submitting ballots by mail increases&#8211; and as states consider ramping up the use of mail balloting&#8211; getting the details right matters. This</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/vote-at-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set of webinars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from CTCL, CCD, and the National Vote at Home Institute covers the low- and no-cost tweaks officials can implement now to keep the process smooth. With precincts in nursing homes off the table in many areas, getting the right amount of people and resources to each new or revamped polling site is a challenge.</span><a href="https://electiontools.org/tool/polling-place-resource-planner/#using-the-tool"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The polling place resource calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to make that process more efficient and accurate. And, officials scrambling to update information across social media and other channels will appreciate this</span><a href="https://electiontools.org/tool/voter-outreach-graphics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter outreach graphics tutorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and our set of free</span><a href="https://electiontools.org/tool/civic-icons-and-images/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> civic icons and images</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. CTCL has also written a number of articles about how local elections officials are dealing with certain issues as</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/johnson-county-missouri/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> planning for the unexpected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/orange-county-florida/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recruiting younger poll workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/weber-county-utah/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communicating more effectively with poll workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>electionline Resources and Training</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the electionline</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/training-resources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Training and Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pages you can find a plethora of information about how to conduct an election in these changing times. Information about vote by mail, vote centers and remote training. But there is going to be a time when the word coronavirus isn’t in every headline and life as we know it, whatever that will look like, goes on and when that time comes you’ll want to be ready so now could be a good time to learn about how other folks conduct their elections, best practices, research, reports, etc. If you’re working from home or furloughed it’s a good time to learn new things and stay sharp on what you already know and you can find so much of that information on our resources pages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Remote working tools &amp; tips</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We here at electionline (and when I saw we, I mean me, me Mindy) have been working from home (or Guatemala, or Ireland, or Zanzibar) since 2011 so it’s been very interesting to watch how millions of people are suddenly dealing with it (and for many, also suddenly becoming home school parents).</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/15/815549926/8-tips-to-make-working-from-home-work-for-you"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National Public Radio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and many other media outlets) have provided lots of tips over the last few days about how work from home.  Our biggest advice to everyone is set a routine and stick with it. It’s working from home, not doing some work while you’re home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your or your office have never worked remotely there are some tools that can help such as</span><a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/work-remote"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video conferencing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://slack.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> messaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.google.com/drive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Are you not entertained?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because you can’t — shouldn’t—work all the time, we wanted to pull together some resources for you and your families that you can use while social distancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are surprisingly more</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_about_elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movies about elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than we had originally thought. While most of them obviously focus on campaigns and politics and not the hardworking election administration folks, they are still a great source of entertainment. Some of our favorites (and not necessarily because they are good) include: Election, All the President’s Men, Bob Roberts, Swing Vote, The Campaign, Wag the dog and of course Recount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several ways to still enjoy the arts world while things are closed and you and your family are practicing social distancing. Playbill has a list of 15</span><a href="https://www.playbill.com/article/15-broadway-plays-and-musicals-you-can-watch-on-stage-from-home"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Broadway musicals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can watch on stage from home. The Metropolitan Opera is offering</span><a href="https://operawire.com/metropolitan-opera-to-offer-up-nightly-met-opera-streams/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nightly Met Opera Streams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each evening beginning at 7:30 p.m. And Parents.com has pulled together a list of</span><a href="https://www.parents.com/syndication/museums-with-virtual-tours/?utm_campaign=parents_parentsmagazine&amp;utm_content=internalsyndication_travelandleisure&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_term=FD51F848-6550-11EA-9FBA-CF782FEB5590&amp;utm_medium=social"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 12 famous museums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can take virtual tours of. If you’re really looking for some escapism, the Hallmark Channel has scheduled a</span><a href="https://www.etonline.com/hallmark-channel-schedules-christmas-movie-marathon-during-self-quarantine-exclusive-143313"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Christmas movie marathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for March 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the great outdoors is inaccessible to you right now, a website called Totally the Bomb has compiled a list of</span><a href="https://totallythebomb.com/heres-33-national-park-tours-you-can-take-virtually-from-the-comfort-of-your-home"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 33 National Parks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can tour virtually. The Verge has compiled a list of</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21181541/soothing-live-animal-webcams-aquarium-zoo"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> animal-related web cams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that features, among others the Monterey Bay Aquarium and its mesmerizing jellies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, because sometimes, sometimes you just have to watch a montage video of a lab named Stella jump into a</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Tu3HN-MmJc4"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pile of leaves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There are so many stories in every fabric of American life</strong> about the impacts of the coronavirus and of course the elections world is no different, but this week we think we found one of the greatest stories.</span><a href="https://www.enterprisenews.com/news/20200317/clerk-was-in-charge-of-brocktons-health-dept-when-coronavirus-hit"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brockton, Massachusetts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ health department was without an executive when the coronavirus became a pandemic and the interim department head had no medical experience at all. Enter John McGarry, executive director of the city’s elections commission who worked as an operating room nurse till about six years ago! Mayor Robert Sullivan has reassigned McGarry to serve as the city’s health director until the crises has passed.</span></p>

In the footage, the elections worker, who is no longer with the county, can be seen checking the time and then at 7pm locking up the ballot drop box without ever looking inside. &#8220;This was a big surprise to find out that the person who actually closed the box at 7 p.m. did not actually collect the ballots out of it,&#8221; County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters told 9News. &#8220;We can train our election judges, which we do. We can train staff and our elections managers, but when it comes right down to it, the only variable that we can’t control is human error. That’s exactly what happened in this case.&#8221; Peters sent a letter to the affected voters apologizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sometimes the best intentions aren’t necessarily good ideas</strong>. Recently county elections boards began receiving voter registration forms generated by a website called Register2Vote.org. Because the only accepts the National Mail Voter Registration Application and the Oklahoma Voter Registration Application, the forms generated by the third-party website had to be rejected. Oklahomans who submitted an</span><a href="https://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/ziriax-cautions-oklahoma-voters-about-unapproved-voter-registration-applications/article_179ecaec-45a1-5a20-a88f-0863cb64c0b0.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> application generated by Register2Vote.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their county election boards will be mailed a letter from the secretary of the county election board explaining why the application was rejected, along with an official Oklahoma Voter Registration Application. “I have spoken with the director of Register2Vote.org. I now believe the organization had good intentions and did not deliberately seek to provide Oklahomans with forms that are not valid under our law. Oklahoma election officials will work with Register2Vote.org to ensure that in the future any voter registration applications provided to Oklahomans are valid and approved for use in our state,” State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax told the Enid News &amp; Eagle.</span></p>

Although the registrar is still putting the finishing touches on the election the paper was able to</span><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/03/16/election-data-shows-how-oc-voters-behaved-on-march-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ascertain some of the patterns for how voters cast their ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and for whom). This was the first election that the county conducted under the Voter’s Choice Act and although there were was an 11-day window of voting before primary day, most voters cast their ballots on Super Tuesday. Preliminary data shows more than 75% of the votes cast for the primary — more than 611,000 — were mail-in ballots, either sent through the Postal Service, dropped off at a vote center, or slipped into a drop box. In the 2018 primary, mail-in ballots accounted for 64% of all the votes cast in Orange County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We really like this idea!</strong> During early voting at the Pottawattomie Park field house, the park advisory council scheduled a</span><a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/03/12/rogers-park-polling-place-will-host-arts-and-crafts-for-kids-while-parents-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “craft for the kids”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event so parents could drop their kids off to do some arts and crafts while they went to cast an early ballot in the Illinois primary. Volunteers for the park advisory council were set to coordinate arts and crafts activities for kids, including a sock puppet workshop. The event was free and open to all families. Unfortunately it became a victim of the coronavirus, but it’s still a great idea where and when possible.</span></p>

The legislation would also provide $3 million to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to begin implementing some of the bill’s requirements, along with reimbursing states for doing the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> A bill from Sen. Ben Allen is preparing to introduce a bill that would compel Los Angeles County to either</span><a href="https://easyreadernews.com/bill-proposes-changes-in-response-to-long-waits-on-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand the number of vote centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or to offer a vote-by-mail ballot to all registered voters.</span></p>

Under the proposal, the Department of Revenue would send a list of eligible voters compiled through license information to the Secretary of State’s Office and on to local election authorities. The Board of Probation and Parole would send that information for people who are being released from incarceration, probation or parole and are eligible to vote again.</span></p>

The proposed legislation would allow voters to cast their ballot in a number of ways, including by mail, drop off at a county board of election, Voter Service and Polling Center or secure mail drop boxes that would be located throughout each of Ohio’s 88 counties. Voters also could cast ballots in person at the office of their county’s BOE or VSPC from the start of the early voting period through Election Day. Each paper ballot would carry a unique bar code and would require signature authentication. Election fraud would be a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  </span></p>
