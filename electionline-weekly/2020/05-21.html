							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>20 Ways to Protect the 2020 Presidential Election</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New report highlights measures that can be implemented before November</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance for Securing Democracy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ASD) at the German Marshall Fund of the United States and the</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bipartisan Policy Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BPC) today released 20 for 20: 20 Ways to Protect the 2020 Presidential Election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this report,</span><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/author/david-levine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ASD’s Elections Integrity Fellow David Levine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/matthew-weil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BPC’s Elections Project Director Matthew Weil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identify 20 ways states could further protect the 2020 presidential election with additional funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the coronavirus pandemic, some states have begun using previously appropriated election security funds to cover unanticipated costs. While necessary, this redirection of funds creates a dilemma: states are using money originally intended to address key issues like election infrastructure and foreign interference to cover the new costs, leaving American democracy vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated foreign adversaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20 for 20 recommendations incorporate successful state-run programs, local officials’ input, and voter feedback to give federal lawmakers a better understanding of what could be done with additional funding and provide election officials with ideas for how to spend any election security funding they already have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As Congress considers additional action to secure the vote in response to the pandemic, they should not lose sight of the need to secure the election against foreign adversaries,” said ASD Elections Integrity Fellow David Levine. “The fact remains that intelligence officials have warned that authoritarian regimes like Russia, China, and Iran will try to interfere in the 2020 elections; the pandemic has not changed this assessment. From mitigating risks that result from increased vote by mail options to defending systems against ransomware attacks, 20 for 20 outlines important steps states can take to secure elections with additional funding. While Congress has provided some election security funding, more is needed to address these twin priorities of combatting foreign interference and making pandemic-related election adjustments. Ensuring a safe and secure election should be a national security priority that unites us all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic has overwhelmed election administrators’ attention and led to massive changes in how our elections will look this November,” said BPC Director of the Elections Project Matthew Weil. “It does not mean the old concerns over election security fade away. Congress stepped to the plate in 2018 and 2019 to secure American elections. Those priorities were right then and need consistent focus going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“20 for 20 shows all that state and local election officials can do to provide voting access during Covid-19 while simultaneously securing the process against nefarious actors. They just need the resources to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the 20 recommendations include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigate the potential risks associated with administering more voting by mail due to the coronavirus</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help local election officials work with Facebook and Twitter to be identified as trusted sources</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a social media monitoring service to help fight election disinformation and/or misinformation efforts</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further protect the state’s voter registration database from bad actors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire additional cybersecurity staff</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CARES Act recently allocated $400 million in federal funding to address state and local governments’ coronavirus-related election needs. A recent report,</span><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/ensuring-safe-elections-federal-funding-needs-for-state-and-local-governments-during-the-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ensuring Safe Elections: Federal Funding Needs for State and Local Governments During the Pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released by experts at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, the R Street Institute, and the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy, and Security put the total need of the five featured states at least $414 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20 for 20 report can be accessed</span><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20-for-20-20-Ways-to-Protect-the-2020-Presidential-Election.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Butler County elections officials said the ballots were mailed on or before the April 27 deadline to be considered.  U.S. Postal Service Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President David E. Williams said in a letter to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose the postal service followed to its processes for delivering absentee ballots. “An</span><a href="https://www.journal-news.com/news/postal-service-says-missort-caused-late-delivery-more-than-300-ballots-butler-county/30hGBU3iLtu7NyXoknuJZI/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unintentional missort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a tray of Butler County return ballots ultimately contributed to a gap in the mail flow, resulting in the delay,” Williams wrote. “The response left us with some unanswered questions, and that’s why Secretary LaRose has already requested greater detail about the new protocols that will be instituted and confirmation that the ballots were always secure while in the possession of the USPS,” Maggie Sheehan, Secretary of State spokeswoman told the Journal-News.</span></p>

But just because Oregon elections officials are pros at this whole vote-by-mail thing doesn’t mean conducting the election during a pandemic didn’t come with its own set of issues. In</span><a href="https://ktvz.com/videos/2020/05/20/des-co-clerk-says-primary-election-came-with-unprecedented-challenges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Deschutes County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Clerk Nancy Blankenship said this year&#8217;s primary election was unlike any other. Tuesday night&#8217;s election results trickled in later than expected. Blankenship said issues included having fewer staff due to COVID-19, voters complaining about receiving the wrong ballot and adapting to upgraded ballot sorter software and hardware. In</span><a href="https://www.malheurenterprise.com/posts/7173/malheur-countys-vote-tally-will-be-updated-once-equipment-fixed-county-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Malheur County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, technical difficulties with a ballot-counting machine delayed the results.

In Oregon’s hotly contested race to be the Democratic secretary of state nominee, State Sen.</span><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/05/oregon-state-sen-mark-hass-wins-democratic-primary-for-secretary-of-state-election-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shemia Fagan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the ultimate winner after The Oregonian originally called the race for Sen.

Fagan will face Republican</span><a href="https://www.koin.com/news/elections/oregon-primary-democratic-republican-secretary-of-state-05192020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kim Thatcher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state lawmaker who won her race with more than 85% of the vote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5218" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Alabama:</strong> Just because schools are closed due to the coronavirus doesn’t mean the learning about elections has to stop. According to the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em>, Autauga County, Alabaa Probate Judge Kim Kervin came up with a way to</span><a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/05/15/pig-ear-sandwich-takes-win-autauga-voting-program/5190666002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keep students engaged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by having them choose which is their favorite sandwich and then the winning sandwich would be featured in a sandwich eating contest between Police Chief Mark Thompson and Montgomery Advertiser reporter Marty Roney. The election &#8220;results&#8221; were tabulated by Autauga Circuit Clerk Deb Hill, Sheriff Joe Sedinger and Kervin, who also serve as the county&#8217;s elections commission during real voting. The candidates were peanut butter and jelly, ham and cheese and the pickled pig&#8217;s ear sandwich. As you may have guessed, the pickled pig’s ear sandwich came up the winner although there were rumors of possible voter fraud and improper influence. And it wouldn’t be an election without a glitch of some kind. In this case, Kervin had trouble finding pickled pig’s ears! &#8220;We really had great participation and we are looking forward to Friday,&#8221; Kervin told he paper. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a hoot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alaska:</strong> Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer announced that the state’s primary election will be held using the</span><a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/05/17/despite-the-pandemic-alaskas-primary-and-general-elections-to-follow-normal-voting-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> normal voting procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but that additional safety measures would be taken at the polls on Aug. 18 and the state will encourage residents to vote absentee and early. “The voters will have multiple choices come this election and they will and should pick the one they’re most comfortable with,” Meyer said according to Alaska Public Media. He said the Division of Elections will be prepared for even the worst situation. All voters who choose to vote in person will be given latex gloves to sign their names and mark their ballot. And voters without a mask will be provided one. Meyer said election workers will be given face shields. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5220" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Colorado:</strong> Gov. Jared Polis has signed three elections-related executive orders. Two of the orders revolve around petition signature collection and a third clarifies elections as a</span><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/05/16/polis-executive-orders-ballots-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical government function</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Colorado, Denver Clerk &amp; Recorder Paul Lopez sent a letter to the city’s mayor saying that the</span><a href="https://denverite.com/2020/05/15/citys-furlough-schedule-will-interfere-with-the-election-cycle-clerk-and-recorder-tells-mayor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed furlough schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—about 9,000 of the city’s 12,000 employees must take eight furlough days by the end of the year—will interfere with the elections division’s ability to process votes and other elections functions. The first of the fixed days, July 6, coincides with ballot processing for the June 30 primary. The second, September 4, coincides with the state’s ballot certification deadline “when our team needs to be available to prepare the ballot and TABOR notice for November,” Lopez wrote. The third, October 19, falls “on the first date we are required under state law to open voter service and polling centers,” he said. “Since nine of the 12 sites we are opening that day are in city facilities, that furlough day and corresponding city shut down will impede our ability to open vote centers and follow state law,” Lopez continued. Lopez is that his office’s budget revisions be approved without reductions and that staff remain essential employees and therefore exempt from furloughs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connecticut:</strong> Governor Lamont signed an executive order that will allow Connecticut voters the chance to</span><a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/coronavirus/conn-voters-will-have-chance-to-vote-by-mail-in-november-governor/2274609/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote by mail for the August primary elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The executive order permits voting by mail if there is no federally approved and widely available vaccine for COVID-19 prevention. According to the executive order, &#8220;a person shall be permitted to lawfully state he or she is unable to appear at a polling place because of COVID-19 if, at the time he or she applies for or casts an absentee ballot for the August 11, 2020 primary election, there is no federally approved and widely available vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.&#8221; Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said she plans to have her office send every eligible voter an application by mail with a postage paid return envelope to begin the process.</span></p>

Ron DeSantis’ administration intends to use</span><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-desantis-seeks-federal-coronavirus-election-money-20200514-qjrbzwyyu5gajbbn6zau65cfri-story.html?int=lat_digitaladshouse_bx-modal_acquisition-subscriber_ngux_display-ad-interstitial_bx-bonus-story_______"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $20.2 million from the federal government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help the state prepare for coronavirus-era voting this year. “It is Florida’s intent to request all of its funds,” Mark Ard, marketing and interim communications director for the Florida Secretary of State’s Office, said via email. “We are in the process of formalizing our request.”</span></p>

Phyllis Wheeler, elections supervisor in McDuffie County said in a phone interview that she herself was tested Wednesday morning. Wheeler had to send home the rest of her staff, including a number of part-time workers and students that were working to process absentee applications and ballots, until the coronavirus test results are complete. Her assistant elections supervisor was also tested for the virus and is working until the results are known.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maine:</strong> The state GOP has secured</span><a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/05/16/politics/maine-gop-gets-essential-status-for-its-effort-to-repeal-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essential worker status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and may continue to gather signatures in an effort to repeal the state’s ranked choice voting law. According to the Bangor Daily News, Signature gatherers must collect voter signatures at stationary locations and place pens and petition on folding tables. The petition circulators must wear protective masks and gloves, stay six feet away from signers and enforce social distancing at signing stations. Signers will have access to single-use pens — they’ll take the pens home with them rather than return them to the campaign — and circulators will carry hand sanitizer and other sanitation products, such as wipes. The campaign has until June 15 to submit the 63,000 signatures necessary for a referendum. That’s 90 days after the Legislature adjourned this year due to the coronavirus, about a month earlier than originally anticipated.</span></p>

She said the state had delivered necessary voter information to the company in time for ballots to be mailed more than a week ago. &#8220;We are extremely disappointed that the vendor has failed to deliver according to the schedule,” Charlson said.

We know from the elections that took place this month that during the pandemic Michiganders want to safely vote.&#8221;  Following her announcement, President Donald J. Trump, who has himself voted absentee,</span><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/05/20/donald-trump-michigan-absentee-ballot-applications/5227024002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took to Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to condemn the move and threatened to withhold funding from the state. His initial Tweet noted that the state would be sending all voters ballots. He subsequently deleted that Tweet and in a subsequent Tweet noted the state was sending applications, but he still stood by his claim of potential voter fraud.</span></p>

We are going to be providing that for all of our counties.” The state is exploring options of moving all counties to paper ballots. In the event that doesn’t happen by November, they’re looking at options. “We asked one of our vendors last week… as simple as something as a popsicle stick or a stylus… something that we can give the voter so they’re not continuously touching the machine,&#8221; noted Watson.</span></p>

To protect the franchise, New York City must be a beacon for clean and fair elections,” Stringer said in a May 14 statement. “Our investigation found concerning evidence of mismanagement at the New York City Board of Elections, including lax record-keeping, broken machines, staff shortages, a lack of bilingual interpreters, and inaccessible polling locations for those with limited mobility.” A spokeswoman for the BOE said, “The Board declines to comment as our efforts and focus are on preparing for and conducting the Primary Election scheduled for June 23, 2020 during this moment of national crisis.” The comptroller recommended that the BOE increase its outreach effort to recruit new poll workers not only to expand bilingual services but to also ensure all polling locations are Americans with Disabilities Act accessible. To prevent issues on the equipment front, Stringer recommended that the BOE conduct testing before election day of poll books, cradle points, and ballot scanners.</span></p>

The contest is a collaboration from Metro Arts and the Davidson County Election Commission. The contest received 75 entries from Nashville public, private and homeschool students in grades 7-12. A panel of residents narrowed the field down to eight. “The fantastic designs we received from talented student artists all over Nashville represented a wide range of schools, ages and ideas,” Metro Arts Executive Director Caroline Vincent said in a statement on Monday. “Now Nashvillians face the fun but tough task of choosing a favorite. This collaboration with the Election Commission is a true reflection of how art can bolster civic participation, and we look forward to finding out the winner and making these stickers for all of Nashville.”</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>California:</strong> The San Diego city council’s rules committee voted 3-2 last to week to allow further evaluation of a measure that would shift city elections to a</span><a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2020-05-14/san-diego-ballot-measures-for-ranked-choice-voting-clean-elections-take-key-step-forward"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  system. The ballot measure will return to the committee for second debate June 10 and if approved by the committee a second time, the full council would have until Aug. 7 to place the measure on the November ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4121" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Louisiana-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Louisiana:</strong> A House committee rejected 9-5 a bill by Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, that would have allowed all registered voters to</span><a href="https://www.kalb.com/content/news/House-committee-rejects-bill-to-expand-mail-in-voting-in-Louisiana-570608481.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all state elections, including this fall’s presidential contest. Landry’s bill would not mandate voting by mail but simply allow it to be used more broadly. The bill failed in a party-line vote, with Republicans against it and Democrats for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> With the deadline for action looming, the House approved a bill that will allow for the expanded use of</span><a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/05/14/missouri-house-absentee-voting-2020-elections/5193566002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the global pandemic. All voters will be given the option of casting an absentee ballot in August and November regardless of the reason why. Despite the expanded ability to cast an absentee ballot, voters wishing to vote absentee will still need to get their ballot notarized. In addition to the absentee voting changes, the bill also gives the secretary of state</span><a href="https://themissouritimes.com/missouri-elections-bill-would-give-secretary-of-state-subpoena-power-in-investigations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subpoena power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when investigating suspected election offenses.</span></p>

Under House Bill 2502, which passed by a vote of 201-1, the Department of State would have 60 days to issue a report on the number of absentee and mail-in ballots, as well as incidents in which ballots were sent to the wrong address or there were allegations that someone tried to use a mail-in ballot to vote for someone else. State Rep. Mike Carroll, D-Luzerne, was the only negative vote. The legislation&#8217;s prospects in the state Senate aren&#8217;t clear. A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, didn&#8217;t immediately respond on Wednesday to a question about whether the Senate plans to act on the bill. Much of the data that would be mandated in this new report is already included in an annual report completed by the Department of State. The House proposal would require the state to generate that information more quickly, so that it&#8217;s available ahead of the presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The Harris County Commissioner’s Court is considering a proposal that would move election responsibilities for the county from an elected clerk to a</span><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/With-clerk-resigning-Harris-County-mulls-switch-15278141.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nonpartisan election administrator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The move would put a single office in charge of running elections and managing the voter roll, both gargantuan tasks in the state’s largest county, which has 4.7 million residents. Voter registration is currently the responsibility of the tax assessor-collector, owing to the office’s historic role collecting poll taxes. The county clerk’s office administers elections. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county attorney’s office prepared a four-page memorandum last week detailing how to switch to an elections administrator. Of the 10 most populous counties in Texas, only Harris and Travis have yet to adopt the elections administrator model.</span></p>

It would also mandate that a certain number of polling places remain open so people who wanted to register on election day could do so. Mailing ballot applications would be the job of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, voters would then complete the ballot request forms and send them to their local clerks to receive the actual ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wyoming:</strong> The Sweetwater County commission vote to approve a resolution to establish the Sweetwater County Courthouse as an absentee polling location and counting center. People will be allowed to go to the courthouse prior to Election Day, fill out an absentee ballot and put it into a voting machine. The machine will accommodate voters from all districts and precincts within the county. The resolution states that the polling place will be open the same hours as the courthouse on normal business days during the time period allowed for absentee voting.</span></p>

The suit, which claims the plans violate the Voting Rights Act, alleges that the plaintiffs have had spotty mail service at their homes for years and it has only gotten worse since the pandemic. The suit claims that neither plaintiff received a Voter’s Guide and that one plaintiff has yet to receive her allot. “COVID-19 has lead to a bunch of hastily implemented voting policies, and the District of Columbia didn’t adequately take into account the historical conditions of Ward 8, or the current reality of Ward 8,” Aristotle Theresa an attorney for the plaintiffs told <em>DCist</em>. “As a result, it’s had a negative impact on a protected class, in this case mostly African Americans.” The lawsuit asks for the BOE to provide additional polling locations in the more populous parts of Ward 8 and to pay attorneys’ fees for the suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten dismissed a lawsuit that was seeking to once again</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/judge-rules-against-delaying-georgia-june-primary-again/LkIWCi0GZzfes5WGUk3g1J/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> postpone Georgia’s primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Batten wrote that elected Georgia officials have the authority to decide how to run elections — not the courts. “The framers of the Constitution did not envision a primary role for the courts in managing elections, but instead reserved election management to the legislatures,” Batten wrote in a 12-page order after a hearing earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Idaho:</strong> Congressional hopeful Nicholas Jones has asked a federal court to give Idaho voters</span><a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/idaho-congressional-candidate-files-lawsuit-extend-ballot-request-deadline#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more time to get their ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the state’s online portal was overloaded with a last-minute flood of requests Tuesday. Jones’ campaign said Secretary of State Lawerence Denney (R) failed to fulfill his duty as Idaho’s elections chief. His attorneys asked the Idaho Federal District Court to push back the deadline for Idahoans to request their ballots to Tuesday, May 26 at 8 p.m., a full week extension from the original cut-off date. </span></p>

The lawsuit was filed in Jefferson City by the ACLU of Missouri and the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition on behalf of the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and several residents. It claims that requiring voters to appear at traditional polling places during the pandemic puts lives at risk. Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem in a Monday judgment tossed the lawsuit, writing that the civil rights groups who sued were asking for widespread absentee voting for all future elections regardless of whether COVID-19 is still around. Beetem wrote that the plaintiffs sought &#8220;radical and permanent transformation of Missouri voting practices without the authorization of the Legislature.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Minnesota:</strong> The League of Women Voters has filed suit against Secretary of State Steve Simon over the state’s</span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/league-of-women-voters-challenges-minnesota-absentee-voting-witness-rule/570602072/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> witness requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for absentee ballots. The suit argues that voters should not need a witness signature during the global health pandemic. &#8220;Minnesota consistently has the highest voter turnout in the nation, with many safeguards in place to ensure election integrity,&#8221; said Michelle Witte, executive director at the League of Women Voters Minnesota. &#8220;Making this small change to our witness requirements during this global pandemic will not damage that integrity — it will only make our elections stronger by ensuring that all voters have as few barriers as possible to exercise their constitutional right.&#8221;</span></p>

The groups claim the law, passed in 2018, wrongfully imposed negative and extreme restrictions on efforts to collect ballots throughout the state. Judge Fehr found that there was merit to the group’s claims and ordered to the state to halt enforcement of the law pending further hearings on the matter.</span></p>

The complaint also argues that Clark County’s procedures for distributing ballots and conducting the election unduly favor that county’s voters over those in other parts of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The state Supreme Court ruled that a person who has a New Hampshire home is</span><a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200520/court-answers-nh-residency-questions-in-voting-rights-case"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> considered a resident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to elections, answering questions posed by a federal judge who is presiding over a challenge to a state law. The law, which took effect last July, requires voters to be full-fledged residents of New Hampshire and ended state law distinctions between “residency” and “domicile.” The case now returns to the lower court.</span></p>

The lawsuit maintains the electronic voting system violates a 2010 court order that New Jersey conduct its elections in the traditional, offline manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in New Jersey, Several organizations have filed a lawsuit in New Jersey seeking</span><a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/groups-sue-new-jersey-over-vote-mail/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changes to the state’s vote-by-mail system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the July 7 primary. The lawsuit asks that every voter be informed if their ballot is rejected and be given a chance to prove their identity and have their vote counted. It was filed on behalf of the League of Women Voters, the NAACP, and an individual New Jersey voter. &#8220;Covid-19 has been exposing deep cracks in our society&#8217;s foundation,&#8221; said Ryan Haygood, director of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. &#8220;Those cracks are causing earthquakes in black and brown communities here in New Jersey and so this lawsuit is really about making sure those cracks don’t reach our democracy.&#8221;</span></p>

Eliminating the excuse requirement during COVID-19 is a common-sense solution that protects people’s health and their right to vote, which is why many other states have already made vote by mail and absentee voting available,” Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, said in a release. </span></p>

On Thursday the</span><a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/texas/2020/05/14/369603/court-order-that-opens-up-mail-in-voting-in-texas-stays-in-effect-for-now-appeals-court-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Texas 14th Court of Appeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled that a trial court order from April would stay in place and that basically anyone is eligible to vote by mail during the pandemic. On Friday, the</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/15/texas-voting-by-mail-coronavirus-blocked-supreme-court/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state’s Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> temporarily put on hold the expansion of voting by mail. The state’s Supreme Court did not weigh the merits of the case at this time. On Tuesday,</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/19/federal-judge-says-texas-voters-can-vote-mail-during-coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. District Judge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fred Biery granted a preliminary injunction that allows all registered voters to vote by mail during the pandemic after finding the state’s existing election rules violate the Equal Protection Clause. On Tuesday, the</span><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/05/20/federal-appeals-court-puts-coronavirus-mail-voting-expansion-on-hold-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in New Orleans once again put the expansion of mail voting on hold. The appeals court’s action is an administrative stay that is in place while the court considers whether to block the lower court ruling while it hears the appeal. So just to clarify, at press time (12pm-ish Eastern on May 21), expanded voting by mail during the pandemic is on hold.</span></p>

If all of the possible votes on the four ballots are counted, six candidates have a chance to either win or retain a council seat. In oral arguments in the case streamed live over the internet, Supreme Court justices cited some case law but mostly asked questions about the primary issue of whether the four voters who cast the contested ballots should have their votes counted due to address errors made at the West Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. The address errors mistakenly add “West” to each of the four voters Washington Street mailing address, causing those voters to be registered incorrectly in the neighboring voting precinct for Bolivar residents. The errors prevented the four voters from appearing in Harpers Ferry poll book of qualified voters on Election Day. Three current Harpers Ferry Town Council members are arguing — contrary to legal opinions of Jefferson County Judge Debra McLaughlin and West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner—that the votes on the provisional ballots shouldn’t count because those voters were not “duly registered” for the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> Advocates for people with disabilities and minority voters in Wisconsin filed a</span><a href="https://fox11online.com/news/coronavirus/sweeping-federal-lawsuit-seeks-election-changes-in-wisconsin"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday asking a judge to order that more poll workers be hired, every voter in the state receive an absentee ballot request form and a host of other changes be made to ensure the August primary and November presidential election can be held safely. The lawsuit argues that not enough has been done since then to ensure that the upcoming elections can be conducted safely and fairly. Proceeding without the changes sought would violate the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit also wants to require that absentee ballot drop boxes be installed in every community; state elections officials work with the U.S. Postal Service to ensure timely delivery, return and counting of absentee ballots; notify voters if their absentee ballots won&#8217;t be counted in time for them to fix problems; increase opportunities for curbside voting; and launch a public education campaign about voting options. It also wants to allow for absentee ballots to be counted for up to a week after the election if they are postmarked by election day or don&#8217;t have a postmark.</span></p>

These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</span></p>

But any number of events can undermine that confidence, including targeted interference by malicious actors, a pandemic, a refusal by losing candidates to accept defeat, severe weather events, and widespread infrastructure failures. When Americans are unable to cast ballots as expected, or results are not as clear or timely as anticipated, there will inevitably be complaints about perceived bias in the system that allows partisans to attack the process itself.  Please join The Bipartisan Policy Center for a conversation with Secretaries of State Jena Griswold of Colorado and Frank LaRose of Ohio as we explore the spectrum of election legitimacy concerns we face in the United States and the role we all must play to ensure a legitimate election. <strong>When:</strong> May 27, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</span></p>
