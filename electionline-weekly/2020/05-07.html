							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Worldwide voting made easier with improvements to worldwide web</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study shows how states can improve military and overseas information on their websites</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple improvements can make</span><a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Reports/Assessing-State-UOCAVA-Web-Pages-FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee voting information on websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 55 U.S. states and territories easier to find and use by Service members, their eligible family, and U.S. citizens abroad covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5491" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FVAP1-300x279.png" alt="" width="300" height="279" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FVAP1-300x279.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FVAP1-768x715.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FVAP1.png 848w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For example, according to the study released by the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), only one state website meets readability standards for the information provided for UOCAVA absentee voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every state and territory has specific absentee voting processes for UOCAVA voters, including use of the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to register to vote and request their ballot, the option to receive  their blank ballot electronically, and use of the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) if their official ballot does not arrive on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requirements for voter registration and types of electronic transmission permitted (email, fax, online portals) vary by state. Whether voters can submit their ballots electronically also varies by state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Especially this year, when absentee voting may be delayed or disrupted by service reductions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that state election websites clearly communicate with all voters covered under UOCAVA,” said FVAP Director David Beirne. “States and territories are welcome to use FVAP.gov as a resource for their UOCAVA content and to incorporate the best practices uncovered in our research.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FVAP assessed three aspects of UOCAVA information on state and territory websites: how quickly UOCAVA information could be located, adequacy of the website’s information on registration and voting procedures, and how easy it was to understand and use the information. In most instances, a voter can quickly locate a state’s UOCAVA information, but the website of a few states and territories, it takes long, about one and a half minutes. On average, state websites included 9 out of 11 key pieces of UOCAVA voting information, but finding and understanding the information was rated the most difficult of the three tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States can improve their websites and help military and overseas voters by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing search engine optimization strategies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making it easy to find UOCAVA information on election homepages and through menus</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting all UOCAVA information on one page</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizing information by how a voter would go through the process</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using lists or tables to organize information</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding jargon and removing unnecessary content</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complete study can be found at </span><a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Reports/Assessing-State-UOCAVA-Web-Pages-FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessing State UOCAVA Web Pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Boards already have begun the 10-day “cure” period for voters to confirm their eligibility for about 44,000 provisional ballots cast in the primary, but it’s unclear how many of those were submitted by voters who never tried to vote by mail. In a letter to Democratic state lawmakers, LaRose wrote that a plan the Ohio General Assembly adopted to extend the election made only those voters who requested an absentee ballot and those who turned up in-person and affirmed that they were disabled or homeless eligible to vote in the election. “I sincerely wish this were not the case. I ran to serve as Ohio’s chief elections official to make the ballot box more accessible for every eligible Ohioan who wants to make their voice heard. However, as a constitutional officeholder in the executive branch, I am bound by my oath of office to abide by the law as you and your colleagues write it, even though I advocated for a different path,” he wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative and legal actions surrounding the elections and the coronavirus pandemic can be found in their respective sections of the newsletter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Public Opinion</strong>: Another week another opinion poll about vote by mail. This one, conducted by <em>USA Today</em> and Suffolk University found that</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/04/coronavirus-americans-overwhelmingly-support-vote-mail-push/3063765001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two-thirds of Americans support voting by mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an alternative to voting in person in November. But while Democrats and independent voters overwhelmingly back vote-by-mail, the majority of Republican voters oppose it. The poll found 65% of Americans support vote-by-mail as an alternative, a greater than 2-to-1 margin over the 32% of Americans who oppose the option. Three percent said they were undecided. Eighty-four percent of Democratic voters said they support voting by mail and just 14% said they oppose it. Less than half of Republicans polled, 43%, said they support vote-by-mail as an alternative while more than half, 53%, were opposed. Self-identified independent voters said they back vote-by-mail during the pandemic by a 66%-31% margin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Public Health</strong>: This week</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/496257-over-800-public-health-experts-call-on-congress-to-fund-mail-in-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of more than 800 public health experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sent a letter to Congress calling on it to fund mail-in voting. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the experts—made up of professors, phycologists and doctors led by the Center for American Progress—calling on Congress to provide $4 billion in funding to address vote-by-mail. “In order to ensure the integrity of the electoral process and protect the public health at the same time, it is incumbent on our leaders to prepare for a Presidential election by mail, in which ballots are sent to all registered voters, to allow them to vote from home and ensure their health and safety in the event of a new outbreak of SARS-CoV-2,” the public health experts wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Presidential Opinion</strong>: Former President</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/president-carter-calls-for-expand-vote-mail-access/cuYLg4GgTTZqc1X6Wl2OGK/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jimmy Carter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who has observed elections all over the world, called for expanded vote by-mail in light of the global pandemic. “I urge political leaders across the country to take immediate steps to expand vote-by-mail and other measures that can help protect the core of American democracy – the right of our citizens to vote,” Carter said according to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>. “Many voters across the U.S. are likely to find themselves in areas where the pandemic has not abated and where the health risks involved in going to polling locations will be unacceptably high,” Carter said.</span></p>

After processing at the local level, the voters who request absentee ballots will be delivered ballots via the mail house, and the cost of both the mailing and return of the absentee ballot will be borne by the Office of the Secretary of the State.

The plan allows for a larger number of votes by absentee ballot than ever, at no cost to the towns or voters.</span></p>

In addition to being less likely to get sick from the coronavirus, youths are likely to be comfortable with the technology involved in quickly checking voters.</span></p>

The integrity of our democratic election process must be maintained, and law established by our Legislature must be followed consistently,” Paxton said. “My office will continue to defend the integrity of Texas’s election laws.” The Texas election code states that a qualified voter is eligible to vote early by mail “if the voter has a sickness or physical condition that prevents the voter from appearing at the polling place on election day without a likelihood of needing personal assistance or of injuring the voter’s health.”</span></p>

Matt Volz, Rocky Mountains news editor for the AP, told the Gazette he has passed the information on to his company’s lawyer who asked the deceptive emailer to “cease and desist. “We strongly discourage anybody from impersonating the Associated Press,” he said. “We’re going to take appropriate action.” As the paper points out, such a strange maneuver in a county with only 1,000 people might normally be shrugged off, especially since the election information is public. But, this election cycle hasn’t been normal in Prairie County as we</span><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2020/04-09/#tab-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the April 9 edition of electionline Weekly. Prairie County Commissioner Todd Devlin did some online sleuthing and believes the emails were coming from former Clerk and Recorder Ruth Peck who is running for the office again this cycle after losing to current Clerk and Recorder Shari Robertson two years ago. Robertson failed to meet the filing deadline and will run as a write-in candidate. Peck has denied she is the one who sent the emails.</span></p>

The New York City Campaign Finance Board released its latest Voter Analysis Report and it’s a really interesting look into voting habit of New Yorkers. In addition to providing a comprehensive look at the 2019 election, the report also includes a 10-year longitudinal study of millions of individual voters, the places with the best and worst electoral engagement, and the factors that have influenced voter participation. It’s fascinating. According to the review 21 percent of registered voters did not cast a ballot for the entire decade. Only 3 percent voters voted every time they could. &#8220;People often talk about how we have a registration problem in New York, but what we&#8217;ve found is that people are registered to vote. They are just not turning out to vote,&#8221; Allie Swatek, the Campaign Finance Board&#8217;s director of policy and research, told the Gotham Gazette. &#8220;The participation score captures that problem: how often people turn out to vote in elections that they are eligible to vote in.&#8221;</span></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Alabama:</strong> Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, filed a bill this week that would authorize</span><a href="https://www.timesdaily.com/news/state/push-for-no-excuse-absentee-voting-going-nowhere/article_76284494-f609-5f02-82f0-3eef82a09f0c.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smitherman’s Senate Bill 335 strikes out the list of excuses that qualify a voter for an absentee ballot, and deletes a section of state law that says they must have one of those excuses to apply for an absentee ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5487" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Illinois:</strong> The panel that sets legislative goals for McLean County government has approved asking state lawmakers to order county clerks to send</span><a href="https://www.wglt.org/post/mclean-county-mail-ballot-legislative-proposal-advances#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mail-in ballot applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all registered voters. According to WGLT, county board member Carlo Robustelli said during a recent legislative subcommittee meeting that the move will help people exercise their constitutional right to vote during a pandemic. “Given that the federal government and CDC and Illinois Department of Public Health are making recommendations about social distancing about certain segments of our population that will be most vulnerable, we should be proactive in making sure people do not have to choose between their health and their life, and voting,” said Robustelli.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Secretary of State William Galvin introduced his plan this week that would alter</span><a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2020/05/06/galvin-to-seek-expansion-of-early-mail-in-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how ballots are cast in the commonwealth during the pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The slate of changes would apply only for the Sept. 1 state primaries and the Nov. 3 general election in an attempt to balance voter engagement and protection against COVID-19 transmission risks. Under the secretary&#8217;s proposed legislation, voters could seek mail-in ballots for either or both elections without any excuse, and local election officials could mail them as soon as possible. In-person early voting would also expand from 12 days ahead of the general election to 18 days, including two weekends, and from zero to 7 days before the primary.</span></p>

Under the bill, registered voters would return their ballots by mail or drop them off at designated, local sites. My bill proposes using the system already in place for absentee ballots to provide that opportunity for citizens to vote through the mail,&#8221; said Irwin. &#8220;And clerk&#8217;s offices would be open on election day for individuals who want to make use of same day registration or, if they&#8217;re disabled voters, who need particular accommodations or if people just want to drop their ballot off in person because they don&#8217;t want to put it in the mail.&#8221; The bill has been referred to the Committee on Elections, chaired by Republican State Senator and former Secretary of State Ruth Johnson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Missouri:</strong> The House Elections and Elected Officials Committee approved the bill on a party line vote of 5-2, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.

That&#8217;s our job,&#8221; Parete said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t, for the life of me, figure out or rationalize where this came from.&#8221;</span></p>

The measure proposes a new constitutional amendment outlining processes for military and overseas voters, election audits, open primaries, instant runoff elections, legislative redistricting by the new Ethics Commission and subdivision of House legislative districts. Its text fills three pages. Supporters submitted the petition format to Jaeger in March. Organizers need 26,904 signatures by July 6.</span></p>

The</span><a href="https://legiscan.com/OH/text/HB560/2019"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill calls on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to “establish a pilot program” of blockchain voting specifically for uniformed service members stationed outside the U.S. The bill was introduced by Reps. Beth Liston and Michele Lepore-Hagan, and cosponsored by 16 other Democrats. If passed, it would see military members transmit their ballots to election officials via “encrypted blockchain technology” that “protects the security and integrity of the process and protects the voter’s privacy.” The receiving board of elections would then print out that ballot “for counting purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Two days after the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a requirement that absentee ballots be notarized, House Republicans pushed through a bill to reinstitute it. Rep. Chris Kannady (R-Oklahoma City) authored an amendment to another bill in order to get the change pushed through. SB210 allows voters to attach a</span><a href="https://www.publicradiotulsa.org/post/oklahoma-house-advances-bill-reinstitute-notarization-requirement-absentee-ballots"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> photocopy of their state ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or voter registration card to their absentee ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic instead of having it notarized. All House Democrats and three Republicans voted against the bill, which now goes to the Senate.</span></p>

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC); the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed the lawsuit on behalf of several plaintiffs, including four voters with medical conditions that would leave them vulnerable to COVID-19 if required to vote in-person. The lawsuit seeks to overturn requirements that a notary or two witnesses sign an absentee ballot. Attorneys call it an “unreasonable requirement,” particularly for those who live alone. Plaintiffs also seek to suspend a requirement that voters include a photocopy of their personal identification with ballots and to allow curbside voting, in which individuals can cast a vote at a polling place in their car. The lawsuit names Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey; Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and 4 county election officials as defendants.</span></p>

The lawsuit challenges state laws and procedures that include requiring elections supervisors to receive vote-by-mail ballots by 7 p.m. on election night for the ballots to count. The lawsuit argues that ballots should be valid so long as they are postmarked on or before Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Florida, after a week and a half of testimony, the</span><a href="https://www.wlrn.org/post/federal-judge-says-he-will-rule-against-florida-voting-rights-case#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ex-felon voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trial wrapped up with U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle signaling that he will rule on the side of the plaintiffs. In 2018 voters overwhelming approved Amendment 4 with reinstated the voting rights to former felons after they had completed the terms of their service. In 2019 the state Legislature approved a bill requiring all ex-felons to repay all fees, fines and restitution before their voting rights may be restored. Plaintiffs argue that the new law is a modern-day poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ruled that</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/judge-upholds-postage-requirement-georgia-ballots-for-june-primary/HjCC1CsCIsL9sClLZ83hmJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring postage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on mailed absentee ballots for the June primary is not an unconstitutional poll tax on Georgia voters, but she said she will consider changes in future elections. Totenberg said that removing the postage requirement would be difficult for the state to implement so close to the June 9 primary and confusing to voters who had already received their absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Iowa:</strong> A judge has ruled the</span><a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2020/05/01/judge-requires-at-least-5-polling-sites-in-woodbury-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> number of polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Woodbury County for the Primary Election on Tuesday, June 2nd, and a special election Tuesday, July 7th must be increased from two to a minimum of five. The judge also ordered Woodbury County Auditor Patrick Gill to establish a polling place in each of the five state representative districts in Woodbury County. Gill says that’s a workable compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michigan:</strong> Michigan election officials agreed to allow</span><a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/election-officials-agree-allow-visually-impaired-voters-use-software-absentee-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visually impaired voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use software to complete an absentee ballot in local elections this week. The deal filed in federal court last week is a temporary fix in an ongoing lawsuit. Voters with visual impairments will have an opportunity to request an absentee ballot typically reserved for military personnel or citizens who are out of the country. The ballots can be completed using electronic reader software. They still must be mailed or delivered to local clerks. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says she&#8217;s confident a long-term solution can be found.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>New York</strong>: In a 30-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres wrote that the plaintiffs, which included former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, had presented a credible argument on the basis of constitutional rights and that New York should reinstate it’s</span><a href="https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Federal-judge-orders-officials-to-restore-New-15249514.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presidential primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scheduled for June 23.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A group of voters backed by Democratic legal groups sued North Carolina seeking to loosen rules around</span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article242482266.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee mail-in ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amid predictions that the coronavirus pandemic will make voting by mail a widespread practice. They want the state to provide prepaid postage on all absentee ballots, change a requirement for two witnesses to sign a ballot, extend the deadline for receipt of ballots until nine days after Election Day and give voters a chance to fix signature discrepancies before election officials reject those ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5490" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ND-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Dakota</strong>: A group behind a</span><a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/crime-and-courts/6479983-Group-behind-proposed-ballot-measure-sues-North-Dakota-wants-to-collect-e-signatures-during-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed voting rights ballot measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a lawsuit against North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger, arguing that petition circulators should be allowed to collect signatures online during the coronavirus pandemic. The plaintiffs, which include former first lady Jane Sinner and a Fargo-based organization called North Dakota Voters First, contend that the state law requiring petition circulators to collect necessary signatures in-person is unrealistic and dangerous as the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to affect the state. The group would need to submit at least 26,904 signatures from qualified voters by July 6 to get the measure on the Nov. 3 general election ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Monday</span><a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5661626/oklahoma-supreme-court-strikes-notary-requirement-for-absentee-ballots"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struck down a requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that absentee ballots must be notarized to be valid. An order issued Monday by Chief Justice Noma Gurich bars the Oklahoma State Election Board from issuing ballot forms or other election materials that suggest notarization is required. Instead, a statement signed, dated and declared under the penalty of perjury will suffice on absentee ballots. The order from the state&#8217;s high court requires the State Election Board to recognize the signed statements as proof that said voter did fill out their own ballot.</span></p>

Supreme Court where Democrats are seeking a high court ruling to</span><a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article242376981.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The SC GOP simply wants a seat at the table to ensure all stakeholders have a voice in this matter of public interest and importance,” the Republican Party lawyers said in their motion.  The Supreme Court has not yet said whether it will hear the case — a move called original jurisdiction —without sending it to a lower court first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third lawsuit seeking to expand all voters’ rights to</span><a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article242443566.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote absentee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Carolina’s June 9 primary and November general election was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Columbia. This lawsuit — brought by the Democratic National Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee and the S.C. Democratic Party — is the third in two weeks seeking expanded absentee ballot rights. The lawsuit alleges that racial bias in S.C. laws and history make it difficult for African Americans to vote, especially during the threat of the coronavirus pandemic. It’s also the second suit filed by the DCCC the S.C. Democratic Party, which a week earlier filed a suit with the S.C. State Supreme Court asking for an expansion of mail-in voting along with two S.C. Democratic candidates running in contested primaries in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tennessee:</strong> A coalition of Tennessee nonprofits sued the state in an effort to expand access to</span><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/05/02/tennessee-groups-sue-expand-absentee-voting-amid-covid-19-pandemic/3071613001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> absentee voting and mail-in ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tennessee&#8217;s limits on voting by mail force voters to &#8220;choose between risking their health by voting in person, or forgoing their right to vote entirely,&#8221; the federal lawsuit stated. &#8220;Tennessee voters must be permitted to cast their ballots without subjecting themselves to unnecessary exposure to a pandemic disease.&#8221; The plaintiffs called on a judge to ease absentee voting restrictions, which they called unconstitutional. The lawsuit also challenged laws that can disqualify some absentee ballots and limit groups&#8217; abilities to help people get mail-in ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Texas:</strong> The Texas Democratic Party has asked a court to order state officials — specifically the state’s attorney general —</span><a href="https://www.tpr.org/post/texas-democrats-ask-court-stop-attorney-general-ken-paxtons-threats-over-mail-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not to interfere with a previous court order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that opened up mail-in voting. In their filing Tuesday with the Third Court of Appeals, lawyers accused the state of thrusting voters and local election officials into “legal limbo” by contradicting the earlier ruling. In its filing, the Texas Democratic Party said the court needs to step in to ensure counties and voters do not fear applying for and processing vote-by-mail applications. “The State has taken the extraordinary action of publicly disregarding an order from a coequal branch of the government, asserting that its view of the Texas Election Code, which was rejected by the trial court, is law of the land and threatening those who follow the trial court’s interpretation with prosecution,” lawyers wrote in their motion. “This includes calling into question the validity of the injunction within Travis County and intimidating Travis County voters.”</span></p>

With the court decision, the towns of Lovettsville, Middleburg and Purcellville will now hold their municipal elections to Thursday, June 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Virginia, a judge has</span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/42093844/judge-approves-absentee-ballot-witness-signature-agreement-for-june-primary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved an agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the state and the League of Women Voters that will allow voters to submit and absentee ballot without a witness signature. The judge writes that “applying the witness requirement during this pandemic would impose a serious burden on the right to vote, particularly among the elderly, immunocompromised, and other at-risk populations. Weighed against those risks, the present record reflects the likelihood that the burden would not be justified by the witness requirement’s purpose as an anti-fraud measure.” Under the agreement, the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections will be required to take “additional reasonable steps” to make sure people know the witness requirement will not be enforced for voters who think they cannot safely have a witness present.</span></p>

							<h2>VVSG 2.0 Public Comment Period</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is taking important steps to advance the development of the next generation of federal voting system standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0, or VVSG 2.0. These steps include sharing the recommended VVSG 2.0 Requirements with the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review, launching a 90-day public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4448" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Seal_of_the_United_States_Election_Assistance_Commission.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each step toward final approval of VVSG 2.0 is another step toward improving election security. The final VVSG requirements will enable manufacturers to develop updated, improved, accessible, and secure voting technology. The process to gather feedback from our stakeholders is critical to completing this process,&#8221; added EAC Chairman Ben Hovland, who has served as the EAC&#8217;s designated federal official for the TGDC for the past year. &#8220;We look forward to getting input from our Board of Advisors and Standards Board, and to hear from the public through the hearings and public comments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2020/02/10/tgdc-advances-vvsg-20-approval-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements. The recommended requirements, developed with the support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were submitted to the EAC’s Acting Executive Director on March 9, 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, the EAC submitted the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements to the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC has initiated a 90-day public comment period on the VVSG 2.0 Requirements, which will run through June 22, 2020. Those who wish to review the</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=EAC-2020-0002-0001&amp;contentType=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Requirements document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as recommended by the TGDC, and submit comments may do so via</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EAC-2020-0002-0001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulations.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioners are expected to consider the VVSG 2.0 for adoption following their review of feedback provided by the Standards Board and Board of Advisors on the proposed VVSG 2.0 Requirements, as well as testimony and comments provided during public hearings and the public comment period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon adoption, VVSG 2.0 would be the fifth iteration of national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 offers a new approach to the organization of the guidelines and seeks to address the next generation of voting equipment. It contains new and expanded material in many areas, including reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of the VVSG 2.0 Requirements follows efforts in recent years to advance the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines, which are 15 principles and related guidelines that form the core of VVSG 2.0 and are supported by the Requirements. The TGDC provided the EAC with recommendations on the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines in September 2017. The EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors recommended the VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines for adoption in April 2018. The EAC solicited public comments on the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VVSG 2.0 Principles and Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to June 2019, and held three public hearings on them in April and May 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) establishes three federal advisory committees that support the EAC in its work: the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), the Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TGDC assists the EAC in developing the VVSG. The chairperson of the TGDC is the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TGDC is composed of 14 other members appointed jointly by EAC and the director of NIST, including state and local election officials, individuals with technical and scientific expertise in voting systems, and representatives from the Access Board, American National Standards Institute, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards Board and Board of Advisors advise the EAC on various matters, including the development of the VVSG. The Standards Board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. HAVA prohibits any two members representing the same state to be members of the same political party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Advisors consists of 37 members, as specified by HAVA. Members include two people appointed by each of the following groups: National Governors Association; National Conference of State Legislatures; National Association of Secretaries of State; The National Association of State Election Directors; National Association of Counties; The National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials and Clerks; The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Election Center; International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Other members include representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Integrity, and the Civil Rights Division; the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance Program; four professionals from the field of science and technology, one each appointed by the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate; and eight members representing voter interests, with the chairs and the ranking minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration and the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration each appointing two members.</span></p>
