							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Nonpartisan Poll Worker Standards</strong><br />
<em>U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence releases voluntary standards for public comment</em></p>
<p>The nonpartisan U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence, a collaborative that is working on a voluntary, nonpartisan set of standards designed by election officials to ensure that local election officials are following best practices in areas like poll workers, security and communications, has released its first standards for public comment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8253" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ElectionExcellence-300x126.png" alt="" width="300" height="126" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ElectionExcellence-300x126.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ElectionExcellence.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Alliance poll worker standards were developed based on feedback from nearly 50 election departments that serve 30.5 million voters. The departments range in size from serving 988 voters to as many as 4.7 million voters.</p>
<p>“Poll workers often have many different names in places across the country, but whatever they might be called, they are the engine that makes voting happen in jurisdictions large and small,” said Tiana Epps-Johnson, founder and executive director of the Center for Tech and Civic Life. “Attracting and retaining qualified poll workers is more challenging than ever. These new standards can help serve as a roadmap for jurisdictions to make sure they are following best practices as they think about their poll worker programs. We look forward to hearing from election departments while the standards are open for feedback. ”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5781" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HealthyElections-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />&#8220;The simple reality is that you just can&#8217;t have a successful election without a strong poll worker operation,&#8221; said Pam Anderson, former Jefferson County Colorado Clerk and the 2022 Republican nominee for Secretary of State in Colorado. “By starting on poll worker management, the Alliance is tackling one of the key challenges all election departments face. These nonpartisan standards are an invaluable tool for election departments that want to improve how they recruit and manage poll workers. Voters everywhere will benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We the Veterans and Military Families was proud to help more than 63,000 veterans and military families sign up with Vet the Vote and volunteer to serve their community as poll workers in the 2022 elections,” said Ellen Gustafson, executive director, We the Veterans. “These nonpartisan poll worker standards will make the poll worker experience better for poll workers and voters alike. We look forward to seeing jurisdictions around the country adopt these kind of poll worker standards to continue to improve the voting experience for all Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellence in poll worker programs is important because of the critical role that poll workers play in helping voters cast their ballot – one reason the Alliance prioritized poll workers as the first voluntary, nonpartisan standards for release. The poll worker standards define excellence for poll worker programs by focusing on the four areas of recruitment, training, management, and retention.</p>
<p>Key recommendations of the poll worker standards include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poll worker recruitment</strong><br />
Your election department recruits enough poll workers with the skills and competencies to successfully support voters in casting their ballots.</li>
<li><strong>Poll worker training </strong><br />
Your election department delivers training that helps poll workers understand and conduct their responsibilities, equips them with the resources to find answers to their questions, and sets expectations of professionalism.</li>
<li><strong>Poll worker management</strong><br />
Your election office manages poll workers by efficiently maintaining information, communicating effectively, and facilitating compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Poll worker retention</strong><br />
Your election office supports retention of competent poll workers and honors their civic contribution by providing a positive poll worker experience, making poll workers feel appreciated, and incorporating feedback on their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>View more about the standard on the<a href="https://www.electionexcellence.org"> Alliance website.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://form.jotform.com/232673834309158">The election community is invited to share feedback on the standards here.</a> The deadline for feedback is Dec. 5.</p>
<p>The U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence is a nonpartisan collaborative that is bringing together election officials, designers, technologists, and other experts to envision, support, and celebrate excellence in U.S. election administration. The collaborative is led by the Center for Tech and Civic Life.</p>

							<h2>Election Workforce Advisory Council</h2>
														<p><strong>New council will cultivate a resilient elections workforce</strong></p>
<p>This week, the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/policy-area/elections/"> Bipartisan Policy Center</a>, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group,</a> an elections consulting partnership, announced the formation of the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/ewac/"> Election Workforce Advisory Council</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“We are excited to have assembled  a diverse group of election officials, experts, academics, and industry representatives in this council,” said Rachel Orey, senior associate director at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “This is a multi-faceted effort to study, develop, and implement best practices that will meaningfully improve recruitment, retention, and training within election administration in the long term.”</p>
<p>Experienced elections officials are resigning or retiring at record rates, and state and local governments are struggling to replace them. “Without intervention, we risk reaching a point at which elections are administered and staffed by a wave of new officials grappling with the complexities of their role while operating under intense public scrutiny,”  said Noah Praetz, president, The Elections Group.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7828" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-300x136.png" alt="" width="300" height="136" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-300x136.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-768x349.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Even for experienced officials, new challenges require new competencies,” added Jennifer Morrell, chief executive officer, The Elections Group. “With the 2024 presidential election fast approaching, we must act now to support this mission-critical workforce and preserve public trust in elections for years to come.”</p>
<p>The Election Workforce Advisory Council will leverage the combined expertise of its members to develop a sustainable talent pipeline, preserve institutional knowledge, and improve job performance and satisfaction – all to ensure that elections are run by experienced professionals. The first initiative of the council is an<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/request-for-proposals-research-on-the-election-administration-workforce/"> academic grant program</a> designed to generate new research findings to inform and enhance these efforts.</p>
<p>The council’s collective expertise will provide a holistic perspective to inform research, generate new solutions, and serve as a central convening ground for this critical work.</p>
<p>The first initiative of the council is an<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/request-for-proposals-research-on-the-election-administration-workforce/"> academic grant program</a> designed to generate new research findings to inform and enhance these efforts. There is $500,000 available to support research projects, hoping to lay the empirical foundation to solve election workforce challenges in the long term. Please share the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/request-for-proposals-research-on-the-election-administration-workforce/"> RFP</a> with any researchers you think may be interested; letters of intent are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>due by November 20</strong></span>.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-10022" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LA2023IVotedSticker-288x300.png" alt="" width="241" height="251" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LA2023IVotedSticker-288x300.png 288w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LA2023IVotedSticker-768x801.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LA2023IVotedSticker.png 794w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" />Geaux Vote</strong>: Louisiana held primary elections this past weekend. The race to replace outgoing<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/14/secretary-of-state/"> Secretary of State</a> Kyle Ardoin (R) is headed to a November 18th runoff. In that contest, Republican Nancy Landry will face Democrat Gwen Collins-Greenup. Landry and Collins-Greenup both polled 19% of the vote, just ahead of the third-place finisher, Public Service Commissioner Mike Francis, a Republican, at 18%.  Landry, a former state lawmaker from Lafayette, currently serves as first assistant and second in command to Ardoin, who chose not to seek reelection, since 2019. Collins-Greenup is a Baton Rouge attorney and accountant who previously ran for the office in 2018. The pair emerged from a crowded race of candidates that also included three other Republicans  as well as longtime Orleans Parish Clerk of Court Arthur Morrell, a Democrat, and no-party candidate Amanda Smith Jennings. Also on the ballot was<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/14/louisiana-amendments/"> Amendment 1</a>. The amendment, which was overwhelmingly approved by voters,  prohibits the use of private donations to conduct elections, though the ballot language framed the proposal as a way to stop foreign countries from corrupting local election officials. Its genesis is an unsubstantiated election conspiracy theory that prompted Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and other conservatives to block parish election officials from receiving charitable donations to pay for tents, signs, hand sanitizer and other items needed for the 2020 elections, the first held during the COVID-19 pandemic. While outside money from non-governmental agencies has been banned by a number of state Legislatures, Louisiana becomes the first state to put it before the voters as a constitutional amendment. A vote recount has been requested in the race for Livingston Parish Sheriff that saw incumbent Sheriff Jason Ard win by just 115 votes. While the recount will include taking another look at all votes cast, it will primarily involve recounting the nearly 2,100 paper mail-in ballots received for that particular race,<a href="https://www.wafb.com/2023/10/16/recount-requested-livingston-sheriffs-race/"> Livingston Parish</a> Clerk of Court Jason Harris said. The<a href="https://www.klfy.com/your-local-election-hq/what-happens-when-an-election-ends-in-a-tie/"> St. Martin Parish</a> District 1 council member race between Republicans Byron Fuselier and Hoyt Louviere resulted in a tie at 899 votes for each candidate. St. Martin Parish Clerk of Court Becky Patin says she has never seen a race go to a tie like this in all of her years in the position. She says a recount is necessary. After polls closed in <a href="https://www.katc.com/news/national-politics/america-votes/what-happened-in-vermillion-parish-on-election-night">Vermillion Parish</a> Vermillion Parish Clerk Diane Meaux Broussard encountered some technical difficulties that turned tallying the votes into quite the challenge. &#8220;People were so anxious for this election,” said Broussard, “you know we had some big things going on, and just wish it would&#8217;ve been different.&#8221; Due to technical issues with 17 voter cartridges, Vermilion staff spent nearly four hours hand-tallying votes on election night.</p>

The newest Democracy Map tracks laws that prohibit the knowing dissemination of disinformation about the time, place, and manner of conducting elections. This applies to false or misleading information about the qualifications or restrictions related to voter eligibility. Only 11 states have laws that explicitly protect against election disinformation – false information that is intentionally created to cause harm. Just over a quarter of voters (28%) live in a state with these protections in place. Since 2020, three states have adopted these new protections: Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia. Pennsylvania is the only battleground state with explicit protections against disinformation.  These types of policies prohibit the knowing dissemination of disinformation about the time, place, and manner of conducting elections, as well false or misleading information about the qualifications or restrictions related to voter eligibility. Disinformation laws generally work by imposing criminal penalties on anyone who intentionally spreads false information about elections. Some states also provide private rights of action for voters to whom the false information is directed.</p>

IHS Deputy Director Benjamin Smith, a member of the Navajo Nation, applauded this milestone in Phoenix. “As part of this effort, President Biden pledged to designate five Indian Health Service voter registration pilot sites by the end of this calendar year,” said Smith. “So, we are honored to be here and celebrate NATIVE HEALTH as the first to gain National Voter Registration Act designation under the Indian Health Service in alignment with the president’s vision.” Native communities have historically avoided participating in elections. Frequent address changes and the use of P.O. boxes also make voting difficult. President Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021, urging his federal agencies to address these access-related barriers and hurdles. “In our democracy, every individual voice must count, particularly when those voices have for a long time been kept down,” said Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes. More than a third of Native Americans — about 1.2 million adults — are not registered to vote. And since nearly 3 million of them nationwide rely on IHS annually, the Biden administration believes: “The designation empowers NATIVE HEALTH to assist individuals in the voter registration process, making it easier for eligible citizens to exercise their right to vote,” as Fontes read his proclamation. Next year marks the 100th anniversary of the Indian Citizenship Act, which granted Native Americans the right to vote.</p>

The design may also be used in other promotional materials for the Elections Department. A panel of judges selected four finalists from 153 community design submissions in August. Residents voted on their favorite of those designs in September, with 837 total votes being cast in the contest. Denson’s dome design received around 38% of the votes. Three cheers to<a href="https://www.koaa.com/news/covering-colorado/i-voted-stickers-for-all-voters-in-el-paso-county"> El Paso County, Colorado</a> which will be including “I Voted” stickers in this year’s mail ballots. El Paso County Elections Director, Angie Leath said the county always received calls from mail voters about how they could get a sticker and now they will. “People hold that with the highest regard, and it&#8217;s just a way for them to show hey, I&#8217;ve done my civic duty, I&#8217;ve engaged, my voice is heard, so this is what my sticker represents,” said El Paso County Deputy Chief Clerk and Recorder, Kristi Ridlen.</p>

The report outlines studies that expose the dangers of internet voting and highlights alternatives that promote voter enfranchisement—while safeguarding our elections. Highlights include: Democracy depends on citizens&#8217; trust in our elections, the ability to cast a ballot without obstacles, and having solid evidence that the winner won and the loser lost. Notable consensus studies on internet voting all show that its adoption threatens the validity of our elections, and widespread usage could compromise our elections at scale. There are better options for voters that prioritize voter enfranchisement and preserve a voter’s right to a secret ballot. Safeguarding the democratic process and public confidence is paramount. Section I summarizes notable consensus studies on internet voting, all determining that its adoption threatens the validity of our elections, and widespread usage could compromise our elections at scale. Privacy concerns arise from the challenge of maintaining both voter anonymity and verification of a voter’s identity. An election’s integrity could be compromised by malicious actors intercepting, altering, deleting—or even claiming to alter—online ballots. Section II highlights the importance of accessible elections and prioritizing voter enfranchisement while preserving a voter’s right to a secret ballot. It proposes seven options that jurisdictions could implement to serve voters who traditionally experience hardship when voting remotely: Provide Remote Accessible Vote-by-Mail Options; Improve Options for Military and Overseas Voters; Bring Voting Devices Directly to Voters; Make All Voting Locations Fully Accessible; Ensure Accessible Equipment is Available and Functioning; Make Improvements to Ballot Marking Device Design and Deployment; and Provide Transportation to Voting Locations.</p>

Author Vanessa Williamson examines the major forms of democratic decline in U.S. governing institutions including election manipulation, expansion of executive power, and efforts to erode the independence of the civil service, finding that the health of our democracy has been in decline since far before the 2020 election. Key findings from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 2010, state legislatures have instituted laws intended to reduce voters’ access to the ballot, politicize election administration, and foreclose electoral competition via extreme gerrymandering.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court has increased its authority over election adjudication, narrowed the scope of voting rights protections, and seems inclined to support some politicization of executive branch administration.</li>
<li>Hyperpartisanship and gridlock leave Congress poorly positioned to provide checks on executive and judicial power.</li>

Gavin Newsom (D) has<a href="https://www.kalw.org/politics-government/2023-10-13/newsom-signs-bill-aimed-at-increasing-voter-participation"> signed several elections-related bills into law</a>. Among the new laws is AB 545, which mandates that curbside voting be available at all polling places. The law also requires tables at polling places to display handheld magnifying glasses and signature cards, which help people with vision issues sign their name efficiently. AB 626 lets voters return a mail-in ballot at a polling place and have it processed like a normal ballot, which will expedite the counting of those ballots. Under the previous law, vote-by-mail ballots had a signature verification process in which the return ballot&#8217;s signature is compared to one on file, a process that takes longer than the on-the-spot checks at polling places. Other bills impacting voting and elections that are now law are AB 292, which provides a clearer explanation to voters with no party preference on which partisan ballots they can request to participate in for those parties&#8217; primaries – without changing party affiliation. There is also AB 398, which allows for electronic and telephone-based requests for replacement ballots, and AB 773, a bill related to elections filings. Gail Pellerin (D-Santa Cruz),chair of the Assembly Elections Committee and a former Santa Cruz County clerk, the position that administers elections authored the bills.</p>

The San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 on Tuesday to oppose implementing the Voter’s Choice Act, which would have reduced the number of polling places and created voting centers during the election season. Supervisor Paul Canepa, who represents North Stockton on the board, cast the dissenting vote, stating the county should leave the door open to using the VCA model. “I don’t know that closing the door on this is a necessity at this point,” he said. “I think, we’re going to do our own model&#8230; I don’t know if we table this or just say no to the VCA. I think going forward, you need to leave every option available.” But Supervisor Steve Ding, who represents Lodi and the surrounding unincorporated areas of the county on the board, said the VCA was actually anti-choice, forcing voters to cast their ballots by mail by removing neighborhood polling places. Ding said the county needs to focus on getting voters out of their homes and into the community during election seasons, as it helps create a sense of community.</p>

The newly-introduced Senate Bill 173 would add election workers to that exempt list. In an internal Senate memo, the bill’s sponsors, Democratic Sen. Bill Demora, of Columbus, and Republican Sen. Theresa Gavarone, of Bowling Green, said the bill would let elections workers focus on their job rather than worry about their family’s safety. “Given the increasing polarization of our society, we have seen the dangers that our election workers face,” the memo says. Demora said he got the idea for the bill in August, when he attended a conference by the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan trade group for lawmakers in Ohio and other states. The involvement of Gavarone, who is close with GOP leadership, gives the bill a better chance of advancing in the Republican-dominated legislature. “This is not a partisan bill. Its meant to protect our elections officials, who are overworked and underpaid,” Demora said. Aaron Ockerman, executive director of the Ohio Association of Elections Officials, said he hasn’t spoken with Demora or Gavarone about the bill. But, he said he’s “appreciative of any effort to help protect elections officials.”</p>

In separate statements, state Senate leadership said the matter was “closed” and House leadership called it “unresolvable.” The breakdown comes after months of back and forth between legislative leaders to try to agree on a new date and after escalating stress at the county level over the uncertainty of the election schedule. A bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators with gubernatorial backing first recommended moving the primary at the beginning of the year, both so it wouldn’t conflict with Passover and so the state’s election would take place earlier in the presidential primary cycle.  But the two chambers could not agree on a new date, and last-minute amendments to one of the two primary bills tanked the effort entirely. In September, the GOP-controlled state Senate sent a proposal to the House with large bipartisan support that would have moved the date to March 19.  A competing bill in the state House, where Democrats have a one-vote majority, set the date for April 2. Its primary sponsor, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D., Philadelphia), said it would give election directors more time while not shortening the window for candidates to submit petitions to get on the ballot as the Senate bill would have. The state House eventually agreed to take up the state Senate’s March 19 bill, but when it did, lawmakers from both parties added several amendments. The amendments, which had not been discussed with Senate leadership, included expanded voter ID, pre-canvassing, and an elimination of the date requirement for mail ballots. With those additional amendments, the state House voted down the Senate bill by a wide bipartisan margin. The chamber passed the April 2 proposal along party lines and sent it to the Senate. But it was dead on arrival. However, at press time, there<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/pa-primary-scheduling-saga-lands-on-april-16-proposal/"> seemed to be consensus</a> to move the primary to April 16. The House approved that measure on October 18, but Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) quickly released a statement evening saying that the House’s effort was<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/confusion-and-delay-bring-unsuccessful-end-in-bid-to-move-pennsylvanias-presidential-primary/"> too little, too late</a> and repeating his earlier admonition that the matter was closed in the upper chamber.</p>
<p>Legislation that would<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/bills-to-open-pennsylvanias-primary-elections-to-independent-voters-pass-in-state-house-committee/"> open Pennsylvania’s primary elections</a> to roughly 1.2 million voters who aren’t registered with a political party passed in a state House committee. Two identical bills, one<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=979"> sponsored by a Democrat</a> and one<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=976"> by a Republican</a>, would allow voters who have no party affiliation to choose which party’s primary ballot they want to vote on when they go to the polls. Pennsylvania is one of only nine states with closed primaries. Advocates for open primaries have argued that the current system disenfranchises groups including about 400,000 Pennsylvania veterans and nearly two-thirds of young adults who have no strong fealty to a single political party. Although the legislation is bipartisan, Republicans on the House State Government Committee voted against the bills after some said they opposed the idea of allowing people who are not members of a party to vote for that party’s nominees. Rep. Brad Roae (R-Crawford), the ranking Republican on the committee, also expressed concern about the timing of the legislation, which would take effect immediately if it is passed by the full House, Senate and signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro.</p>

Despite the claims that electronic voting machines are susceptible to hacking, a three-judge panel found that Lake’s speculative claims were insufficient to establish injury. “Plaintiffs’ candidacies failed at the polls, and their various attempts to overturn the election outcome in state court have to date been unavailing,” the panel wrote in its<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lake-v-fontes-ninth-circuit-opinion.pdf"> order</a>. The candidates claimed in their April 2022<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lake-Finchem-v-Arizona.pdf"> complaint</a> that electronic voter machines are susceptible to hacking by nongovernmental actors intending to influence election results. They said the machines have a history of failure both in Arizona and abroad, arguing that hand-counting paper ballots is the only reliable and trustworthy method. They also contend Dominion Voting Systems lied and ignored a state legislative subpoena inquiring about the data relating to the 2020 presidential election in Arizona. Dominion wasn’t named as a defendant. U.S. District Judge John Tucci disagreed,<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-gop-candidates-lose-bid-to-ban-exploitable-voting-machines/"> dismissing the case</a> a month later for<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AZHobbs.pdf"> lack of standing and failure to state a claim</a>. “We agree with the district court that plaintiffs’ speculative allegations that voting machines may be hackable are insufficient to establish an injury,” the panel wrote. The panel acknowledged experts in Lake’s case who claimed that the machines are hackable, but reminded that neither she nor her legal team presented evidence of past interference. “And, on appeal, counsel for plaintiffs conceded that their arguments were limited to potential future hacking, and not based on any past harm,” the panel wrote.  The panel ruled that Lake and Finchem lost legal standing for their claims as candidates when they lost the election, and lack standing as citizens for their failure to either a past injury or injury that is “imminent or substantially likely to occur.”</p>
<p>Cochise County supervisors and the county recorder had<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/10/18/arizona-appeals-court-rejects-cochise-countys-stance-on-ballot-hand-counts/71233529007/"> no authority to attempt to hand count all ballots cast in the 2022 general election</a>, the state Court of Appeals ruled this week. The ruling from the three-judge panel upholds a decision from a Pima County Superior Court judge that was issued nearly a year ago, a day before the statewide election. The court concluded the county got ahead of itself when it insisted it could move to a full hand count immediately after the election and ignore the procedure outlined in state law. &#8220;The county was required to follow the procedures mandated by the plain language of (the law), which creates a gradual, multi-step process that must be satisfied before a jurisdiction-wide hand-count audit of all precinct or early ballots may occur,&#8221; Judge Michael Kelly of the Tucson-based court wrote. Judges Sean Brearcliffe and Peter Eckerstrom concurred. Cochise County officials had told the judges they intended to hand count future election results as long as the lower-court ruling was reversed. Brian Blehm, who represented supervisors Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd, said he had not seen the ruling and could not comment. The decision could freeze the county&#8217;s intent to hand count future elections, including next year&#8217;s presidential race, attorneys with the Democracy Docket noted in a news release on the ruling.</p>

Matis<a href="https://michiganadvance.com/blog/judge-denies-motion-to-disqualify-prosecutor-and-dismiss-indictment-in-voting-machines-case/"> denied a motion</a> to disqualify Special Prosecutor DJ Hilson and dismiss the indictment as part of the case against attorneys Matthew DePerno and Stefanie Lambert Junttila and former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City). DePerno — the 2022 GOP attorney general nominee — Lambert Junttila and Rendon were each indicted as part of an investigation into potential tampering. Attorney Michael J. Smith, who represents Lambert Junttila, filed the motion citing a law that bars attorneys from prosecuting or aiding in the prosecution of a person for an alleged criminal offense where he is engaged or interested in any civil suit or proceeding depending upon the same state of facts against such person directly or indirectly. Smith argued that the facts used in the indictment against Lambert Junttila were the same facts used in a declaratory judgment requested by Hilson earlier this year, in an effort to clarify the law surrounding undue possession of a voting machine. After considering arguments from Smith, and Heather Bloomquist, who wrote the special prosecution’s response to the motion, Matis determined that the indictment and the declaratory judgment did not deal with the same state of facts, and denied the motion. “I ultimately don’t believe that it was dependent upon the same state of facts,” Matis said. “[The declaratory judgment] was a legal question.”  While the case was scheduled to proceed to pretrial following the hearing on the motion, Matis scheduled another pretrial date in anticipation of additional motions filed by the defendants.</p>

Ingham County Prosecutor John Dewane said Theodore Lawson’s slaying Sunday does not appear to be connected to his political activities or beliefs. Lawson, 63, was a member of Ingham County’s Board of Canvassers and served as secretary of the county’s Democratic Party. Lansing police have not released any details around the circumstances of the shooting, but Lansing City Council at-large candidate Trini Lopez Pehlivanoglu told the Lansing State Journal that Lawson was knocking on doors for her campaign when he was shot. He later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Lansing Police Dept. Chief Ellery Sosebee said in a statement that Lawson’s murder was &#8220;senseless&#8221; and &#8220;speaks to the careless mindset of a very small section of our most violent offenders.&#8221; The 15-year-old who was charged with murder also faces gun charges. A probable cause conference has been scheduled for Oct. 20.</p>

Quinn wrote in two orders issued last week that the new law is &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; and the defendants are prohibited from &#8220;registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to vote.&#8221; &#8220;To do so is a criminal act which can be investigated, charged, and prosecuted in the normal course,&#8221; his order continues. Quinn&#8217;s office could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Quinn ordered probation for April Weyaus and Emilio Trevino following sentencing hearings on Oct. 12. The order barring them from voting was issued as a supplement to his sentencing order. Attorney General Keith Ellison and Secretary of State Steve Simon, said in a joint statement they will oppose the orders, which they said the judge issued &#8220;without prompting.&#8221; &#8220;The orders have no statewide impact, and should not create fear, uncertainty, or doubt. In Minnesota, if you are over 18, a U.S. citizen, a resident of Minnesota for at least 20 days, and not currently incarcerated, you are eligible to vote. Period,&#8221; they said in the statement. &#8220;It is critically important that everyone whose rights were restored understands that they are welcome in our democracy.&#8221;</p>

The Gateway Pundit, founded by brothers Jim and Joe Hoft, was sued for defamation and emotional distress by Freeman and Moss in 2021. They contend the right-wing site published debunked stories accusing them of election fraud that resulted in threats of violence, many tinged with racial slurs. Freeman and Moss’ attorneys say the Hofts have “repeatedly delayed discovery in this matter,” including by “failing to comply with the court’s discovery orders; failing to abide by their discovery obligations… and filing not just an improper counterclaim but also several meritless motions.” The Hofts argue that any stories published by the Gateway Pundit regarding Freeman and Moss were “either statements of opinion based on disclosed facts or statements of rhetorical hyperbole that no reasonable reader is likely to interpret as a literal statement of fact.” Rhetorical hyperbole, the Hofts argue, “cannot form the basis of defamation and related tort claims.”</p>

The grand jury’s review of Corine Sheldon’s actions comes a year after the attorney general’s office served a grand jury subpoena on Rensselaer County seeking a trove of absentee ballot documents that were handled in 2021 by county Operations Director Richard W. Crist and Jim Gordon, the county’s director of purchasing. Sheldon recently submitted her resignation notice and her last day on the job will be Oct. 31. The attorney general’s investigation of Sheldon centers on whether she allegedly knowingly certified election results in the Working Families Party primary for county executive two years ago that she knew had erroneously undercounted the number of votes secured by incumbent County Executive Steve McLaughlin’s Democratic challenger, Gwen Wright.</p>

Divis registered to vote in his home county, and then registered again and voted in adjacent Colfax County. In August, a jury<a href="https://www.1011now.com/2023/10/12/columbus-man-gets-maximum-fine-election-fraud-case-involving-claim-that-he-lived-richland/"> found him guilty of election falsification, a Class IV felony</a>. The conviction carried a maximum fine of $10,000 as well as a prison sentence of up to two years. An investigation by the Nebraska State Patrol found that Divis, his son Jason Divis and his daughter-in-law Carina Divis all resided in Platte County and had registered to vote there, but then also registered to vote and did vote in Colfax County during the 2020 general election. According to prosecutors, Divis had become angry with the members of the village board in Richland, a community in Colfax County where Divis owned several properties. The town board had passed an ordinance pertaining to junk on lots and nuisance properties, the newspaper reported. In October 2020, Divis falsely attested that he was a resident of Richland and registered to vote in Colfax County, where he cast a vote in the November 2020 general election. Carina Divis was sentenced to one year of probation after a one-day bench trial in July, according to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Jason Divis was also sentenced to 1oneyear of probation after agreeing to plead no contest to the charge.</p>

Roy Cooper (D) sued the State of North Carolina, the President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate and the Speaker of the North Carolina House, claiming that the North Carolina General Assembly<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/north-carolina-governor-sues-lawmakers-over-measure-eliminating-his-authority-over-elections-board/"> limited his constitutional duties as governor</a> and violated the constitutional separation of powers. In a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gov-cooper-v-berger-complaint-north-carolina.pdf"> suit</a> the governor said that the General Assembly shows “flagrant disregard” for constitutional principles and established precedents.  “Like Gollum reaching for the One Ring, legislative defendants are possessed by the power it brings. When it comes to seizing control of the enforcement of the state’s election laws, neither the clear rulings of the Supreme Court, nor the overwhelming vote of the people, will deter them,” Cooper said in the suit. Last week, the primarily Republican general assembly overturned five of Cooper’s vetoes and passed the bills into law. Session Law 2023-139, previously Senate Bill 749, removed Cooper’s ability to fill positions on the Board of Elections, which had five seats, and instead granted that ability to Speaker of the House of Representatives Philip Berger, President Pro Tempore of the Senate Timothy Moore, and the minority leaders of the House and Senate. A 2018 constitutional amendment proposed to voters had sought to create a bipartisan board of elections, restricting the number of appointees by the governor to two and reducing the board to four seats. North Carolina voters voted against the amendment in the 2018 election.  Cooper argues that the State Board of Elections is an executive branch agency and that the responsibilities of the election boards are not related to legislative function, nor are they the responsibility of the Legislature.</p>

In September Traynor requested more information on whether Burleigh County Auditor Mark Splonskowski can file the lawsuit, which hinges on his status as a county official, without the support of Burleigh County. Splonskowski filed the suit in partnership with the Public Interest Legal Foundation against state Election Director Erika White in July, claiming harm from an alleged conflict between state and federal mail-in voting laws. The county has said it isn&#8217;t putting any funds or employee time toward the case, which Splonskowski has repeatedly said is being brought in his capacity as an individual. Both Splonskowski and the state have provided Traynor with additional information as the judge seeks to determine Splonskowski’s standing in the case. Splonskowski is attempting to bring the suit as an individual, but Traynor said in a Sept. 15 filing that Splonskowski “clearly contemplates the suit in his official capacity as Burleigh County auditor.” The judge requested more information to ascertain if Splonskowski actually has the legal standing to file the suit, or if it should be dismissed because he doesn’t have approval to bring the suit from the Burleigh County Commission. If the suit proceeds, the court will have to address questions about the alleged conflict between federal and state laws, which the state has argued is nonexistent. A Justice Department filing in September indicated support for that stance, arguing that counting and casting a ballot are different processes, and ballots that are mailed ahead of or on Election Day are cast according to North Dakota law, which means there is no conflict.</p>

The York County Board of Elections is slated to vote to approve the agreement at its meeting this week. The<a href="https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/york-county/2023/08/26/casa-york-county-settle-spanish-voting-lawsuit/70677489007/"> settlement</a> comes with a lengthy list of requirements for the county&#8217;s election department to assist Spanish-speaking voters through 2028. Those include providing bilingual sample ballots for reference both online and in-person at all 161 precincts, as well as Spanish-language resource signs and bilingual Spanish-English paper ballots at 33 precincts. The CASA-led lawsuit sought a preliminary injunction against the county and its elections board and was originally filed in October 2022. The injunction was lifted after the county agreed to provide bilingual sample ballots at every precinct and additional interpreters for the November general election, among other concessions. In addition, York County election workers are required to be trained on how to direct Spanish-speaking callers to the Spanish language interpretation line, on Election Day and the rest of the year. Important voting updates such as changes to polling locations will be communicated in Spanish as well as English or provide a notice to Spanish-speaking voters how to access the information in Spanish.</p>

Brown ruled that Galveston County<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/13/galveston-county-redistricting-case/"> violated the federal Voting Rights Act</a> in 2021 when it drew new districts for its commissioners court. Brown ruled the county’s 2021 commissioners court precinct map “denies Black and Latino voters the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and the opportunity to elect a representative of their choice to the commissioners court.” As a result, the county has been ordered to redraw the map by Oct. 20. The trial focused on how the county utilized its first opportunity to redraw precincts without federal oversight to break up the sole commissioner precinct where Black and Latino voters made up a majority of the electorate. Precinct 3, where Black and Latino residents had built political groups and selected their representative on the court, was chopped in the 2021 map. As a result of the court’s decision, the nomination or election of county commissioners from the current precinct map may not be administered, enforced, prepared for or permitted. The commissioners court must now adopt a new plan before Nov. 11, 2023, for the upcoming 2024 election. Brown<a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/voting/2023/10/17/466950/galveston-county-leaders-get-a-weeks-delay-in-deadline-to-file-new-redistricting-plan/"> extended the deadline</a> for county leaders to file a new redistricting plan to October 27. If it fails do so, the court will impose its own plan on November 8. That&#8217;s just three days before the candidates&#8217; filing deadline for the March 2024 primaries.</p>
