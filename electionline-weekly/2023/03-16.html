							<h2>In Focus This Week </h2>
														<p><strong>The kids are alright</strong><br />
<em>An occasional look at youth voter education and outreach</em></p>
<p>M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Earlier this year, California  hit a unique milestone — one million 16-and 17-year-olds pre-registered to vote.</p>
<p>As of March 6, that number was 1,012,196 to be exact, meaning California has more young people pre-registered to vote more than 10 states and the District of Columbia have current registered voters.</p>
<p>While experts and advocates haven’t always been bullish on the youth voter turnout, recent elections have proven that young people are turning out in greater numbers than ever before. In<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/2022-election-center#youth-turnout-second-highest-in-last-three-decades"> 2022</a>, according to<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/"> CIRCLE</a>, the youth voter turnout was the second-highest in the last three decades.</p>
<p>Getting those young people ready to do their civic duty can take of a variety of formats. The<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/2022-08/circle_growing_voters.pdf"> CIRCLE Growing Voters Report</a>, released in the summer of 2022, provided a framework for how institutions and communities can prepare young people to become active and informed voters.</p>
<p>State and local elections officials have found their own ways to get young people registered and involved. We’ll be taking a look at some of those officials and their programs throughout the year. If you’ve found a unique or successful way to grow America’s electorate, let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Civic Education<br />
</strong>This year, the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s Office has launched the<a href="https://www.sos.ri.gov/divisions/civics-and-education/CivicEducationTeacherAward"> Civic Teacher of the Year</a> award. The award will honor one outstanding teacher who has demonstrated a commitment to and expertise in teaching civics or American government, with special consideration given to teachers who <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9518" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CivicEduation-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CivicEduation-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CivicEduation-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CivicEduation.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />employ innovative teaching practices and experiential learning opportunities for their students. Nominations can be made by a current student, teaching colleague, or administrator.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a former history and civics teacher myself, I know how critically important it is to educate our students on both our history and how to participate in our democracy,&#8221; said Secretary of State Gregg M. Amore. &#8220;I am excited to honor the outstanding professionals who do this work and to hear from their students and colleagues about their successes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amore recently took those educator skills to a classroom in Middletown where he spoke to AP U.S. History and AP Government students. According to local media reports Amore touched on a variety of civics-related topics including voting rights and voting-related amendments to the Constitution.</p>
<p>“I think that when you’re taking a history class you usually get a really sequential view of history. Seeing all of the examples of voter suppression in one discussion was interesting, to get a big scope of view to see how it has changed and how it still needs to be improved today,” senior Collin Klampert<a href="https://www.newportri.com/story/news/education/2023/03/09/ri-secretary-of-state-gregg-amore-visits-middletown-high-school/69980388007/"> told</a> The Newport Daily News.</p>
<p>In DeKalb County, Georgia, a<a href="https://thechampionnewspaper.com/new-program-will-focus-on-voting-and-other-adult-tasks-at-chamblee-high/"> “Voting 101”</a> pilot program recently debuted at Chamblee Charter High School on “Adulting Day”.</p>
<p>The program was hosted by Sen. Sally Harrell, who represents Georgia’s 40th District, in collaboration with Rep. Karen Lupton of Georgia’s 83rd District and the<a href="https://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/voter-registration-elections/our-mission"> Dekalb County Voter Registration and Elections Office</a>.</p>
<p>The program instructed students how to register to vote, research candidates on the ballot, apply for and submit absentee ballots, and how to vote early [versus voting] on Election Day. The goal of the course was to “demystify and clarify the voting process for new voters and ultimately increase the number of young voters participating in our elections.” Students also got hands-on experience with the voting equipment.</p>
<p>“When my kids became first-time voters, they found it to be a little intimidating and they had lots of questions,” Harrell<a href="https://thechampionnewspaper.com/new-program-will-focus-on-voting-and-other-adult-tasks-at-chamblee-high/"> told</a> The Champion. “This program will take some of the mystery out of the process and create greater confidence in our youngest voters.”</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3788" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-261x300.jpg 261w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-768x884.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups.jpg 869w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" />Youth voter registration drives are always a popular avenue for elections officials.<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/"> Iowa Secretary of State</a> Paul Pate has made them a cornerstone of his administration. March 22 is<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2023_03_07.html"> Iowa High School Voter Registration Day</a> — a day when Pate calls on all Iowa high schools to conduct voter registration drives.</p>
<p>“Citizen participation in elections is paramount to our republic and registering to vote is one of the most important steps an individual can take to get involved and make their voice heard. During my tenure, I&#8217;ve recruited Iowans young and old to register to vote, and my office takes a special focus on encouraging young people to register to vote,” Pate said.</p>
<p>Iowa law allows 17-year-olds to register to vote and there are currently more than 3,400 already registered. They can also participate in primary elections as long as they turn 18 prior to or on the day of the general election. Iowa law requires high schools to conduct two voter registration drives every school year.</p>
<p>“With initiatives like the<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/youth/carriechapmancattaward.html"> Carrie Chapman Catt Award</a> and Iowa High School Voter Registration Day, we&#8217;ve been able to show students informed voting can be fun,” Pate said. “In 2018 I worked hard to change Iowa law so individuals who were 17 years-old could register and participate in primaries and caucuses as long as they would be 18 by or on Election Day. A record number of Iowans are registered to vote, and schools across the state have stepped up in a big way the past few years to get students registered.”</p>
<p>The Carrie Chapman Award competition began in 2019. Every school in Iowa that signs up and registers at least 90 percent of their eligible students to vote will receive the Carrie Chapman Catt Award, named after the Iowan who was a national leader in the women’s suffrage movement. Schools that register 50% and 70% of their eligible students will also receive statewide recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Pollworkers</strong><br />
More and more localities are relying on young people to serve as poll workers or to help out in the polling places on Election Day and during early voting.</p>
<p>This week, the Illinois General Assembly if voting on a bill that would allow college students to receive academic credit for serving as election judges. Under the bill, Illinois universities and community colleges will be required to submit policies for awarding an academic credit or non-credit alternative to the Illinois Board of Higher Education and Community College Board by June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the county clerks association and various county clerks were very excited about this bill,&#8221; Rep. Daniel Didech (D-Buffalo Grove)<a href="https://www.wandtv.com/community/illinois-college-students-could-soon-get-academic-credit-as-election-judges/article_442ac502-c380-11ed-a06c-f7f94d68edcf.html"> told</a> WAND. &#8220;There was initially some opposition from the community colleges and universities. As amended, we&#8217;ve addressed their opposition.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=995&amp;GAID=17&amp;GA=103&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegID=142882&amp;SessionID=112">House Bill 995</a> passed on a 100-12 vote and now heads to the Senate for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Contests</strong><br />
And of course there are the ever-popular “I Voted” sticker contests. Just this week, two Michigan <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8677" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png" alt="" width="182" height="152" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-1024x852.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-768x639.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" />counties announced new “I Voted” sticker competitions for local students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think by talking about the &#8216;I Voted&#8217; sticker and the importance that people have with this sticker, and the importance it is to exercise one&#8217;s right to vote, I think students will start to understand and hopefully will start to develop the habit of voting,&#8221;<a href="https://clerk.ingham.org/departments_and_officials/county_clerk/"> Ingham County Clerk</a> Barb Byrum<a href="https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2023-03-14/ingham-county-clerk-invites-young-artists-to-design-i-voted-stickers-for-future-elections-in-mi"> told</a> WKAR.</p>
<p>As we previously reported, the<a href="https://sos.tn.gov/"> Tennessee Secretary of State’s Office</a> hosts an<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2021/01-28/"> essay contest</a>, which launched in 2016, and focuses on civic education. In 2020, the essay contest specifically focused on poll workers.</p>
<p>“We need to begin recruiting the next generation of poll officials, and the pandemic accelerated this need.  This year’s contest was an effort to jumpstart our efforts to recruit younger Tennesseans and to encourage them to serve their communities as poll officials,” Hargett said at the time. “Serving as a poll official provided an unmatched opportunity for students to see our electoral process in action and assist their community in running a safe and secure election.”</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4575" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />2023 Elections</strong>: Local elections were held this week from sunny Florida to snowy New Hampshire. In Florida,<a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/political/elections-local/palm-beach-county-municipal-election-was-successful-despite-low-turnout-officials-say"> Palm Beach County</a> Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link said things went smoothly, although turnout was low. Seventeen of the county’s 39 municipalities held elections.  According to the supervisor of elections office, 12.38% of the county&#8217;s more than 193,000 eligible voters cast a ballot this election cycle. In comparison, during the municipal election in the spring of 2022, 18.8% of voters cast a ballot by mail or in person. It&#8217;s a little lower than what we had previously,&#8221; Sartory Link said. &#8220;Vote by mail is a little lower than it has been in the past.” Sartory Link attributes the overall lower turnout to a lower mail ballot turnout. That lower mail ballot turnout  may be the result of a new Florida law which required all mail voters to re-register to automatically get a mail ballot. Despite the lower voter turnout, Sartory Link said she&#8217;s thankful there were no hiccups, and that the process was smooth and safe.  &#8220;I was worried about some of the cities where I had heard some really contentious races, but when I was out today, everyone was behaving well,&#8221; Sartory Link said. &#8220;The candidates, the representatives of the candidates, were good-natured. I saw no issues.&#8221; Municipal elections were also held in<a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-south-florida-election-day-20230314-i3gsvwrd6fef5ooixbe4c7ipwi-story.html"> Broward County</a>. The election turnout was “very, very low, and unfortunately it was expected,” said Ivan Castro, spokesman for Broward County’s Supervisor of Elections. The lower expectations arose from a new state requirement that voters reapply for mail ballots, a process that many apparently overlooked. Officials agreed it played a role in depressing turnout.  “I think it does, it absolutely does for sure,” said Broward County Mayor Lamar Fisher at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, where he served as a member of the Canvassing Board. “Every two years you have to apply for the absentee mail-in ballot, and people are going to forget and they are just not going to vote.” Weather wreaked havoc on Town Meeting Day in New Hampshire with<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2023-03-13/some-nh-towns-postpone-elections-for-noreaster-snow-storm"> more than 70 towns</a> postponing their local elections due to a nor’easter. A new law<a href="https://www.conwaydailysun.com/news/local/despite-noreaster-many-towns-plow-ahead-with-voting/article_5fc1b45a-c28c-11ed-ae5c-df8d83cd7914.html"> allowed towns to postpone</a> their elections for up to two weeks. However, despite many towns postponing, the show did go on in others. Some polling places were<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/weare-new-hampshire-town-election-power-outage/43307771"> without power</a> and in<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2023-03-14/ballots-amid-the-snowflakes-snow-delays-some-elections-but-many-towns-carry-on-amid-storm"> Henniker</a>, Town Moderator Cordell Johnston had to post a sign that said: “Please do NOT insert your ballot if it is WET, hand it to the clerk or moderator.” It was a precaution informed by a past election day with heavy precipitation, when a wet ballot jammed a machine mid-election. In<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/kingston-new-hampshire-voting-police-noreaster/43307000"> Kingston</a>, the local police department offered to drive voters to the polls and poll workers told WMUR that several voters did take them up on the offer.</p>

This updated version covers 19 chapters on topics such as accessibility, voting system certification, system security, audits, ballot building, absentee voting, and recounts. Using input from local and state election officials and other stakeholders, the EMG serves as a resource for new and experienced election officials, regardless of their jurisdiction size or resources. The EAC recognizes that the election administration landscape has changed since the previous EMG was released over 15 years ago, necessitating this update. With the designation of elections as critical infrastructure in 2017, physical security, cybersecurity, and continuity of operations during a disaster have become essential components of national security. State election laws and regulations, election technologies, and best practices are constantly evolving to meet the needs of resilient and secure election systems. There also has been an influx of new election officials, as many others have entered retirement. The EMG was updated to address these issues and more. “With preparations for the 2024 presidential election underway, the Election Management Guidelines represents an excellent addition to the EAC’s growing library of election administration resources to support these efforts,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks in a joint statement. “Election officials must have a wide range of knowledge and serve many roles in addition to administering elections — from IT specialist and communications expert to ballot security manager. The EMG provides guidance on various election processes and topics election officials may encounter during their tenure, no matter how long they have served.” The second edition of the EMG includes additions to the original topics and incorporates references to many of the EAC’s latest Clearinghouse resources. One significant change is the addition of a chapter dedicated to Post-Election Audits due to the increased public attention on audit types and procedures. Conversely, the former Technology in Elections chapter was eliminated, so relevant technologies are discussed throughout the updated EMG.  New election officials and office staff members can use the EMG as an introduction to unfamiliar aspects of election administration. Experienced officials may use the EMG as a helpful reference to find ways to update or improve their procedures.

Based on 15 criteria that highlight three main principles (access, trust, and security), the<a href="https://voteathome.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ec915df3d0c3bdd808028bdad&amp;id=5f55eda35f&amp;e=d9cdb44b33"> scorecard</a> is designed to focus on policy and budget decisions made by state legislatures, and to avoid implicit judgements that can’t be quantified. It scores the most significant steps and potential obstacles in facilitating a mail ballot&#8217;s journey from election officials to voters and back again. States score well for adopting inclusive policies that increase access to and use of mailed-out ballots. For example, &#8220;local option&#8221; laws that allow the Vote at Home model in specific circumstances; or “permanent absentee,” allowing voters to choose to automatically receive their mailed-out ballot for at least four years of future elections. Other indicators include the availability of ballot tracking technology to notify voters when their ballots are dispatched, received, and counted; and &#8220;notify and cure&#8221; policies that give voters time to correct mistakes or update their signatures. Scores are based on state policies and practices as of March 15, 2023. &#8220;This is the most focused and comprehensive scorecard of its kind, with criteria that provide a clear guide to boosting mail ballot use,&#8221; says Barbara Smith Warner, NVAHI Executive Director. Eight states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington — and Washington, D.C. employ such &#8220;Vote at Home&#8221; election systems, and all rank high on the scorecard. Still, none received a perfect score of 65. In contrast, all of the ten lowest-scoring states have &#8220;excuse required&#8221; laws that mandate voters to provide a narrowly defined specific reason to vote by mail. &#8220;The rankings reflect which states are closest to the best-designed Vote at Home election systems, and which still have a long way to travel.&#8221; Smith Warner says.  &#8220;The evidence is clear and compelling that when all eligible registered voters are mailed their ballot, it strengthens our democracy by increasing participation across all demographics,&#8221; Smith Warner noted. NVAHI intends for its scorecard to provide a roadmap for state legislators, election officials, and citizens interested in moving their states closer to adopting full vote at home election systems. The criteria were selected and weighted to help policymakers identify and implement best practices for voting by mail, regardless of size, population or geography of each state.</p>

Austin McCollum, R-Bentonville, in a voice vote with audible dissent from at least one lawmaker. The bill moves to the full House for further consideration. Under the bill, the<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/mar/09/house-panel-endorses-bill-that-would-create-state/"> &#8220;election integrity unit&#8221;</a> would be required to track all alleged violations, complaints and investigations related to election integrity in a database. The secretary of state and the State Board of Election Commissioners would have secure access to the database. The unit also would oversee the attorney general&#8217;s &#8220;election law violations hotline.&#8221; The group would have to respond to notifications and complaints regarding alleged violations of voter registration and election laws and refer notifications and complaints to the State Board of Election Commissioners for investigation. The integrity unit also could receive sworn statements and issue subpoenas to compel the production of records and other documents. Under the bill, the attorney general would be required to appoint a director of the unit. The attorney general also would be permitted to appoint other staff, including assistants, non-sworn investigators, professional staff and clerical staff.</p>
<p>Local elections officials have expressed concerns about Senate Bill 275 and the impact it may have their<a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/mar/10/officials-electioneering-bill-puts-polling-places/"> ability to secure polling places</a>. Senate Bill 275 is sponsored by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton. It has been referred back to the Senate State Agencies Committee for discussion and possible amendment. The bill as written says any polling site or vote center shall allow any person outside the building and more than 100 feet from the primary entrance used by voters to audibly disseminate information advocating for or against any candidate, issue or measure on the ballot; display signs held in a person&#8217;s hand advocating for or against any candidate, issue or measure on a ballot; and display attire advocating for or against any candidate, issue or measure on a ballot. &#8220;I could lose all three of my polling sites in Bella Vista,&#8221; Kim Dennison, Benton County&#8217;s election coordinator, said. &#8220;What am I going to do with 15,000 people who want to vote and have no place to go?&#8221; Dennison said she has heard from a number of churches that have served as polling locations in Benton County elections and many have expressed concerns about losing control of their property during elections if the proposed legislation passes.</p>
<p>The House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs passed Senate Bill 250 by Sen. Kim Hammer (R-Benton) on a split voice vote after several hours of debate and testimony that included debunked claims and conspiracies about election integrity. The bill would require<a href="http://www.magnoliareporter.com/news_and_business/regional_news/article_b6215b44-c21d-11ed-bcb6-67542ce0b8a7.html"> counties that opt to get rid of voting machines</a> to bear the costs of paper ballots. SB250 would also require “paper-ballot counties” to use a state-approved machine to perform a preliminary count and declare preliminary, unofficial election results within 24 hours of polls closing.</p>

The committee approved the policies during a lengthy afternoon meeting. Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Stamford Democrat who co-chairs the panel, said proponents hoped to put the proposal before both the House and Senate in time to have an early voting option in place for this year’s election. Although the proposals are functionally similar, they do contain differences: two bills would create a 14-day early voting window while one would open polls for 10 days. All three bills would require a four-day window for special election voting but only two of them would also require the same window for referendum votes. The bills provide for the polls to be open on weekend days prior to Election Day and generally open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. However, each proposal sets aside two days during which polling locations would offer early and later hours.  The proposals allow municipalities to operate one central polling location during early voting days rather than open every location normally available on Election Day. However, they also allow larger towns to offer additional polling places if those locations are approved by the Office of the Secretary of the State.</p>

SB 3 is in response to the Delaware Supreme Court decision last year and would require all absentee ballots to include an oath or affirmation that the qualified voter’s vote is free from improper influence. This would be in lieu of the oath or affirmation required under Section 3 of Article 5 of the Delaware Constitution. This would be in lieu of the oath or affirmation required under Section 3 of Article 5 of the Delaware Constitution. Amending the Delaware Constitution requires not only the passing of the changes in this Act, but also passage of the same changes after the next general election by the next General Assembly. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because § 1 of Article XVI of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend the Delaware Constitution.</p>

A bill that would have ended general election runoffs as long as a candidate wins at least 45% support received a committee hearing, but it wasn’t considered for a vote. Other ideas for eliminating runoffs also went nowhere, such as creating a system called ranked-choice voting, in which voters’ second-choice candidates would be considered. Runoffs cost taxpayers across Georgia an estimated $75 million in 2020, according to a study by Kennesaw State University professors. Metro Atlanta’s four core counties estimated that last year’s U.S. Senate runoff cost them a combined $10 million or more. Several legislators have said they prefer sticking with Georgia’s current system that requires runoffs.</p>
<p>The House State and Local Government Subcommittee advanced legislation that<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/georgia-house-panel-oks-senate-bill-to-restrict-outside-money-for-local-governments-to-run-elections/"> prohibits local government officials from directly receiving donations</a> from outside organizations to administer elections. If the bill passes, all private donations would have to be funneled to local election administrations through the secretary of state’s office and the State Election Board. The bill also makes it a felony carrying up to a year in jail and a $10,000 fine if someone violates the law by applying for private grants or receiving donations for election operations. The legislation also requires local governments to return any money they receive from non-governmental organizations that came in since the passage of the GOP’s 2021<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/03/26/kemp-commends-election-overhaul-braces-for-legal-challenges/"> election law overhaul</a> that attempted to limit outside funding after millions poured into Georgia elections in 2020 to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

Bill 57 would ban carrying firearms in 13 places: city-, state-, and federally owned buildings, hospitals, schools and child care facilities, parks, homeless and domestic violence shelters, “places frequented by children,” like the aquarium, polling places, public transportation, businesses serving alcohol, large public gathering, like protests, concerts and marijuana dispensaries. The bill would also require that anyone carrying a gun who interacts with a police officer tell the officer and present their license. If Mayor Rick Blangiardi signs the bill, it would take effect May 1, a council press release said. The mayor has 10 business days to sign.  Blangiardi intends to sign the bill, according to his spokesperson Ian Scheuring, but he could not say when.</p>

If the bill passes, the only acceptable forms of identification accepted at Idaho polling places would be: An Idaho driver’s license or an identification card issued by the Idaho Transportation Department.; A U.S. passport or a photo ID card issued by an agency of the U.S. government; A tribal photo identification card; or A license to carry concealed weapons, or an enhanced license to carry concealed weapons.</p>
<p>The House State Affairs Committee held a resolution, subject to call of the chairman, that would ask voters to amend the Idaho Constitution and make it<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/03/09/idaho-ballot-initiatives-resolution-held-in-house-committee-for-now/"> harder to get an initiative or referendum on the ballot</a>. The resolution comes after a similar piece of legislation in 2021, Senate Bill 1110, was struck down as unconstitutional by the Idaho Supreme Court. That law would have increased the number of legislative districts needed to qualify an initiative to all 35 districts, rather than 18 districts as currently required.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/SJR101/"> SJR 101</a> would ask voters if they want to amend the Idaho Constitution to require signatures from 6% of registered voters in all 35 legislative districts to place an initiative or referendum on the ballot. It passed the Senate in a 27-8 vote and is sponsored by Sen. Doug Okuniewicz, R-Hayden.</p>
<p>The House killed a bill that would have placed<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/03/13/idaho-house-kills-bill-that-would-have-restricted-voting-by-absentee-ballot/"> strict restrictions on who could vote using absentee ballots</a> or even request an absentee ballot.  The House voted 30-40 to kill House<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0205/"> Bill 205</a>, which would have prohibited Idahoans from voting by absentee ballot for convenience. Instead, if the bill had passed, Idahoans would have needed to meet one of a handful conditions to vote by absentee ballot, including serving in the U.S. armed forces, illness, disability or hospitalization, serving a religious mission, staying a second home they own or having to work or attend university classes.  In November’s general election, 129,210 of the 599,493 votes cast were cast by absentee ballot, representing about 21% of all votes.</p>
<p><a href="https://idahonews.com/news/local/legislation-could-provide-day-off-or-remote-learning-on-certain-election-days">Election day</a> could soon be a day off for Idaho&#8217;s K-12 students. House bill 209 would allow schools to take the day off or have a virtual school day. as more Idaho schools continue to serve as polling locations. The sponsor of the bill says this is being done in an effort to keep students safe, during elections as more people head to their local school polling places. The bill&#8217;s statement of purpose says it&#8217;s to provide students safety and adequate polling locations on election days. The concern is that during election days people are typically present on school grounds that are not typically there during school hours. The sponsor of the bill says this addresses the need for more polling locations and the need to keep students safe. Secretary of State, Phil McGrane says it would support the high number of in-person voters.</p>

Lawmakers hope this proposal could help election authorities address the constant shortage of election judges across the state. Rep. Daniel Didech (D-Buffalo Grove) said his bill can also create more opportunities for young people to get hands-on experience in the democratic process. Illinois universities and community colleges will be required to submit policies for awarding an academic credit or non-credit alternative to the Illinois Board of Higher Education and Community College Board by June 30, 2024. Under this plan, election judges would not be paid if they receive the academic credit. House Bill 995 passed on a 100-12 vote. The proposal now heads to the Senate for consideration.</p>

Dalya Attar introduced a bill aimed at<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/bs-md-primary-date-change-to-avoid-ramadan-20230309-v56hr3sxavhzzez3rl36pyblby-story.html"> changing the date of Maryland’s 2024 primary</a> from April 23 to April 16 to avoid a conflict with Passover. However, Attar submitted an amendment to the bill that would change the suggested new date to May 14 because the April 16 date meant early voting would have coincided with Ramadan.  “April 16th would mean that early voting would fall on Ramadan, and I did not want the date to conflict with Ramadan either and restrict people from voting,” Attar wrote in an email to The Baltimore Sun. Attar said it was a constituent who drew her attention to the potential conflict. The amendment passed in a subcommittee of the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee. Maryland law calls for primary elections to take place on the fourth Tuesday in April of a presidential election year. Rather than submit an entirely new bill, Attar said, she packaged the change in the form of an amendment in “an effort to ensure expediency and efficiency.” “I look forward to the amendment becoming law and the primary date next year being on May 14, 2024,” she said.</p>
<p>House and Senate lawmakers have approved nearly identical bills ahead of elections next year to speed<a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/state-government/bills-changing-rules-for-processing-correcting-mail-ballots-approved-in-house-and-senate-LFSKKAYZHJCKBODSR4FCNHXL4A/"> counting of mail ballots and make it easier for voters to correct ballots</a> that weren’t filled out properly. If the bills become law, a local election board would be required to begin canvassing absentee ballots — preparing them to be counted — eight business days before the first day of early voting. Boards would not tabulate any ballot totals until Election Day. Jurisdictions with few mail voters could be exempted from the requirement. The bill would alter current law that requires local election boards to void a ballot if the envelope has not been signed and the voter did not correct it within 10 days of the election. Instead, a local election board would be required to review each ballot envelope shortly after it is received to check for signatures. If an omission is found, the board must alert the voter and give them a chance to cure, or correct, their ballot.</p>

SB 151 would require individuals registering to vote to confirm they understand it is a felony to vote or attempt to vote more than once at the same election, in either the same or another voting precinct. “This reform received widespread support last year from both Michigan county and municipal clerks, who actually run our elections,” Bellino said. “It is designed to protect elections through awareness of the law and does nothing to prevent or hinder someone from legally voting.” SB 151 has been referred to the Senate Elections and Ethics Committee for consideration.</p>

Prior to being cut or removed from the rolls, an individual will receive a notice in the mail that they are being considered for “inactive status.” Being made inactive will prevent an individual from voting on a regular ballot in an upcoming election, and that person would be required to present an affidavit ballot to be counted for the election should they go vote.  If a voter does not vote in an election via affidavit within two years, they will effectively be removed from the voter rolls.  On the Senate floor, Senator Jeff Tate (R) defended the bill, saying they have had increased reports of deceased individuals’ names showing up on voter rolls. He said that led to concerns over voter fraud.</p>

The 10-9 decision came despite opposition to the measure from the Secretary of State’s Office. Faulkner’s House Bill 586 would allow people to vote absentee if they lack convenient and affordable transportation or are concerned their health or safety would be endangered by traveling to or being at a polling place. Existing allowable reasons for voting absentee in New Hampshire include absence from the voter’s city or town, a religious observance, disability or illness, and employment commitments (including caregiving) during the entire time the polls are open. N.H. Secretary of State David Scanlan said his office opposes HB 586 because in their estimation it would run counter to a New Hampshire constitutional provision. “Our state Constitution specifically says you can obtain an absentee ballot for one of two reasons — being absent or due to a disability,” Scanlan said. “Anything outside of that doesn’t meet the Constitution’s requirement.</p>

Rachel May, a Syracuse Democrat, introduced the legislation. The bill would allow local election boards to designate countywide vote centers for the day of a primary or general election. The concept is not new to New York or other states. In New York, counties already use vote centers during the nine-day early voting period before an election. With the addition of electronic poll books and ballot on-demand printers, polling places can be set up in central locations for all voters in a county.  &#8220;Overseen by bipartisan elections commissioners and poll workers,&#8221; May wrote in her justification for the bill, &#8220;this system functions well across the state during the early voting period.&#8221;  &#8220;This legislation will give county election officials the flexibility they need to establish one or more such centers during elections,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just like the established polling places during early voting, these vote centers will allow voters from anywhere within a county to use polling places with such a designation to cast their ballot.&#8221; May&#8217;s bill has been referred to the Senate Elections Committee for review.</p>

If that happened, Oklahoma elections would be held separately, and federal laws would be followed only during federal elections. The bill would establish that the Oklahoma attorney general with concurrence of the secretary of the State Election Board would confirm if a trigger has taken place. If or when the action is needed, a committee is to be established within two weeks and make a determination on time, place and manner of election dates for the state within 60 days. The Committee would be made up of four members each appointed by the House and Senate, as well as the state&#8217;s attorney general, the chair of the District Attorneys Council, and the governor or a designee. HB 1415, presented Tuesday, passed the House with a vote of 77-20. It now moves to the state Senate where it is authored by Sen. Dave Rader, R-Tulsa.</p>

It now heads to the budget-writing Joint Ways and Means Committee, where lawmakers will decide whether expanding voting rights to about 12,000 incarcerated people is worth a $750,000 cost. People convicted of felonies lose their right to vote while serving their sentences in almost every state. In Oregon and 21 other states, those individuals regain their voting rights upon release from prison. People in county jails who haven’t been convicted and sentenced or who are serving time for minor crimes or misdemeanors still can vote.  The measure would require the state to let people in prison begin registering to vote and casting ballots on June 1, 2026. An amendment approved by the committee postponed the measure’s effective date to give the Secretary of State’s Office, the Department of Corrections and cities and counties more time to prepare for mailing ballots.</p>

If Senate Bill 2 becomes law, a person found guilty of the crime could face up to 20 years in prison and more than $10,000 in fines. The debate between Democratic lawmakers and Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, the bill’s author, focused heavily on what constitutes illegal voting. Lawmakers disagreed over whether, under the bill, a person who mistakenly votes illegally could be prosecuted. Democrats pointed to examples such as a person who knows they have been convicted of a felony but doesn’t realize that makes them ineligible to vote or a person who knows they are not a U.S. citizen but does not know that makes them ineligible.</p>

In a 111-page opinion, Marrero said Wohl and Burkman used thousands of robocalls in Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois to spread false and misleading information about mail-in voting in a “calculated” effort to “deter Black voters by exploiting fears and stereotypes.” “The Court recognizes that the free exchange of ideas on issues of public concern and the ability to engage in robust political discussion constitute the foundations of a democratic society,” Marrero wrote. But, he added, evidence showed “that the neighborhoods that Defendants targeted were not accidental or random” and a reasonable jury would conclude the two men wanted to “deny the right to vote specifically to Black voters.” Burkman and Wohl had pleaded guilty in October to a single count each of felony telecommunications fraud over the robocalls. They were sentenced in November to two years probation, six months of electronic monitoring and 500 hours of community service in a voter registration drive. Marrero wrote this week that Wohl and Burkman’s actions also violated the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act, which enforces citizens’ right to vote under the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Senior Judge William J. Martínez<a href="https://gazette.com/news/courts/judge-defamation-lawsuit-dominion-denver-election/article_dea53388-f8ab-51bc-8318-ff63b180b8f8.html"> refused to dismiss a defamation lawsuit</a> brought by a former Dominion Voting Systems executive against an Oklahoma podcaster who spread unproven statements about election-rigging in the wake of the 2020 presidential race. Eric Coomer, the former director of product security and strategy for voting technology supplier Dominion, sued Clayton Thomas &#8220;Clay&#8221; Clark and his &#8220;Thrivetime Show&#8221; podcast for promoting the rumor that Coomer allegedly confessed to ensuring former President Donald Trump would not win reelection. Those assertions of &#8220;treasonous behavior&#8221; resulted in death threats against Coomer. Martínez denied the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Clark and Thrivetime argued they had &#8220;every reason to believe&#8221; the dubious allegations about Coomer, and the lawsuit could not survive because it stemmed from their protected First Amendment activity. But the judge found &#8220;no real dispute&#8221; that some of the defendants&#8217; comments about Coomer amounted to defamation. &#8220;Plaintiff has presented evidence that Defendants, for a period of at least a year, repeatedly accused Dr. Coomer (or amplified others’ accusations) of the crimes of election fraud and treason, that they did so in reckless disregard of the truth, and that they persisted in these accusations even after a point in time when they reasonably should have known of the death threats Plaintiff had received,&#8221; Martínez wrote <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cod-1_21-cv-03440/pdf/USCOURTS-cod-1_21-cv-03440-0.pdf">in a March 7 order.</a></p>

The would-be governor’s election challenge was first dismissed in December, after a two-day trial during which she failed to provide evidence backing up her claims that Maricopa County elections officials rigged things against her. After an appellate court last month upheld that dismissal, Lake followed through on a pledge to take the case to the state Supreme Court. On March 13, the defendants in the case — Fontes, Governor Katie Hobbs and Maricopa County — filed biting responses to Lake’s petition asking the Supreme Court to take up her election contest case. All three asked the high court to reject Lake’s suit. “Those who invoke our Courts must do so in good faith,” Craig Morgan, an attorney for Fontes, wrote in his response to the Supreme Court. “We cannot allow a disgruntled vocal minority to weaponize our Courts, sow unfounded distrust in our election processes, malign our public servants, and undermine our democracy – all for the purpose of trying to overturn the People’s will and topple an election.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge Steve Jones is<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/a-trial-is-needed-to-decide-georgia-voter-challenge-case-judge-rules/6KXJX7XPBZB5TOMLOEFORMYM4Y/"> allowing a lawsuit</a> alleging that mass voter eligibility challenges in Georgia infringed on voting rights to move toward trial. Jones wrote in an 87-page order that he won’t grant summary judgment to either party in the case, Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group, or True the Vote, a Texas-based organization that contested more than 300,000 voter registrations before runoffs for the U.S. Senate in early 2021. A trial is needed to decide whether allegations that True the Vote’s efforts to disqualify voters amounted to voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act, Jones said in his order. County election boards threw out almost all the voter challenges.</p>

In the suit, lawyers for Mayor Cantrell say the agreement reached by the Louisiana Secretary of State and organizers with the recall effort on active voters in the parish is void, questioning the legality of the agreement.  The Secretary of State&#8217;s Office agreed that the voter threshold would be 25,000 lower than it was.  Prior to the threshold being lower, Orleans Parish had 249,876 total voters. With the lower threshold, that leaves the number at 224,876, leaving the recall to need roughly 45,000 signatures to get the petition to a vote. The suit also questioned Judge Jennifer Medley&#8217;s approval of the settlement after reports showed Medley may have signed the recall petition herself. Cantrell and her lawyers are asking for the recall petition to be declared null and void, according to the lawsuit.  This comes after organizers say they have compiled enough signatures to put the recall on a ballot for residents to decide.  The Orleans Parish Registrar of Voters is currently counting the number of signatures collected by recall organizers.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5224" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />North Carolina</strong>: The North Carolina Supreme Court is revisiting a case surrounding voter ID requirements. During this week’s<a href="https://abc11.com/politics-voter-id-law-nc-supreme-court-republicans/12956143/"> voter ID arguments</a>, four of the court&#8217;s five Republicans defended the ability of justices to rehear the matter or expressed skepticism about rulings from a three-judge panel that held a trial on the law or the previous edition of the Supreme Court. Democrats and their allies say this week&#8217;s hearings happened solely on the partisan makeup of the court. A chief issue on appeal is whether the judges who struck it down relied too heavily on a 2013 voter ID law and a decision three years later by a federal appeals court that struck it down on the basis of racial bias. &#8220;Voter ID is a solution in search of a problem. Reversing this case would have a detrimental impact on North Carolinians&#8217; access to the ballot box, especially minority, poor, and elderly voters,&#8221; said NC Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton. Attorneys for the minority voters who challenged the 2018 law have said the trial judges were able to consider the history surrounding the 2013 law as part of the broader circumstances in determining whether legislators acted in part with discriminatory intent. Peter Patterson, an attorney for the GOP legislators, said the courts wrongly presumed the 2018 law was tainted as well. The evidence affirmed the law was constitutional by providing more ID options and offering the ability for people to cast ballots even if they lack an ID by filling out a form. Patterson also pointed out the measure had support from some Democrats, including a Black senator.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5227" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Vermont-Flag-300x208.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="208" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Vermont-Flag-300x208.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Vermont-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Vermont:</strong> Republicans are again suing the City of Winooski for allowing<a href="https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/gop-sues-to-stop-noncitizen-voting-in-winooski/Content?oid=37762331"> noncitizen</a> residents to vote in local elections, weeks after the Vermont Supreme Court struck down an earlier challenge to the practice in Montpelier. The new complaint, filed by the Vermont GOP, the Republican National Committee and two city residents, takes aim more narrowly at school elections. Because local districts use funds from state education coffers, the plaintiffs&#8217; legal theory goes, school board and budget votes should be treated as state elections, which the Vermont Constitution restricts to citizens. In 2021, following local votes and state lawmakers&#8217; approval, Winooski and Montpelier joined a small number of municipalities nationwide in extending voting rights to noncitizens. Voters in Burlington passed a similar measure on Tuesday that would take effect if state lawmakers sign off. The cities&#8217; charter changes are not identical. While Winooski and Burlington included school elections in their expanded voter eligibility, Montpelier did not. The RNC and the Vermont GOP sued both Winooski and Montpelier in 2021, seeking to have their charter changes struck down. In January, the Vermont Supreme Court rejected the bid in the Montpelier case, reasoning that &#8220;there is still a difference between municipal government and state government.&#8221; In their decision, the justices wrote that an election involving noncitizen voters could run afoul of the state constitution if it was merely &#8220;municipal in name.&#8221; The retooled complaint against Winooski contends that local school elections are such an example.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/making-congress-work-divided-nation">Making Congress Work in a Divided Nation</a>: Congressional committees are essential to a functioning legislative process, but experts agree they aren’t being used to their full potential. The media paints a picture of a legislative body paralyzed by partisanship, and political scientists agree that our representatives are passing fewer bills. After the chaos that embroiled the current House over the race for speaker, is it any wonder that many Americans have lost faith in the effectiveness of their elected representatives? The Brennan Center is thrilled to host a panel discussion about making Congress work with former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), political correspondent Daniel Strauss, and Brennan Center Elections and Government Program research fellow Dr. Maya Kornberg. Kinzinger is no stranger to calling out Congress for allowing partisanship to breed dysfunction, particularly as one of the two Republicans on the House January 6 committee. Strauss is a staff writer at the New Republic and has covered both Washington politics and political campaigns across the country. Kornberg is the author of the new book, Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process, which examines the legislative process beyond polarized voting patterns. Join us for an important and timely in-person conversation in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, March 22, at 6:30 p.m. The event will be moderated by Mike Spahn, a partner at Precision, one of the country’s leading strategic marketing agencies. The panel will address questions including what the committee system teaches us about bipartisan collaboration, what must be done to bring Congress into the digital age, and how to make Congress more representative of the country as a whole. <strong>When:</strong> March 22, 6:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">Election Center Special Workshop</a>: Courses offered will include: Course 9 (History III &#8211; 1965 to Present), Course 10 (Constitutional Law of Elections, renewal) and Course 15 (Training in Elections: Reaching All Levels). <strong>When:</strong> April 27-30. <strong>Where:</strong> Houston.</p>
<p><a href="https://esra-conference.org/2023-conference">ERSA 2023 Conference</a>:  The 7th Annual Summer Conference on Election Science, Reform, and Administration (ESRA) will be held in person from Wednesday, May 31 to Friday, June 2, at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.  Details about this year&#8217;s conference program are forthcoming. <strong>When:</strong> May 31-June 2. <strong>Where:</strong> Atlanta</p>
<p><a href="https://www.naco.org/events/2023-naco-annual-conference-exposition">NACo Annual Conference</a>: The National Association of Counties (NACo) Annual Conference &amp; Expo is the largest meeting of county elected and appointed officials from across the country.
