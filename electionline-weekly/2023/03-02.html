							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New Report by the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</strong><br />
<em>Voter Registration Database Security in 2022</em></p>
<p>Kristin Sullivan, research director<br />
The Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-02-at-11.06.22-AM-300x83.png" alt="" width="300" height="83" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-02-at-11.06.22-AM-300x83.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-02-at-11.06.22-AM.png 532w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />As integral components of the voter registration process, state voter registration databases (VRDBs) are foundational to U.S. elections and their security is critically important. Any disruption to a state VRDB by a bad actor could have serious consequences for the smooth operation of our elections and undermine voter confidence. To promote a better understanding of this aspect of election integrity, the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research (CEIR) conducts a biennial survey assessing the state of VRDB security across the U.S.</p>
<p>CEIR recently released a<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/2022-vrdb-security-report/"> report with the results of its 2022 survey</a>, which examines three key areas of VRDB security: prevention, detection, and mitigation. As the report notes, countless election officials successfully administered highly secure and accessible elections in 2020 and 2022, despite intense scrutiny and a national environment of rampant mis- and disinformation. In preparation for the elections, officials worked hard to secure election infrastructure against both foreign and domestic threats by improving their state cybersecurity practices. One critical component of this effort was ensuring the security of VRDBs.</p>
<p>Overall, CEIR’s 2022 survey shows that since 2018, respondent states have implemented and maintained Industry standard best practices to improve their VRDB security posture. These best practices include establishing password requirements, monitoring login attempts, training users, requiring tabletop exercises, and backing up VRDBs. The 2022 survey also shows that state security practices have improved in key areas when compared to 2020. In the 2020 report, for example, CEIR called for further adoption of multi-factor authentication—a measure experts agree is critical to secure VRDB access—and that progress was evident in 2022. We also saw states adapt to changes in best practices for certain password requirements, bring more IT support in-house, and implement additional email security.</p>
<p>Still, some opportunities for growth remain. For example, it appears there may have been slight regression in terms of minimum character requirements for user passwords. This remains a best practice that the National Institute of Standards and Technology, among others, supports and we would expect to see progress in this area in the future.</p>
<p>Based on input from security experts, the 2022 survey introduced two new topics: security procedures for remote third-party access and adherence to the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf"> 3-2-1 rule</a> in backing up VRDB systems.  Both areas show encouraging initial results, though there is some room to grow.</p>
<p>Generally, after three surveys, CEIR remains encouraged by the state of VRDB security. As always, threats will continue to evolve, requiring that state responses and the best practices they employ stay ahead of them. For this reason, CEIR will continue its research in this critical field.</p>

							<h2>DHS Grant Op-Ed</h2>
														<p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
<em>New DHS grants has potential to provide meaningful support to elections officials</em></p>
<p>By Lawrence Norden and Derek Tisler</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/02/27/dhs-announces-2-billion-preparedness-grants"> announced</a> a change in its Homeland Security Grant Program that could make a huge difference for election offices around the country. In fiscal year 2023, states must dedicate at least three percent of the money they receive from this $1 billion program to election security needs, opening up tens of millions of dollars for state and local election offices in need of better security for their workers and for voters.</p>
<p>Previously, DHS had recommended that states prioritize spending some of the grant money received through the program on election security – with this change in policy, that is now a requirement.</p>
<p>This new funding has the potential to provide meaningful support to our guardians of democracy. It could help reverse the flow of dedicated professionals leaving the election administration field because they don’t feel safe in the new climate of harassment and threats.</p>
<p>This grant program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with guidance and support from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Over the past few years, CISA has conducted physical security assessments for election officials across the country, identifying security risks and making critically important recommendations for increasing physical security in offices and at polling sites. But because these assessments have no money attached, election officials are too often left with awareness of vulnerabilities and without the resources to do anything about them. The grant program’s new three-percent rule can be an important step to close that gap.</p>
<p>It’s true that some election offices have been lucky enough to get state or local support that has allowed them to add important security measures. For instance, individual counties in Arizona, Colorado, and Wisconsin have purchased everything from<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/02/1084033824/election-officials-and-lawmakers-are-responding-to-voter-fraud-narrative-differe"> bulletproof doors and glass</a> to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/politics/midterms-elections-threats-security.html"> video cameras and security fencing</a>. But for every jurisdiction that has found the money to implement such measures, there are many more who could not. The new spending requirements will allow election offices to purchase the kind of basic upgrades adopted sporadically by some counties, as well as access controls and door locks to protect equipment and ensure unauthorized persons cannot gain access to buildings, and exterior and parking lot lighting to make the areas that workers use to get into official buildings more secure. It can also be used for things like table-top exercises and other training on hardening office security to meet escalating threats, as well as cell phones, radios and other communication systems that allow election workers to communicate immediately if they are threatened. Making these facilities safer is not only important for the workers who spend their days there, but also for members of the public who visit these buildings to register to vote and cast ballots.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, election workers are not just threatened where they work. Some officials, like Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, have been<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/28/winfrey-testifies-before-house-panel-threats-election-workers/5400419001/"> stalked, confronted, and threatened</a> outside their own homes. States can use the new federal funds to provide election workers with personal security training, or to help hide personal information that attackers have used in the past to harass election workers and their families outside of the office.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the threats against election workers are a new and deeply disturbing trend in American elections and will require far more than the new funds promised by FEMA. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law has estimated that the nationwide cost for instituting best practices to protect election workers from the rise in threats of physical violence could be<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-protecting-election-workers-threats-physical-violence"> as much as $300 million</a> over the next five years. Just as importantly, money alone cannot solve this problem. All levels of government must do more, including by arresting and prosecuting those who have illegally threatened election workers.</p>
<p>This effort by DHS, FEMA and CISA to get more security funding to election officials is an important first step. It is also a meaningful statement from the federal government that it understands threats of physical violence against those who run our elections are a threat to our democracy itself, and that election officials and workers should not feel they are alone when they stand up for free and fair elections for all of us.</p>
<p>For more information on available funding, election officials should contact their State Administrative Agency, which<a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/about/state-administrative-agency-contacts"> can be found here</a>.</p>

Mayorkas this week announced more than $2 billion in funding for eight fiscal year 2023 preparedness grant programs. These grant programs provide critical funding to help state, local, tribal, and territorial officials prepare for, prevent, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism. DHS has identified six national priority areas in the FY 2023 grant cycle: cybersecurity; soft targets and crowded places; intelligence and information sharing; domestic violent extremism; community preparedness and resilience; and election security. DHS’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has released<a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/homeland-security#nofos"> the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP)</a> Fiscal Year 2023 Notice of Funding Opportunity. These grant programs provide critical funding to help state, local, tribal, and territorial officials prepare for, prevent, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism. Election Security has once again been identified as a National Priority Area (NPA) in the HSGP, with a newly required minimum spend of 3%. The State Administrative Agency (SAA) is the only entity eligible to submit HSGP applications to FEMA, but the notice specifically notes that “the SAA must include the State’s Chief Election Official for all projects and matters related to the election security [NPA].” SAA contacts for each state can be<a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/about/state-administrative-agency-contacts"> found here</a>. The application period will close at 5:00 p.m. Eastern on May 18, 2023.

This week, the board of supervisors in both counties made decisions about the future of voting. In<a href="https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/kc-board-of-supervisors-majority-votes-for-dominion-voting-systems-extension-with-county"> Kern County</a>, where angry residents have been attending supervisor meetings since the beginning of the year, the board voted to renew its voting equipment contract with Dominion. There is no evidence that I have seen that the Dominion voting system or the company itself is fraudulent or has malicious intent, which is evident by the fact that no federal agents here in court have found it as such,&#8221; Espinoza, said. She said the voting system is sound and provides accurate results as has been proven time and time again. She recommended the board approve the contract with Dominion voting systems. &#8220;As your Auditor-Controller, I am telling your board that to replace our current voting system based on accusations that have yet to be proven despite being made nearly two and a half years ago is a waste of taxpayer dollars and county resources,&#8221; Espinoza, said. In<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-01/shasta-cuts-tied-with-dominion-amid-unfounded-voting-fraud-claims"> Shasta County</a>, board of supervisors voted to cancel its contract with Dominion and to pursue the possibility of counting votes by hand. As noted in the Los Angeles Times, Shasta County has been in near political chaos for more than a year after far-right activists, including members of a local militia, led a successful recall of a Republican supervisor and former police chief. This week’s hearing about the Dominion contracted lasted 13 hours. Board Chairman Patrick Jones, who spearheaded the voting system changes, said that he intends to follow election laws, but that many in his county do not trust electronic voting machines. Supervisor Mary Rickert, one of two board members who voted to keep Dominion, said she believes the effort is more far-reaching. She and local staff noted that ditching Dominion could cost the cash-strapped county hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra expenses because the county will have to pay to have the voting machines removed. “You don’t understand, our government is being overthrown,” she said in an interview with the Times. In a statement, Dominion said Shasta County’s decision was “yet another example of how lies about Dominion have damaged our company and diminished the public’s faith in elections.”</p>

This comes after the Bastrop County Elections Office held a sticker design contest for K-12 students. The competition was stiff, with over 140 kids submitting a sticker sketch. The top ten winners in each category were honored in front of local leaders at the Bastrop County Commissioners Court meeting. With a unique design that featured a bluebonnet and quill, Smithville High junior Sophia Royster won Bastrop County’s first-ever “I Voted” sticker contest. “We get to be a part of the process a little bit with this,” she said. “Even though we can’t vote, we still get to be involved in the process.” In the younger kid category, Bluebonnet Elementary 2nd-grader Kyla Coleman took the top honors with a colorful design.</p>

Karey</a>, a retired attorney who was a past secretary of the Baltimore County Board of Elections, died of respiratory failure Saturday at Brightview Towson, an assisted living facility. He was 90. A Republican, he was named secretary of the Baltimore County Board of Elections for its 2011-to-2015 term. He was also legal counsel to the elections board before he held a position on it. In a 1994 Sun story, he described how Baltimore County was dealing with election gridlock in the Maryland governor’s race between Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the Republican candidate, and Parris N. Glendening, the Democratic candidate and eventual winner. In Baltimore County, Democrats demanded to check the signature on each of 6,567 absentee ballot envelopes against the signature as recorded on the voting rolls, The Sun’s story said. Democrats wound up challenging more than two-thirds of the ballots because there were no signed affidavits on file for them. In the news account, Mr. Karey said counting ballots without affidavits had been done “in many, many elections and I don’t think we should change it now, even though it might change the election.”</p>

Goldman’s bill would also aim to make polling places more accessible. It would require them when possible to be near public transportation. There would need to be a polling place on every college campus as well as efforts to bring more early voting to rural areas.  Finally, the Early Voting Act would require ballots cast early to be counted beforehand. The congressman said former President Donald Trump and his allies have used the uncertainty of election night counting to undermine democracy.</p>

With the vote, the Board gave up their statutorily-prescribed control over the appointment of the county’s elections director, Election Day procedures, ballot counting and presentation of election results. Republicans Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd voted yes, and Democrat Chairwoman Ann English voted no. The supervisors moved forward despite a warning from the attorney general’s office they received, in which the solicitor general wrote that he had serious concerns about the legality of the drafted agreement. According to Votebeat, Solicitor General Joshua Bendor appeared concerned about Cochise County’s proposal, though, because of the lack of clarity around just how much authority supervisors were giving Stevens – perhaps including establishing voting locations, appointing workers, approving ballot contests, and finalizing results.</p>

In a voice vote with Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, dissenting, the Senate committee endorsed Senate Bill 250 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton. The bill would require a county that chooses to use paper ballots in place of approved voting machines to be responsible for the cost of the paper ballots, and any devices or machines required for the printing and tabulation of paper ballots. It would require each paper ballot to be compatible with the electronic vote tabulation devices selected by the secretary of state law under Arkansas Code Annotated 7-5-301. During all elections in counties that use paper ballots and in which those ballots are counted by hand, the ballots would be required to first be marked using permanent ink and be run through an electronic vote tabulation device before a hand count is conducted under SB250.</p>
<p>The Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee endorsed Senate Bill 272 by Sen. Jim Petty, R-Van Buren. Under the bill, the counties selected to participate in the<a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2023/feb/23/election-review-measure-backed/"> election integrity review</a> would be chosen at random in a public meeting of the state Board of Election Commissioners; designated by a two-thirds vote of the board if information obtained through the complaint process or by a certified election monitor indicates that a substantial violation of election or voter registration laws may have occurred in that county; or designated by the Legislature’s Joint Performance Review Committee. The board would be required to pick 15 counties by designation or by random selection by Jan. 31 of the odd-numbered year to participate in the election integrity review, starting Jan. 1, 2025. The board may conduct an election integrity review of election-related documents and records prior to Jan. 1, 2025, as a pilot program. The election integrity review would include not less than 15 counties and no more than 20 counties in an odd-numbered year under SB272.</p>

Ken DeGraaf of Colorado Springs, would have required elections officials in Colorado’s 64 counties to count votes using a “distributed ledger,” a decentralized verification system similar to blockchain technology. DeGraaf said the bill would allow any voter to verify that their vote was counted for their chosen candidate. HB-1170 was postponed indefinitely by the House State, Civic, Military, and Veterans Affairs committee on an 8-3 vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed.</p>

One of the bills would prohibit county governments from accepting election donations from organizations. Another bill would require Georgia’s voting system to scan ballots without having to rely on QR codes, often called bar codes, which are unreadable to the human eye. One proposal would require anyone employed in a county election office to be a U.S. citizen. Other initiatives would make less controversial adjustments to election processes, requiring audits after primaries as well as general elections, giving local election offices more time to report the total number of ballots cast on election night, and clarifying wording on absentee ballot applications that say “THIS IS NOT A BALLOT.”</p>
<p>Senate Bill 277 could<a href="https://wgxa.tv/news/local/senate-bill-could-give-macon-bibb-mayor-sole-authority-for-election-supervisor"> change how elections are supervised</a> in Macon-Bibb. Senators John Kennedy and Rick Williams sponsored changes to the legislative act that created the Bibb County Board of Elections in 1969. As currently worded; the mayor and county commission &#8211; upon the recommendation of the board of elections &#8211; shall appoint an elections supervisor. If passed, the proposed bill would read &#8220;the governing authority of Macon-Bibb County shall select and appoint a person whose title shall be &#8216;elections supervisor,&#8217; who shall be the chief administrative officer of the board, and who shall have duties and functions as may be prescribed by the board, and who shall serve the pleasure of the county manager of Macon-Bibb County&#8221;. If the bill is approved, it would give full control and authority for the mayor and commission to appoint the election supervisor.</p>
<p>A Senate committee approved a bill that could allow voters to be disqualified based on an allegation that they had changed their address, which voting rights groups said could lead to mass disenfranchisement. The Republican-sponsored proposal would expand the ability of Georgia residents to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-senate-panel-votes-to-empower-voter-challenges-ban-drop-boxes/MEKKSJHU4VC73NN7JRIV4NKIGM/"> challenge the eligibility of other voters</a>, based on a belief that elections are rife with the potential for fraud. The legislation advanced on a 5-3 vote by the Senate Ethics Committee. Senate Bill 221 could receive a vote in the full Senate within days. Voter advocates say the bill would permit unreliable change-of-address data to be used against people who temporarily relocate, including college students, military members and the poor. The measure specifically targets the homeless by requiring them to register to vote by using the address of their county’s courthouse. The legislation also calls for an outright elimination of absentee ballot drop boxes after the General Assembly passed a voting law in 2021 that confined them inside voting locations. In addition, the bill would require digital ballot images to be displayed online, mandate audits after both primary and general elections, and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from working in county election offices.</p>

Currently, if you want to request an absentee ballot, you don&#8217;t need a reason. Under Rep. Joe Alfieri&#8217;s (R-Coeur d’ Alene) bill, you would only be allowed to request an absentee ballot if you&#8217;re in active service of the military; you&#8217;re hospitalized, ill or have a disability; you&#8217;re unable to vote in person on Election Day because you have to work or attend university; or you&#8217;re out of the country on a religious mission. An updated version of Alfieri&#8217;s bill also allows someone to request a ballot if they’re staying in a second home or residence outside of their county &#8211; to account for snowbirds.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 27-8 to pass<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/SJR101/"> Senate Joint Resolution 101</a>, which would require 6% of voters in all 35 Idaho legislative districts to sign a petition for an initiative or referendum to qualify for election. The current threshold is 6% of voters in 18 legislative districts.  Initiatives and referendums are a form of direct democracy that allow the voters to act independent of the Idaho Legislature.</p>
<p>The Senate voted to pass a bill that calls for the Idaho secretary of state to create and mail a free, informational<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/03/01/idaho-senate-oks-bill-creating-new-election-voter-guide-that-will-be-mailed-to-idahoans/"> voter guide</a> to every Idaho household before state primary and general elections. Secretary of State Phil McGrane brought<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/S1078/"> Senate Bill 1078</a> forward as a way to expand upon and replace the current voter’s pamphlet that is now mailed to Idahoans. If the bill is passed into law, the new voter guide would include information about federal and state candidates for office, including state judicial candidates. The new guide would include information on voter registration, voting requirements and important dates and deadlines on top of the existing information included in the voter pamphlets, which only present information about constitutional amendments, ballot initiatives or referendums. The new voter guide would be prepared and tailored to each of the state’s 35 legislative districts so that voters would know what is on their specific ballot.  McGrane estimated the cost of offering the new voter guide would be $750,000 to cover the design, production and sending the voter guide out.</p>

Authored by Rep. Timothy Wesco, R-Osceola, the bill would require that voters applying for an absentee ballot provide identifying information, like the last four digits of a Social Security number, an Indiana driver’s license number, or another form of identification. The bill would also prevent anyone other than a voter or voter’s family member from requesting an absentee ballot on their behalf. The original version of the bill would have imposed additional restrictions on eligibility for absentee voting but those previsions were removed. Wesco amended the bill again, removing a provision that barred election officials from marking or highlighting ballot applications mailed to voters. House Bill 1334 would require county election boards would to match at least one of the identifying numbers in a voter’s absentee ballot application to the voter’s registration record. In the absence of a match, the county’s partisan clerk would mail the voter a new application with an note explaining the error.</p>

The provision is one of three elections laws changes proposed by Iowa Sen. Sandy Salmon, a Republican from Janesville, and advanced by Salmon and fellow Republican Sen. Jason Schultz, of Schleswig. Under the other proposals, all ballots would be recorded, preserved and be considered public information — including which candidates were selected, but without any of the voter’s identifying information; and Iowans could challenge voter registration information across county lines.</p>

The bill was approved by the State Government Committee. Jamie Cashman, a lobbyist for the Iowa Association of County Auditors, said the group will have at least one request: Auditors would like to begin mailing absentee ballots to voters 25 days before the election, rather than the 20 days allowed under current law. He said that would help spread out the workload for election officials and ease voter confusion. The House bill would require any recounts be conducted countywide, rather than only in certain precincts. Candidates also would have to choose whether they want to request a machine or hand recount. Candidates would be required to use whichever method they choose in every county where they request a recount. In addition, the legislation would change the size of recount boards, depending on the population of the county. Currently, all Iowa recount boards are made up of three members — one designated by the apparent winner, another designated by the apparent loser and a third member mutually agreed upon by the other two.</p>

The restriction would apply to advance voting ballots received by mail, in the office of the county election officer, the satellite election office, any polling place or a county-maintained election drop box.  While the House was divided on ending the three-day grace period, legislation giving the Secretary of State more control over the electoral process was passed with no opposition.<a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2086/">  House Bill 2086</a> and<a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2087/">  House Bill 2087</a> would clear up Kansas election law confusion.

The measure would build on a limited, little-used program that now can shield victims’ home addresses from voter rolls. If the bill becomes law, the program would be expanded to mask their addresses on other publicly available government records. The bill won Senate passage on a 36-0 vote, sending it to the House. Republican Sen. Julie Raque Adams, the bill’s lead sponsor, said the proposal would offer protections for victims of domestic violence, stalking and human trafficking. The bill would bring Kentucky’s efforts in line with 38 other states that offer comprehensive programs to mask the home addresses of domestic abuse victims on public records. The Secretary of State’s office runs Kentucky’s address confidentiality program related to voter rolls and it would administer the expanded program. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams praised the Senate vote to expand the program, saying the state is “one step closer to ensuring that survivors of domestic violence can get the protection they deserve.” In his statement, Adams urged the House to pass the measure. Senate Bill 79 is intended to expand the program’s accessibility.</p>

Barry Hovis of District 146 in Whitewater has introduced legislation that would allow for<a href="https://www.semissourian.com/story/2985614.html"> ballot curing</a>. Hovis, who introduced House Bill 1184 on Feb. 16, was inspired by similar legislation put in the hopper by state Sen. Jason Bean. Hovis said the purpose behind his bill is straightforward even if the name on the bill is hard to comprehend. &#8220;If there is a simple mistake on the ballot envelope by someone filing absentee, there should be an opportunity to correct, or &#8216;cure,&#8217; the error so the vote is counted,&#8221; Hovis said. Hovis explains the measure would require county election clerks to try to contact those voters who submitted a ballot with mistakes on the envelope and offer a time-limited chance to correct them. Under current state statute, section 115.295 RsMO, if any statement on any ballot envelope received by county clerks hasn&#8217;t been completed, the ballot &#8220;shall be rejected.&#8221; Hovis said he thinks in the case of a simple mistake, such as failing to sign the ballot envelope, county clerks should do a bit more in order to ensure a vote is counted by reaching out to the voter directly. Cape Girardeau County Clerk Kara Clark Summers said if the bill becomes law, Cape Girardeau County should be able to handle the additional work.</p>

The bills, all sponsored by Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, would have banned machine-counting of ballots, required votes be counted at the county precincts they were cast in and moved Montana to closed primary elections. The committee heard about an hour of testimony on<a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20231&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=SB&amp;P_BILL_NO=435&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ="> Senate Bill 435</a>, which would have eliminated the use of tabulators in Montana, and would require all counties to hand-count every selection on every ballot. Arguments to return to hand-counting have gained popularity in right-wing circles across the country, with many who dispute the results of the 2020 presidential election suggesting the ballot-counting machines were hacked.<a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20231&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=SB&amp;P_BILL_NO=433&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ="> Senate Bill 433</a>, also introduced by Manzella, would require ballots to be counted at the precinct where they were cast, prior to being transported to the county’s centralized location for counting ballots. Under current practice, election officials count the number of ballots at each precinct polling place — but not the intensive process of tallying up each vote on each ballot — before sealing them up and transporting them to the central location. Two election officials must accompany the ballots any time they’re moved, part of Montana’s “chain-of-custody” requirements. The bill would also require video and audio recording off all vote-counting activities. Those processes are already required to be open to the public, but “election integrity” groups in Montana have alleged foul play in the absence of recorded evidence to the contrary. Another bill offered by Manzella would have required Montanans to declare a party affiliation in order to vote in the state’s primary elections. That would be a switch from Montana’s current “open primary” system, in which voters don’t register with a party and are free to vote in a party primary of their choosing. Unaffiliated voters wouldn’t be able to vote in any primary races.</p>

Cast vote records were central to a wave of public-record requests submitted to election officials in Montana last summer. Across the country, the requests appeared to spike after Mike Lindell, a nationally prominent election conspiracy theorist, instructed his followers to request the records from the local election administrators</p>

A hash is a code generated by an algorithm, and can be used to check whether the source code of a tabulator or other election system has been altered. The bill would require counties with election systems capable of generating the hash to check it against the “trusted hash” generated by the Election Assistance Commission when the system was initially certified for use. If no tampering has occurred, the hashes should be identical.</p>
<p>A proposal to<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/bill-to-hold-all-elections-on-even-numbered-years-advances/article_deb8eec2-c36e-5432-b3eb-828064f7a1ec.html"> simplify Montana’s election calendar</a> would upend how local district elections are held, according to groups opposing legislation endorsed by a House committee Tuesday. Rep. Mike Hopkins, R-Missoula, framed his bill as an attempt to boost turnout in elections that often fly under the radar for voters, but ultimately have major impacts on their property tax bills. Those elections — whether they’re for municipal government or school, fire, irrigation or other special districts — would be held alongside the federal primary and general elections that take place in even-numbered years, under<a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20231&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=HB&amp;P_BILL_NO=774&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ="> House Bill 774</a>. Rather than the thousands of different special elections that occur across the state each biennium, Hopkins said, his proposal would require only two.</p>

The bill, if passed, would also require jails to establish polling places for prisoners who are registered to vote in a different county than the one in which they are being held. The legislation would not allow individuals convicted of a felony who haven’t had their right to vote restored to cast a ballot. The bill doesn’t apply to inmates at Nevada state prisons.</p>

The bill, sponsored by Senator Andrew Zwicker, would bring those deadlines into agreement with other deadlines that were adjusted under State laws enacted in 2022. Bill, S-3595, would increase the time by which a county clerk must provide materials to the printer. The bill, as amended, would require clerks to provide materials to the printer on or before the 60th day prior to the primary election. Getting primary election materials out to the printers much further in advance than before will help ensure that they are properly prepared and mailed out, thereby reducing the possibility of human error and leading to greater trust in the State’s elections systems. The bill was released from the Senate by a vote 37-0.</p>

If the bill becomes law, people who do not comply could be charged with a petty misdemeanor which carries up to a six-month prison sentence and a maximum fine of $500. If the bill continues to progress towards law, it’s important to remember that this bill would not apply to peace officers or to security personnel while carrying out their official duties.

The law as enacted under SB 1 says a person commits a crime if they “knowingly or intentionally” vote or attempt to vote in an election in which the person “knows they’re not eligible” to vote. Hughes’ new bill changes that language so that anyone who votes or attempts to vote in an election in which “the person knows of a particular circumstance that makes the person not eligible to vote” could face charges.  That means that rather than having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the voter knew they were casting their ballot unlawfully, prosecutors would only need to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the voter knew of the circumstance that made them ineligible to vote, said James Slattery, senior supervising legislative attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project.</p>

Sen. Charles Trump, R-Morgan, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the bill’s lead sponsor, said the bill increases the maximum number of voters in an urban precinct from 1,500 to 2,500, and allows for greater consolidation of precincts. The Senate also passed<a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=631&amp;year=2023&amp;sessiontype=RS"> Senate Bill 631</a>, which would facilitate the state’s use of federal money from the Help America Vote Act in federal elections. Also known as HAVA, Trump said the bill was passed by Congress after the 2000 presidential election to help facilitate vote counting in states.  Senate Bill 631 also extends the deadline for when county clerks can accept voter registrations on the final day of registration by a few hours, from close of business to midnight.<a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=644&amp;year=2023&amp;sessiontype=RS"> Senate Bill 644</a>, which aims to clarify the procedure for contested elections, also passed.

<p>A bill requiring cites to hold their municipal elections on the same day as statewide primary or general elections continued its journey through the House of Delegates last week. The measure cleared the House Government Organization Committee. It’s second of three committee reviews, with a few additional tweaks. Current code allows cities to align their elections with those dates if they wish. This bill, HB 2782, would make it mandatory. If it becomes law, it will pose some problems but offer benefits, members learned. Committee counsel and Secretary of State General Counsel Donald Kersey explained the main problem would be in some counties, city and county voting precincts don’t match. Kersey said code requires the local governments to respect their precinct boundaries – unless it’s not practicable. In some cases, “practically speaking the boundaries just haven’t been respected in the past,” he said. The bill mandated they work out the conflicts and its effective date, Jan. 1, 2026, gives them time to work them out, he said.</p>

It was then revived by a rarely used rule that allows for a bill to be recalled from one committee and referred to another. The Senate Revenue Committee, which was seen as more sympathetic to the bill, approved its passage on a 4-1 vote on Feb. 16. It then made its way through the Senate and passed on 19-11-1 vote after three readings on Feb. 24. Two amendments were adopted by the Senate. These included adding language about a qualified elector to specify who is already a registered voter and who is a new voter. The second amendment, brought about by Biteman, eliminated this language the following day.</p>
<p>HB131,<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0131"> prohibition on delivery of unsolicited ballot forms</a>, passed on its third reading and was signed by Senate President Driskill. If signed by the governor, the bill would prohibit anyone except a county clerk or the secretary of state’s office from distributing an absentee ballot request form. If signed into law, the act would be effective immediately.</p>
<p>Governor Mark Gordon has signed the following bills into law:<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0279"> HB279</a> requuires voters to provide identification to obtain an absentee ballot in person,<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0079"> HB79</a> states that a concealed carry permit, issued by the state of Wyoming, is an acceptable ID form when voting in person at a polling place or in person at an absentee polling place and<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0005"> HB5</a> that mends the definition of “registry list” to include a state-issued voter identification number, absentee ballot status and registration dates. Prior to this law, the registry list included only the list of names, addresses and party affiliations of registered voters in a precinct.</p>

In a filing this week, Lake’s attorneys focused on problems with ballot printers at some polling places in Maricopa County, which is home to more than 60% of the state’s voters. They alleged chaos created by the technical problems had disenfranchised Republican voters. They claimed the chain of custody for ballots was broken at an off-site facility and that the Arizona Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of proof in deciding Lake&#8217;s challenge. In the nearly four months since Lake’s defeat, the courts concluded she presented no evidence that voters whose ballots were unreadable by tabulators at polling places were not able to vote. Maricopa County officials declined to comment on Lake’s appeal. They have previously said everyone who experienced problems with ballot printers had a chance to vote. In rejecting her appeal two weeks ago, the state Court of Appeals said the only thing Lake had in backing up her claims about the tabulator problems was “sheer speculation.”</p>

In an amended lawsuit filed, the Election Integrity Project says laws passed over three decades “have systematically eroded (voting) rights by an onslaught of unconstitutional statutes and emergency regulations, which, taken together, have led to widespread election irregularities across California counties.” The actions responsible for the alleged damage include universal vote-by-mail — which doesn’t require voters to present identification, legalizing unrestricted “ballot harvesting” and allowing counties to treat vote-by-mail and in-person votes differently, according to the suit. The suit seeks an audit of all vote-by-mail ballots and ballot envelopes, duplicated ballots and other documents used to vote in all elections since the November 2020 election. It requests an order that defendants be ordered to preserve those materials for inspection, as well as all voting machines, software and other equipment used in voting in the state since that election. It also seeks a court ruling to find a number of state election laws passed over the years unconstitutional, and undisclosed damages.  According to the suit, the law changes have allowed a “large number” of vote-by-mail ballots to be sent to those who are ineligible.</p>

The details of the settlement were not immediately available, but a spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said no voters would be declared inactive or removed from the rolls in the process. Some observers, including Cantrell herself, have expressed concerns that the recall campaign’s legal challenge was a backdoor strategy to purge New Orleans voters from the rolls. But it appears the deal won’t change anyone’s voter status. Instead, the secretary of state will simply lower the threshold of the number of signatures the recall petition needs in order to trigger a general recall election. John Tobler, deputy secretary of communications with the Secretary of State’s office, said the threshold will be lowered as if 25,000 people were removed from the list of active New Orleans voters. But under the terms of the deal, which had not yet been signed by a judge, no one will be moved to the inactive voter list, he said. “No one’s being removed,” Tobler said. “Essentially, the total number of the electorate is going to be reduced by 25,000 … And that was an agreed upon number to sort of make both parties satisfied. But no one is being removed.” Tobler said that the deal and lower active voter count will only apply to the Cantrell recall petition, not future petitions or elections. Recall organizers have said they delivered boxes with almost 50,000 signatures to the Orleans Parish Registrar of Voters last week but no official number has so far been released. How the secretary of state’s office could unilaterally lower the signature requirement without auditing the rolls was also not clear.</p>

Joshua Macias and Antonio Lamotta were each sentenced to 11½ to 23 months behind bars but placed on immediate parole followed by at least two years of probation. Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons did not explain her reasoning but emphasized that the men are now barred from possessing guns and said she would reevaluate her decision if there was any evidence of their being near a firearm. Prosecutors had asked Clemons to impose a sentence of at least three years in prison. The men’s attorneys, meanwhile, said that incarceration was unnecessary and that their clients were being improperly villainized for their support of former President Donald Trump. The judge told them: “In two years, if you have no issues, you’re done” with the sentence.</p>

A host of reforms have been proposed, like opening primaries up to independent voters or implementing top-two, top-four, and even top-five systems. Yet, while primaries are often among the most consequential contests in American politics, voters are largely uninterested. Primary turnout in most races is abysmally low, and in some states is trending down. Are new forms of primaries part of the prescription for what ails American politics, and what can be done about low turnout? Join the Bipartisan Policy Center, election experts, and policymakers for a discussion examining primary turnout and reform, including new 50-state analysis of 2022 midterm primary turnout and the impact of reforms like Alaska’s new top-four system. <strong>When</strong>: March 9, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where</strong>: Online.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Philanthropy-Organizer-Consultant-RFP.pdf">Philanthropy-Organizer Consultant RFP</a>, Nonproft VOTE— Nonprofit VOTE is seeking an experienced consultant to act as the organizer and facilitator for the Philanthropy for Voter Engagement Initiative. This Initiative seeks to mobilize foundations to support voter engagement among their grantees and within their communities, both directly through grantmaking and indirectly through their actions. This Initiative is not about fundraising for any particular organization, but rather resourcing and supporting critical voter engagement work at nonprofits across the nation. Funding within the voter engagement space is often cyclical and narrowly focused on groups that do voter engagement work almost exclusively. Such a strategy fails to provide needed consistency and underutilizes the vast nonprofit infrastructure already in place in communities around the nation, including food pantries, housing clinics, family service agencies, community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and other nonprofits that have long-standing, year-around relations with the communities they serve. The long-term goal of the Initiative is to foster a philanthropic system that consistently supports and resources voter engagement among their grantees and broader community. The immediate objective is to build upon work that Nonprofit VOTE conducted in partnership with various philanthropy serving organizations (PSOs) to produce the Voter Engagement Toolkit for Foundations (both private and community foundation editions) in 2018. The toolkit to be updated identifies common strategies from direct funding of voter engagement work to the hosting trainings and revising overly-restrictive grant language. As the toolkits make clear, a foundation need not be a civic engagement funder to support voter engagement. There are roles for health funders, housing funders, environmental funders and most other types of funders to support voter engagement in a way that enables them and their grantees to more effectively deliver on their missions and strengthen the communities they serve. The Initiative consultant will work in close partnership with Nonprofit VOTE’s executive director and other key staff. <strong>Deadline:</strong> March 15. <strong>Application:</strong> For more information and to apply for this RFP,<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Philanthropy-Organizer-Consultant-RFP.pdf"> click here</a>.</p>
