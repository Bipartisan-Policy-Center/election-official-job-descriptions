														<p><strong>VVSG 2.0 Update<br />
</strong><em>EAC provides update to media on migration</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>This week, the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> provided the media with an update on the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines-vvsg-migration#Resources">migration to VVSG 2.0</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="186" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />All four EAC Commissioners made remarks during the briefing that covered the EAC’s ongoing work to keep elections safe and secure, with a focus on the EAC’s testing and certification process, an overview of VVSG and the path VVSG 2.0 migration in the years ahead.</p>
<p>The continued security of VVSG 1.0 systems, the future of VVSG 2.0, and role the EAC plays in support of state and local election officials throughout the migration process were also highlighted in the briefing.</p>
<p>The EAC&#8217;s commissioners adopted the newest standard, VVSG 2.0, on February 10, 2021. In November and December of 2002, <a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voting-system-test-laboratories-vstl">Voting System Test Labs</a> (VSTLs) were accredited to test to the latest standard and the EAC is now accepting voting systems for certification to VVSG 2.0.</p>
<p>On November 15, 2023, testing new systems against VVSG 1.0 will cease and all further testing of new systems will be done against VVSG 2.0 system standards.</p>
<p>“Enacting VVSG 2.0 was an important step in enhancing U.S. election security, which we all know is a national security imperative,” said Commission and EAC Vice Chairman Ben Hovland. “This was done not with the immediate elections in mind, but rather thinking many years down the line, trying to stay ahead of future threats.”</p>
<p>Hovland stressed that while moving forward all systems will be tested to the VVSG 2.0 standards, no system currently certified under VVSG 1.0 will be decertified.</p>
<p>“Election officials may continue to use or procure voting systems that have been certified to VVSG 1.0 and 1.1 in accordance with their state and local laws,” Hovland said. “I would like to reiterated that EAC-certified voting systems remain certified unless a formal process for decertification occurs. We remain confident in certified systems, regardless of which VVSG they were certified to.”</p>
<p>With the accreditation of the VSTLs, the EAC is now able to test and certify systems to VVSG 2.0 and Commissioner Tom Hicks said they have just reached an important milestone in that process—the first system has been submitted to the EAC and it is currently going through the process for certification to VVSG 2.0.</p>
<p>With one system already going through the certification process, reporters queried about the process for other systems. Chairwoman Christi McCormick noted that the EAC is not usually in communications with vendors, but that her understanding is that all of the manufacturers are work to submit to 2.0.</p>
<p>“It will take time for other new systems to be developed, certified, manufactured, and fielded for use in elections, particularly in an environment of constrained funding for state and local elections offices,” Hicks said. “We anticipate seeing VVSG 2.0 systems deployed in the years following the 2024 election, based on state and local procurement processes and decisions.”</p>
<p><strong>Help for Elections Officials<br />
</strong>The commissioners addressed what they are doing to help state and local elections officials navigate this process with the public and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>“The VVSG 2.0 migration process has been a top of director engagement with state and local officials for the better part of two years now,” Commission Donald Palmer said. “We understand that our voices together will do the most to amplify the communication to as many stakeholders and voters as possible.”</p>
<p>Palmer discussed the suite of resources available to elections officials including the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/Secure_Elections_Toolkit_Final_508.pdf">Secure Elections Toolkit</a> with plain language messaging and <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFdXFIl0og/LnlR1PId509eOzPe6ItW3Q/view?utm_content=DAFdXFIl0og&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink&amp;mode=preview">customizable graphics</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/security/EAC_Testing_and_Certification_508.pdf">Testing and Certification Factsheet</a>. The EAC also created a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines-vvsg-migration#Resources">dedicated landing page</a> on eac.gov that gives an overview of the migration process and provides links to the resources available.</p>
<p>The commissioners acknowledge the uphill battle state and local officials may experience with educating the public about this process. McCormick noted that the commission has worked to change some of the language it uses with regard to testing and certification so that it’s more plain English.</p>
<p>“One of the things we’ve learn in the last few years is that there are many pieces of the process  that the pub wasn’t familiar with,” Hovland said. “We continue to look for ways to build out materials and work with elections officials throughout the country [to better educate the public].”</p>

<em>National panel recommends 24 ways to protect integrity of 2024 elections</em></p>
<p>Two dozen of the nation’s leading experts on law, elections and information security — representing universities, <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />nonprofits and the private sector — have issued 24 recommendations for safeguarding the integrity of the 2024 U.S. elections.</p>
<p><a href="https://law.ucla.edu/24SDP">The report, titled “24 for ’24,”</a> was published today under the auspices of UCLA School of Law’s <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/academics/centers/safeguarding-democracy-project">Safeguarding Democracy Project</a>. It is aimed at ensuring access to the ballot for all eligible voters, protecting election integrity and enhancing the public’s confidence in the fairness of the election and the accuracy of the results. In it, the authors call for specific action from journalists, social media companies, government bodies, election officials, congressional and state leaders, and the general public.</p>
<p>The authors’ guidance is divided into four broad categories: legal, media and social media, politics and norms, and technology. Chief among the recommendations is that states strengthen laws to protect election officials from violence, threats of violence and intimidation.</p>
<p>“Since the 2020 election, election officials throughout the nation have faced increasingly more frequent threats of physical violence,” the authors write. “According to one recent poll, nearly one third of election officials have been ‘harassed, abused or threatened.’ … Nationwide, approximately 20% of local election officials have stated they may quit before the 2024 election in response to such threats, which would lead to substantial losses of institutional knowledge.”</p>
<p>“The United States’ election system continues to be under great stress, especially after the last election was conducted during a pandemic and with unprecedented attacks on the integrity of the election system,” said UCLA Professor Richard Hasen, who is also director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project and lead the work on the report. “I am hopeful that we have provided a road map for actionable steps that can and should be taken for a fair and legitimate 2024 election season.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3340" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Hasen, a UCLA professor of law and political science, is an internationally recognized election law expert and frequent commentator on American democracy and the courts. The Safeguarding Democracy Project promotes research, events and advocacy aimed at ensuring election integrity.</p>
<p>“Under the auspices of UCLA Law’s Safeguarding Democracy Project, Rick Hasen has led a stellar and diverse group with concrete suggestions that everyone committed to American democracy and fair elections should closely consider,” said Michael Waterstone, dean of UCLA School of Law.</p>
<p>The authors also advise that:</p>
<ul>
<li>News organizations and nonprofits should fund, develop and implement training workshops to improve reporters’ understanding of election processes and relevant election law, and to help develop relationships between election professionals and journalists. Special attention should be paid to helping local and non-English-language news outlets.</li>
<li>Nonprofit organizations and foundations should establish an independent, bipartisan commission well before the election to gather and amplify prominent pro-democracy voices warning against the erosion of core democratic norms. The commission should alert the public to instances of democratic erosion, encourage candidates and other political actors to embrace pro-democracy norms and weigh in after the election, if necessary, to promote the resolution of election disputes in a manner consistent with democratic principles.</li>
<li>Election administrators should review and strengthen measures to secure election systems against insider threats, such as mandatory background checks for vendors and staff with access to critical systems, access controls, and robust chain-of-custody procedures.</li>

The statement released September 7, the first time the libraries have joined to make such a public declaration, said Americans have a strong interest in supporting democratic movements and human rights around the world because &#8220;free societies elsewhere contribute to our own security and prosperity here at home.&#8221; &#8220;But that interest,&#8221; it said, &#8220;is undermined when others see our own house in disarray.&#8221; The joint message from presidential centers, foundations and institutes emphasized the need for compassion, tolerance and pluralism while urging Americans to respect democratic institutions and uphold secure and accessible elections. The statement noted that &#8220;debate and disagreement&#8221; are central to democracy but also alluded to the coarsening of dialogue in the public arena during an era when officials and their families are receiving death threats. &#8220;Civility and respect in political discourse, whether in an election year or otherwise, are essential,&#8221; it said. The statement stopped short of calling out individuals, but it still marked one of the most substantive acknowledgments that people associated with the nation&#8217;s former presidents are worried about the country&#8217;s trajectory. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s great concern about the state of our democracy at this time,&#8221; Mark Updegrove, CEO of the LBJ Foundation, which supports the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas told<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/presidential-centers-warn-of-fragile-state-of-us-democracy/7258066.html"> Voice of America</a>. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to go much farther than January 6 to realize that we are in a perilous state.&#8221; The bipartisan statement was signed by the Hoover Presidential Foundation, the Roosevelt Institute, the Truman Library Institute, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, the LBJ Foundation, the Richard Nixon Foundation, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation, the Carter Center, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, the George &amp; Barbara Bush Foundation, the Clinton Foundation, the George W. Bush Presidential Center and the Obama Presidential Center. Those organizations all support presidential libraries created under the Presidential Library Act of 1955, along with the Eisenhower Foundation. The Eisenhower Foundation chose not to sign, and it said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press: &#8220;The Eisenhower Foundation has respectfully declined to sign this statement. It would be the first common statement that the presidential centers and foundations have ever issued as a group, but we have had no collective discussion about it, only an invitation to sign.&#8221;</p>

The return to the building also included the unveiling of a new painting that hangs high on the lobby walls.<a href="https://vtsuffrage2020.org/the-light-of-truth-upon-them/"> &#8220;The Light of Truth Upon Them&#8221;</a> is an oil canvas that commemorates more than 100 years of the 19th Amendment being passed. It details women&#8217;s fight to have an equal part in American democracy. When Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas now walks into her office building, she said her eyes are drawn to the banner at the top that reads &#8220;Hard Won, Not Done.&#8221; Cynthia Cagle is the local artist that created the piece. She explained that painting these powerful women figures was an emotional process.  &#8220;These women were more than just activists,&#8221; Cagle said. &#8220;They were rebels, agitators, and warriors. Members of the BIPOC community for whom access to vote was barred in so many ways. They fought not just for women’s rights to vote, but the right to vote for all.” The Vermont Suffrage Centennial Alliance commissioned the project.</p>

Blobby is a cartoon blob and social media influencer leading the state’s Voting in Oregon Feels Good campaign. According to the Oregon Secretary of State’s office, the accounts will “use humor and meme content to reach a broader audience with our office’s accurate election information” in an effort to increase voter participation. The team will also use the accounts to share PSAs that they hope will “pre-bunk” false election information. The videos are animated and channel the same informative messaging of Smokey the Bear, which former Secretary Shemia Fagan said was an influence at the start of the campaign in October 2022. “Research shows that once a person forms a belief about elections it’s very hard to change their mind,” Fagan said when the campaign was first announced. “When Oregonians know all the steps elections workers take to protect the integrity of our elections, it completely undercuts the conspiracy theories from proponents of the Big Lie.”</p>

Joining Franklin Tomorrow in sponsoring the contest were the city of Franklin and its Public Arts Commission, as well as the Williamson County Election Commission, which will use the sticker designs during the October election cycle for both early voting and on election day, Oct. 24. The top vote getter in the youth category was a design by Maia Bowers, who is an eighth-grader. Her design featured patriotic colors of red, white and blue as well as the Tennessee tri-star flag with the words “I Voted” in cursive. Matthew Mattheiss had the top design in the adult category with the “I” in his design framed against a columned building similar to the Historic Williamson County Courthouse. His design also featured the tri-star circle at the top and is in red, white and blue.</p>

The bill, called<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB969"> AB 969</a>, got a final vote Friday as it easily passed through the California legislature, where Democrats hold a supermajority in both houses. Now it awaits the governor&#8217;s signature. If enacted, the bill would ban hand-counting in established elections with more than 1,000 registered voters, or more than 5,000 registered voters for special elections. Those rules would only be relaxed if a natural disaster or emergency prevents an electronic voting system from working, such as a wildfire or power outage. AB 969 would also ban counties from terminating a voting system without signing a contract for a new one.</p>
<p>A bill to<a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/election/california-bill-to-simplify-language-for-ballot-referendums-signed-into-law/"> change the language on ballots for state referendums</a> in order to make it clear what voters are deciding with their choice was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom.<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB421"> Assembly Bill 421</a>, which was introduced by Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, originally sought to make major changes to the state’s referendum process, which is used to overturn laws passed by legislators. Among the changes it proposed included requirements for those out collecting signatures for these measures to register and receive training with the Secretary of State, and to disclose if they are volunteers or paid. It would also implement a three-year ban if someone violates the law. However, most of the original provisions were scrapped by legislators as it was amended. The version of the bill that was signed into law Friday focused on one change: changing the options for referendums from “yes” and “no” to “keep the law” and “overturn the law.” The new language is expected to take effect next year, just in time for the 2024 ballot. It will not impact language for local referendum measures, according to state officials. Puzzling language used for state referendums have been a long-standing issue for voters. Under current law, voters are required to vote “yes” to oppose repealing the law. On the other hand, a “no” vote means that they support the referendum.</p>

An initiative including a broad array of actions was ordered by the L.A. County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, Sept. 12. The L.A. County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk is required to increase engagement with diverse communities in the county, where some 200 languages other than English are spoken in immigrant households. “We must consistently fine-tune and enhance how we are engaging with these voters,” said First District Supervisor Hilda Solis, who co-authored the motion with Fourth District Supervisor Janice Hahn. It was adopted unanimously. The supervisors directed Clerk-Recorder, Registrar of Voters Dean Logan to work more closely with nonprofit groups representing non-English speaking and limited English-proficient voters. He’s been directed to find places for more in-person voting centers and is empowered to provide cash incentives to hire bilingual poll workers. Logan must report back to the supervisors in 45 days on a plan to improve voting materials and voting access in multi-ethnic enclaves. “These will soon become a majority minority in the next few years,” said Solis. The Registrar-Recorder is required to produce a post-election report after the March 2024 presidential primary and the November 2024 presidential election.</p>

The vote to reduce the supervisor of elections office&#8217;s total proposed budget by $318,223 was approved by a 3-2 vote last week during the county commission&#8217;s first of two budget hearings. The change was proposed by District 3 Commissioner John Tobia, who will be running against Bobanic in a Republican primary for supervisor of elections next year. &#8220;This is political gamesmanship at its best, and he is campaigning from the dais,&#8221; Bobanic said in an interview after the meeting, noting that the mailing of sample ballots had not been questioned by commissioners in previous years. &#8220;What&#8217;s different? What&#8217;s changed? His name will be on the ballot, running for my job.&#8221;</p>

Punishment would be up to five years in prison or a fine of up to $1,000. State Rep. Kara Hope, D-Holt testified in favor of her legislation this week before the House Elections Committee. Her husband is Delhi Township clerk and he has told her as political tensions increase, they’re taking a toll on the regular folks who keep the voting process afloat year after year. “He’s found that some people who have been election workers for a long time – who are maybe seniors – have their children telling them, ‘Mom or Dad, I don’t want you to go into the polling place this year,’” she told MLive. Poll challengers, the politically-appointed observers of election processes, would likely not be covered by these protections, she told the committee. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who received threats after the 2020 election, also testified in support of Hope’s bills. False claims about voting have eroded trust in the process, she said, and turned people against public servants.</p>

The suggestions made Tuesday, Sept. 12, by Ottawa County Board Chair Joe Moss and Co-chair Sylvia Rhodea were part of last-minute discussions around a countywide plan by local governments to meet requirements of Michigan’s new early voting law, which goes into effect next year. While the board’s authority is relegated to approving or denying the county’s expenditures related to the plan, Moss pulled the item from consideration Tuesday to have a discussion around changes he and Rhodea want to see in the plan. The early voting plan has already been approved by nearly all local governments in Ottawa County. The changes proposed by Moss and Rhodea would require use of watermarked ballots and livestreaming early voting polling places and ballot boxes. They say the changes would further election integrity and transparency, but it would potentially bind local clerks to election changes outlined by the county board leaders. The meeting ended with no clear direction on what Moss may seek to require in the agreement, or offer as an addendum, for the board to possibly approve it at the next meeting on Sept. 26.</p>

The bill has raised concerns among voting rights advocates and Democrats in the GOP-controlled state legislature. Among the changes the bill would make, voted ballots and something called cast vote records, or CVRs, would be accessible by public records requests. Under<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_163/GS_163-165.1.html"> current state law</a>, such confidential records are publicly available by court order only. The bill is modeled on legislation drafted by the North Carolina Election Integrity Team, or NCEIT, which is a chapter of the Election Integrity Network, an organization founded by Cleta Mitchell. Mitchell is a North Carolina-based attorney and notorious for her role in trying to help Donald Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Ann Webb, policy director for Common Cause North Carolina — a civil and voting rights advocacy group — does not totally disagree with Womack and backers of making CVRs more publicly accessible. “We fully support transparency in elections and election audits,” Webb told the committee in a public comment period, adding that she appreciated the slowing down of the legislative process on this bill. Through its legal counsel, the State Board of Elections submitted some recommendations to the bill sponsors, including that they remove an entire section of the proposed legislation. The bill as written would seemingly enable counties and their local elections boards to circumvent the state elections board’s authority and dispense with vote tabulating machines altogether in favor of hand counting ballots.</p>

Each of the supporters provides no data or statistics backing up their claims that voters are gaming the system. Ohioans have a choice going into primary election day. Right now, voters are able to pick whether they want a Republican, Democratic or an unaffiliated ballot that day. &#8220;It&#8217;s time that we really modernize the way that we do voter registration in party primaries in the state of Ohio,&#8221; Sec. of State Frank LaRose said. LaRose joined Republicans in introducing<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/sb147"> Senate Bill 147</a>, which would close Ohio’s primaries. It would require voters to register with a political party 30 days before the election to be able to vote on that ballot. This would prevent political “gamesmanship,” according to state Sen. Michele Reynolds (R-Canal Winchester) and state Rep. Thomas Hall (R-Madison Twp.) Hall introduced<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb208"> House Bill 208</a>, the companion legislation. Voting rights advocates say the legislation is another way to suppress voters. If a voter doesn&#8217;t register with a party in time, they will have to vote with a nonpartisan ballot, which won’t have any candidates on it.</p>

In the 3-1 executive session vote by paper ballot, the Senate Committee on Shared Revenue, Elections and Consumer Protection<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wisconsin-lawmakers-vote-to-boot-elections-chief-targeted-by-conspiracy-theorists/"> decided not to reappoint Meagan Wolfe</a> as the administrator of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission. The committee vote sends her appointment to the full Senate, which could take up the matter as soon as Thursday. Senator Mark Spreitzer, a Democrat from Beloit who sits on the five-person committee, confirmed through a spokesperson the result of the vote Monday afternoon — with Spreitzer as the lone “yes” vote in favor of Wolfe. Echoing the opinions of Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and the Wisconsin Legislative Council, Spreitzer said Wolfe’s nomination is not properly before the Senate because a majority of the six-member WEC did not vote on her appointment and formally send it to the legislature. Despite the commission’s deadlock, GOP senators vowed to move forward with Wolfe’s confirmation anyway, a process that took another step forward Monday and brings her appointment closer to being settled with a lawsuit, an outcome lawmakers and others have acknowledged as a likelihood.</p>

The state&#8217;s request concerned the decision by three federal judges in Birmingham who found that the map approved by the Republican-led state legislature to set the boundaries of Alabama&#8217;s seven U.S. House districts was unlawfully biased against Black voters and must be redrawn. That map was devised after the Supreme Court in June blocked a previous version, also for weakening the voting power of Black Alabamians. The Supreme Court in its 5-4 June ruling ordered state lawmakers to add a second House district with a Black majority &#8211; or close to it &#8211; in order to comply with the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. Black voters tend to favor Democratic candidates. Following that ruling, the legislature adopted a plan that increased the portion of Black voters in a second House district from around 30% to 40%, still well below a majority. The three-judge panel on Tuesday ruled that the new map failed to remedy the Voting Rights Act violation present in the first map and directed a special master &#8211; an independent party appointed by a court &#8211; to draw a new, third version of the map ahead of next year&#8217;s congressional elections.</p>

And the essential elements of the new claim, this one to Maricopa County Superior Court, remain the same as those the state&#8217;s high court refused to consider. The supporters&#8217; attorney, Ryan Heath, contends now, as he did then, that it was illegal for Maricopa County to verify signatures on early ballots by comparing them with images from prior early ballots. He argues Arizona law says the only valid comparison has to be with the person&#8217;s original voter registration. What he has now that he did not last month is a ruling by Yavapai County Superior Court John Napper in a similar case seemingly agreeing with the argument. But that decision, while providing legal fodder to support Heath&#8217;s theory about ballot signature verification, is not final. Moreover, in the Yavapai County case, the Arizona Free Enterprise Club and Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections are seeking only a declaratory judgment prohibiting recorders from using anything but original voter registration records when verifying early ballots in future elections.</p>
<p>Cochise County Supervisor Tom Crosby filed a lawsuit against Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, Attorney General Kris Mayes, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, and Maricopa County Election officials claiming that Arizona’s largest county<a href="https://www.azpm.org/p/headlines/2023/9/11/217427-cochise-supervisor-files-suit-against-state-and-maricopa-county-officals-over-2022-election/"> failed to follow the procedure</a> to verify 1.3 million mail-in ballot signatures in the 2022 election. Crosby filed suit last week in a personal capacity along with Maricopa County resident David Mast.  Together, they claim that Maricopa County Elections staff compared signatures on electors’ mail-in-ballots to the most recent historical signatures submitted by those voters and not to the signatures on each elector’s voter registration form they used to register to vote, which Crosby and Mast assert is required by Arizona law. Crosby and Mast seek to have the court force Maricopa County to conduct a recount of all the mail-in ballots in the 2022 election or conduct yet another election for Governor, Attorney General, and Propositions 308 and 309. A court date has yet to be set.</p>

At issue was whether the bar code-based system allows voters &#8220;to verify in a private and independent manner the votes selected by the voter on the ballot before the ballot is cast&#8221; as described in Arkansas Code 7-5-504, which sets the standards for machine operations under the state Election Code. Dismissing the lawsuit, Circuit Judge Tim Fox ruled that the system does provide that verification opportunity as required by law because voters are given printed ballots to cast once they&#8217;ve selected their choices from the computer system. &#8220;This format completely and totally complies with that [language],&#8221; he said. &#8220;They [voters] got to look at that information. The voter has been given the opportunity to confirm their ballot.&#8221; The law is &#8220;clear and unambiguous&#8221; so the question comes down to either yes, the system complies with the law, or no, it does not, the judge said. &#8220;This is the crux of the lawsuit,&#8221; Fox said. &#8220;I am ruling that &#8230; this mechanism gives the voter the opportunity to verify in a private and independent manner the votes selected by the voter on the ballot before the ballot is cast.&#8221;</p>

His time is concurrent with a jail sentence for a 2021 DUI conviction. He was fined $750 and ordered to pay $745.50 in court costs.

The latest election law they’re targeting, effective June 15, makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly spread false information with the intent to impede or prevent people from voting if issued within 60 days of an election.  The law doesn’t target policy disputes or claims about candidates, but, rather, dirty tricks like spreading lies about how and when to vote and who is eligible, which have long been employed to suppress voting, often in Black neighborhoods. It’s now a gross misdemeanor — punishable by up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine — to spread false information about the “time, place or manner of holding an election”; restrictions on voter eligibility; and threats to physical safety associated with voting. The<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/02/14/election-bill-that-would-make-it-easier-to-vote-moving-through-legislature/"> provision</a> was part of the Democracy for the People Act. The misinformation lawsuit contends that people who believe and continue to say felons still serving sentences don’t have the right to vote could reasonably fear prosecution for doing so, and fear retaliation from felons bringing lawsuits against them. The lawsuit claims the law targets political and campaign speech and gives too much power to the attorney general, county attorneys and “any person injured.”   Secretary of State Steve Simon has said he thinks the law has enough safeguards to protect First Amendment rights because a prosecutor would have to prove the intent to impede someone from voting, which is a high bar.</p>

The Department of Justice&#8217;s argument is largely in line with other opponents of the suit, pushing back on the idea of an alleged tension between state and federal law regarding these ballots.  Burleigh County Auditor Mark Splonskowski and the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which bills itself as a nonprofit dedicated to election integrity, filed the initial suit in early July against state Election Director Erika White. In a Statement of Interest filed Monday, the Department of Justice indicated that it doesn’t see a conflict between federal and state laws.  The U.S. Attorney General’s office is allowed to address issues that pertain to “the issues of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States,” according to the filing. The office’s argument is twofold: First, that counting ballots postmarked on or before Election Day is not in violation of federal law, and second, that an absentee ballot deadline like the one North Dakota has in place, which allows for counting after Election Day, protects the rights of overseas Americans and military personnel.</p>

The case involves actions taken by two of three Fulton County, Pennsylvania, Commissioners – Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch – who sought to have Dominion voting equipment examined by a third party after the 2020 election. They claimed they did so to consider whether to continue to use the voting machines. Multiple outside firms were ultimately given unauthorized access to voting systems in Fulton County after the 2020 election without authorization from the Board of Elections, according to court filings in the special master probe. The third county commissioner only learned that an outside firm had been allowed to inspect the election equipment until after it was done, court filings show. Months after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered the protective order, the commissioners allowed another party  to inspect the voting equipment without the knowledge of the state, according to court papers. After the completion of that report, the county moved to sue Dominion, arguing that the machines were not fit for their intended use and purpose.  When Pennsylvania state officials brought the action to the attention of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the court issued sanctions. It ordered the county officials to pay attorney’s fees and referred their attorney Thomas Carroll to Pennsylvania’s attorney disciplinary board. The court also ordered the Dominion voting equipment to be placed in the custody of a neutral agent.  The commissioners had asked the US Supreme Court to freeze those sanctions while the justices considered whether to take up the commissioners’ appeal. The court rejected the request. No dissents were noted in the court’s order.</p>

The lengthy roster  of plaintiffs will argue certain provisions of the new law made it harder for voters of color to cast ballots, with some alleging the effect was intentional. More than 20 state and national organizations brought a collective five lawsuits against the law, often referred to as Senate Bill 1, that have been consolidated into this case. The groups claim several provisions of the law violate federal laws including the Voting Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act and the First, 14th, and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The trial is expected to go until late October, and U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez may not issue a decision until months later. Experts say it’s unclear and too soon to tell whether a decision will come in time to affect elections and voting in 2024, especially since appeals could draw the process out.</p>

The legal battle is playing out in King County Superior Court, where a trio of liberal nonprofit groups filed a lawsuit in November, arguing that the signature rejections are subjective and unconstitutional, tossing out thousands of legitimate votes while doing next to nothing to ferret out the rare instances of actual fraud. In response, elections officials, including Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, have defended the signature checks, warning in dire terms that scrapping them could lead to a total collapse of election integrity and potentially scuttle the state’s all-mail voting system. A key court hearing is set for this week, at which the opposing sides will seek to persuade Judge Mark Larrañaga to rule in their favor without proceeding to a trial.</p>
