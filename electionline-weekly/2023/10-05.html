							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month</strong><br />
<em>CISA and EI-ISAC mark five years</em></p>
<p>While this month marks the 20th Anniversary of<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month"> Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a>, it wasn’t until 2017 that the U<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">.S. Department of Homeland Security</a> designated<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/313132-dhs-designates-election-systems-as-critical-infrastructure/"> elections as critical infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Following the critical infrastructure designation in 2017, in 2018 Congress<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/416567-key-cyber-bill-cementing-cybersecurity-agency-at-dhs-heads-to-trumps/"> approved legislation</a> creating the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA).</p>
<p>Also that year, the<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac"> Election Infrastructure Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center</a> (EI-ISAC) was founded as part of the  <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center of Internet Security</a>. The EI-ISAC is a community of dedicated election officials and cybersecurity professionals working side-by-side to ensure the integrity of elections among U.S. state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5640" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png" alt="" width="300" height="77" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-768x197.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo.png 820w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Combined, CISA and the EI-ISAC are the go-to organizations for state and local elections officials with regard to election security, especially cybersecurity.</p>
<p>With so much focus, and rightly so, on physical threats to election security, it’s still important to focus on cyberthreats.</p>
<p>Marci Andino, Senior Director of EI-ISAC noted that it’s critical to establish a culture of cybersecurity awareness among staff — including poll workers and seasonal staff.</p>
<p>“Humans have always been, and continue to be, the weakest link in our cybersecurity defenses,” Andino said. “Cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility, and we must be prepared to recognize and report cyberattacks quickly. Security awareness is only part of the equation though, and ensuring you are maintaining essential cyber hygiene practices and collaborating with your election peers across the country are also critical elements of securing your election office.”</p>
<p>Both CISA and the EI-ISAC offer a plethora of services, resources, tools and trainings to establish a secure elections office.</p>
<p>These range from regular email updates on important updates and newly-identified vulnerabilities in popular software packages, as well as “last mile” information and assistance with transitioning to<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2021/04-15/"> key safeguards like the .GOV domain</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Not just at the office</strong><br />
Cybersecurity Awareness Month is also a good time to consider the personal online security of elections officials and their familes. To that end, CISA along with the National Cybersecurity Alliance is focusing this year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month on “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world">Secure Our World</a>,” specifically aimed at educating the public on how to stay safe online.</p>
<p>CISA challenges everyone to help secure our world by adopting four simple steps that everyone can take to stay safe online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords that are long, random, and unique to each account, and use a password manager to generate them and to save them.</li>
<li>Turn on multifactor authentication on all accounts that offer it. We need more than a password on our most important accounts, like email, social media, and financial accounts.</li>
<li>Recognize and report phishing, as we like to say, think before you click. Be cautious of unsolicited emails or texts or calls asking you for personal information, and don&#8217;t click on links or open attachments from unknown sources.</li>
<li>Update software. In fact, enable automatic updates on software so the latest security patches keep devices we are connected to continuously up to date.</li>
</ul>

The series’ lessons incorporate not only physical accessibility, such as creating accessible polling places, but also promote ways election administrators can create accessible websites, social media, other electronic communications, and forums. The series’ broadly applicable guidance adheres to accessibility laws nationwide. The EAC’s video training series promotes ways election workers can reduce this and other obstacles to accessibility, no matter a jurisdiction’s size or resources. NCAM, which worked with the EAC on the series, is a national leader in making digital media accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

Local elections were held throughout the state. The U<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2023/10/03/us-justice-department-monitoring-elections-on-alaskas-north-slope-and-in-dillingham-kusilvak-areas/">.S. Department of Justice</a> monitored local elections in three rural Alaska regions to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Turnout varied throughout the state. In the<a href="https://www.webcenterfairbanks.com/2023/10/04/fnsb-residents-head-polls-2023-municipal-elections/"> Fairbanks North Star Borough</a> Susan Yannish, Chair of Fairbanks #1 Precinct, helped at a polling place at the Carlson Center. “We’ve had a really good turnout today,” she said in spite of the<a href="https://www.newsminer.com/news/local_news/fairbanks-borough-residents-head-to-the-polls-for-municipal-elections/article_29c5cf92-6266-11ee-99df-1f6298a83de1.html"> snow</a>. In<a href="https://www.kbbi.org/local-news/2023-10-03/municipal-elections-underway-across-the-kenai-peninsula"> Homer</a>, election worker Pam Brodie saw more people than she expected come out to vote. “It&#8217;s been going well in that it&#8217;s been very steady and very busy, so we have had no time to read magazines or anything,” she said. “we&#8217;re just dealing with the public all the time, but the lines are not too long.”<a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2023/10/02/voting-in-juneaus-election-ends-tomorrow-night-what-happens-next/"> Juneau</a> City Clerk Beth McEwen spent the time leading up to the election educating voters about the process and why it takes a while to get those results in. “Starting on Election Night at 8 p.m., we will actually start to scan those ballots and adjudicate them,” said City Clerk Beth McEwen. “Adjudication means we’re going to actually have human eyes on those ballots, looking to make sure the machine counted the vote the way the ballot appears to have been cast.” The<a href="https://www.adn.com/arctic-sounder/news/2023/10/04/election-results-for-mostly-uncontested-northwest-arctic-borough-races-start-trickling-in/"> Northwest Arctic Borough</a> was still compiling results. The borough also hadn’t received results from Selawik as of Wednesday morning borough clerk Stella Atoruk said. “Selawik had phone issues last night,” Atoruk said. “Bering Air was on hold this morning due to ice fog and awaiting bags from all the villages.”</p>

SIPI is a federally funded tribal college.  The college&#8217;s latest enrollment data from Spring 2023 shows the student body is comprised primarily of students from the Navajo Nation, followed by Pueblo of San Filipe, Kewa Pueblo, Pueblo of Jamez, Pueblo of Laguna and White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation. “Voting is essential for a healthy democracy and the protection of liberty. SIPI’s new office will increase voter access to basic information and provide education on the registration process,” said Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland in a press release.  “The new office is an important move that will allow more people to participate in a process that should be easily accessible to everyone.”</p>

Which is what makes this story troubling. According to NBC News, Twitter/X has slashed the number of people on its disinformation and election integrity team just weeks after it said it was hiring for new positions to help it guard against foreign interference. The cuts included Aaron Rodericks, the head of the team. The person familiar with the cuts said four people had been let go — the entirety of X&#8217;s election integrity unit in its Dublin office. It&#8217;s unclear how many people remain on the team. Twitter/X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Elon Musk appeared to confirm the cuts in a post on Twitter/X. The cuts are part of X&#8217;s broader pullback from its efforts to address false information and foreign interference that once ran rampant on the platform. Musk has also aggressively criticized the company’s previous moderation efforts, releasing internal documents that he and conservative commentators have claimed showed a liberal bent to how it handled elections and misinformation. &#8220;Decimating their election integrity team — on top of last year’s firings — means that X will continue to be a toxic hellscape that people and advertisers should avoid,” said Kyle Morse, the deputy executive director of the Tech Oversight Project.</p>

According to The Washington Post, the 2016 presidential election made clear to Bassin that “we were living through a global democratic recession,” he says. Protect Democracy was his response. The organization’s software VoteShield is designed to fight election fraud. Its National Task Force on Election Crises prepares for unprecedented election catastrophes. Its Law for Truth project files defamation lawsuits to help people harmed by conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. MacArthur fellows receive a grant of $800,000 over five years to spend however they want. Fellows are nominated and endorsed by their peers and communities through an often yearslong process that the foundation oversees. They do not apply and are never officially interviewed for the fellowship before it’s awarded.</p>

Gavin Newsom signed into law a bill that<a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2023/10/04/gov-newsom-signs-bill-to-essentially-ban-hand-counts-in-elections/71065022007/"> bans hand counts in elections</a> in all but the smallest jurisdictions in California, setting up what could be a political and legal collision in Shasta County over whether manual or machine tallying will happen in the next election in November. AB 969, which targeted Shasta County’s controversial move to eliminate machine tallies in local elections, was signed by Newsom on Oct. 4. The bill is an urgency statute, so it takes effect immediately. Passed by the state Assembly last month, the bill, now law, bans the manual counting of ballots in elections with more than 1,000 registered voters. There are more than 110,000 registered voters in Shasta County. Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, D-Santa Cruz, authored the bill weeks after Shasta supervisors in late January voted 3-2 to terminate the county’s contract with Dominion Voting Systems. Shasta County Board of Supervisors Chairman Patrick Jones said Wednesday he had been expecting the governor to sign the bill. The new law will not affect Shasta County’s plans to hand count ballots in the November 2023 and presidential primary election in March 2024, Jones said. “I&#8217;ve asked legal counsel to weigh in on this. And I believe that it does not affect Shasta County,” Jones said. “We already made that decision to get away from machines in January and February. We have been waiting this entire time for the Secretary of State, which she said she would approve a hand tabulation plan. She has yet to do so. So she&#8217;s simply dragging her feet on this. But we have already made our decision. And a majority of the board has already spoken.”</p>

The Shasta County counsel calls the ordinance “legally insufficient” and “unenforceable.” A report to supervisors about the ordinance states, &#8220;County Counsel has reviewed the proposed ordinance, found it legally insufficient and unenforceable, and therefore has not approved it as to form.&#8221; Supervisors established the Citizens Election Advisory Committee on Sept. 12. The first-of-its kind citizens election group with the proposed oversight powers has some worried about the potential it has of taking away some of Cathy Darling Allen&#8217;s authority as county Registrar of Voters, an elected position. Darling Allen said she was not consulted about the ordinance or asked to speak about it at Tuesday&#8217;s meeting. Among the duties and actions the ordinance gives the committee are: Make reports to supervisors and/or the citizens election committee; Observe, inspect and examine elections records and documents for accuracy and completeness; Committee members will collaborate to receive, investigate and respond to citizens&#8217; complaints; Ask questions of elections officials and receive timely answers; Per authorization from the board chair — in this case Jones — contact the county counsel to request subpoenas. Supervisor Tim Garman calls the ordinance government overreach. “We have no reason to do any of this. It’s just another waste of money,” Garman said.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6763" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MICap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MICap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MICap.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Michigan:</strong> The House has approved a bill that would allow<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/28/michigan-elections-overseas-ballot-transmission-military-members-transportation-to-the-polls/70992908007/"> spouses and children of overseas military members</a> to return their ballot electronically beginning in 2025. The electronic return bill for military members and their families stationed outside of the U.S., sponsored by Rep. Carol Glanville, D-Walker, would require Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office to develop a secure web portal and rules capable of securing those electronic ballots by Aug. 1, 2025. The system would require the returned ballot to match the voter’s signature on file and require all electronic ballots be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The electronic voting measure for military members is an expansion of a bill passed in October 2022 when Republicans controlled the Legislature. That legislation, however, would have been limited to overseas military members only — not family members stationed with them — and was supposed to take effect in 2024. The bill would require overseas military members and their families to submit a paper ballot in addition to their electronic one. While the electronic ballot has to be in by 8 p.m. on Election Day, individuals who didn’t receive an absentee ballot within 45 days of the election, a requirement under current law, would have additional days to submit their paper ballot past the six-day cushion allowed under Prop 2.</p>
<p>A separate bill would remove a mandate requiring clerks to challenge any ballot submitted by someone who registered within 14 days of an election. The<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/28/michigan-elections-overseas-ballot-transmission-military-members-transportation-to-the-polls/70992908007/"> required challenge</a> – which mandates the voter to show photo identification, other proof of identity or a signed affidavit attesting to their identity – has been a burden to clerks in the years since a 2018 proposal allowed for same-day registration, supporters said. Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou, D-East Lasning, said the challenged ballots are particularly problematic in college towns where young voters are “hoping to vote where they currently live rather than in their hometowns.” Clerks’ mandated challenge of the ballot has revealed zero cases of election fraud, she said. Another aspect of the legislation would eliminate bans on a third-party hiring transportation companies to cart voters to the polls. The state law has been unsuccessfully challenged in prior court battles.</p>

Mark Walczyk, R-Watertown, has introduced legislation he believes will help combat a new trend. Currently,<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/politics/2023/09/29/bill-would-make-impersonating-an-elections-official-a-felony"> impersonating any official</a> is a misdemeanor in New York but the legislator&#8217;s bill would make it a felony to impersonate elections officials. The legislation follows a report from the New York state Board of Elections said there have been cases reported in 13 counties where voters were approached about their registration allegedly by people impersonating elections officials. &#8220;This is a crime that we want to take very seriously in the state of New York because the defense of our republic and the way we do democracy in the state of New York is in the balance here,&#8221; he said. Walczyk said he feels confident about the bill&#8217;s chance at passage this session. He said he already has co-sponsors and doesn&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a partisan issue. The League of Women Voters and the Democratic caucus chair of the state Elections Commissioners Association said they&#8217;re supportive.</p>

Roy Cooper<a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/nc-gov-cooper-vetoes-bill-giving-legislators-all-appointments-to-state-and-local-elections-boards/"> vetoed a bill that restructures state and local elections boards</a> to give legislators more power.  In a statement, Cooper said<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/s749"> Senate Bill 479</a> could lead to gridlock and the risk that Republicans or courts could change election results they don’t like.  The bill strips governors of all appointments to the state Board of Elections and gives them to legislative leaders. As it stands now, the governor appoints all five state Board of Elections members, choosing from state political party nominees. The governor’s party holds three of the five seats.  Under the bill Cooper vetoed, the State Board of Elections would expand to eight members, with four members appointed by Republican legislative leaders and four appointed by Democratic leaders. Democrats and Republicans would get two appointments to four-member local elections boards.</p>

Under the bipartisan proposals,<a href="https://www.apg-wi.com/rice_lake_chronotype/news/legislation-to-protect-election-workers-moves-forward-at-wisconsin-capitol/article_03e98b82-5e25-11ee-9578-d3b39d2e35d1.html"> attacks on election workers</a> would become a felony, election workers would have access to whistleblower protections and voters would receive text message updates about the status of their absentee ballots. “Election workers are the backbone of successful elections and deserve to operate without fear for their personal safety or job security,” said André Jacque, R-DePere, who co-authored the bill, at a public hearing of the Senate Committee on Shared Revenue, Elections and Consumer Protection on Tuesday. It would also make it a Class I felony to intentionally harm an election worker. Currently, most forms of battery are Class A misdemeanors, but this bill would provide special protections for election workers. It would also make certain information about election officials private to prevent doxing, or the sharing of personal information about a person online. And it offers whistleblower protection to election workers who lawfully report what they reasonably believe to be voting irregularities or fraud.</p>
<p>Republicans on the Wisconsin Senate Committee on Shared Revenue, Elections and Consumer Protection voted 3-2 to<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/10/03/senate-election-committee-denies-appointment-of-dem-election-commissioner-over-administrator-vote/"> deny the appointment</a> of Joseph Czarnezki, a Democrat, to the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) because of his participation in an effort to keep WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe in her job. Czarnezki, the former Milwaukee County clerk and a former state senator, was nominated by Gov. Tony Evers to a commission seat that is statutorily required to be held by a Democratic former clerk. The status of his nomination is still dependent upon a vote of the full Senate. He can remain on the commission until the Senate vote.</p>
<p>Democrats introduced a<a href="https://www.wkow.com/news/state-democrats-introduce-bills-designed-to-encourage-voter-participation/article_f3bd867c-6267-11ee-8bd2-5f2a5d5f74a7.html"> slew of bills</a> they say are designed to encourage participation in voting in Wisconsin. One bill provides <a href="https://www.gazettextra.com/beloit-democrat-proposes-automatic-voter-registration/article_bb6115ae-6312-11ee-9c97-3769219ebabf.html">automatic voter registration</a>. Another makes it easier for high school students to obtain voting information and register to vote. A third requires elected state officials to work as election officials when they&#8217;re not on the ballot.</p>

The panel of three wrote that CISA “used its frequent interactions with social media platforms to push them to adopt more restrictive policies on election-related speech,” revising an injunction issued last month. The decision bars CISA, its director, Jen Easterly, and several other top agency officials from taking actions that “coerce or significantly encourage” tech companies to remove or reduce the spread of posts. CISA, which was established in 2018, has played a prominent role in efforts to secure elections from online threats, in part through communicating with social media companies during the 2020 elections. The ruling clears the way for the Supreme Court to decide whether to take the case, after the Justice Department asked the justices to put the 5th Circuit ruling on hold. It’s a significant reversal of a September decision by the same panel of judges, which found that though CISA flagged posts to the platforms, there was not sufficient evidence that the agency’s activities crossed the line and were coercion.</p>

Plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in Tuscaloosa federal court against the absentee election managers of Jefferson, Mobile and Tuscaloosa counties. The suit claims the counties violate federal law by not providing an accessible way to mark and return absentee ballots. While blind voters and voters who have trouble reading print use screen readers or magnification programs to vote independently and privately, according to the organization, the counties being sued do not have remote vote-by-mail systems that allow those technologies to be used. Such technology exists to allow those voters to read, mark and return absentee ballots electronically, according to the federation, which noted that other states allow the technology to be used. While a remote vote-by-mail system is made available to military members and overseas members by Alabama, the state had not allowed voters with disabilities to use it. “Alabama has an abysmal record of broken promises and failure to respect and protect the rights of the state’s blind voters,” said Barbara Manuel, president of the National Federation of the Blind of Alabama, in a statement Tuesday announcing the lawsuit. “We cannot tolerate this state of affairs and are determined to change it.” The Southern Policy Law Center’s attorneys are among those representing the plaintiffs.</p>

Brimmer has rejected an attempt by Secretary of State Jena Griswold to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to declare her office has<a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/courts/federal-judge-advances-lawsuit-against-griswold-over-non-disclosure-of-dead-voter-data/article_b5210d7a-62ef-11ee-9569-fb60d2fe3da5.html"> withheld data about deceased voters</a> in violation of the law. In 2021, Griswold&#8217;s office declined to provide ERIC&#8217;s deceased voter reports to the Public Interest Legal Foundation. The foundation claimed it was entitled to the information under the National Voter Registration Act. n response to the foundation&#8217;s records request, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher P. Beall said Colorado receives data &#8220;from a variety of sources&#8221; to maintain the accuracy of its voter registry and &#8220;does not treat&#8221; the ERIC reports as part of its activities. Therefore, it did not have to produce the reports to the foundation. The foundation countered in its court filings that the &#8220;ERIC Deceased Reports &#8216;concern&#8217; voter list maintenance activities in every sense of the word.&#8221; Brimmer<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cod-1_21-cv-03384/pdf/USCOURTS-cod-1_21-cv-03384-0.pdf"> rejected Griswold&#8217;s motion to dismiss</a> the case, noting federal law broadly requires disclosure of information concerning list-maintenance activities. &#8220;Accordingly, the Foundation has sufficiently alleged the ERIC records it seeks are concerned with implementing a program or activity under the NVRA, namely, maintaining accurate voter rolls,&#8221; he wrote. Brimmer addressed Griswold&#8217;s concern that other federal laws govern the privacy of motor vehicle records and the confidentiality of the underlying data ERIC uses to produce its reports. Griswold characterized the foundation&#8217;s lawsuit as an &#8220;end run&#8221; around those privacy protections that could expose the state and ERIC to penalties. &#8220;The Court agrees with the Foundation that information covered by the disclosure provision of the NVRA, but protected by other federal statutes, should be read as exceptions to the NVRA’s disclosure provision,&#8221; Brimmer wrote. Consequently, any legitimate prohibitions on disclosing data could likely be solved by redacting specific information, rather than withholding all records, he explained.</p>

The lawsuit by Mark Andrews, an auditor from Gwinnett County, alleges “2000 Mules” damaged his reputation by showing him as he delivered ballots for himself and his family to a drop box as D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” An investigation by the GBI cleared Andrews of wrongdoing when he returned absentee ballots for the 2020 presidential election. Georgia law allows voters to drop off ballots for their family members. “The allegations about the individual defendants’ conduct, which was purportedly based solely on conjecture and speculation and continued long after Andrews was officially cleared of any wrongdoing, are disturbing,” Grimberg wrote in his 53-page order.</p>

The lawsuit filed in March by BABE VOTE and the League of Women Voters of Idaho challenged House Bills 124 and 340, which eliminated the use the student IDs for voter registration but provided for a new free form of identification. The organizations claimed it violated the constitutional right to equal protection under the law as well as the right to suffrage. The Idaho Secretary of State’s office sought a declaratory judgement in the case, which means the case will not go to trial. Hoagland dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaint and declared in his written judgment that HB 124 and HB 340 do not violate the equal protection clause of the Idaho Constitution. In the memorandum and order, Hoagland wrote “The challenged legislation places conditions on the right to suffrage rather than directly removing the ability of a particular classification to vote. While a certain classification—age— appears to be more affected than other classifications, the condition is not immediately invalidated nor does the condition make it impossible – let alone overly burdensome – for those in the classification to continue to exercise the right of suffrage. ‘Students’ are not a protected class. Moreover, not every student is a young person and not every young person (of voting age) is a student. The removal of student identification as means for registering to vote and identifying oneself at the polls, is not discriminatory and it has a clear relationship to the stated purposes of HB 124 and 340.”</p>

The Public Interest Legal Foundation, which describes itself as a “public interest law firm dedicated to election integrity,” first sued Maine in 2020. That case challenged a state law that restricted access to the state’s registered voter list to political parties or groups engaged in get-out-the-vote efforts. In 2021, state lawmakers amended the law to permit access by groups seeking to evaluate the state’s compliance with “its voter list maintenance obligations.” But that same law also added privacy protections to prohibit the sale of voter information and forbid the release of information that could identify “a specific voter,” according to court filings. It also instituted up to a $1,000 fine for each violation. In a ruling issued in March, U.S. District Judge George Singal ruled in favor of the foundation, writing that public disclosures required by the National Voter Registration Act preempt the restrictions in Maine law. The First Circuit Court of Appeals will hear the case October 5  in Boston.</p>

The legislators claim the process of how Proposal 3 of 2018 and Proposal 2 of 2022 became laws violated both the state and federal constitutions. The suit points to the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the state legislature to regulate the time, place and manner of federal elections. Both proposals came from ballot initiatives and fundamentally changed how elections run in Michigan. However, both proposals passed without involvement from the state legislature. The 11 lawmakers who filed the suit argue that bypassing this step invalidates the proposals. “While the core of this lawsuit is indeed a simple constitutional matter, it is even more important as our goal is to restore integrity to the voting process,” Michigan Senator Jonathan Lindsey explained. Proposal 3 enacted things like protecting the right to a secret ballot, ensuring ballot access for military and overseas voters, adding straight ticket voting and automatically registering voters if they have proof of residency. Proposal 2 created nine days of early voting, expanded the number of ballot drop boxes, created a system for ballot tracking and expanded voter ID laws.</p>

Mississippi attorneys, led by state Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, had asked for the review. Granting the review means the Aug. 4 decision is vacated.  The Aug. 4 ruling held that denying voting rights violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Mississippi lawyers argued that the panel’s decision would “inflict profound damage and sow widespread confusion.” If the ruling had been allowed to stand, tens of thousands of people could have regained voting rights, possibly in time for the Nov. 7 general<a href="https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-governor-election-reeves-presley-7e38dbe518f71a743422445b1efc18ea"> election for governor</a> and other statewide offices. That now appears unlikely. It was unclear how quickly the appeals court would schedule a full-court hearing, how quickly the full court would rule, and whether the court, widely considered among the most conservative of the federal appellate courts, would uphold the panel ruling.</p>

The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Helena by the Montana Federation of Public Employees and the Montana Interest Research Group. Judge Donald Molloy has been assigned to the case, as one of the three federal district judges in Montana who handles voting rights complaints. The Legislature passed House Bill 892 last session, with bipartisan support in the House after it got a party-line vote in the Senate. It was sponsored by Missoula Republican Rep. Lyn Hellegaard, and picked up unanimous support from Republican lawmakers. The new law makes it illegal for anyone to vote in Montana in the same election that they cast a ballot in another state, with an exception for special district elections. It also states that a voter “may not purposely remain registered to vote in more than one place in this state or another state at any time.” Violating the new double-voting law could result in fines up to $5,000 or up to 18 months in prison, making the new crime a felony. The groups say this is a violation of the right to vote, because it will “have the effect of deterring potential Montana voters from registering in the first place.” They argue that students in particular could inadvertently run afoul of the new laws. The complaint quotes a Seventh Circuit of Appeals decision to note that “every year millions of Americans go off to college in August. … They will vote in only one place, even if they have open registrations in two.”</p>

Lawyers for the North Carolina Alliance for Retired Americans write that the 30-day residency mandate violates the U.S. Constitution and Voting Rights Act and totally denies newcomers to the state the right to vote for no compelling reason. People who currently comply with that residency window can participate in same-day registration at early voting sites up to the Saturday before the election. “Voters must not be denied their fundamental right to vote just because they move between states shortly before election day, if they are otherwise eligible,” David Fox, a Washington-based lawyer representing the alliance, said in a news release.<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Constitution/NCConstitution.html"> North Carolina’s constitution</a> sets a one-year state residency requirement to vote in state elections, but that provision was held unconstitutional decades ago and isn’t enforced. A 30-day precinct requirement is still carried out, however, and state law says lying about one’s residency on a registration form is a low-grade felony. The U.S. Voting Rights Act does allow states to set registration deadlines up to 30 days before a presidential election. But the law says no U.S. citizen can be denied the right to vote for president and vice president simply because the person can’t comply with a “durational residency requirement,” the lawsuit says. The state constitution does give legislators the ability to ease residency requirements for presidential elections, but there is no such law currently on the books.</p>

Salazar was charged with eight counts of tampering with government records and false application for voter ballot. Elections Administrator Laura Warnix first uncovered the alleged fraudulent activities. Following her alleged findings, a comprehensive investigation was initiated by the Bee County Sheriff’s Office in collaboration with the State Attorney General’s Office.  The core of the alleged scheme centers around members of a local political candidate’s family who allegedly provided false statements, asserting residence in an abandoned house situated on Beeville’s west side. By falsely claiming this residence, the individuals intended to change their precincts, positioning themselves to vote for a family member actively campaigning within the precinct in question.  “This organized, fraudulent activity was a clear attempt to undermine the integrity of our election process,” said First Assistant Bee County Attorney Brian Watson. “We will not tolerate any attempt to defraud the voters of Bee County.”</p>

Elias Law Group, representing four Wisconsin voters, called the requirement a “burden” to voters in the lawsuit, which they filed in federal court against the Wisconsin Elections Commission and other elections officials. State law requires clerks to reject absentee ballots that are missing a witness’ address or signature. A Wisconsin judge<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-donald-trump-wisconsin-supreme-court-05166e3f3ef970b5cde8ac15cd30e18b"> ruled in 2022</a> that elections officials cannot correct or fill in missing information on witness certifications, a practice known as ballot curing. The Voting Rights Act prohibits states from requiring a voter to “prove his qualifications by the voucher of registered voters or members of any other class.”</p>
