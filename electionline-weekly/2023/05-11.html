							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>CEIR’s Summit on American Democracy</strong></p>
<p>By David Becker, executive director &amp; founder<br />
Center for Election Innovation and Research</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/">The Center for Election Innovation and Research</a> hosted the Summit on American Democracy in Washington, D.C. We met to take stock of where leaders stand on best practices now, with the elections of 2020 and 2022 in the rearview mirror, and to chart a way forward to 2024. The summit was a forum for citizens across the political spectrum – election officials, experts, and members of the media – to discuss pressing issues, and share actionable ideas to further strengthen our democracy in a nonpartisan way.</p>
<div id="attachment_9705" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9705" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9705" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR1-300x208.png" alt="" width="300" height="208" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR1-300x208.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR1.png 618w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9705" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Secretary Stephanie Thomas of Connecticut and Secretary Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, speak on a panel, ”Lessons Learned from the 2020 and 2022 Elections”.</em></p></div>
<p>The event featured panel sessions and discussions on important issues, such as whether we should count ballots faster, ways to make voter information even more secure, and how we can come together to strengthen voter trust. Every state’s chief election official and election director was invited, along with local election officials from all over the country. The nearly-200 bipartisan conference attendees were joined by journalists, election workers, and citizens watching the live stream and on C-Span. It was incredibly valuable for us to reconnect, share ideas, and hear diverse perspectives on election administration.</p>
<p>To check out the full event,<a href="https://www.summit.electioninnovation.org/live-stream"> you can watch the livestream recording here.</a></p>
<p>Attending and speaking were election officials from both parties, from Maine to California, some who have served in public office for decades, and some who are preparing to administer an election for the first time. Speakers engaged in frank discussions on the effect of disinformation on the election administration workforce. Even over 900 days since the 2020 election, the lies have not let up, continuing to persist, leading to abuse and harassment of election officials nationwide, in red areas and blue areas. A common theme was the toll this had taken on our field.</p>
<div id="attachment_9706" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9706" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9706" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR2-300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR2-300x199.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR2-768x510.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CEIR2.png 916w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9706" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, right, and Natalie Adona, Clerk-Recorder/Registrar of Voters, Nevada County, CA, left, participate in a panel, “Addressing Threats and Harassment Facing Election Officials.”</em></p></div>
<p>A lunch conversation between Representative Jamie Raskin and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, moderated by CNN’s Kyung Lah, was a high point. It was Rep. Raskin’s first major public speaking engagement since his successful treatment for cancer, and he and Sec. Raffensperger talked about the work of the January 6th Select Committee, and the way forward towards bipartisan rejection of election denial.</p>
<p>One particularly poignant moment was hearing from Maricopa County Supervisor, Bill Gates, whose story about his struggles with PTSD after unrelenting attacks on his integrity<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/06/bill-gates-maricopa-county-arizona-ptsd/"> was shared just days before in the Washington Post</a>. Gates described his journey with great courage, assuring those listening that it’s ok to admit you feel angry or depressed, and encouraging them to seek help from a licensed therapist if they need it. Bill telling his story, himself, in a room full of election officials of both parties, many of whom had suffered similar harassment, was not something any of us will soon forget.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly proud of the work of the entire team at CEIR who helped put on this major event, and grateful to all the election officials, Republicans and Democrats, who flew to DC to attend and engage with their colleagues. I invite you to check out the conversation yourself, by watching the<a href="https://www.summit.electioninnovation.org/live-stream"> livestream recording</a>, which is available for anyone to view CEIR’s website.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5908" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-300x253.png" alt="" width="154" height="130" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-300x253.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-768x649.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter.png 798w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" />Social Media</strong>: In 2022, electionlineWeekly speculated  about how changes coming to the ownership of Twitter<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/12-15/"> could impact local election administrators</a>. This week, the Associated Press has story about how election administrators across the country have<a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-verification-blue-check-elections-elon-musk-5df36ed183d16ec3bf99446e6827bcdd"> struggled to figure out the best way to respond</a> after Twitter owner Elon Musk threw the platform’s verification service into disarray. Some are taking other steps allowed by Twitter, such as buying check marks for their profiles or applying for a special label reserved for government entities, but success has been mixed. Twitter’s new policy invites government agencies and certain affiliated organizations to apply to be labeled as official with a gray check. Some counties contacted by The Associated Press said they have minimal concerns about impersonation or plan to apply for a gray check later, but others said they already have applied and have not heard back from Twitter. An email sent by The Associated Press to Twitter’s press office and a company safety officer requesting comment was answered only with an auto-reply of a poop emoji. The <a href="https://www.nased.org/">National Association of State Election Directors</a> has been proactive in helping state and local elections officials with verification on Twitter. “State and local election office accounts are eligible for free grey check marks for government accounts under Twitter’s verification program, but they must apply for it.  To apply, election officials should<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/grey-checkmark-request/"> complete this form</a> on Twitter’s website,&#8221; said Amy Cohen NASED executive director. &#8220;If a local election office applies and is denied or doesn’t hear back in a timely manner, they should contact their state election director.  Verification is an important part of an election office’s communication arsenal: it tells platform users that this account – your office – is the source for accurate, reliable information about elections in your jurisdiction. Even if your office only uses Twitter sporadically, getting verified now prepares you now so that if you do choose to tweet when an election is closer or you do need to communicate urgent information, you are already established as the source for election information in your jurisdiction.”</p>

The agreement, which Maricopa County&#8217;s Board of Supervisors approved, largely won&#8217;t impact elections operations but will mean shifts in communications strategies. Currently, county supervisors and the Recorder&#8217;s Office operate a shared communications office within the Elections Department. Under the new agreement, the Elections Department will be fully under the control of county supervisors and have its own communications team. The supervisors are responsible for functions such as in-person voting and vote tallying. The Recorder&#8217;s Office, which is responsible for areas like campaign finance, voter registration and mail-in voting, will rely on separate spokespeople. &#8220;When somebody speaks, we have to be always answering &#8230; &#8216;Is this what the board&#8217;s saying or is this what the recorder is saying or both,'&#8221; Recorder Stephen Richer told the Arizona Republic. &#8220;And so I hope that this will make that less frequent.&#8221; The agreement also adds new guidance around operations such as election center tours, ballot drop boxes and provisional ballots not directly addressed in the existing agreement. In addition, it outlines one area of responsibility that both county supervisors and Richer will remain jointly involved in — ensuring the security of information systems.</p>

Gutierrez was hired after the county’s entire election staff quit earlier this year. Gutierrez’s firing came a day after several residents showed up at a public meeting to say the turmoil and dysfunction surrounding the office were a growing embarrassment for their community. “You can all stand up and rejoice and start clapping and just go have a party,” Gutierrez said. “Because I have been terminated.” Gutierrez said he had been asked to resign but refused to do so because that would be “admitting some sort of guilt.” He also said he apologized if he had disappointed or offended any Buckingham residents. Republican Electoral Board Chairwoman Karen Cerwinski said Gutierrez was terminated for “falsification” of his job application, but the firing comes after numerous residents reported unusual encounters with <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-9651" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CascadeCoMT-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />the man recently hired to run voter registration and elections. In<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/05/09/great-falls-library-wants-monitor-appointed-for-mill-levy-election-or-it-may-seek-court-relief/"> Cascade County, Montana</a>, the Great Falls Public Library is requesting an elections monitor to oversee the Cascade County Election Office going into its June 6 mill levy election. A letter sent Cascade County commissioners, the county attorney Josh Racki, and Clerk and Recorder Sandra Merchant, listed a series of concerns surrounding the Election Office’s handling of the Great Falls Public School District election last week. These included apprehension over instructions on a sample ballot for their upcoming election, the incorrect processing of signatures with the school board election, along with previously reported concerns of absentee ballots not fitting in secrecy envelopes and the delay to vote in person on Election Day. “The library cannot simply rerun a failed election if any of the same violations or irregularities occur. The library will suffer immediate damage if the election is invalidated, and it will hold those responsible for its losses liable for them,” the letter read. The letter said in order to prevent the potential for a failed election and the consequences for the library, the board is considering seeking injunctive relief from a court, which would include the appointment of someone to oversee the library’s election. “To avoid involvement of the courts, however, we propose that the county immediately appoint a mutually acceptable monitor,” the letter said.</p>

It would also eliminate the ten-day cure period to gather additional signatures and require petition signatures from at least 5% of the electors of each county in the state, instead of half of the counties. A cure period is a time to collect additional signatures if the petition falls short of the required number. Ohio eliminated August special elections last year due to cost and low turnout. Who will pay for the new election? Under Ohio law, the state bears the entire cost. LaRose said he has been &#8220;assured by legislative leaders that those funding needs will be met.&#8221; The<a href="https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2023-04-25/ohios-elections-officials-oppose-august-special-election-for-60-voter-approval-amendment"> Ohio Association of Elections Officials</a> spoke out against the special election resolution. “Over the last several years, elections officials have been through so, so much. And in terms of the timelines of an August special election and so much more, it just makes for a very hectic schedule and a very difficult operation,&#8221; said Frankie DiCarlantonio, a trustee of the Ohio Association of Elections Officials and a board of elections member in Jefferson County.</p>

The<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=1BF30EB3-82E3-4569-A79F-E51024B2F981"> Protecting Election Administration from Interference Act</a> would: Expand protections for election administrators by extending existing prohibitions on intimidating or threatening voters to include election officials engaged in the counting of ballots, canvassing, and certifying election results. It is currently a federal crime to interfere with the voting process, and this would make clear that the criminal penalty extends to the counting and certifying process as well; Strengthen protections for Federal election records and election infrastructure to stop election officials or others from endangering the preservation and security of cast ballots; and Provide judicial review for election records by allowing the Justice Department and candidates to bring lawsuits to ensure compliance with election record requirements. “Across the nation, we have seen our local election administrators and officials face a barrage of threats and abuse,” said Klobuchar. “We need to respond head on to protect those who are on the frontlines of our democracy. This legislation is key to fighting against attempts to undermine access to the ballot box and ensuring our democracy works for all Americans.”</p>
<p>Sens. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) introduced the<a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/48886821/bill-calls-for-voting-systems-to-undergo-penetration-testing"> Strengthening Election Cybersecurity to Uphold Respect for Elections through Independent Testing</a>, or SECURE IT, Act  that would require voting systems that need certification to undergo penetration testing. Current law under the Help America Vote Act does require the Election Assistance Commission to provide for the testing and certification, decertification and recertification of voting system hardware and software by accredited laboratories. However, the senators say the existing law does not explicitly require penetration testing of these systems. This new legislation would also tell the EAC and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to accredit the entities that can perform penetration testing. And the bill would create a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program through which vetted researchers would be given access to voting systems by their manufacturers. The researchers would then look for vulnerabilities and disclose them to the manufacturers and the EAC.</p>

HB209 calls for harsher penalties and no exceptions if the assistance involves a payment. The bill passed by a vote of 76-28, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The vote came after the Republican majority cut off the debate after an hour. The bill moves to the Senate. Under the bill, a person who accepts payment for help obtaining, filling out, or delivering an absentee ballot would be guilty of a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Paying a third party for that same help would be a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years. Family members and certain election officials would be allowed to help with a ballot or application. And people would be allowed to help a voter who is blind, disabled, or unable to read and write at that voter’s request. But otherwise, it would be illegal for a person “to knowingly distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, obtain, or deliver an absentee ballot application or absentee ballot in addition to his or her own absentee ballot application or absentee ballot.” The exceptions for help by family members or requested help would not apply to the section of the bill on paying or receiving payment for help with a ballot.</p>

The sponsor of the repeal bill, Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, said getting rid of ranked choice voting was the No. 1 issue her constituents wanted to discuss last year. “For many years, voters have highlighted the lack of trust in our election process,” she said at the start of the hearing. “Ranked choice voting has exacerbated that, because it must be counted by the use of a computer, using an algorithm instead of people being able to simply count and tally a vote.” Alaska voters adopted the new voting style by ballot measure in 2020. Among nearly 50 members of the public who spoke at the hearing, the testimony ran 3-to-1 in support of ranked choice voting.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4166" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />California:</strong> An bill making its way through the Legislature draws its inspiration from Shasta County’s abrupt and controversial decision in January to prematurely end its contract with Dominion Voting Systems. “It was pretty shocking to see a county board of supervisors terminate a voting contract without any option with how to move forward with another system,” Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Democrat, told the Record Searchlight. Introduced on Feb. 14, Pellerin’s Assembly Bill 969 would require a county board of supervisors to have both a<a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2023/05/04/shasta-county-decision-to-drop-dominion-voting-machines-prompts-state-bill/70184728007/"> transition plan and a replacement contract</a> with a state-certified system in place before terminating an existing voting system contract. Pellerin introduced the bill about three weeks after Shasta Supervisors voted 3-2 to terminate their contract with Dominion without a state certified and federally qualified voting system in place, ignoring the advice of Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen and then-County Counsel Rubin Cruse Jr. The California Association of Clerks and Election Officials support the bill. Pellerin’s bill is now headed to the Senate after passing the Assembly.</p>
<p>Assembly Bill 1227 has already cleared the assembly and is now headed to the state senate. The bill, by Assemblymembers Evan Low (D-San Jose) and Alex Lee (D-San Jose), would allow the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors to decide<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/05/10/new-bill-could-allow-ranked-choice-voting-in-santa-clara-county/"> if they want to adopt ranked choice voting</a> for county elections. California law dictates that only cities — not counties — can change their voting methods on their own, which is why state legislation is needed before Santa Clara County could proceed with the change. With ranked choice voting, there would be no primaries and only a general election would be held. Voters have the option to rank the candidates on the ballot in the order they prefer. The winner is determined by a simple majority and if one isn’t reached, the votes are redistributed based on the rankings until a candidate reaches more than 50%. If AB 1227 makes its way to the governor’s desk and Gov. Gavin Newsom gives it a sign of approval, it would then be up to the board of supervisors as to what happens next.</p>

The caucus was split as 15 Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the measure. The bill calls for early, in-person voting for 14 days before a general election in November, seven days before the statewide August primaries, and four days before special elections and presidential primaries. Local referendums on budgets and other issues are not included. The 33-section bill gives wide latitude to cities and towns to run their elections, but each municipality must have at least one early-voting location. The locations will be required to be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., but have extended hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on the last Tuesday and Thursday before statewide primaries and general elections. Early voting would not be enacted until the presidential primaries in early 2024 as vendors and local officials need time to prepare for the change.</p>
<p>Legislators voted for a constitutional amendment to adopt<a href="https://www.courant.com/2023/05/10/connecticut-pushes-no-excuses-absentee-ballot-voting/"> “no excuses” absentee voting</a>. After debating for one hour, the state House of Representatives voted 113-38 with all negative votes cast by Republicans. Another 15 Republicans voted in favor of the bipartisan resolution. Under the rules, legislators needed to pass the resolution for the amendment by a simple majority for the question to be placed on the ballot for all voters during the presidential election year in November 2024. The question to appear on the ballot is: “Shall the Constitution of the State be amended to permit the General Assembly to allow each voter to vote by absentee ballot?” Currently, residents can obtain an absentee ballot for specific reasons, including sickness, physical disability, serving overseas in the United States military, and a voter’s absence from the municipality on the day of the vote.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5354" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Delaware-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Delaware:</strong> Senate Democrats pass the first leg of a constitutional amendment to<a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2023-05-04/delaware-senate-passes-first-leg-of-constitutional-amendment-to-allow-no-excuse-absentee-voting"> roll back restrictions on absentee voting</a>. After failing to gather enough support to pass a previous constitutional amendment with the same goal, Democratic state lawmakers attempted a workaround last year, passing legislation with a simple majority to allow Delawareans to vote by mail. They argued the state constitution’s limits on acceptable reasons for absentee voting are a floor, not a ceiling for the General Assembly. Delaware’s Supreme Court rejected that argument in October, overturning the law and asserting the General Assembly could only permit voting by mail via constitutional amendment. State Sen. Darius Brown’s bill would begin that process, removing the constitution’s limits on the circumstances in which absentee voting is allowed and permitting the General Assembly to set new rules and procedures through legislation. Brown argues no-excuse absentee voting is a common practice nationwide and would allow Delawareans to choose the most convenient voting option without cutting corners. The amendment passed with more than the required two-thirds majority in the Senate on a party-line vote, and it will need to reach the same vote threshold to pass in the House and return for consideration and final approval next session.</p>

Brian Kemp signed into law. The law also<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/new-georgia-law-allows-time-off-for-early-voting-and-requires-audits/X4S6IYMAT5DBDBKXFOLSKC2WFA/"> requires more frequent audits</a> of election results. The new law expands on an existing statute that guarantees two hours of unpaid voting time for workers on Election Day. Workers seeking time off will have to notify their employer in advance, and then the employer will decide on a time when workers can be absent. In addition, the measure calls for audits of at least one statewide contest after primary, runoff and special elections. Currently, a race is only audited after general elections every two years. “This bill would further empower Georgians to participate in one of the most important civic duties,” said state Sen. Rick Williams, a Republican from Milledgeville and the sponsor of Senate Bill 129.</p>
<p>Kemp signed House Bill 730 on May 1 that makes changes to how appointments are made for the<a href="https://theaugustapress.com/gov-kemp-signs-columbia-county-board-of-elections-bill/"> Columbia County Board of Elections</a> appointments.</p>
<p>Kemp has<a href="https://www.govtech.com/policy/georgia-governor-nixes-funding-for-voter-check-in-upgrades"> blocked $550,000 in state funding</a> for technology intended to reduce wait times when voters check in at their polling places. Instead, money for the upgrades would have to come from county governments and their taxpayers during next year’s elections. Kemp wrote in a message that accompanied his line-item vetoes that the secretary of state’s office should disregard an item in the state budget calling for a statewide data plan to connect check-in tablets to a cellphone network. The governor said local governments are responsible for data plan contracts for election equipment.</p>

Beginning this year, Maine voters who are disabled or at least 65 years old can request that town clerks automatically mail absentee ballots to them for every statewide and municipal election. Some lawmakers now want to make that same option available to all voters. The bill,<a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?paper=SP0677&amp;SessionID=15"> LD 1690</a>, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Mattie Daughtry of Brunswick, has the support of Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who pointed out that five other states already allow “ongoing absentee balloting.” But Maine&#8217;s Town and City Clerks Association opposes the measure. Speaking on behalf of the organization, Waterville clerk Patti Dubois told members of the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee that a further expansion is premature because clerks are still rolling out ongoing absentee balloting for older and disabled Mainers. She said there are also concerns about costs. Committee members were divided on the issue, voting 6-3 along party lines in favor of the bill. The bill will now go to the House and Senate for consideration. If approved as amended by the committee, the change would take effect by Dec. 31, 2025.</p>

The legislation implements automatic voter registration, allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote, and creates a permanent absentee voter list that will automatically send people who sign up a ballot each election. &#8220;Today is a great day for Democracy,&#8221; Walz said. &#8220;The ballot is the most powerful thing we have. Your voice is in your ballot. And if you don&#8217;t have access to that or it&#8217;s made more difficult, your voice is stifled.&#8221; The proposal also requires voting materials and sample ballots to be in languages other than English and prohibits voter intimidation at the polls, among other provisions. Secretary of State Steve Simon, also a Democrat, praised the measure during a bill signing ceremony on Friday surrounded by supporters. He acknowledged that 50 years ago, then-Secretary of State Joan Growe began the push for some of these provisions. The bill passed both chambers along party-lines. Republicans criticized Democrats of scrapping a long tradition of passing election bills on a bipartisan basis.</p>

It would make<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/04/metro/bill-requiring-election-audits-passes-nh-house/"> election audits</a> a normal procedure occurring after every state and federal election moving forward. The bill requires the Secretary of State to randomly select eight towns or city wards to audit per election. The audits would be open to the public. Election audits allow states to verify the accuracy and performance of voting equipment and vote counting machines. In practice, it’s a partial recount of results that takes a random sample of paper ballots and checks it against the initial results to make sure the results are accurate. The House made some changes to the Senate’s version of the bill: making the audit mandatory, expanding it to include all voting devices and not just AccuVote devices, doubling the number of audits from four to eight, and requiring that 100 ballots be compared to digital images. It would also include the presidential primary in races to be audited.</p>

Oklahoma’s top election officer praised a new law making it a crime to harass or threaten the state’s election workers. &#8220;It is unfortunate that even here in the state of Oklahoma, election officials have been doxed, harassed and even threatened by people who believe false claims about the conduct and administration of elections,&#8221; Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said this week. &#8220;As one of those who has been doxed and threatened, I can tell you that election officials across this state are very grateful to the Legislature and the governor for taking these threats seriously and enacting this legislation to deter and punish such actions in the future.&#8221;</p>

The 34-25 party-line approval of<a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB2107"> House Bill 2107</a> came despite protests from Republicans who are suspicious of the proposal and argued it is tainted by its connection to Fagan. HB 2107 would put Oregon in league with Nevada and Colorado in expanding opt-out registration to the state’s Medicaid program, the Oregon Health Plan. Other states have adopted variations on that policy, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. Under HB 2107, automatic registrations via the Oregon Health Authority could not begin until 2026. There are approximately 200,000 Oregonians who are eligible to vote but not registered, according to estimates from the Oregon Secretary of State. Fagan said earlier this year about 85% percent of those people — 171,000 — are on the Oregon Health Plan.</p>

The bill from Frisco Republican Rep. Jared Patterson would permit election judges to carry handguns at polling places on Election Day and would allow some poll workers to carry guns during early voting. The change will “make it clear that law abiding citizens who are election judges who want to carry to protect themselves and discharge their duties can do so legally without fear of prosecution,” Patterson said during a hearing on the bill in March. The proposal,<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB636"> House Bill 636</a>, now heads to the Senate for consideration, where a similar bill died in 2021. The change expands on a portion of Texas’ election code that considers an appointed election judge a government official with the authority of a peace officer or district judge while they preside over a polling place. Though Texas prohibits guns in polling places, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a nonbinding legal opinion in 2018 that said polling judges could bring firearms to polling places. Patterson’s legislation would enshrine it in law.</p>

Sen. Nader Hashim, D-Windham District said the charter amendment was approved by a vote of 18 yeses. Last month, the House of Representative passed the bill in a 103-33 vote. The amendment would allow “youth voters” to vote for local offices, and serve as members of Representative Town Meeting and the Select Board. Residents approved a charter amendment to lower the voting age in a 908-408 vote in March 2019, sending the matter to the Legislature. The Youth Vote initiative came from Brattleboro Common Sense, an activist group focused on promoting democracy and other progressive issues. “I hope the governor will sign this charter change into law and respect local control and the wishes of the voters,” he said. “This charter change is a great way to foster civic involvement at an earlier age, and many of our youth are working, paying taxes, and are involved in our community. Our youth should have a voice when it comes to the ballot.”  Last March, the Senate failed to override Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of a similar bill. At the time, senators raised concerns about youth serving on select boards because they aren’t allowed to sign contracts by state law.</p>
<p>Four election-related changes to the Burlington city charter passed a second reading in the Senate paving the way for final passage and then heading to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk. Burlington voters passed the<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/05/10/senate-advances-burlingtons-election-related-charter-changes/"> charter changes</a> by wide margins on Town Meeting Day this year. Those changes would allow noncitizen voting in city elections, expand ranked-choice voting to more city offices, including mayoral races, create a new map for election ward boundaries and give some flexibility to where polling places are located. The Senate’s final passage is expected to occur on Thursday, after the third reading. Following that, it would be sent to Scott. Scott vetoed similar resolutions for Montpelier and Winooski in 2021, but the Senate overrode him. Reached by email on Wednesday, Jason Maulucci, a spokesman for Scott, said “The Governor has not yet reviewed the charter changes, but on non-citizen voting generally, he remains concerned by the patchwork approach. The governor believes there should be consistency with election laws.” The Burlington measures passed the House on May 2, with some Republican pushback on the basis of constitutionality.</p>

Among other changes, the proposals would prevent last-minute polling site closures, better protect election officials and enact stricter military voting requirements to deter fraud. One of the bills would raise the penalty for intentionally harming an election official from a misdemeanor to a felony and prohibit public access to records containing an election official’s address. It would also protect election officials from losing their jobs for reporting suspicious activity and fraud. Another bill would prohibit towns and cities from closing more than half their polling locations unless local lawmakers hold a public hearing and approve the shutdowns at least 30 days before an election. Polling sites could only be closed fewer than 30 days before an election with permission of the local clerk and the head of the local lawmaking body. Lawmakers also proposed requiring service members to provide their Department of Defense identification number when requesting a military absentee ballot. Local clerks would have to verify the voter’s identity with the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs before counting a military ballot. The bipartisan group of lawmakers behind the bills has also proposed requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to reimburse local governments for the costs of special elections, and allowing people to make a voting complaint on behalf of their adult parent or child even if they live in separate districts.</p>

The motion would have required a vote by both the Assembly and Senate to approve the hiring of investigators but was rejected with little discussion by Republicans who hold the majority in the Legislature and on the joint finance committee. The four Democrats on the committee — Sen. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee, Sen. Kelda Roys of Madison, Rep. Evan Goyke of Milwaukee and Rep. Tip McGuire of Kenosha — introduced the motion in hopes that investigations going forward would have more oversight.</p>

Attorneys for Gov. Katie Hobbs and Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, both Democrats, sought sanctions against Lake for bringing what they called a frivolous and unfounded lawsuit. The order signed by Chief Justice Robert Brutinel declined to award Hobbs and Fontes their attorneys fees and said Lake&#8217;s lawyers must pay $2,000 to the court clerk for repeatedly claiming it was an &#8220;undisputed fact&#8221; that 35,563 ballots were added to the results at Maricopa County’s third-party ballot processor, Runbeck Election Services. Hobbs, Fontes and Maricopa County all disputed the claim.

Eric Elliff has allowed a lawsuit to continue against Colorado’s secretary of state over<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2023/05/05/colorado-mail-ballot-signature-rejection-lawsuit-continues/"> rejection of voter signatures</a> on mail ballots. The complaint, filed last December by a veterans rights group called Vet Voice Foundation, argues that Colorado’s vote-by-mail system unfairly disenfranchises voters when it rejects ballots because of a signature mismatch. It also alleges that Black and Hispanic signatures are rejected at significantly higher rates than for white voters. That signature verification system is in an attempt to prevent fraud that almost never happens, according to the lawsuit. The advocacy group is seeking an injunction to stop the signature matching requirement. The judge rejected an attempt by the Secretary of State, Jena Griswold, and her attorneys, to dismiss the lawsuit over the plaintiff’s lack of standing. In court filings, the plaintiff&#8217;s attorneys, from the national firm Perkins Coie, wrote that the right to vote is fundamental to democracy, but “for the vast majority of Colorado voters who vote by mail, this fundamental right is contingent on an arbitrary, deeply flawed signature matching process. While ostensibly deployed to verify voter identity, signature matching is election integrity theater: it disenfranchises qualified voters by the tens of thousands, all for the appearance—but not the reality—of election integrity.”  The secretary of state had argued that the case should be dismissed in part because the Vet Voice Foundation lacked standing.</p>

Because he cut a plea deal, he’s expected to get less than the maximum. During the court hearing, Lubitz’s lawyer, Jonathan Friedman, said it was his client’s decision to plead guilty against his advice, arguing “this was a triable case.” But Lubitz told U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz that he wanted to accept responsibility for his crime, so the judge accepted his guilty plea. In August 2022, he threatened election workers who assisted him and other voters at a senior center in Sunrise during the primary election. “Should I kill them one by one or should I blow the place up?” a federal indictment accused Lubitz of saying at the polling station, then he “pointed his finger and thumb in a gun-like fashion towards election workers.”</p>

The statute designed to block distribution of advance mail ballot applications to potential Kansas voters was inspired by Republicans who acted on false claims sophisticated crooks stole reelection from President Donald Trump in 2020. The Democratic governor vetoed the bill, but was overridden by the GOP-led House and Senate two years ago. Last year, Vratil struck down portions of House Bill 2332 forbidding out-of-state groups from being involved in distribution of mail ballot applications to potential voters. The state’s attorneys had agreed this section of the law violated First and 14th Amendments of the federal constitution. Vratil said in the new ruling — a 42-page dissertation on shortcomings of the 2021 Kansas law — the personalized application prohibition was an unconstitutional restriction on “plaintiff’s core political speech and association” and was written so broadly it “criminalizes a substantial amount of protected speech.” Under the law, it would have been illegal to mail an advance mail ballot application personalized with a voter’s name and address even if the voter provided that information and requested the application.</p>

The consent decree follows a complaint lodged by federal prosecutors that alleged the county breached provisions of the federal Voting Rights Act requiring that bilingual ballots be printed in any voting jurisdiction where residents with limited English proficiency account for more than 5% of the voting population. The county also violated portions of the law requiring access for those with disabilities, prosecutors allege. Under the consent decree, which must still be approved by the courts, the county would be required to print all election materials in English and Spanish and ensure the presence of in-person Spanish language assistance in districts where at least 100 registered voters have Spanish surnames. Union County Clerk Joanne Rajoppi, who appeared to welcome the consent decree, said the county had already been sending bilingual ballots to roughly half of the county’s 21 municipalities. “I’m really happy about it because there are people in those other towns that probably need bilingual ballots,” she said. “We have a very diverse population in Union County, so I see it as giving more accessibility and information to people.” The suit also charged the county denied voters who knew limited English from receiving assistance from the person of their choice, as required by the Voting Rights Act. Union County has agreed to let voters choose who assists them, so long as the latter individual is not an agent of their employer or union.</p>

Linhardt, who ruled cast vote records (CVR) from the 2020 general election in Lycoming County are public, has concluded<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/elections/2023/05/judge-rules-in-person-2020-ballot-images-in-pa-county-are-not-accessible-to-public.html"> images of votes cast in person</a> are not. Linhardt’s decision came on the same day the state Department of State asked Commonwealth Court to reverse his ruling on the CVRs. Both cases involve appeals of Office of Open Records’ (OOR) decisions on Right to Know requests that neither is public. The Legislature in passing Act 77 in 2019 amending the Election Code made public images of mail-in and absentee ballots. The act does not explicitly establish whether images of a voted in-person ballot constitute the contents of the ballot box and thus excepted from public access, Linhardt pointed out. Using what he referred to statutory construction, he ruled since a voted in-person ballot is considered contents of the ballot box, so should an image of that ballot. He cited these differences between CVRs and ballot images: A CVR contains almost all the information that is on a ballot but will not list the name of a write-in and an image will not only reveal who the elector has written in but display the voter’s handwriting. Someone familiar with the handwriting could identify the voter. Linhardt speculated the reason the Legislature made images of mail-in and absentee ballots public was a concern they might be more subject to voter fraud. Making them subject to public disclosure increases confidence in the accuracy and reliability of such votes, he wrote, adding: “Mail-in and absentee ballots present unique challenges, so it makes sense they warrant special provisions to deal with them.”</p>

Remington said, the commission must consider the complaint without the participation of one of its six commissioners who was also one of the fake electors. The Wisconsin Elections Commission, Republican commissioner Robert Spindell and those who brought the lawsuit ultimately all agreed that the complaint should be heard again without Spindell’s participation.  Given that agreement, Remington said during oral arguments that he would write a written order as soon as next week to vacate the commission’s unanimous rejection in March 2022 of the complaint against the fake electors and to require it to consider it again without Spindell. “Surprise, surprise, I’m coming to the same conclusion, as all the parties have, that the appropriate remedy is to vacate the decision of the WEC and remand it back for further proceedings, which don’t include Commissioner Spindell,” Remington said.</p>
