							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Lawmakers, Your Local Election Officials Would Like to Chat</strong><br />
<em>New guide from NCSL and EAC can help make connections</em></p>
<p>By Katie King and Wendy Underhill<br />
National Conference of State Legislatures</p>
<p>Voters are the most important people when it comes to elections: There’s no doubt about that. Legislators set election policy: There’s no doubt about that, either.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9801" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-5.11.55-PM-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-5.11.55-PM-233x300.png 233w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-5.11.55-PM-796x1024.png 796w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-5.11.55-PM-768x987.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-5.11.55-PM.png 966w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" />Then there are the advocacy groups asking either for more access or for more integrity—it’s hard to forget about them.</p>
<p>It can be easy, though, to overlook another key group: election administrators. County, city and town clerks, election directors, registrars of voters, auditors and probate judges all pay attention to the choices legislators make, because as policy goes, so goes their workload.</p>
<p>That means that in every state, there are at least some election officials who are laser-focused on legislative action.</p>
<p>The usual quip is that legislators know how to run for office, but that doesn’t mean they know how to run an election. That’s OK, though—knowing the folks who do have the expertise can be a boon.</p>
<p>“No one knows the needs of local election offices and the voters they serve better than local election officials,” says Christy McCormick, the chairwoman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, or EAC. “Their knowledge of election administration is an important resource when legislation impacting elections is considered.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5304" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png" alt="" width="300" height="127" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A new guide, “<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/How_to_Work_With_State_Legislators_FINAL.pdf">How to Work With State Legislatures</a>,” gives election officials an overview of the legislative process, tips on how to build relationships with legislators, effective communication strategies and more. Created by the EAC and NCSL, the guide can help the officials who implement policy connect with the people who make it.</p>
<p>“We try to be present at the legislative committee that is hearing the bills so we can testify in person,” says Kathy Montejo, the city clerk and registrar of voters in Lewiston, Maine. Speaking for her state’s association of election officials, she adds that the “legislators have gotten to know us, and we have been able to establish a personal connection, which has developed the trust and respect they have for us and our insight and opinions.”</p>
<p>For election officials, attending hearings and being responsive is great; having a set of ready-to-go “asks” is even better.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="166" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px" />“When you’re going to see the legislative staff, or your members of the legislature, and you hand them a list of 25 or 50 things, they always ask, ‘What’s important to you?’” says David Stafford, the supervisor of elections in Escambia County, Fla., which includes Pensacola. “You start by ranking those things—which are the one or two most vital requests?”</p>
<p>Engaging with legislators is good, but getting involved politically is a big no-no for most election officials. They know their lane: administering the laws in a nonpartisan manner. And they know lawmakers’ lane: making tough choices in a highly political world.</p>
<p>“Given our current environment, we really try not to get involved,” says Christina Tvedten, the elections manager in Ramsey County, Minn., which includes the state capital, St. Paul. “We are not partisan.” She speaks for her peers when she says, “Legislators can rely on the fact that the input received from us is not affected by partisan bias.”</p>
<p>For example, they can provide input on whether an idea will improve accuracy, reduce costs or speed up reporting.</p>
<p>All they ask is that they be consulted—and they believe sooner is better when it comes to weighing in on the unintended consequences and possible costs of doing things in a new way. When it comes to elections, talking to administrators can get you to win-win.</p>

It was a quiet day at the polls in the Garden State. According to the NJ Spotlight, a large percentage of voters took advance of early voting and vote-by-mail. More than 220,000 people used mail-in ballots and some 24,000 visited in-person voting centers Friday, Saturday and Sunday to cast ballots early on machines. While the number taking advantage of early in-person primary voting remained low, that turnout was about 20% higher than in 2021, when the governor’s race topped balloting in the first year it was offered. In<a href="https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/atlantic-county-voters-get-first-look-at-new-voting-machines/article_7d93e8ac-048d-11ee-8e20-a74c1e857187.html"> Atlantic County</a> voters  had a first chance to use new polling machines purchased through a bond ordinance late last year. The new machines were used in all 151 voting districts during the primary election. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy, and it&#8217;s basically foolproof,&#8221; Valerie Tyrone told the Press of Atlantic City. Last year, Atlantic County commissioners voted to bond for $3.4 million to buy 325 new voting machines that include a paper audit trail. In<a href="https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/06/montana-great-falls-public-library-2023-election-results-allegations-filings/70293918007/"> Cascade County, Montana</a>, voters headed to the polls for a library mill levy. Tuesday’s election marked the first with a court-ordered election monitor and reports are that things went well. According the<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/06/07/cascade-county-elections-official-sees-smoother-elections-process-some-attribute-to-monitor/"> Daily Montana</a>, election judges and poll watchers working at the Montana ExpoPark report the process went smoother than the May 2 election, the first election for newly appointed Clerk and Recorder Sandra Merchant. Poll watcher Nancy Anderson attributed some of the course correction to the presence of Election Monitor Lynn DeRoche, who worked in the Elections Office more than 16 years with previous longtime Clerk Rina Moore, who was also present Tuesday as a poll watcher. “It’s smoother in some aspects because the ballots fit in the envelopes,” Anderson told the Daily Montanan with a chuckle, referencing one of the issues that plagued the May 2 election. “There are still some issues with people getting ballots that are not theirs.”</p>

According to the AP, the stories from those on the front lines of history recount tragedy, racism, oppression and ultimately hope in seeing a president sign into law a measure designed to ensure equal access to the ballot and fair representation in the halls of political power — from city councils to statehouses to Congress. The stories include those of<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-freedom-summer-mississippi-schwerner-c9a488de38948e38c55389b20be17bbb"> Stephen Schwerner</a> whose brother was murdered trying to register Black voter in Mississippi,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/lyndon-johnson-daughter-voting-rights-supreme-court-cf792bdb6228ba20f257a73f055eddb9"> Luci Johnson</a>, daughter of President Lyndon B.

Supervisor Keith Carson wrote the<a href="http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_06_06_23/GENERAL%20ADMINISTRATION/Regular%20Calendar/Supervisor%20Carson_351423.pdf"> legislation</a> creating the commission following the November 2022 General Election, which was marred by several serious mistakes made by Registrar Tim Dupuis and his team including incorrectly tabulated ballots in ranked-choice contests in Oakland, Berkeley, and San Leandro. The new commission is designed to address many of these problems, mainly by requiring the registrar to present the oversight board with its plan in advance of each election. The commission will give the registrar feedback on the plan—including voter education, outreach, language access, and technical issues, including how ballots are counted. The commission will also conduct post-election assessments and report to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

The legislation, known as<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/senate-passes-bill-for-early-voting-in-connecticut/3041384/"> Public Act 23-5</a>, will impact general elections, special elections and primaries in the state. It was passed in the Senate on June 1 with a 27 to 7 vote, and it passed in the House of Representatives with a 107 to 35 vote. The bill gives Connecticut voters 14 days to cast their general election ballots early and in-person. Every town in the state will now be required to establish at least one early voting location beginning Jan. 1, 2024. It also allows seven early voting days for most primaries and four for presidential primaries and special elections. “There are 46 other states that already have early voting and I&#8217;m glad that Connecticut is finally joining them and giving our voters this option. This will help improve the ability of voters to cast their ballots and enable more people to participate in our democracy,” Lamont said on Twitter.</p>

All Minnesotans who are not currently incarcerated for a felony conviction are now eligible and able to register to vote. Minnesota Secretary Steve Simon joined Restore the Vote advocates today to register the very first newly eligible Minnesotans. The voters completed their voter registration forms and Simon handed them an “I Will Vote” sticker. “Today is a victory for voting rights and for Minnesota. Expanding our democracy to tens of thousands of Minnesotans who have left prison behind will only make it stronger,” said Simon. “But we can’t walk away after this victory, we have to hit the ground running to get our newly eligible neighbors registered and participating in our democracy.” With at least 55,000 Minnesotans being newly enfranchised, the newly effective law marks the largest expansion of voting rights since the voting age in Minnesota was lowered to 18.</p>

One bill would require ballot measures to be written in plain English. One bill would permit voters standing in line on Election Day to receive food or water from someone else while they wait, which is currently illegal in New York.

Assemblymember Amy Paulin (D-Westchester County) and Sen. James Skoufis (D-Orange County) announced that their bill would come to a vote before lawmakers end their legislative session in Albany later this week. The measure, the Democratic lawmakers argue, would help boost voter turnout in local elections by aligning them with state and national elections — such as those for governor or president, which draw far more voters than local-only elections in odd years. If it is signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, the measure would be gradually phased in over a period of years. It would apply to offices like county executive and town supervisor, for which elections in many localities are held in odd-numbered years, opposite the presidential and statewide elections. But it would not apply to certain positions like district attorney and city-level elections — which are set by the state constitution.</p>

The proposal also requires elections boards to acquire and use signature verification software for absentee ballots. It would require signature verifications for mail-in ballots — in addition to the current rules that also require two witnesses. And it makes it easier to remove people from voting lists if they’ve claimed they aren’t a citizen to get out of jury duty. Some of the changes proposed have been proposed in the past, only to be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Others are new ideas.</p>
<p>Legislation has been introduced that would call for a<a href="https://www.cbs17.com/news/political-news/lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-hold-special-election-if-legislator-switches-parties/"> special election if a legislator switches parties</a>. The bill introduced by Democrats today is called the Voter Fraud Protection Act. It works under two parts. The first part of the bill says if an elected legislator switches parties with six months or more left in their term, they vacate their seat and a special election has to be held. Lawmakers behind the bill say that would give voters the chance to support the legislator in question in their new party or elect someone new. The second part of the bill says if a legislator switches parties, donors can request a refund and the legislator will be required to return money donated to their campaign under the party they switched from.</p>

Rep. Joe Webster, D-Montgomery, sponsor of HR32, said recent elections have shown the need for the study especially with many poll workers leaving. Rep. Carol Kazeem, D-Chester, sponsor of HR47, said state law allows Pennsylvanians who have served a felony sentence to regain the right to vote, but many are not aware of that right.</p>

That would require a special session, which either Gov. Cox or lawmakers can call. Schultz said he didn’t believe lawmakers would call themselves. Right now, Utah law stipulates that 180 days, or about six months, are needed to complete the special primary and general election schedules.  This reflects the requirement that there are 90 days between the date Gov. Cox schedules the election and the primary. The law also requires that another 90 days must separate the primary and the general elections. The law also requires special elections be held on certain existing election days, unless the legislature gives money to change the dates. As it stands now, the earliest date the general election can be held in March of 2024 unless the legislature steps in.</p>

One<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/reg/asm/bill/ab298"> bill</a> would prohibit a municipality from closing more than half of its polling places within 30 days of an election. It would also prevent a municipality from closing any polling place within 30 days without gaining approval from the local governing leader and clerk and allowing the public to weigh in. A potential amendment to the bill would require the entire city council to vote on a polling place closure. Another<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/reg/asm/bill/ab283"> bill</a> would require the Wisconsin Elections Commission to repay local governments for certain costs involved with administering special elections, such as open Assembly and Senate seats. Another<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/ab282"> bill</a> would require municipalities that broadcast canvassing proceedings on election night to save the recording for 22 months. Democratic Gov.

The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions held its first of six scheduled meetings last week “In other states, there have been issues of poll watchers interacting with voters, and there’s at least a couple of complaints in Wyoming about this that I’ve become aware of,” committee Co-Chair Case said. “Some states prohibit poll watchers from being within a certain distance of a voter, some prohibit them from talking to a voter. So, where are we on that?” Both parties instruct poll watchers not to challenge voters, Platte County Clerk and County Clerks’ Association of Wyoming President Malcolm Ervin said. He also said it’s especially helpful when complaints of voters being challenged are made early enough that county clerks can address and stop it. “I wouldn’t say that issue was pervasive, but present,” Ervin said. Case also said it may be worthwhile to have independent observers in the room as ballots are counted, so long as those observers do not interfere with the ballot counting process. “It seems to me I could make an argument that’s a time where you ought to be able to have observers that are not interfering with the people to watch that situation,” he said.</p>

Alexander Kolodin (R-Scottsdale) that allowing people to fill out their ballots at their kitchen tables — or anywhere else — runs afoul of a constitutional provision that requires “secrecy in voting shall be preserved.” There was no explanation of the decision. But in refusing to consider the arguments he presented for the state GOP, the justices left intact an earlier decision by the state Court of Appeals that there are sufficient safeguards built into Arizona law to ensure that each voter’s choices are kept confidential. The decision is the last legal gasp for the party, as there is no basis to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Arizona has had some form of early voting almost since the first days of statehood. But that was limited to special circumstances, ranging from military serving overseas to people who were incapacitated. In 1991, however, state lawmakers approved no-excuse early voting, allowing anyone to request a ballot be sent to them which they can fill out at home — or anywhere — and either return it by mail, put in a drop box or take directly to a polling location. Kolodin, in seeking to have the Supreme Court void on-demand early ballots, did not discuss the election results. Instead, he focused on that constitutional requirement “that secrecy in voting shall be preserved.” Strictly speaking, Kolodin was not arguing that people can’t have a ballot sent to them by mail. What he told the justices, though, is that the constitutionally mandated secrecy can be maintained only if an official is present when someone actually casts a ballot — even from their own kitchen — and that the official “then watches the voter enclose and seal the ballot in an envelope.” Kolodin said that can’t happen if someone is filling out a ballot at a kitchen table and sealing it there.</p>

John Barr is the Ypsilanti city attorney, and he said the case was referred to the city insurance company and they’ve picked up the defense. According to the law firm representing the five landlords who filed the suit, the ordinance is a violation of the First Amendment because it&#8217;s compelled speech.</p>

There will be no change in November’s municipal elections, the city announced following the Supreme Court ruling. Six justices wrote the majority opinion that held the district court and the city properly declined to place the entire proposed charter amendment on the ballot and that it would be improper for the court to sever or remove an unconstitutional provision because it was integral to the purpose of the amendment, according to the city. The original charter amendment petition was filed in June 2022 by representatives of Residents for a Better Bloomington, which describes itself as a nonpartisan grassroots watchdog group serving the residents of Bloomington. The petition asked for a second vote on ranked-choice voting last November, asking to repeal the system instituted in 2021 for Bloomington City Council elections and to establish a two-thirds voter approval of any new effort to establish ranked-choice voting for city elections. The Supreme Court said that the purpose of the proposed amendment was clearly two-fold, to repeal ranked-choice voting and prevent it from being reinstated in future elections, according to the city’s announcement. “Given the importance of the unconstitutional provision, the court was unable to conclude that the residents of Bloomington who supported and signed the petition would have done so if the proposal did not include the severed provision.”</p>

The ACLU released a statement this week that says the term &#8220;caregiver&#8221; is not adequately defined, meaning that nursing home attendants and other healthcare institution workers could be liable should they aid patients with voting. Author of the bill, state Senator Jeff Tate, claims it would prevent &#8220;ballot harvesting.&#8221;</p>

The county had planned to resolve the matter and avoid a hearing by agreeing to count the write-ins with non-shaded ovals in that particular race, as it did in a prior settlement with City Mayor George C. Brown over his write-ins. However, city council candidate Mark Shaffer filed an action intervening in Brooks’ case before that stipulation was fully executed, forcing the matter to proceed to a hearing. Based on legal advice, the county election board had taken the position that voters must both shade in the oval and write a name for a write-in to be accepted. Similar to Brown’s filing, Brooks’ petition filed through Borland &amp; Borland in Wilkes-Barre said state law prior to March 26, 2020 would have required voters to both mark the write-in selection and name of the candidate in jurisdictions with electronic voting systems that use paper ballots to register the votes, the petition said. However, the law was amended after that date to eliminate the requirement that a voter “mark” a write-in candidate, specifying that voters can “indicate” their intent to select a write-in by inserting the name of the person, it said. Voters showed this indication when they expressly declined to select a named candidate on the ballot and instead wrote in the name of their choice, it said. Shaffer’s filings had argued this law change still required completion of both steps — shading in the oval and writing the name. The panel of judges agreed with the interpretation presented by Brooks.</p>

Board of Supervisors member Jordan Miles said the current interim registrar provided most of what he had asked for. But in some cases, that meant he received nothing as they didn’t have the requested files on record. “While the responses to my requests could be considered insufficient, I want to put this suit behind us to afford the Electoral Board the time and energy it needs to be fully prepared for the November election and stabilize itself and its operations, all of which are essential to democracy in Buckingham County,” Miles said. Miles had filed suit against the board and the registrar’s office in May arguing that they have violated state law in multiple ways.</p>
