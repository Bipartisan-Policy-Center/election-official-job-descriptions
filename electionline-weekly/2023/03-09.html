<em>Coalition of Bay Area Election Officials in California combines resources</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9491" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-9.49.21-AM-273x300.png" alt="" width="273" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-9.49.21-AM-273x300.png 273w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-9.49.21-AM.png 424w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" />With the 2020 election barely in the rearview and the 2022 election looming, a group of elections officials from California counties got together and decided that the best way to tackle the issues of mis- and disinformation in 2022 and future elections was together.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://sccvote.sccgov.org/coalition-bay-area-election-officials"> Coalition of Bay Area Election Officials</a>  consists of 11 counties— Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano and Sonoma—in the<a href="https://www.visitcalifornia.com/region/san-francisco-bay-area/"> San Francisco Bay Area</a> of California.</p>
<p>The Coalition represents 4.3 million California voters — almost 20 % of the state’s registered voters. The 11 counties range in population size from San Benito with around 66,000 to Santa Clara with around 1.8 million. Some are<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/california-voters-choice-act"> Voter’s Choice Act Counties</a>, some are not.</p>
<p>And while there may be differences in the counties, the one thing they have in common is  a<a href="https://emmysf.tv/membership-2/november-2017-off-camera/bay-area-drops-to-8th-nielsen-market/"> shared media market</a> — currently the eighth largest media market in the country according to Nielsen.</p>
<p>That shared market offers a unique opportunity to present a united front to combat mis-and disinformation with trusted facts through press releases, fact sheets and op-eds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deliver key messages that we can really educate the voters about because we do understand that democracy is fragile, it took a hit in 2020, and we want to do what we can to build trust in elections,&#8221; Tommy Gong, chief deputy clerk-recorder in Contra Costa County<a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/bay-area-elections-officials-team-up-to-educate-voters-curb-misinformation.amp"> told</a> a local television station around the launch of the Coalition.</p>
<p>According to Gong, the idea for the Coalition began percolating at the end of 2021 and it was ready to launch by the spring of 2022 with a June California election on the horizon.</p>
<p>Members of the Coalition meet regularly via Zoom to cut down on travel time and costs. Who represents each county at the meetings varies from county to county. For instance it may be the county registrar, a deputy, or in the case of Santa Clara County, it’s Evelyn Mendez who serves as the county’s public and legislative affairs manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9492" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-11.12.26-AM-300x290.png" alt="" width="300" height="290" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-11.12.26-AM-300x290.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-11.12.26-AM-1024x990.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-11.12.26-AM-768x743.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-09-at-11.12.26-AM.png 1026w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“I saw the Coalition as an opportunity to build stronger relationships with my colleagues in the Bay area and to learn from them and expand the capacity to accomplish more such as creating videos which my small office doesn’t have that capacity,”<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUroS5xMTM"> said</a> Marin County Registrar of voters Lynda Roberts. “And as a group we’re able to share and talk about ways that we can present a unified message.”</p>
<p>The costs and “duties” of the Coalition are shared. With more staffing and funding, some of the larger counties have taken on things like hosting the Coalition’s website and producing an<a href="https://youtu.be/K_YsJRom6U8"> informational video</a> about the Coalition.</p>
<p>“We all have the same message, we have the same last day to register, the same election day so it’s something that we collaborate together to make sure we pick up on each other’s strengths,”<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUroS5xMTM"> said</a>, Mendez. “There’s a lot of people that have a lot of different experiences that can contribute to the whole of the group. And it’s very  helpful especially when we have a Facebook page that someone else can run, it doesn’t have to be our county. We have someone else that can put a fact sheet together. Everybody just collaborates on the ideas and it works really well for the 11 of us and I know a lot of the counties in the state could benefit from what we’re doing.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just other California counties that could benefit from the Coalition’s model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/">The Elections Group</a> did a<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/greater-bay-case-study"> case study</a> of the Coalition and created a<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61da19f9986c0c0a9fd8435f/t/634df6ee9e16ec4d4d4efe82/1666053872517/Comms+Box+Outline_221017.pdf"> workbook</a> so other jurisdictions can create their own regional coalitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every challenge facing election officials is being answered somewhere through innovative practices. We launched our Accelerating Excellence series to elevate those practices and make copying them easier through case studies and implementation workbooks,” said Danny Davenport, election expert with The Elections Group. “We knew early on that we wanted to include the Coalition in that series, because it is an amazing example of local election officials working together to educate and inform voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Coalition received the<a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Coalition-of-Bay-Area-Election-Officials-Tommy-Gong-Contra-Costa-County-CA.pdf"> Democracy Award</a> — Outstanding Practice of 2022 from The Election Center during the Election Center’s 2022 Annual Conference.</p>
<p>“Speaking on behalf of all 11 coalition counties, we are thrilled and honored to have this important work recognized,” Gong<a href="https://www.marincounty.org/main/county-press-releases/press-releases/2022/elex-joint-awards-082422"> said at the time</a>. “Our hope is that this innovative method of distributing information to a large shared media market will catch on in other regions and help our fellow elections officials find other ways to share resources.”</p>

							<h2>DHS Grant Program Op-Ed</h2>
														<p><em>**Due to a technical error, not everyone may have been able to view this op-ed last week so we are running it again.**</em></p>
<p><strong>DHS Grants Op-Ed</strong><br />
<em>New DHS grants has potential to provide meaningful support to elections officials</em></p>
<p>By Lawrence Norden and Derek Tisler</p>
<p>On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/02/27/dhs-announces-2-billion-preparedness-grants"> announced</a> a change in its Homeland Security Grant Program that could make a huge difference for election offices around the country. In fiscal year 2023, states must dedicate at least three percent of the money they receive from this $1 billion program to election security needs, opening up tens of millions of dollars for state and local election offices in need of better security for their workers and for voters.</p>
<p>Previously, DHS had recommended that states prioritize spending some of the grant money received through the program on election security – with this change in policy, that is now a requirement.</p>
<p>This new funding has the potential to provide meaningful support to our guardians of democracy. It could help reverse the flow of dedicated professionals leaving the election administration field because they don’t feel safe in the new climate of harassment and threats.</p>
<p>This grant program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with guidance and support from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Over the past few years, CISA has conducted physical security assessments for election officials across the country, identifying security risks and making critically important recommendations for increasing physical security in offices and at polling sites. But because these assessments have no money attached, election officials are too often left with awareness of vulnerabilities and without the resources to do anything about them. The grant program’s new three-percent rule can be an important step to close that gap.</p>
<p>It’s true that some election offices have been lucky enough to get state or local support that has allowed them to add important security measures. For instance, individual counties in Arizona, Colorado, and Wisconsin have purchased everything from<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/02/1084033824/election-officials-and-lawmakers-are-responding-to-voter-fraud-narrative-differe"> bulletproof doors and glass</a> to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/politics/midterms-elections-threats-security.html"> video cameras and security fencing</a>. But for every jurisdiction that has found the money to implement such measures, there are many more who could not. The new spending requirements will allow election offices to purchase the kind of basic upgrades adopted sporadically by some counties, as well as access controls and door locks to protect equipment and ensure unauthorized persons cannot gain access to buildings, and exterior and parking lot lighting to make the areas that workers use to get into official buildings more secure. It can also be used for things like table-top exercises and other training on hardening office security to meet escalating threats, as well as cell phones, radios and other communication systems that allow election workers to communicate immediately if they are threatened. Making these facilities safer is not only important for the workers who spend their days there, but also for members of the public who visit these buildings to register to vote and cast ballots.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, election workers are not just threatened where they work. Some officials, like Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, have been<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/28/winfrey-testifies-before-house-panel-threats-election-workers/5400419001/"> stalked, confronted, and threatened</a> outside their own homes. States can use the new federal funds to provide election workers with personal security training, or to help hide personal information that attackers have used in the past to harass election workers and their families outside of the office.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the threats against election workers are a new and deeply disturbing trend in American elections and will require far more than the new funds promised by FEMA. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law has estimated that the nationwide cost for instituting best practices to protect election workers from the rise in threats of physical violence could be<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-protecting-election-workers-threats-physical-violence"> as much as $300 million</a> over the next five years. Just as importantly, money alone cannot solve this problem. All levels of government must do more, including by arresting and prosecuting those who have illegally threatened election workers.</p>
<p>This effort by DHS, FEMA and CISA to get more security funding to election officials is an important first step. It is also a meaningful statement from the federal government that it understands threats of physical violence against those who run our elections are a threat to our democracy itself, and that election officials and workers should not feel they are alone when they stand up for free and fair elections for all of us.</p>
<p>For more information on available funding, election officials should contact their State Administrative Agency, which<a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/about/state-administrative-agency-contacts"> can be found here</a>.</p>

According to NPR, the states announced in tandem this week that they were beginning the process to pull out, after weeks of negotiations over potential changes the organization could make to appease GOP members who have been facing constituent pressure about ERIC, in part due to a sustained misinformation campaign from the far-right. Officials from the three states cited a number of reasons for leaving the organization including data privacy. ERIC’s Executive Director Shame Hamlin confirmed to NPR that ERIC had received the three states&#8217; requests for resignation. &#8220;We will continue our work on behalf of our remaining member states in improving the accuracy of America&#8217;s voter rolls and increasing access to voter registration for all eligible citizens,&#8221; he added in a statement.<a href="https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2023-03-07/larose-says-ohio-may-drop-out-of-voter-registration-program-he-praised-last-month"> Ohio</a> Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who has previously praised the voter registration system now says Ohio may drop out. &#8220;There have been some conversations just recently about the future of that organization. My team has been actively involved in that. I know that there are concerns that some secretaries have and like any human endeavor, there are imperfections to that organization. And some of the people involved, I think, have caused concern for others,&#8221; LaRose said when asked about ERIC. On Twitter,<a href="https://twitter.com/GaSecofState/status/1633290545689772033?s=20"> Georgia</a> Secretary of State said the states leaving ERIC have “…hurt their own state &amp; others while undermining voter confidence.”</p>

While election day itself went well in most places, what was on the ballot made more news than anything.<a href="https://www.rutlandherald.com/news/local/voter-turnout-slow-and-steady-for-town-meeting-day/article_505e3460-ee8f-5b1f-8770-88078abc16e6.html"> Vermont</a> held Town Meeting Day on Tuesday and there were few reports of issues with voter turnout being slow and steady throughout the day. Voters in<a href="https://www.timesargus.com/news/local/city-polling-place-will-stay-cookie-free/article_1afac903-ac50-5712-ad0e-b8596231332f.html"> Barre</a> had to do without after the town council decided that the Girl Scouts could not sell cookies at the polling place on Tuesday.  In<a href="https://www.waterburyroundabout.org/news-archive/pqx2jbtp3y0perayko8wul4gcm9hvj"> Duxbury</a>, drive-up voting booths were located outside the town garage and town office so voters could cast their ballots from their cars. An appropriations question was inadvertently omitted from the ballot in<a href="https://www.timesargus.com/news/local/library-glitch-will-force-special-election-in-east-montpelier/article_14071ea2-e308-514a-b15b-9efa103cff20.html"> East Montpelier</a> so a mail-in single issue special election will need to be conducted. In<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/03/07/burlington-votes-down-police-control-board-prop-zero-charter-changes/"> Burlington</a>, voters were face with three elections-related ballot measure, which were both approved. By a vote of 7,143-3,366, voters approved allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections—a measure that failed in 2015. By a vote of 6,702-3,701 voters approved expanding the use of ranked choice voting to more city offices. And finally by a vote of 7,623-2,345 voters approved updating the city charger to allow some flexibility in where polling places are located. During the all-mail municipal election in<a href="https://www.dailybreeze.com/2023/03/07/election-results-redondo-beach-voters-strongly-backing-election-process-change/"> Redondo Beach, California</a> voters seem poised to approve changing the city’s current primary and runoff system to a ranked choice process. The measure had about 77% support, according to initial returns. It was smooth sailing in<a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/secretary-sq-820-election-smooth-for-officials-in-tulsa-county"> Oklahoma</a> where a statewide special question election was held Tuesday. &#8220;It was actually a very quiet day in terms of issues or trouble,&#8221; Tulsa County Elections Secretary Gwen Freeman said. &#8220;You’re always prepared for that on every single election day. If you looked at early voting and the numbers that came back from those two days of early voting both here and at Hardesty, it was a nice and slow steady stream.”</p>

Township Clerk Diana Keller said she usually relishes the peace and quiet, yet cannot forget how it was interrupted two years ago, when three men, one of whom was equipped with a holstered sidearm, handcuffs and a bulletproof vest, walked into the township hall asking her for election equipment. A locked storage area where the ballot tabulator was kept also was broken into. Since then, Keller said she has felt isolated in a way that doesn’t have anything to do with geography. “I’m not one bit satisfied with how this was handled,” she said. “The county won’t talk to us about it. The only person they prosecuted was someone I never even saw, and the state hasn’t gotten involved. It’s like it’s just getting swept away.” At this point only one person, Tere Jackson who alleged she worked for the Department of Defense, has been charged but those charges have been dismissed. Keller is unhappy happy about spending almost $5,000 on the equipment and almost that much on attorney fees. “We’ve changed the locks on the office door and on the storage room and we have a security camera now,” she said. “I was afraid for a long time after that day, but I’ve decided to set my fear aside and move on,” she said. “I’d still like the state to investigate. I want to make our village stronger every day.”</p>

Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, both Democrats, introduced<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Vote%20at%20Home%20Act%20of%202021.pdf"> Vote at Home Act</a> on Wednesday. It would automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew driver’s licenses, allow everyone to vote by mail and provide pre-paid envelopes to return ballots. Wyden described voting from home as “just common sense” in a statement.  “The United States is stronger when more Americans can vote,” Wyden said in a statement. “Our bill will make elections more accessible to seniors, students and working families that might not have time to wait at a polling station. Voting at home makes elections more secure as well, since there’s a built-in paper trail for every single ballot that can’t be hacked.” The measure would require states to mail ballots to registered voters weeks before Election Day, while allowing people to vote in person in states that have polling places. It wouldn’t affect same-day registration in the 20 states and Washington, D.C., that don’t have voter registration deadlines.  It would also require that U.S. citizens who provide identifying information, including their name, address, signature and proof of citizenship, to their state’s motor vehicle authority be automatically registered to vote. Oregon and California were the first states to automatically register voters, and 18 other states and Washington, D.C. followed suit.</p>

Under current law, a person who has lost their right to vote based upon a past criminal conviction may apply to the Board of Pardons and Paroles for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote under certain circumstances, including payment of all fines, court costs, fees, and victim restitution as ordered by the sentencing court and completion of probation or parole and release from compliance by the court or Board of Pardons and Paroles. If signed into law, SB 21, pre-filed by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison (D-Birmingham), would eliminate the application and certificate requirement and leave it up to the Board of Pardons and Paroles to determine whether or not the person may have their right to vote restored.</p>

To ensure their ballot counts, it must be submitted this way by the Friday before Election Day. Priya Sundareshan, a Democrat, says the bill would only make it harder to vote. “That is just adding hurdles upon hurdles to people to have their ballots count,” said Sundareshan. “That’s not the way we need to be going. We need to be making it easier to vote, not harder to vote.” Republican J.D. Mesnard is the bill’s sponsor. He says it would not make voting more difficult but instead would treat early voters more like Election Day voters. The bill now heads to the House.</p>

Andrew Collins (D-Little Rock) that would have allowed eligible Arkansans to<a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2023/03/08/online-voter-registration-fails-to-pass-house-committee-other-voting-bills-sail-through"> register to vote online</a> like they do in 42 other states. A similar bill passed the House with 95 votes last session before it died in the Senate.  A representative for Secretary of State John Thurston said his office was neutral on the bill and had already contacted the office’s vendor for such things in case the bill passed. Collins said<a href="https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HB1537.pdf"> House Bill 1537</a> would help a variety of people register, including 18-year-olds and people with disabilities. Christian Adcock of Disability Rights Arkansas spoke in support of the bill.  Rep. Cindy Crawford (R-Fort Smith) said she voted for the bill in the last session but her constituents “chewed” on her for voting for something that they said could inject more fraud into elections.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-9486" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PaloAltoCA.png" alt="" width="179" height="166" />Palo Alto, California</strong>: This week, the Palo Alto city council approved an emergency ordinance that would<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/palo-alto-bans-concealed-weapons-at-city-buildings-polling-places-schools-other-sensitive-locations/"> restrict concealed firearms</a> from being carried in certain locations deemed sensitive. Councilmembers approved the emergency ordinance unanimously and it will be effective immediately. They also approved a separate, standard ordinance that will allow amendments to the original language and make the ordinance available for public comment. The ordinance bans concealed firearms on any city-owned property, active polling place, or school, whether it be public or private.  Included in the emergency ordinance was a direction to staff to draft a resolution that states that the city is deeply concerned for the safety of its residents given what it called an epidemic of gun violence in Santa Clara County, California, and the U.S. The council limited the emergency ordinance to sensitive locations recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 2022 decision that invalidated blanket restrictions on concealed weapons.</p>

Miles Rapoport, a Democrat who served as Connecticut’s top election official from 1995 to 1999, appeared before the legislature’s Government Administration and Elections Committee to support the bill. At the moment, the proposal is a one-paragraph concept that requires qualified Connecticut voters to cast ballots during elections or provide a reason for not doing so. Rapoport likened compulsory voting to mandatory participation in jury duty, a civic requirement adopted to ensure that jury pools are reflective of the overall population when a person’s guilt or innocence is on the line. “I think the analogy to voting is very strong. We want — or we absolutely should want the decisions that are made about the laws under which we live and the people who are making those laws to be decided by the most fully reflective population,” Rapoport said. “We don’t have that now.” Supporters of the proposal do not envision heavy punishments for those who fail to vote and do not provide a reason. Rapoport said Australian authorities accepted virtually any excuse voters provide for not casting ballots. The proposal has attracted a fair amount of controversy. More than 50 people submitted written testimony ahead of this week’s hearing and opponents overwhelmingly outweighed supporters.</p>

The Senate voted 33-23 along party lines to approve<a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/64653"> Senate Bill 222</a>, sending it to the House for more debate. The measure would tighten a provision from a 2021 Georgia law that made it illegal for elections officials themselves to accept outside money after Republicans grew alarmed that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg donated more than $400 million to election officials nationwide. “We’ve had some communities that didn’t quite understand the intent, so this is an attempt to clarify the attempt,” said Senate Ethics Committee Chair Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican. He went on to say that a third party gives money for elections, “You influence the outcome of the elections.”</p>
<p>A divided state House committee approved a bill that would allow Georgians to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-state-legislature/house-panel-passes-bill-to-allow-inspection-of-georgia-ballots/TE7TNDLVPRDWHHOHLTSSEPCFEY/"> inspect paper ballots after an election</a>. Current law allows Georgians to inspect electronic copies of ballot images to verify that official vote tallies are accurate. But the original paper ballots remain under seal and can be opened only with a judge’s order — a procedure designed to prevent ballots from being tampered with after an election.<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/426"> House Bill 426</a> would provide public access to the paper ballots after an election is certified — a move proponents say will increase confidence in elections by allowing citizens to verify the results for themselves. The committee was evenly divided on the bill, but Chairman John LaHood cast the deciding vote in favor of it. The bill now goes to the Rules Committee, which will determine whether it gets a vote by the full House.</p>

If<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0259/"> House Bill 259</a> is passed into law, only a county clerk, election official, officer or employee of the state authorized by law would be able to distribute absentee ballot application forms. The bill specifically says nongovernmental entities shall not distribute absentee ballot applications unless they are specifically authorized by state or federal law. That means that spouses, parents, other family members, nursing home staff members, roommates, neighbors, co-workers, voting advocacy groups, political parties and anyone else would be banned from distributing absentee ballot application forms. Rep. Kevin Andrus, R-Lava Hot Springs, sponsored House Bill 259, saying he feels strongly that political campaigns should not be allowed to distribute absentee ballot applications. Andrus’ bill goes further, though. It prohibits everyone — not just political campaigns — from distributing absentee ballot applications unless they are a county clerk, election official or an officer or employee of the state specifically authorized to distribute the absentee ballot application forms.</p>

The bill got pushback for provisions opponents said would disenfranchise elderly and disabled voters while also needlessly complicating procedures for election employees. But the bill’s author — Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola — and supporters say the measure would add more security to Indiana’s elections than signature verification alone can provide. Committee Chair Jon Ford, R-Terre Haute, said that he would hold the bill while Wesco worked on amendments. Right now, voters requesting absentee ballots are asked — but not required — to provide the last four digits of their Social Security Numbers on their applications. That applies to mail-in ballot applications, as well as applications for traveling board, military-overseas and other others. House Bill 1334 would make identification mandatory, and more. It would require a voter to put down those last four numbers, or one of three other identifiers: an Indiana driver’s license number, a non-driver identification card number or a unique identifier for those who registered to vote decades ago. A voter could instead include a photocopy of their license, non-driver card or other proof of identification — like a passport or state university-issued ID card — in the envelope with the application. County election boards would have to match at least one of the numbers with information in the voter’s registration record. Without a match, election officials would have to work with the voter to resolve the errors, delaying receipt of the mail-in ballot. The completed ballot needs to be back in officials’ hands by 6 p.m. on Election Day to get counted. The bill would also bar state agencies and local units of government from “mass-mailing” unsolicited applications. And it would give the Secretary of State — currently Diego Morales — broad powers to “prescribe any other procedures necessary to implement” certain provisions dealing with how to get new applications to and from voters. While the secretary of state’s office supports the legislation, most who spoke at the hearing this week did so in opposition to the bill.</p>

Chief among the measures proposed by Republican senators would require voters to present a government-issued photo ID at the polls to minimize the risk of voter fraud. The Republican bill would allow a driver’s license, a state ID card, U.S. passport, military ID, or concealed carry gun permit; but a student ID from a Maine college or university would not qualify. Senate Republicans would also prohibit absentee ballot drop boxes, which became popular in the pandemic-plagued election of 2020, unless security cameras are watching them 24/7. A House Republican bill that has received a public hearing would make voters re-register every four years.</p>
<p>Sen. Pinny Beebe-Center, D-Rockland, introduced LD 577,<a href="https://knox.villagesoup.com/2023/03/08/sen-beebe-center-introduces-bill-to-make-local-election-information-more-available-online/"> “An Act to Increase Availability of Election Information on Local Government Websites.”</a> The bill was the subject of a public hearing before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government. LD 577 aims to increase the availability of official online information about local elections for all Maine voters, regardless of where they live. This would entail the Secretary of State’s Office assisting town offices with creating web pages and uploading election information to those pages. The Secretary of State’s office testified in favor of the bill, acknowledging the serious undertaking of the bill, but realizing its importance as well. The League of Women Voters of Maine also testified in favor of the bill, acknowledging its importance especially for small towns. “Representing a district of mostly small towns, I am well aware of the workload for town clerks and the lack of resources for digital infrastructure in many Maine municipalities,” said Sen. Beebe-Center.  “Having the Secretary of State’s Office implement a system where town clerks could submit official local election information to be posted on the Secretary of State’s website would solve the issue of some towns not having the existing infrastructure or technical capacity to post official local election information online themselves. This is a matter of equity: No Maine voters should be penalized in their efforts toward civic engagement just because they live in a small town with limited resources.”</p>

It calls for four supervisors for divisions including elections, vital records, legal divisions and deeds. Clerk-Register Domonique Clemons was appointed clerk-register in December by Genesee Circuit Court judges and started work on a reorganization designed to complete the task of merging the county clerk and register of deeds operations. Commissioners started the process 12 years ago when they voted to merge the clerk and register of deeds positions, but the offices maintained largely separate identities. Clemons has told commissioners that he wants the offices to function together with employees cross-trained to be able to work in more than one position.</p>

Five cities in Minnesota are also using ranked choice voting for their local elections, including Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Bloomington, Saint Louis Park, and Minnetonka. Senator Kelly Morrison is the chief author of a bill that would require ranked choice voting for all state and federal elections in Minnesota. “Ranked choice voting gives voters great voice, choice, and power,” Morrison says. Authors of the bill say ranked-choice voting can prevent costly and time-consuming runoff elections. The bill would also allow cities, counties, and school districts to use ranked-choice voting in their local elections. However, Senate Republicans argue the current election system in Minnesota has worked for generations and doesn’t need to be changed.</p>
<p>Gov. Tim Walz signed<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;f=HF0028&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2023"> House File 28,</a> which<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voting-rights-restored-55000-minnesota-felons-new-voting/story?id=97628054"> restores the right to vote</a> to convicted felons who complete their term of incarceration. According to the governor&#8217;s office, 55,000 individuals who previously were deprived of voting rights now can register to vote, the most significant expansion of that right in Minnesota in a half-century.</p>
<p>The Democracy for the People Act, (<a href="https://default.salsalabs.org/T7dd260b7-2c87-416a-b820-944026139c56/5ef89c78-c57a-451b-9ee9-a3fa98aafe65">HF3</a>), includes a provision that would make it a gross misdemeanor — punishable by up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine — to<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/03/07/election-bill-would-make-it-illegal-to-knowingly-spread-false-election-info-that-impedes-voting/"> knowingly spread materially false information</a> with the intent to impede or prevent people from voting. It would apply before 60 days an election.  It would be illegal to spread false information about the “time, place or manner of holding an election,” qualifications for or restrictions on voter eligibility, and threats to physical safety associated with voting. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, a national voting rights attorney and chief author of the election bill, said the provision is designed to protect voters from intimidation, harassment or anything that would hinder them from voting. “We realized Minnesota (statute) is not strong and clear enough,” she said.</p>

The system is used for some elections in 12 states and allows voters to rank candidates by preference, with the winner being the first candidate to collect more than 50% of votes. A representative from the Secretary of State’s office said ranked-choice voting would confuse voters and open up elections to vote-counting errors and delays. Opponents said the bill addresses a problem that doesn’t exist, as no elections are currently held in Montana through ranked-choice voting. The measure passed the House of Representatives with Democrats in opposition.</p>

Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, would<a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/national_news/nebraska-bill-seeks-to-make-all-state-elections-nonpartisan/article_7f959876-b80b-580b-9a99-53f3ac0c1b30.html"> make all Nebraska elections nonpartisan</a>, except for presidential elections. Instead of holding partisan primary elections, voters could vote on all candidates running for that office, and then the top two candidates would advance to the general election. The bill was the subject of a public hearing in the state&#8217;s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee.  Many of Nebraska&#8217;s elections are already nonpartisan, including elections for legislative seats. However, some races — including those for governor and various state offices, Congress and many county offices — are partisan. Candidates are chosen in the primaries by party, and they are identified on the ballot by their party affiliation. Those practices would change under LB776.</p>
<p><a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=50722">Legislative Bill 770</a>, proposed by State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, would require the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office to audit the Department of Motor Vehicles, polling places and the offices for county clerks and county commissioners to<a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-lawmaker-proposes-audit-of-dmv-polling-places-for-ada-compliance/"> ensure ADA compliance</a>. The audits would begin in 2025 and be conducted every five years after. The Secretary of State’s Office would provide its findings and any recommendations to the Government Committee and the Governor’s Office after each audit. The proposal includes a fiscal note of about $4 million, which was derived from an engineering firm that specializes in ADA compliance at the recommendation of the state ADA coordinator. Additional costs, such as any changes that may be required, were not included in the estimate.</p>

Republican Assems. Danielle Gallant, Ken Gray, Bert Gurr and Toby Yurek submitted Assembly Bill 230 to the record last week. The bill would change the deadline for a county clerk to receive a ballot to Election Day at 5 p.m. A voter would have to mail their ballot before the end of the early voting period. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo said in his State of the State Address in January that he would support such a measure. Republican Assem. Gregory Hafen II, of Pahrump, introduced similar legislation in February. Hafen’s bill<a href="https://www.kunr.org/show/purple-politics-nevada/2023-03-03/2023-nevada-legislative-session-republican-election-bills-voter-id-fraud-punishment-voting-deadlines"> would also require</a> voter identification. Nevada law allows mail-in ballots to be accepted for four days after an election. The change in the law, passed and signed by former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, was a compromise and changed from seven days.</p>

The bill would let election candidates collect digital signatures, in addition to paper signatures; it would require the state to operate an “election security organization”; and would require mandatory training for election watchers, among other things. “All of the changes that are in this bill are born from actual experiences of New Mexico’s election administrators,” bill co-sponsor Sen. Katy M. Duhigg (D-Rio Rancho) told the House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee on Monday, March 6. “A lot of this is stuff that was adopted temporarily during the 2020 election.” Under the bill, poll workers could also get more pay. And the bill adds security measures to absentee ballots, Duhigg said. For example, the bill would require the last four digits of a person’s social security in order to submit absentee ballots. The bill would let the Secretary of State designate officials’ home addresses as confidential. Ultimately, the committee voted to pass the bill. But the three Republicans in the committee voted against the bill. It’s already been approved by the New Mexico Senate and next heads to the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>House Bill 4, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a<a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/bill-to-expand-voting-access-heads-to-full-senate/article_1659adbc-bc2f-11ed-b31a-c799934a0d6f.html"> 6-3 party-line vote</a>, was<a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-voting-rights-bill-1e5ed0ccef74cf4d4bf5ffb825160a61"> approved by the full Senate on a 27-14 vote</a>. Under the legislation, New Mexicans would be automatically registered to vote when they do business at the Motor Vehicle Division, and the voting rights of convicted felons would be automatically restored the day they get out of prison. In addition to enacting automatic voter registration and automatically registering convicted felons upon their release from incarceration, even if they’re still on parole, the bill would create a permanent absentee voter list and make Election Day a state holiday. Automatic voter registration would not go into place until 2025. The bill now heads back to the House for a concurrence vote on amendments before reaching the governor’s desk. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has expressed support for major provisions in the bill.</p>
<p>A proposal to prohibit New Mexicans from bringing<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2579845/bill-banning-firearms-from-polling-places-advances-to-house-floor-while-other-gun-bills-also-advance.html"> guns into polling places</a> is headed to the House floor, after winning approval on a party-line vote in its final House committee. The bill, Senate Bill 44, would specifically bar firearms from being brought within 100 feet of a polling place — or inside. It was brought forward after an election cycle that featured a defeated GOP state House candidate being charged in January with shooting at the homes of several Democratic elected officials.</p>

The legislation would also Allow people to register to vote online — and also require state officials to do more work to verify that people are actually dead, or have moved, before removing them from the list of registered voters, crack down harder on people who intimidate voters or election workers, by increasing criminal penalties and also broadening what counts as intimidation, increase funding for elections offices around the state, and make it a crime to falsely tell people they’re not eligible to vote, or to challenge large numbers of voters’ eligibility without proof. State and national political groups sometimes engage in both those tactics.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have filed<a href="https://www.wral.com/north-carolina-republicans-file-bill-that-would-reduce-early-voting/20753789/"> their own election reform bills</a>. One is called the Election Day Integrity Act and would ban election boards from accepting mail-in absentee ballots received after 7:30pm on Election Day. Current law allows mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day to be accepted until the Friday after the election. A separate bill would shrink the early voting period from 17 days to nine days starting and ending with the Saturdays closest to the election.</p>

SB 51, creates a new Election Integrity Division answering to the Secretary of State. The team would be responsible for investigating voter fraud “upon receiving a complaint” or at its own discretion. In addition to requiring the office investigate public complaints, the law directs it to produce an annual report. The second proposal, SB 71, establishes another office under the Secretary of State’s umbrella. The Office of Data Analytics and Archives would serve as a clearing house for the statewide voter registration database. The measure also codifies what information boards of election must include in a bid for uniformity. Additionally, a provision in SB 71, known as the DATA Act, could actually lead to less voter information being publicly available. The bill does not, however, shield birthdates.</p>

Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 0396 attempts to limit who may mail in a mail ballot for voters. The legislation would limit the people who can &#8220;physically mail [a] voted mail ballot&#8221; to the &#8220;voter/spouse/court appointed guardian/cohabitant/or adult person related to the voter by blood or marriage.&#8221; The bill is opposed by Secretary of State Greg Amore. Amore warns the move could – and likely would – disenfranchise voters who live by themselves and older voters who rely on others for assistance by prohibiting people in &#8220;a voter’s trusted circle from being able to assistthem when returning their mail ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senate Bill 0364 would repeal the state’s voter ID law. The Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, says repeal &#8220;would encourage voting by ethnic minorities, the elderly, people with disabilities and those who are poor.&#8221; &#8220;Voter identification was enacted for a reasonable purpose – to deter voter fraud,&#8221; the commission acknowledged. &#8220;However, voter identification comes at a high price – the discouragement of voting &#8230; [and that] price is too high to pay.&#8221;</p>

The bills would affect five of the state&#8217;s six largest counties. State Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) and State Representatives Briscoe Cain (R-Deer Park) and Mike Schofield (R-Katy) filed identical bills (<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB1750">Senate Bill 1750</a>) that would hand the powers of the appointed elections administrator back to the elected county clerk and county tax assessor-collector. In addition to Harris County, the bills would affect Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, and Collin Counties. But in a statement accompanying the filing of their bills, Bettencourt and Cain left no doubt that they were responding to developments in their home county during the 2022 primary and general elections. The bills&#8217; authors argue that the measures would make large counties more responsible to their respective voters. &#8220;The Elections Administrator experiment in Harris County has failed,&#8221; Cain said. &#8220;As larger counties try to use this position as another bureaucrat meant to grow government, it&#8217;s important that voters have a say in running their elections.&#8221;</p>

Bill sponsor Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, told fellow lawmakers his bill adopts 18 of 22 recommendations made by the audit. He grouped the provisions into the following five categories:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">The bill gives the state&#8217;s top election official, the lieutenant governor, specific authority and methods to enforce election law. The lieutenant governor&#8217;s election office &#8220;will provide a method of consulting, training, warning, and, if necessary, enforcing our election laws,&#8221; Maloy told a Senate committee last month.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It also improves the use of a statewide voter database to &#8220;allow for more consistent and effective use by counties.&#8221; Maloy said the bill &#8220;requires the lieutenant governor&#8217;s office to manage voter registration activities, analyze county use of a database to ensure the use of building controls monthly and maintains a document describing statutory voter list maintenance for clerks.&#8221;</li>
<li aria-level="1">When it comes to vote count discrepancies, HB448 requires public reconciliation of ballots, requires an immediate count of ballots received and requires chain of custody standards to better track the receipt and count of ballots.</li>
<li aria-level="1">HB448 gives election workers more details about what it means for signatures to match and requires signature verification training. Maloy said it also requires a study by the Division of Motor Vehicles and the lieutenant governor&#8217;s office on how to improve the quality of signatures on file.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Lastly, Maloy said the bill strengthens Utah&#8217;s election audit system by prohibiting an individual from auditing their own work. It also requires the lieutenant governor to study risk-limiting audits for their potential use in the state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maloy&#8217;s bill drew support from election administrators, including Ryan Cowley, state director of elections. Cowley praised the audit&#8217;s findings of no fraud, but said HB448 is a good step forward for elections in the state.</p>
<p>Lawmakers allowed the clock to runout on HJR that would have asked voters to approve increasing the threshold for a ballot measure approval to 60% of voters. The resolution passed the House 56-16, but wasn&#8217;t considered in the Senate.</p>

Mark Gordon allowed House Bill 103 to become law<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/03/02/gordon-allows-crossover-voting-bill-to-pass-into-law-without-signature-big-win-for-chuck-gray/"> without his signature</a>. House Bill 103 moves the deadline to change party affiliation from primary election day to the day before candidates can file for political office in Wyoming. The idea behind this bill is to prevent voters from changing their party affiliation to influence the primary election of a different party. He expressed skepticism that the bill will prevent crossover voting in the future, saying the bill’s effects may be “more academic than real” due to the fact that nearly 93% of Wyoming voters are Republican. Gordon also said “no matter what” the bill will cause “some confusion” among voters in the next primary.  “Because the bill adds uncertainty to the voting process, I have determined not to sign HB 0103,” Gordon said.</p>

In a brief <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/030223zr_k536.pdf">order</a>, the court called for the parties involved in the dispute and the Justice Department to file &#8220;supplemental letter briefs&#8221; addressing the Supreme Court&#8217;s jurisdiction over the case, given that the North Carolina Supreme Court has agreed to rehear the redistricting dispute at its center. On the one side of the legal fight are North Carolina Republican legislative leaders, and on the other side are voting rights groups, North Carolina voters and state elections officials. The Justice Department backed voting rights groups in the case. The court set a deadline of March 20 for the additional filings to be submitted.</p>

According to Votebeat, Mayes believes that, when agreeing last week to give Recorder David Stevens the authority to run the county’s elections, the county supervisors weren’t clear enough that they still have the final say over certain decisions, according to the Arizona Superior Court complaint. State law requires the supervisors to approve decisions such as where to put voting centers and who to hire to work the polls, for example, and they must also finalize election results. In a statement, Mayes equated the agreement to an “unqualified handover” that could give Stevens the potential to cloak future changes to the county’s elections from the public. “I am deeply concerned this move might shield or obscure actions and deliberations the Board would typically conduct publicly under open meeting law,” Mayes wrote. Mayes is asking the court to stop Stevens from exercising the authority given to him in the agreement, to stop him and the supervisors from spending money related to the agreement, to recover any related money that has already been spent with interest, and to declare the agreement void.</p>
<p>Calling his 2022 election challenge &#8220;groundless and not brought in good faith,&#8221; Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Melissa Julian has ordered Mark Finchem and his attorney to<a href="https://www.wmicentral.com/news/finchem-ordered-to-pay-attorneys-fees-in-election-case/article_57ec0e95-cbb8-51d6-ade1-52ba159d0f3a.html"> pay the legal fees</a> of successful secretary of state candidate Adrian Fontes. Julian said that Finchem and Daniel McCauley also have to pick up the tab for Katie Hobbs. She also was named as a defendant in his claim based on her prior position as secretary of state and based on his claim she interfered with his candidacy. What Finchem and McCauley owe has yet to be determined. Julian told them to submit their bills to him for review. Finchem, in a statement, called the ruling &#8220;contemptible judicial overreach&#8221; beyond the authority of state law and court rules.</p>

Hutchinson will replace Nick Resnick, who last month resigned from the seat for which the two men had run against each other in a tightly contested November election. Resnick was erroneously certified the winner in November due to an error in how the Alameda County Registrar of Voters tabulated the ranked choice voting results, leading to weeks of uncertainty over how the mishap could be rectified. Seligman declared Hutchinson the election’s winner, determining that a re-review of the ballots supported the notion that Hutchinson would have won if votes cast with a blank first column or an ineligible write-in submission had immediately been transferred to him.</p>

Court documents show Jones sent multiple threats to Monica Palmer, the then-chair of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, which is tasked with certifying election results in the Detroit area. Court filings show text messages, including ones in which Jones calls Palmer &#8220;a terrorist,&#8221; and says Palmer, her husband and their daughter &#8220;should be afraid.&#8221; According to the criminal complaint, Jones admitted to sending the messages and posts, telling investigators she felt Palmer was interfering with the election. Jones could face up to 10 years in prison. Her sentencing is scheduled for July.</p>

A survey in 2017 found that many of the county&#8217;s polling locations contain barriers to voting for persons with disabilities, which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The settlement requires the county to either relocate inaccessible polling places to new, accessible facilities, or to use temporary measures such as portable ramps, signs, traffic cones, and doorbells, where appropriate, to ensure accessibility on Election Day.</p>

Vote.org introduced an app in 2018 to ease voter registration by letting users upload electronic images of their signatures and provide all needed registration info. The program then automatically filled in the data, along with the signature, on voter registration forms and Vote.org sent the forms to their fax vendor, which faxed them to the county registrar’s office. To comply with a Texas law passed in 2013 authorizing registration by fax, Vote.org had another vendor then mail printed versions of the applications to county registrars within four business days of the fax transmission, a method state lawmakers intended to make it possible for procrastinators to beat the registration deadline with a faxed application and then follow up with an original signed copy. According to Texas, Vote.org’s rollout of the software was an “unmitigated disaster.” In response, then-Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos issued a press release days before the 2018 midterm elections telling voters online registration is not allowed in Texas and advising counties applications submitted through Vote.org’s application were not complete because they contained digital signatures. Texas codified and clarified the rule in May 2021 with passage of House Bill 3107, which stipulates registering via fax requires an application containing the voter’s “original signature” be submitted by personal delivery or mail within four days of faxing the form. Vote.org sued the elections administrators of four of Texas’ most populous counties – Bexar (seat San Antonio), Travis (Austin), Dallas, and Cameron (Brownsville) – alleging the signature requirement violates the First and 14th Amendments and section 1971 of the Civil Rights Act because an original signature is irrelevant to a person’s qualifications for voting.</p>

A host of reforms have been proposed, like opening primaries up to independent voters or implementing top-two, top-four, and even top-five systems. Yet, while primaries are often among the most consequential contests in American politics, voters are largely uninterested. Primary turnout in most races is abysmally low, and in some states is trending down. Are new forms of primaries part of the prescription for what ails American politics, and what can be done about low turnout? Join the Bipartisan Policy Center, election experts, and policymakers for a discussion examining primary turnout and reform, including new 50-state analysis of 2022 midterm primary turnout and the impact of reforms like Alaska’s new top-four system. <strong>When:</strong> March 9, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/making-congress-work-divided-nation">Making Congress Work in a Divided Nation</a>: Congressional committees are essential to a functioning legislative process, but experts agree they aren’t being used to their full potential. The media paints a picture of a legislative body paralyzed by partisanship, and political scientists agree that our representatives are passing fewer bills. After the chaos that embroiled the current House over the race for speaker, is it any wonder that many Americans have lost faith in the effectiveness of their elected representatives? The Brennan Center is thrilled to host a panel discussion about making Congress work with former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), political correspondent Daniel Strauss, and Brennan Center Elections and Government Program research fellow Dr. Maya Kornberg. Kinzinger is no stranger to calling out Congress for allowing partisanship to breed dysfunction, particularly as one of the two Republicans on the House January 6 committee. Strauss is a staff writer at the New Republic and has covered both Washington politics and political campaigns across the country. Kornberg is the author of the new book, Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process, which examines the legislative process beyond polarized voting patterns. Join us for an important and timely in-person conversation in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, March 22, at 6:30 p.m. The event will be moderated by Mike Spahn, a partner at Precision, one of the country’s leading strategic marketing agencies. The panel will address questions including what the committee system teaches us about bipartisan collaboration, what must be done to bring Congress into the digital age, and how to make Congress more representative of the country as a whole. <strong>When:</strong> March 22, 6:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Philanthropy-Organizer-Consultant-RFP.pdf">Philanthropy-Organizer Consultant RFP</a>, Nonproft VOTE— Nonprofit VOTE is seeking an experienced consultant to act as the organizer and facilitator for the Philanthropy for Voter Engagement Initiative. This Initiative seeks to mobilize foundations to support voter engagement among their grantees and within their communities, both directly through grantmaking and indirectly through their actions. This Initiative is not about fundraising for any particular organization, but rather resourcing and supporting critical voter engagement work at nonprofits across the nation. Funding within the voter engagement space is often cyclical and narrowly focused on groups that do voter engagement work almost exclusively. Such a strategy fails to provide needed consistency and underutilizes the vast nonprofit infrastructure already in place in communities around the nation, including food pantries, housing clinics, family service agencies, community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and other nonprofits that have long-standing, year-around relations with the communities they serve. The long-term goal of the Initiative is to foster a philanthropic system that consistently supports and resources voter engagement among their grantees and broader community. The immediate objective is to build upon work that Nonprofit VOTE conducted in partnership with various philanthropy serving organizations (PSOs) to produce the Voter Engagement Toolkit for Foundations (both private and community foundation editions) in 2018. The toolkit to be updated identifies common strategies from direct funding of voter engagement work to the hosting trainings and revising overly-restrictive grant language. As the toolkits make clear, a foundation need not be a civic engagement funder to support voter engagement. There are roles for health funders, housing funders, environmental funders and most other types of funders to support voter engagement in a way that enables them and their grantees to more effectively deliver on their missions and strengthen the communities they serve. The Initiative consultant will work in close partnership with Nonprofit VOTE’s executive director and other key staff. <strong>Deadline:</strong> March 15. <strong>Application:</strong> For more information and to apply for this RFP,<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Philanthropy-Organizer-Consultant-RFP.pdf"> click here</a>.</p>
