														<p><strong>Bipartisan Policy Center Elections Task Force Report</strong><br />
<em>Policy to Carry Us Beyond the Next Election</em></p>
<p>By Grace Gordon and Rachel Orey<br />
Bipartisan Policy Center</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9639" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NEW-REPORT-Policy-to-Carry-Us-Beyond-the-Next-Election-Elections-Project-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NEW-REPORT-Policy-to-Carry-Us-Beyond-the-Next-Election-Elections-Project-300x169.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NEW-REPORT-Policy-to-Carry-Us-Beyond-the-Next-Election-Elections-Project-1024x576.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NEW-REPORT-Policy-to-Carry-Us-Beyond-the-Next-Election-Elections-Project-768x432.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NEW-REPORT-Policy-to-Carry-Us-Beyond-the-Next-Election-Elections-Project-1536x864.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NEW-REPORT-Policy-to-Carry-Us-Beyond-the-Next-Election-Elections-Project.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Chronic underfunding and back-to-back crises have created an election policy environment that must prioritize immediate threats at the expense of long-term planning. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s latest report,<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/policy-beyond-the-next-election/"> Policy to Carry us Beyond the Next Election</a>, is endorsed by the BPC’s Task Force on Elections that seeks to abate this stopgap mentality by pairing long-term vision with concrete, interim reforms.</p>
<p>“The strength of the 2022 midterm election is thanks to the tireless work of election administrators nationwide who shored up our democratic institutions in the face of rising anti-democratic sentiment,” said Rachel Orey, Associate Director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project. “Yet looming practical challenges—exacerbated by election conspiracies and ongoing disinformation campaigns—threaten to increase the number and severity of glitches in 2024, with its higher turnout and more intense focus on the presidential election.”</p>
<p>Practical challenges could become a self-fulfilling cycle in which under-resourced election offices spread thin by baseless attacks become more likely to make mistakes that, in turn, fan the flames of conspiracist sentiment. The report urges state and federal legislators to close the resource and policy gaps that put the critical infrastructure of our democracy at risk.</p>
<p>The report outlines six goals for the future of election administration and 23 actionable policy recommendations to make these goals a reality. Each recommendation strives to supersede partisan politics as a motivator by placing voters and election administrators front and center.</p>
<p>The six long-term goals for election administration are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Election administration has regular, predictable funding from local, state, and federal governments.</li>
<li>All qualified individuals are able to register and cast their ballot in a free, fair, and private manner without undue burden or barrier. Voter roll maintenance is a regular and uncontroversial part of the elections process that is sustained through interstate cooperation.</li>
<li>Results are trusted by candidates and the general public. Mail ballot processing is smooth and widely trusted, and initial results are released expediently after the polls close. After a successful canvass, results are certified and acknowledged by stakeholders without controversy.</li>
<li>The elections workforce is well resourced, well trained, and resilient to threats.</li>
<li>State and federal governments invest in election technology innovation. National guidelines for voting and non-voting equipment are updated regularly with the input of local election officials and adhered to nationwide.</li>
<li>Political factors do not affect the unbiased administration or perception of elections. Legislative reforms are made in a bipartisan manner and prioritize the needs of voters and election administrators.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the public servants responsible for the day-to-day work of keeping our democracy functioning, election officials have specialized knowledge of how the increasingly complex elections ecosystem functions. Their input is crucial to—yet all too often excluded from—election policy conversations.</p>
<p>Election officials inspired and endorsed all 23 policy recommendations in the report. For example, to ensure a well-resourced elections workforce, the report proposes compensating election workers at competitive rates commensurate with their responsibilities and experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report encourages state and local government partnerships with other local government bodies to incentivize public servants to serve as temporary election workers.<a href="https://votehamiltoncountyohio.gov/become-poll-worker/partners-in-democracy/"> Hamilton County, Ohio</a> ,<a href="https://elections.maricopa.gov/asset/jcr:5cd67713-a05b-4ac7-896a-649a6790934f/FINAL%20-%202022%20Elections%20Plan.pdf"> Maricopa County, Arizona,</a> and the<a href="https://www.charlestoncounty.org/departments/bevr/adopt-a-polling-location.php"> city of Charleston, South Carolina</a> all have programs in place to encourage local government involvement in temporary election work.</p>
<p>This report is the eighth unanimously endorsed product of<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"> BPC’s Task Force on Elections</a>, comprised of 29 state and local election officials from 21 states devoted to making meaningful improvements to U.S. elections. Formed in 2019, the task force is the country’s first convening of currently serving election administrators.</p>

The lowest voter turnout in the U.S. is in rural counties and small metropolitan areas, according to new data from<a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/about-us"> County Health Rankings and Roadmaps</a>, an annual report published by the Population Health Institute. The program analyzes health across a variety of measures for every county in the U.S. with the goal of creating awareness about the many different factors that can influence community health. One of those indicators is voter turnout, calculated as a percentage of voting-age residents who cast a ballot. In 2023, the focus of the report was on the connections between infrastructure, civic participation (like voting), and community health. Experts say that communities with better infrastructure have higher scores on measures of public health and higher rates of voter turnout. “Rural places have lower access to broadband internet, access to libraries, parks and recreation facilities, and slightly lower access to adequately funded schools,” Keith Gennuso, researcher at the Population Health Institute, told the Daily Yonder. These resources are what public health professionals call civic infrastructure, or the amenities that help a community provide services to its residents. unequal access to civic infrastructure hurts voter turnout because it limits the spaces where residents feel like they can organize and participate in community affairs. If people feel like they don’t belong to a place, they are less likely to vote, studies show.</p>

If what Dr. Frank says is true, we will be the first in line to seek answers.” “Secretary Gray meets with hundreds of people every week to discuss issues that affect them,” spokesman Joe Rubino said in an email response to WyoFile’s telephone inquiry about Gray’s April 1 meeting with Frank.</p>

In the letter, Garcia, who has been the Tarrant County elections administrator since 2018 and is well regarded, cited difference with new County Judge Tim O’Hare as a driving force behind his resignation. O’Hare who campaigned against “mail ballot harvesting” and “Democrats cheating” created a county election integrity task force to look for voter fraud although there was a lack of evidence of any widespread fraud. “When leadership respects the team’s values and shows trust, members of the team become the best version of themselves. … Judge O’Hare, my formula to ‘administer a quality transparent election’ stands on <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-9600" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-5.30.23-AM-216x300.png" alt="" width="194" height="269" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-5.30.23-AM-216x300.png 216w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-5.30.23-AM-738x1024.png 738w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-5.30.23-AM-768x1065.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-5.30.23-AM.png 894w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" />respect and zero politics; compromising on these values is not an option for me. You made it clear in our last meeting that your formula is different, thus, my decision is to leave.” A meeting between the county commission and O’Hare this week<a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2023-04-18/tarrant-county-judge-commissioners-clash-at-meeting-over-resignation-of-elections-administrator"> became heated</a> over Garcia’s resignation. The commissioners expressed support for Garcia. “It just seems to me that Mr. Garcia had an excellent record running elections,” Democratic County Commissioner Roy Charles Brooks said. “He was verified by every audit that was ever done of our election system. He had the respect of both political parties. He was transparent in the operation of the elections office.”  In<a href="https://www.farmvilleherald.com/2023/04/buckingham-county-adds-a-new-registrar-electoral-board-member/"> Buckingham County, Virginia</a> Luis Gutierrez has been appointed to serve as the county’s new general registrar after the previous registrar resigned in March. Gutierrez is serving in an interim role until June 30. Additionally, Woody Hanes will be filling the role for a Democratic member of the county’s electoral board. Hanes is a former educator and has served as a poll worker and precinct officer. Hanes said her main focus is getting the office functioning. “The kid thing is to have this office functioning,” Hanes told The Farmville Herald. “That’s the main goal. We’re getting the computers set up, getting the new registrar up to date. The office is open and it&#8217;s functioning.”</p>

The contest was open to Dinwiddie youth under the age of 18 and invited them to submit artwork to be used as the County’s “I Voted” sticker. Stephanie B. Wray, General Registrar and Director of Elections shared “This was a way to generate youth involvement and solicit public input in the elections process. Our hope was to elicit a sense of community pride through the specialized sticker as opposed to using a generic “I Voted” sticker on Election Day.” A total of 29 designs were submitted and the Electoral Board selected six that would be shared with and voted on by the citizens of Dinwiddie County. The winning design was created by Chad Eric Edwards, Jr. When asked what inspired the sticker, Eric responded, “I thought about the reason why we get to vote. If it was not for our military and people fighting for our country, we would not have the freedoms we have now, and we wouldn’t be able to vote.” Eric continued, “I am thankful for all the people that continue to serve so that we can continue to have the freedoms we enjoy every day.” Regarding the new stickers, Emma Ruffin, Chair of the Electoral Board stated, “We were certainly pleased by the community response to this contest and will be honored to pass out stickers with Eric’s design during 2023 elections.” Eric is a junior at Dinwiddie High School, and also attends Rowanty Technical Center where he studies carpentry.</p>

He was 73. He died after unexpected medical complications during a six-month, around-the-world cruise with his wife of 36 years, Katy Eymann. “Bill Bradbury may be gone, but he leaves behind a legacy in Oregon that will endure for generations to come,” U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley said in a statement. Bradbury served 15 years in the Oregon Legislature, retiring from the statehouse in 1995. Gov. John Kitzhaber appointed Bradbury that year to be Oregon’s 23rd secretary of state. Bradbury served for a decade, focusing on improving Oregon’s voting system and establishing more transparent campaign practices. Bradbury established Oregon’s vote-by-mail system, which has significantly increased voter participation since 2000. He also helped establish Oregon’s online political campaign contributions system, ORESTAR, which gives the public access to campaign finance information. “In battling MS with his trademark relentless optimism, Bill showed all of us how to bring good cheer and inner toughness to life’s many challenges,” U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden wrote on Twitter. “He will be hugely missed.”</p>

The measure (<a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?PublicationType=Committees&amp;CommitteeId=3211&amp;Session=2023&amp;DocumentType=Proposed%20Committee%20Bills%20(PCBs)&amp;FileName=PCB%20SAC%2023-01.pdf">PCB SAC 23-01</a>) would ban noncitizens and those convicted of violating the election code from handling voter registration applications and impose a $50,000 fine on third-party voter registration organizations for each infraction. It also reduces the time for those groups to turn in voter applications from 14 days to 10 days before facing daily fines of $50, up to $2,500. Other provisions of the bill would require voters to request a mail ballot at least 12 days before an election and would ban local Supervisors of Elections from mailing out a ballot within 10 days before an election. The bill also reduces the reporting requirements for political committees from monthly to quarterly. The reporting requirements used to be quarterly until 2013, when lawmakers eliminated donation caps while moving to monthly reports, arguing the increased frequency would provide more transparency for voters.</p>

Legislators will have a tall task to overturn Kelly&#8217;s veto, as the bill fell well short of the two-thirds supermajority needed to override in both the Kansas House and Senate. Currently, mail ballots are counted if they are received by local election officials by 5 p.m. on the Friday following the election, provided it is postmarked by Election Day. Senate Bill 209 would end the so-called &#8220;three-day grace period&#8221; and require ballots be returned by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Legislators in both chambers had previously passed bills to end the three-day grace period over the objections of lawmakers from rural areas hit hard by mail delays in recent years. This has led to worries that eliminating the grace period will mean that legitimately cast ballots won&#8217;t be counted, despite the best efforts of the voter. In her veto message, Kelly said the bill would &#8220;disenfranchise members of our armed services,&#8221; though the timeline for military voters differs slightly than for the general population. She also worried it would harm rural Kansans.</p>

Republicans unsuccessfully tried to amend a portion of the bill that requires more reporting of political ads to the state campaign finance board. Republicans unsuccessfully tried to cut a provision banning political spending in elections by “foreign-influenced” corporations, which is when a foreign group owns at least 1% of a corporation. The bill also includes a provision that would make it a gross misdemeanor — punishable by up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine — to knowingly spread materially false information with the intent to impede or prevent people from voting.</p>

Rep. Peggy McGaugh, R-Carrollton, said county clerks had sought a 100-foot buffer and that a compromise for a 50-foot line had been reached. Current state law prohibits exit polling, surveying, sampling, electioneering and other activities within 25 feet of the polling place’s outer door closest to the polls. McGaugh said the concern was mainly with overzealous canvassers gathering signatures for petitions. Her legislation added “circulating initiative or referendum petitions” to the list of prohibited behaviors close to polling places. Lawmakers voted 106-24, with 25 voting present, against the wider buffer.</p>
<p>The House gave initial approval to a bill that would<a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/presidential-primary-would-return-under-bill-approved-by-the-missouri-house/"> reinstate the presidential preference primary</a> in Missouri. The bill was amended to establish that the primary will take place on “the first Tuesday after the first Monday in April.” As introduced, the bill would have ordered the primary to be held on “the second Tuesday after the first Monday in March.”</p>

The sponsor, State Sen. Greg Hertz (R-Polson), is proposing an amendment to remove the sunset date and have the 2025 legislature look into expanding the top two primary toward future congressional and statewide races, beginning with U.S. Congressional races in 2026 and all statewide races in 2028. Supporters say the bill ensures a winning candidate gets a majority of general election votes and will allow races to be about issues instead of party. “With six years being the longest term of any of our elected officials, plus with the U.S. Senate being our only statewide vote in Washington, D.C., we believe that a U.S. senator should have to earn at least 50% of Montana voters’ support,” said Danielle Tribble, executive director of the Montana Republican Party. Opponents say the bill is clearly targeted toward one race, and it stifles the chances of third parties winning elections while increasing opportunities for manipulation by political parties.</p>

The committee unanimously passed<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/10415/Overview"> Senate Bill 406</a>, introduced by Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, which would make it a felony for any person to threaten election workers. If passed, anyone who attempts to use any force, intimidation, coercion or violence on an election worker with the intent to interfere with the performance of their election-related duties could be sentenced to not less than one year and no more than four years in prison.</p>
<p>The Senate elections panel also heard<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/9871/Overview"> Senate Bill 162</a>, introduced by Sen. Melanie Scheible, D-Las Vegas, which would establish polling places in county and city jails. The legislation aims to ensure that anyone eligible to vote who finds themselves in custody or in a detention center is still able to vote, Scheible said. It would apply to people who have been charged with a felony, have no prior felonies on their records and are presumed innocent until proven guilty, she said. The bill was amended to say every law enforcement agency that administers a jail or detention center must develop and implement a policy on voting in the facility. It must allow every eligible voter to cast a ballot, and includes coordination with local election officials to carry out the provisions of the policy.</p>
<p>The Assembly Legislative Operations and Elections Committee approved<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/10000/Overview"> Assembly Bill 242</a>, which would ban the use of paper ballots at in-person voting centers, instead requiring all voting to be conducted on machines. Also, the bill specifies that all ballots be counted using machines, and not hand-counted. The committee’s Democrats voted unanimously for the bill, but Republicans Jill Dickman, R-Sparks, Rich DeLong, R-Reno, Brian Hibbetts and Richard McArthur, both R-Las Vegas, voted no.</p>
<p>The committee also approved on a party-line vote<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/10336/Overview"> Assembly Bill 394</a>, which requires the secretary of state to create a procedure to certify election results if a city or county hasn’t completed its required canvass by a deadline.

Doug Burgum’s veto</a> of a bill that would have outlawed the approval voting method used by Fargo in some city elections. A 28-19 vote in the Republican-led Senate on Wednesday means Burgum’s veto of <a href="https://ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-overview/bo1273.html?bill_year=2023&amp;bill_number=1273">House Bill 1273</a> stands, and the proposal will not go into effect. The legislation sponsored by Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, would have banned ranked-choice and approval voting in North Dakota. Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds majority vote in each chamber &#8212; 32 votes in the Senate and 63 in the House of Representatives, which cleared that bar earlier this month. Burgum said earlier this month the approval voting ban represents an “egregious example of state overreach” that “blatantly infringes on local control.&#8221; The Republican governor noted the legislation would invite lawsuits against the state. Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, told colleagues Wednesday that overriding Burgum’s veto would improperly strip Fargo of its popular voting method. “At best, (House Bill) 1273 is a legislative solution in search of a local government problem where none exists. At worst, it’s an unnecessary incursion, intrusion and disruption to the balance of local control and the democratic process,” Lee said.</p>

Secretary of State Shemia Fagan is pushing for the bill,<a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB2107"> HB 2107</a>, as part of her 2023 Protect Our Democracy Agenda which she announced in January.  Under the bill, those who are enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan who are eligible but unregistered to vote will automatically be registered.  According to the Secretary of State’s office, about 200,000 (6%) of Oregonians are eligible but unregistered to vote. Of the 200,000, Fagan says 171,000 are enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan. In an interview with KOIN.com, Secretary Fagan explained that the Oregon Health Authority’s role under this bill would be data sharing — providing the secretary’s office with Oregon Health Plan enrollee information including name, age, residence and electronic signature (if available), for unregistered but eligible voters. The bill states the authority cannot give the secretary’s office any electronic records indicating that a person is not a U.S. citizen. The secretary’s office would be tasked with creating the schedule for OHA to send the data. “It would essentially be data sharing, exactly like the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles,” Secretary Fagan said. “Essentially, they have information, when we know based on certain categories, that someone is eligible to vote – again, age, citizenship status and residency. Then they would transfer on a certain regular schedule.”</p>

The concerns, which were discussed during the first scheduled read-through for implementing ranked-choice voting, included a proposed limit on the number of candidates voters can rank for each race and the need for voter education for the methods and calculations behind the voting system. Commissioner Mingus Mapps, who was a vocal opponent of Portland’s agreed-upon version of charter reform in November, scolded employees with the city and county’s election offices during a series of questions regarding the ranked-choice system’s methodology. “Being real,” Mapps said. “Do we have anyone on staff at the city who actually understands the math of what’s happening with election thresholds, surplus fractions, transfer values, and how to translate that into what I think of as a spreadsheet that can capture the various rounds of what we’re trying to do here?”</p>

The measure, when it was proposed, went unnoticed and passed on a voice vote without debate. After Votebeat reported on the unprecedented problem with the law and election officials’ deep concerns, state Sen. Bryan Hughes and other lawmakers filed legislation to ease the conundrum the measure had forced on counties, which would be prohibited from using their current vote-counting equipment and required to purchase new equipment each election. Hughes said during a committee hearing that there had been a “misunderstanding on the scope” of the provision.  Hughes’ new proposal,<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB1661"> Senate Bill 1661</a>, would amend the language of that law to allow counties to continue to use the voting equipment they have without any additional costs to counties or taxpayers.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Hall (R-Rockwall) introduced Senate Bill 990, which would<a href="https://www.kltv.com/2023/04/18/east-texas-legislator-puts-pause-bill-outlawing-countywide-polling-places/"> outlaw countywide polling places on Election Day</a>, limiting voters to their residential precincts. As Hall stated during discussion, the voter would have “one place that you go, one machine which your vote will be put in.” The intent, Hall said, is to avoid prioritizing convenience over security. The bill previously passed the State Affairs Committee in March and was set to be discussed and voted upon this week. Hall presented his bill to the Texas Senate as planned. However, after presentation, Hall made a motion for suspension of the rules, the passing of which would allow a bill to go directly to a vote after having been laid out. The motion did not pass, and instead the Senate began to debate the bill. Hall ultimately withdrew his motion to suspend the rules, which ended the debate for the day. Hall explained he wanted to work on an amendment.</p>
<p>The Senate approved<a href="https://www.news-journal.com/news/bill-that-could-strip-inactive-texas-voters-registration-advances/article_c6839806-de0d-11ed-b4fe-a7f4ec833ea6.html"> a “use it or lose it” voter bill</a> that could purge voters from registration rolls who skip two federal elections. The legislation mirrors a controversial Ohio law that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. That law, and bills like it, have been criticized for having a disproportionate effect on low-income communities and people of color. Under the Texas bill, any voter who skips two federal elections in a row, as well as any local or state elections between them, must confirm they still live at the same address. County election officials would send address confirmation notices shortly after a federal election to any voter who did not cast a ballot in the previous 25 months. If a voter does not respond, they would be placed on a “suspense list.” The proposal passed 19-12 along party lines. It now heads to the House for consideration.</p>

Rissi pleaded guilty to two counts of making a threatening interstate communication. He&#8217;s scheduled to be sentenced in June. Prosecutors said Rissi&#8217;s message for Hickman was left Sept. 27, 2021, three days after a technology firm called Cyber Ninjas released a report alleging a wide range of election improprieties in Maricopa County, which includes the Phoenix area. Experts said the report, which was commissioned by Republican leaders of the state Senate, was riddled with errors, bias and flawed methodology.  More than two months later, as Brnovich was under pressure from election deniers to charge people with election fraud, prosecutors say Rissi left another message telling him to “do your job” and threatening violence.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Judge Thomas Fink<a href="https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/cochise-county/judge-rejects-effort-to-remove-cochise-co-elections-director"> refused to temporarily block</a> Cochise County from putting all of its elections responsibilities under the County recorder’s office. It’s the latest round in a battle with the state over elections, which started with a dispute over ballot counting last year. It eventually led to the elections director quitting earlier this year. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes had argued that it was up to the Legislature to decide how elections are run in each county. In a statement Mayes said: “My office filed a lawsuit against Cochise County, the members of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors, and the County Recorder for their unlawful agreement to delegate nearly all of the Board’s election duties to the Recorder. The Agreement is essentially an unqualified handover from the Board to the Recorder, not one that would allow both entities to work hand in hand to fulfill their statutory duties openly and transparently.”</p>

The two voters say they are hoping to have a federal judge issue some type of ruling that will prevent something like this paper shortage from happening again. “Well the genesis comes out of the 2022 General Election which was a complete disaster by the administration,” said Attorney Wally Zimolong, representing the voters. “Two of the voters are the plaintiffs in this case. They were told to come back one, two, three times. Eventually, they could not come back any further,” added Zimolong. It is aimed at the county in general, the election board, and the election bureau. “The First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution say everyone has a right to vote and not to be unduly encumbered to exercise that vote,” Zimolong continued. The lawsuit highlights how a Luzerne County Judge issued an order that day to extend voting hours to 10:00 p.m. Some 40 polling places did not have enough paper and that forced many voters, the total of which is still unknown, to be asked to return to vote. “It’s not symbolic at all. We are asking a judge for a mandatory injunction which would compel the county going forward to make sure they do not deny the right to vote to any person to make sure they comply with the Pennsylvania Election Code and the administration to make sure that there is election officials are adequately trained,” Zimolong said.</p>
<p>The five-judge Commonwealth Court panel this week<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/court-tosses-tom-wolf-suit-against-voter-id-abortion-amendments/3547119/"> dismissed a challenge</a> to how lawmakers have bundled together five potential state constitutional amendments on grounds the legal dispute was not ripe for the judges&#8217; review. The panel said judges were not passing judgment on the proposed amendments themselves, which Republican leaders pushed through both chambers of the Legislature in the session that ended in November. Another round of General Assembly approval is still needed, and Judge Lori Dumas wrote that the court did not want to entangle itself in an abstract disagreement with no apparent concrete consequences. “If every alleged misstep in the constitutional amendment process resulted in a lawsuit, then the potential exists for protracted, piecemeal litigation, which could potentially conflict with election-related deadlines,” she said in an 11-page order. The judges dismissed the legal challenge that had been filed against the General Assembly by Democratic then-Gov. Tom Wolf and the woman who served as his acting secretary of state, Leigh Chapman. Wolf, who was succeeded in office in January by fellow Democrat Josh Shapiro, had argued the bundling ran afoul of state constitutional rules that prevent combining changes with multiple, unrelated topics.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said Fulton County had<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/fulton-county-dominion-voting-machines-sanctions-pa-supreme0court-20230419.html"> blatantly defied the court</a> when it allowed a third-party company to access its 2020 voting machines. The county had first given a firm access to its Dominion voting machines in the weeks after the 2020 election, prompting the Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections, to decertify the machines and ask the court to block the county from giving any further access. The court agreed, ordering the machines be kept secure. Fulton County gave another company access to its voting machines anyway, leading the justices to impose sanctions on the county and its attorneys in the form of repaid legal fees for both the state and Dominion. “No remedy can undo the harm that the county’s contempt caused,” Justice David Wecht said in his majority opinion, but “simply are the next best thing.” “There can be no orderly and effective administration of justice if parties to litigation do not comply with court orders. Our close review makes clear that Fulton County willfully violated an order of this Court,” Wecht wrote. “As well, we find that Fulton County and its various attorneys have engaged in a sustained, deliberate pattern of dilatory, obdurate, and vexatious conduct and have acted in bad faith throughout these sanction proceedings.”</p>

The Texas Election Code, in keeping with the Civil Rights Act of 1960, bars officials from releasing anonymized completed ballots for 22 months after an election. There has been a longstanding consensus that those election records are confidential during that period, according to Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee. &#8220;And then, out of thin air, our current attorney general decided that those records were no longer confidential and had to be produced to the public for inspection immediately following the election,&#8221; Menefee said. &#8220;Again, this was a complete 180 from not only the law, but also previous opinions issued by previous attorneys general.&#8221; The county is asking a Travis County court to rule Paxton&#8217;s office wrongly concluded the county could not withhold those records, but others side with the attorney general&#8217;s interpretation. Williamson County also is suing the attorney general on the election ballots issue.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel heard arguments for and against the acquittal Crystal Mason on felony<a href="https://www.keranews.org/government/2023-04-18/5-years-after-voter-fraud-conviction-crystal-mason-pleads-her-case-in-tarrant-county-court"> voter fraud charges</a> this week. A Tarrant County resident, Mason was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. She was on supervised release for a federal conviction and thus ineligible to vote, and while her ballot was never counted, Tarrant County prosecutors charged her with illegal voting. Mason has maintained that she did not know she was ineligible. This is Mason’s second time to appeal her conviction in front of the Second Court of Appeals in Fort Worth. Previously, the court upheld her conviction, but was forced to reconsider its ruling by the state’s highest appeals court. Attorneys representing Mason and attorneys from the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office each had three minutes to make oral arguments in front of judges J. Wade Birdwell, Elizabeth Kerr and Dabney Bassel. Recording devices were not allowed, and court staff ordered all electronic devices be shut off before entering the courtroom. The panel of judges grilled both the defense and prosecution on the intricacies of their arguments, and ended the hearing once rebuttals concluded. The key question before the Second Court of Appeals is whether Mason voted while actively knowing she was not eligible to vote. An amendment to the voter fraud statute Mason was prosecuted under, passed in 2021, specifies a person can’t be convicted of voting illegally solely based on the fact that they signed a provisional ballot affidavit. Instead, prosecutors must show other evidence to corroborate that the person knew they were voting illegally.</p>

From cable news to social media, we’re very aware that what we’re hearing or reading could be wrong. And it seems our skepticism of the right’s version of current events should extend to our history as well. A new book,<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/20454/9781541601390"> Myth America: Historians Take On the Biggest Legends and Lies About Our Past</a>, dispels many of the myths being pushed about our country’s past. In a collection of 20 essays from top historians, edited by Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer, this important text shows how those on the right have used revisionist history to fan the flames of politicization and unravel the seams of democracy.  Join us for a live virtual conversation on Thursday, April 20, at 6 p.m. ET with historians featured in the book, Yale University law and political science professor Akhil Reed Amar, Emory University African American Studies professor Carol Anderson, and Northwestern University associate professor Kathleen Belew, as well as editors and Princeton professors Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> April 20 at 6 pm Eastern.</p>
