<em>2022 EAVS highlights what’s changed and what’s not since the pandemic</em></p>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) recently released the<a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDowluKjkw4g-2FT1YiJ7iSvCTQCj62ArXIcX1gxDCltzpDzHMQQIeU70AqBRn5WbnZpqE0PmaPs3vOfuLPr0RRVp4c-3DVefE_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJps6dz8gyNCknCP4U7fahvp8-2F0UGTzGdlRL9uObHNydpC6vPO1l-2FMzNL5R5By5Lig4NptkW6irUvFK-2BoE5do1lXHE2I6gcrqnGuSxryNSQ2AFiJa93wB3tHvq3whetlAgNaUxEisbqE2A-2F8XjZKoqZ70OO47QdG7tlX8Tzkx5X9SXFiJOyPKn9FMuNGg3kIYOQlAA-2FzzXvEYM050z8OCyA8uI1lSOtX9-2BjWAPXrfLdPys7WboYjxUWBaNvvbUTAiZQrFin2UqfhqtuJgbME8dBjA-3D-3D"> 2022 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) report</a>, the nation’s most comprehensive source of election administration data collected from 50 states, U.S. territories, and the <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="211" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" />District of Columbia. The 2022 EAVS highlights how election dynamics have and have not changed since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDow2BvR2CXg7N9-2B-2FWHWfllWSdO1ilcqelbo7MrawDSBtumXpC2ZLvRYES0LEVbNjp8Mexm-2BfjA1NTz-2BVN5ZLx6HJlkKtusHpzpRTXhb19iP6SE-Jn_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJps6dz8gyNCknCP4U7fahvp8-2F0UGTzGdlRL9uObHNydpC6vPO1l-2FMzNL5R5By5Lig4NptkW6irUvFK-2BoE5do1lXHE2I6gcrqnGuSxryNSQ2AE8ayZLRtd1GiCl-2BNRcFwPIGU06DWEk0AoX9cZK4bpmWfnRvSOOfQ2AzT7hzKShAIHdyqcBDw9-2B9IHhU2nEfBiOA4LaosPhyMYvW17LgHFOg8foXz4kbPDlomYa1C9-2FRaz9JHAwegMuxoUrp-2FtSC-2FY64kAoQQSus-2FdCNcwpf32o6g-3D-3D">The report</a> covers topics such as voter registration, military and overseas voting, mail voting, early and Election Day polling place operations, voter participation, and election technology. These data are vital in helping election officials, policymakers, and other election stakeholders identify trends, anticipate and respond to changing voter needs, invest resources to improve election administration and the voter experience, and better secure U.S. elections infrastructure.</p>
<p>“With the participation of every state and local election office in the nation, the EAVS data provide us with an invaluable understanding of the election process and the management challenges faced by election officials today,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks in a joint statement. “To keep the survey as relevant as possible in this ever-evolving environment, new questions were added, such as on how election officials perform post-election auditing and recounts. These findings show the multiple ways election offices verify the process that should give voters confidence in the accuracy of our election results and faith in the work of election administrators.”</p>
<p>Key findings from the 2022 EAVS include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Motor vehicle offices accounted for 55% of the total registrations received for the 2022 general election—the highest share of voter registrations by any method in EAVS history. Online registrations accounted for 14%; registrations by mail, fax, and email combined accounted for 9.1%; and in-person registrations accounted for 5.9% of the total registration applications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Voter turnout during the 2022 midterm elections decreased by approximately 5% compared to the last midterm election, with only nine states showing turnout increases between these two elections. Of the citizen voting age population in the United States, 46.8% voted in the 2022 general election, comprising more than 112 million counted ballots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In-person voting on Election Day was the most common method for voters to cast their ballots, with 49% of voters using this method. While in-person voting rebounded during the 2022 midterms compared to the 2020 presidential election, when 30.5% of voters use this method, it was still lower than before the pandemic. During the 2018 midterms, 58.2% of voters used this mode.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The increase in voting by mail that started during the pandemic continued into the 2022 midterms with nearly one-third of voters voting this way in 2022 compared to one-quarter in the 2018 midterm elections. However, when compared to the 2020 presidential election, this voting method decreased from 43%. Many states expanded opportunities to vote by mail in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In-person early voting decreased in 2022 compared to 2020, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Although the use of in-person early voting increased in the 2020 general election to 30.5%, it decreased to 22.2% in the 2022 general election, similar to the level of in-person early voting seen for the 2018 general election.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Election officials reported having an easier time recruiting poll workers during the 2022 midterms compared to the 2018 midterms&#8211; 22.7% described this recruitment as being “somewhat easy” or “very easy” in 2022 as opposed to 15.3% in 2018.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Data from a new question in the 2022 EAVS found more than 80,000 individuals served as first-time poll workers during the 2022 general election, comprising 16.7% of the poll worker population for this election.</li>
<li aria-level="2">645,219 poll workers assisted with early and Election Day in-person voting for the 2022 general election.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Based on a new question in the 2022 Policy Survey on auditing, nearly all states (94.6%) reported examining whether voting machines are tabulating votes correctly before vote tabulation begins, also known as logic and accuracy testing.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Most states (76.4%) also reported conducting some form of post-election tabulation audits, which is when a sample of ballots are selected and re-tabulated and the results are compared to the originally reported vote totals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The EAVS 2022 Policy Survey expanded the series of questions asking states to report their auditing activities, this time focusing on specific types of audits both before and after an election. The EAC also added new and revised questions to the EAVS Policy Survey on areas such as drop boxes, curing mail ballots, accessible absentee voting, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) ballot transmission and return methods.</p>
<p>For over 20 years, the EAC has conducted the EAVS following each federal general election. Prior to 2014, this data was reported in three different reports – the <a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDowluKjkw4g-2FT1YiJ7iSvCTSVZ5OswAiUgTKsFH3Xk6ZGFRkectJKje4BdVRG7yjYAA-3D-3DXdG9_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJps6dz8gyNCknCP4U7fahvp8-2F0UGTzGdlRL9uObHNydpC6vPO1l-2FMzNL5R5By5Lig4NptkW6irUvFK-2BoE5do1lXHE2I6gcrqnGuSxryNSQ2AGDlD5AfId8rZaHBKp2RYdZzlwHs2smLnfyfbqYhQ7yonoobOZbO5wpAHZWfWPvpa-2BMAL8V5uRqQ6sonn46KSZ9S7QjB2pe85GfL2ngyA156JtqH2gKoDxTKeA4irhROiwhSe2v86HoNpAUBQUXN-2BbXp8dSudyJsT7yvvUJq4SlWQ-3D-3D">National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) report</a>, the <a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDowluKjkw4g-2FT1YiJ7iSvCTQx9eGGad7oHQk4ZsGqgDcsE6b6B26gm8yC0RRDTL91Xg-3D-3DoKHL_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJps6dz8gyNCknCP4U7fahvp8-2F0UGTzGdlRL9uObHNydpC6vPO1l-2FMzNL5R5By5Lig4NptkW6irUvFK-2BoE5do1lXHE2I6gcrqnGuSxryNSQ2AGSM2SHBDjLlqWtP3yEyJalBWDw2g5vRb-2BVH6aK3U9AVO784Q0bShiZm52hWUgaOE-2BtHHxv1q4q-2FzXB5OklFmErilfLNyQXPmL3rnb8iM-2BNiokaEPC4JR-2BBvt22P1GQR5LsuZFe0XlcCMhusGXBxrC9T5KrZuAo8lOzMI1aNBSPHQ-3D-3D">Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) report</a>, and the Election Day Survey/EAVS.

							<h2>New Report from Alliance for Securing Democracy</h2>
														<p><strong>Countering the Weaponization of Election Administration Mistakes</strong><br />
<em>Report seeks to help officials learn from past mistakes</em></p>
<p>Since 2020, states have introduced hundreds of laws based on false claims of widespread election fraud. Election officials—who <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />played an integral role in carrying out a safe and secure election that year—have been quitting in large numbers due to continued threats and harassment stemming from these same election lies. This combination creates a potentially fraught scenario for 2024: A new cohort of election officials will serve in their first election, likely resulting in more mistakes, any of which can be weaponized to feed into false claims of stolen elections.</p>
<p><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/weaponization-election-mistakes/">In a new report,</a> David Levine, senior elections integrity fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) at GMF and a former election official, and Krystyna Sikora, a program assistant at ASD at GMF, explain how election officials can learn from past mistakes to prevent any future mistakes from being weaponized in 2024.</p>
<p>The authors examine errors made in three pivotal counties in 2020 and 2022 and how those mistakes were subsequently weaponized in baseless lawsuits, social media disinformation, election interference legislation, and, in one case, the January 6th Capitol riot.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In Antrim County, Michigan, election officials misreported results due to a technical error. Even though this mistake was quickly caught, it served as the basis for a swirl of conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines, which were used to incite the January 6th riot.</li>
<li aria-level="1">In Harris County, Texas ballot shortages, long lines, and paper jams led to a series of lawsuits that aimed to overturn the election, even though multiple investigations found that the Election Day issues did not alter the outcome of the vote.</li>
<li aria-level="1">In Maricopa County, Arizona, vote counting machines initially couldn’t count some ballots because the toner was not dark enough. This created a backdrop for widespread disinformation, a lawsuit, and a misguided legislative proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a voting system as complicated as the United States’, mistakes are bound to happen, but they are not a sign of malfeasance. If and when mistakes occur, election officials must be ready to respond immediately to prevent further erosion of trust in US elections. The authors offer recommendations for state and local officials to prevent similar mistakes from happening and to respond if they do, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Increasing nonpartisan election observation</li>
<li aria-level="1">Extending vote counting timelines</li>

Conley will spearhead CISA’s partnership engagement and coordination efforts with election officials across the nation as they continue to serve as the frontline defenders of election infrastructure. “Our work to support election officials across the nation remains one of CISA’s highest priorities. Cait is a dedicated public servant and combat-tested U.S. Army veteran with extensive operational and leadership experience working top national security priorities, including cybersecurity and counterterrorism. This experience, combined with her work leading the bipartisan Defending Digital Democracy Project, make her ideally suited to help those state and local officials carrying out elections in every community in America. I’m thrilled to have her take on this responsibility,” said Easterly. “I want to thank Kim Wyman, who will be departing CISA at the end of July for an opportunity in a private sector. Kim has been an invaluable Senior Election Security Lead over the past year and a half, strengthening our partnerships across the election community and maturing our operations. I’m pleased that she will remain as an informal advisor and friend to Team CISA, as well as a critical partner in the broader election security community.” “It has been an honor to lead CISA’s election security efforts and to work side-by-side with so many talented and dedicated colleagues,” said Wyman. “I thank Director Easterly for the opportunity to support election officials in this role and to be part of this important mission. I am proud of the team and what we’ve already been able to accomplish. I have worked with Cait for the past several years in this election security space and know that CISA is in good hands with Cait joining the effort going forward.” Conley previously served as the executive director of the bipartisan Defending Digital Democracy Project, based out of Harvard University’s Belfer Center, where she led the development and implementation of strategies, tools and recommendations for election administrators, election infrastructure providers, campaign organizations, and leaders involved in democratic processes to better defend against cybersecurity threats. She is also an experienced combat veteran with demonstrated leadership in global special operations, cyber operations, and counterterrorism.  “I’m thrilled to take on this responsibility and can’t wait to hit the ground running,” said Conley. “We have an amazing elections team here at CISA which has been working year-round to support state and local election officials in ensuring the security and resilience of elections. I am excited to return to the election security mission and build on the incredible progress CISA has made over the last several years.”</p>

Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana said that parts of the government<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/federal-judge-biden-social-media.html"> could not talk to social media companies</a> for “the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.” Doughty’s decision to restrict the government’s communication with social media plants has some concerned about the impact this could have on election disinformation campaigns. Alice E. Marwick, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was one of several disinformation experts who told the New York Times that the ruling could impede work meant to keep false claims about vaccines and voter fraud from spreading. The judge’s decision blocked certain government agencies from communicating with some research organizations, such as the Stanford Internet Observatory and the Election Integrity Partnership, about removing social media content. Bond Benton, an associate communication professor at Montclair State University who studies disinformation, described the ruling as “a bit of a potential Trojan horse.” It is limited on paper to the government’s relationship with social media platforms, he said, but carried a message that misinformation qualifies as speech and its removal as the suppression of speech. “Previously, platforms could simply say we don’t want to host it: ‘No shirt, no shoes, no service,’” Benton told the Times. “This ruling will now probably make platforms a little bit more cautious about that.”</p>

Every 10 years, after the federal government publishes updated census information, California must redraw the boundaries of its Congressional, State Senate, State Assembly, and State Board of Equalization districts so that the state’s population is evenly allocated among the new districts. The 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission was created via citizen initiative in 2008. The 2020 Commission embraced  the idea of seeking to leave behind a body of feedback and recommendations to assist its successors, as well as external stakeholders, in understanding the many challenges the CRC experienced, how it addressed them, and how future CRCs might save valuable time by avoiding as many of these challenges as possible and by learning from its hindsight to better address those challenges that prove unavoidable, The Lessons-Learned Subcommittee was one of the early creations of the Commission, and it has compiled lessons since its establishment in the fall of 2020. The subcommittee organized a preliminary lessons-learned discussion before the Commission received Census data so that memories of the Commission’s early weeks and months would be as clear as possible; after the completion of the new maps, there was an extended discussion in March 2022 that yielded nearly 1,400 inputs that the subcommittee then synthesized in preparing its draft report. “We are pleased to announce the launch of this important report and hope that it will prove useful to our successors as well as to the many external stakeholders who have a role in preparing for the 2030 redistricting cycle,” said Ray Kennedy, the Commission’s current rotating chair and one of the members of the Lessons Learned Subcommittee.</p>

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) has introduced a bill to require the federal government to<a href="https://www.kimt.com/news/minnesota/minnesota-u-s-senator-introduces-military-families-voting-bill/article_ff6f1c1e-8a0e-5c7e-832d-3401f97b140e.html"> assess how military families can access voter registration information</a>. The bipartisan Supporting Military Voters Act would require the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to examine and identify what improvements are necessary for servicemembers and their families to have this information, according to a news release from Klobuchar’s office. There would also be a study of the Department of Defense’s compliance with existing federal laws to provide servicemembers timely access to absentee ballots. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Nebraska, is partnering with Klobuchar on the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2328"> bill</a>. U.S. Reps. Laurel Lee, R-Florida, and Joe Neguse, D-Colorado, are leading the bill in the House. “The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy, but access to absentee ballots and registering to vote are obstacles for too many of our brave servicemembers and their families,” said Klobuchar. “Our bipartisan legislation would help us examine and better understand the barriers so that we can make sure members of our military &#8211; who have sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms and defend our nation &#8211; are able to access the ballot box and make their voices heard.”</p>

John Bel Edwards (D) rejected a measure that would have required election officials conduct a supplemental statewide voter canvass. It’s the third time the governor has vetoed a version of the bill that he has deemed redundant because parish registrars already conduct an annual review of their polls. In his veto message, Edwards said the legislation amounted to an attempt to purge voters from the rolls. “The insistence by the governor that this process is unnecessary is blatantly partisan and ignores not only the recommendation of the nonpartisan Louisiana Legislative Auditor and election experts, but also the relevant testimony and real-life examples presented in committee,” Ardoin said.<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB646&amp;sbi=y"> House Bill 646</a>, by Rep. Les Farnum, R-Pollock, would allow Ardoin’s office to canvass voters who have not participated in an election for at least 10 years. If they failed to correspond with the Secretary of State’s office, they would also be moved to an inactive voters list where they will have two federal elections to either vote again or confirm their registration before being purged from the voter rolls. The existing annual voter canvass looks for voters who have changed addresses or moved out of state. The parish registrar mails them a new voter identification card to fill out. If they fail to return the card, they can be moved to an inactive voters list. State lawmakers must let legislative leaders know if they oppose a veto override session by July 13. If a majority of members in both chambers wants to convene, the session would begin July 18.</p>

Our poll workers are essential in that regard they are critical, and they are an integral link to ensuring that people in our communities have a full experience that’s positive as it relates to the power of voting,” said Sen. Lea Webb (D-52nd Senate District).  The training includes materials relating to diverse voters, professional delivery, and providing assistance to voters with disabilities and limited English-speaking skills. The training intends to be available both in person and virtually.</p>

The federal lawsuit follows a seven-year investigation into LA County’s voting program, which found that the county — acting through its registrar-recorder — excluded voters with mobility and vision disabilities as far back as 2016. The initial investigation, opened in April 2016, surveyed 88 voting locations through June 7, 2016, finding that 73 sites did not comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. But despite informing the county of its Title II violations in September 2016, the county failed to improve accessibility to disabled voters in subsequent elections. “The county’s vote centers include facilities that the United States identified in its Sept. 13, 2016, letter as noncompliant with Title II, its regulation and the applicable 1991 and 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. The county continues to use such facilities in federal, state and local elections, without providing a temporary or permanent measure to correct the non-compliant features,” the government says in its<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/us-v-los-angeles-voting-complaint.pdf"> lawsuit</a>. According to the complaint, at least one voter that relied on a wheelchair reported to the Department of Justice claiming she had difficulty accessing the county’s voting system at a senior facility in Chatsworth, California, during the August 2019 special election. Los Angeles County Clerk, Registrar-Recorder Dean Logan aid the county became aware of the possibility of the lawsuit in May and had been activity working in good faith to reach an agreement with the government for “enhanced assessment and mitigation of physical barriers at vote centers alleged to violated the Americans with Disability Act.” “I am disheartened by this action despite our good faith efforts to reach agreement on a reasonable settlement. The assertions made in the media release do not reflect the voting model or service delivery provided by Los Angeles County,” Logan said. “That said, we remain committed to addressing accessibility issues in an equitable and effective manner and will be vigilant in preserving the extensive work the county has done to improve access to voting, broadly, and specifically for voters with disabilities and other specific needs.”</p>

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the measure in late May, before embarking on his formal presidential campaign. Although the law,<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7050"> SB 7050</a>, would not be enforced until September, the organizations still would have faced fines of $50,000 for each infraction they committed starting in July. With the protection of Judge Walker’s order, third-party voter registration organizations have temporary relief from drastically altering their programming, said Frederick Vélez III Burgos, national director in Miami of civic engagement for the Hispanic Federation. “Our need for urgency was given that the law went into effect July 1, and our clients were almost immediately impacted,” said attorney Cesar Ruiz, who represents the civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF, in a phone interview with the Florida Phoenix. “So, there was a significant risk of harm to our organizational clients and also to our individual clients. We were happy the judge issued his decision as quickly as he did, and we’re thrilled with the outcome,” Ruiz said. Another aspect of the law Judge Walker blocked outlawed third-party voter registration organizations from retaining new registrants’ information, which the challengers argued would hamper their ability to provide civic education, fact-check applications, and conduct quality control surveys. Walker also called out the vagueness of language used in the statue spelling out the kind of information organizations couldn’t keep or what handling and collection of applications meant. He said the state could not solve the vagueness problem through enacting regulations. “The state of Florida is correct to seek integrity in our electoral system,” Walker wrote in his 58-page decision. “Sound election laws ensure the people are heard without distortion from negligent and bad-faith actors. Here, however, Florida’s solutions for preserving election integrity are too far removed from the problems it has put forward as justifications.”</p>
<p>The Duval County Supervisor of Elections is facing a lawsuit after some voters complained some city districts have<a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/group-voters-sue-duval-supervisor-elections-voting-precinct-disparity/46W5D2UE4ZGINMZYI6GD3TJ4LE/"> more voting precincts than others</a>. The newly filed lawsuit shows 6 registered Duval County voters are suing Mike Hogan for having an unequal number of voting precincts throughout the county. Which they said violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. “We found that, for whatever reason within each of those districts there is a wide range of voting precincts and some of the districts have up to twice as many voting locations as other districts do,” said Attorney Jeff Childers.</p>

The lawsuit asks a superior court judge to order the Fulton Commission to appoint Frazier to one of the Republican Party’s two seats on the election board, which oversees voter registration, sets voting locations and certifies election results in the heavily Democratic county that includes the city of Atlanta. The lawsuit alleges that the Fulton County Commission is required to approve Frazier because a county ordinance says the commission “shall” appoint two election board members each from the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>

A coalition of groups called Idahoans for Open Primaries is backing the initiative, which would do away with the closed primary elections and replace them with an open primary that all candidates and voters could participate in, regardless of party affiliation. Supporters of the open primary initiative are holding off on launching their signature collections until the court issues a ruling on the ballot titles.  To qualify the initiative for the ballot, supporters have until May 1 to meet the requirements to gather signatures from at least 6% of registered statewide voters (about 63,000 signatures) and gather signatures from at least 6% of voters in 18 of the state’s 35 legislative districts.  If the initiative qualifies, it would appear on Idaho voters ballots during the November 2024 general election. If the initiative qualifies for the ballot, it would take a majority of Idaho voters to approve it.  Under the proposed new system, the top four vote-getters from the primary election would advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.  The initiative would also change the general election to create an instant runoff election and ranked choice voting. Under that system, Idahoans would vote for their first choice of candidate and then have the ability to also rank the three remaining candidates in order of preference on the same ballot. If one candidate wins a majority of the votes, that candidate would be elected the winner. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes would be eliminated and their votes would instead be transferred to voters’ second choice candidate. The process would continue until one candidate has a majority of votes and is elected the winner.  Idahoans would only vote once; there would not be multiple rounds of voting.</p>

Rosenberg has blocked the state from attempting to prevent election officials from offering<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/06/29/state-loses-court-battle-enabling-iowans-to-again-receive-non-english-voting-materials/"> non-English voting materials</a> to the public. Under the ruling, Iowa counties will again be allowed to provide citizens with non-English ballots, voter-registration forms, and absentee ballot applications. The decision dissolves a 15-year-old injunction that blocked the practice. The ruling was handed down in a lawsuit that was filed on behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa (LULAC). The lawsuit challenged the state’s application of the English Language Reaffirmation Act to election materials. The act, which was signed into law by Gov. Tom Vilsack in 2002, requires that all political documents from the state “shall be in the English language” unless the materials are deemed “​​necessary to secure the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.” In 2003, the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office began to make non-English voter registration forms freely available online. Steve King, then a conservative Republican member of Iowa’s congressional delegation, filed a lawsuit, arguing the practice violated the state’s English Language Reaffirmation Act. A district court judge agreed and issued an injunction in 2008 that barred the secretary of state from providing voter registration forms in any language other than English. LULAC sued Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the Voter Registration Commission and four county auditors, asking the court to dissolve the injunction and issue a declaratory order stating that voting materials are exempt from the Iowa English Language Affirmation Act. Rosenberg cited the Voting Rights Act while ruling in LULAC’s favor, dissolving the injunction and stating that voting materials were exempt from the restrictions imposed by Iowa’s English Language Reaffirmation Act. Rejecting the state’s arguments, Rosenberg said it “strains credibility” to assert that providing voting materials in another language would not be required by, or necessary to secure rights guaranteed by, the Constitution. “One would be hard-pressed to find a right that has been more frequently and unwaveringly praised in this nation than the right to vote,” Rosenberg wrote. “One’s ability to participate in the shared experience of democracy is dependent on effective communication, whether it be amongst voters or between the electorate and the state. Iowa itself has a long history of immigrants, including ones that do not speak English proficiently. In fact, the Constitutional Convention of the State of Iowa in 1857 contemplated such an issue given the large German population in the state at the time. The convention agreed to commission the translation of the Iowa Constitution into German and the printing of 3,000 copies for distribution among the state’s German immigrants.”</p>

William pleaded guilty to seven counts of election fraud. In exchange for her guilty plea, prosecutors dropped 10 counts of providing a false statement on an absentee ballot, seven counts of forgery and eight counts of forging a signature on an absentee ballot application. Investigators said Williams submitted applications for absentee ballots to nine city and township clerks on behalf of 26 legally incapacitated people under her care and had the ballots mailed directly to her. She also allegedly submitted separate voter registration applications for each person without their knowledge or consent, according to court records. Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Margaret Van Houten sentenced Williams to one year of probation and ordered her to pay a $3,500 fine.</p>

Previously, felons had to wait until they were off probation or parole and had paid their fines or restitution. About 55,000 Minnesotans who have been convicted of a felony but aren’t imprisoned are eligible to vote in the next election. On behalf of a conservative outfit, Minnesota Voters Alliance, the Upper Midwest Law Center filed a lawsuit challenging the law, which went into effect in June. The<a href="https://www.umlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Petition-for-Quo-Warranto-Felon-Voting-FINAL.pdf"> lawsuit</a> argues the new statute exceeds the Legislature’s authority under the Minnesota Constitution, which says felons lose their right to vote until the right is restored to them. But it doesn’t specify the timing, so the DFL-controlled Legislature stepped in this session, restoring voting rights as soon as a person’s incarceration term is done. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in February that the previous law banning felons from voting was constitutional. The Upper Midwest Law Center said in a press release that the Supreme Court ruled civil rights are restored upon completion of a felon’s sentence, but the new law restores the right to vote to people still on supervised release, i.e., before their sentence is complete and “directly contradicting constitutional law.” James Dickey, senior counsel for the law center, said in a release that felons on supervised release, work release or probation don’t meet the constitution’s requirements. Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, chief author of the House bill, released a statement saying he’s confident the lawsuit won’t prevail, calling it an attempt to suppress the franchise and create confusion and fear among those who have had their voting rights restored.  “Although disappointed, I am not surprised by this lawsuit and I remain weary and highly skeptical of groups that seek to limit access to our democracy, as we all should,” he said.</p>

The court declined to reconsider a 2022 decision by the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said Mississippi had remedied the discriminatory intent of the original provisions in the state constitution by altering the list of disenfranchising crimes. In a dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the authors of the Mississippi Constitution in 1890 made clear that they intended to exclude Black people by removing voting rights for felony convictions in crimes they thought Black people were more likely to commit, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The list of disenfranchising crimes was “adopted for an illicit discriminatory purpose,” Jackson wrote in the dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to Mississippi’s felony disenfranchisement provisions 125 years ago, and “this Court blinks again today,” Jackson wrote. “Constitutional wrongs do not right themselves,” she wrote. “With its failure to take action, the Court has missed yet another opportunity to learn from its mistakes.”</p>

Joe Lombardo (R). Under the law, those who harass, intimidate or use force on election workers performing their duties in Nevada could face a felony, fine and up to four years in prison. The lawsuit — which names Lombardo and Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar as defendants and asks the court to prohibit the state from enforcing the law — argues that the SB406 is not specific enough about who is classified as an election worker and what constitutes “intimidating” behavior toward them. It claims the legislation is “an absolute contradiction” with the intent of existing laws allowing public observation of election operations.</p>

Beckerman has<a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/briefs/federal-judge-tosses-oregon-lawsuit-over-mail-voting-tabulation-machines/"> tossed a lawsuit</a> intended to end mail voting and electronic voting tabulation in Oregon, saying “generalized grievances” about the state’s elections aren’t enough to give a group of unsuccessful Republican candidates and other election deniers standing to sue. In a<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.169576/gov.uscourts.ord.169576.1.0.pdf"> 44-page complaint</a> filed last October and in oral arguments last month, plaintiffs claimed that Oregon voters have been disenfranchised, though they provided no evidence. The bulk of the complaint relied on “2,000 Mules,” a 2022 film from right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, that purported to show that people in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin delivered multiple ballots to drop boxes.  Beckerman dismissed the suit late last month. “Plaintiffs allege that Oregon’s computerized vote tabulation and mail-in voting systems violate their constitutional rights, including violations of the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and their fundamental right to vote,” Beckerman wrote. “Plaintiffs allege that ‘organized criminals’ are manipulating Oregon’s elections, and they base their claims on a documentary about voting irregularities in other states and reports of voting irregularities in Oregon.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5226" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Tennessee:</strong>  Tennessee’s Supreme Court ruled against a man who<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-virginia-tennessee-restoration-lawsuit-d4170799001938f75cc99a7e58079171"> sought to register to vote in the state after receiving clemency for a crime committed decades ago in Virginia</a>.  Ernest Falls was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Virginia in 1986, according to court documents. He moved to Tennessee in 2018. In 2020, then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam granted Falls clemency, restoring his full rights of citizenship. But when Falls tried to register to vote in Tennessee, he was prevented from doing so. That’s because of a Tennessee law that requires people seeking to restore their voting rights to first prove they have paid all outstanding court costs, restitution and child support obligations.  At issue is whether that section of Tennessee law should be read together with another section that prohibits people who have been convicted of certain crimes in other states from voting in Tennessee unless their rights have been restored. During oral arguments before the Tennessee Supreme Court last year, Falls’ attorney William Harbison argued that someone who has full rights of citizenship shouldn’t be subjected to having to get their voting rights restored. In a dissenting opinion on Thursday, Justice Sharon Lee agreed.  “Mr. Falls’ voting rights were fully restored; he should not be denied his constitutional right to vote,” she concluded. But the majority ruled that the two sections of Tennessee law should be read together and that Falls must submit proof that he has none of the outstanding financial obligations that would disqualify him from having his voting rights restored.</p>
<p>Sumner County Chancery Court Judge Louis Oliver, III is putting members of the Sumner County Commission on notice they<a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/06/30/judge-puts-sumner-county-commissioners-on-notice-they-may-be-held-in-contempt/"> could be individually held in contempt</a> in an ongoing legal dispute with the county’s election commission. On June 27, Oliver admonished an attorney during a court hearing over the county commission’s public efforts to embarrass Lori Atchley, the election’s administrator, while she is a litigant in a case against them. On June 29, Oliver ordered that each member of the commission, along with Sumner County Mayor John Isbell, be given a copy of an injunction issued last month that prevents the officials from taking actions against the election commission or its employees while the legal dispute continues. Oliver’s order noted that each individual county commissioner, as well as the commission as a whole, is subject that injunction. The judge’s order on Thursday reminded county officials that they are subject to regular court rules that say: “compliance with such order or injunction may be compelled or its disobedience punished as a contempt by a judge of the court in which the action is pending.”</p>

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, is a First Amendment challenge that alleges the new majority of Lynchburg’s electoral board is “intent on pressing the partisan falsehood — widely known as the ‘Big Lie’ — that the defeat of Donald Trump for President in 2020 must have been procured by fraud, and the ancillary supposition that local election administrators who are not part of the Republican faction are not to be trusted.” “It’s kind of inherent. I had hoped to be reappointed, but I have known for quite some time that there have been accusations of fraud in my office,” Gibbons said. “I just feel like our office has had senseless attacks on our character and our neutrality repeatedly over and over by Republican-authorized representatives.” Defendants in the suit are board secretary Betty Gibbs and board vice chair Steven Troxel, who were placed on the board in 2022 and 2023.  Gibbons’ suit alleges that Gibbs and Troxel’s decision to replace her was motivated by politics — and cites incidents leading up to the 2020 election where Gibbs was allegedly outspoken with suspicion of election administrators, lingering in the office “with intent to intimidate” during the 2020 election cycle.</p>
