Also known as the “Clearies,” the awards program celebrates the hard work of election offices across the country for programs that took place during the 2022 midterms. Awardees include jurisdictions of varying sizes, from states with 6.5 million registered voters to counties with about 80,000 registered voters.</p>
<p>“The spotlight on U.S. elections has never been brighter, and the EAC is pleased to honor the work of these offices to make elections more secure, technologically advanced, and accessible to voters,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks in a joint statement. “Especially as election administrators <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-9762" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LAIVoted-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />prepare for the 2024 presidential election, we encourage them to review the great work of these Clearie Award-winning jurisdictions for ideas they may want to replicate in their communities. This includes best practices to recruit and train poll workers, which we recognize has been challenging for many election offices nationwide.”</p>

The following day during local elections in Hull, Massachusetts, a<a href="https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/2023/05/18/hull-ma-election-disrupted-by-house-fire-court-questions-if-votes-count/70232942007/"> six-alarm fire blocked traffic to Hull High School, the town’s only polling location</a> for an hour and a half. Hull officials made the last-minute decision to extend voting by two hours to accommodate those who wished to vote, and retroactively asked Plymouth County Superior Court to authorize the extension and permit the counting of ballots cast during that time. However, on Wednesday night, the town was told the votes would not be counted and &#8220;the court&#8217;s decision also calls into question the validity of the election due to the unfortunate disruption of the voting,&#8221;<a href="https://www.town.hull.ma.us/town-clerk"> the clerk&#8217;s website reads.</a> &#8220;The town is reviewing the decision and determining the next steps.&#8221; According to<a href="https://www.town.hull.ma.us/sites/g/files/vyhlif3286/f/news/hull_town_clerk_statement_on_may_15_2023_annual_town_election.pdf"> Hull Town Clerk Lori West</a>&#8216;s petition to the court, she and town attorney James Lampke consulted with the elections division at the secretary of state&#8217;s office before they decided to keep the polls open for two hours beyond the scheduled closing time. Efforts to reach a judge for an emergency order afterhours on Monday were unsuccessful, the petition says.  The town told residents about the extension using an emergency phone system some residents were signed up for, as well as robocalls, social media and Hull Community Cable. West said the candidates, most of whom were at the polls throughout the day, were notified of the decision and were “receptive and understanding.” &#8220;Everyone involved in the process stepped up to the plate to do the right thing and make the best of an unusual situation,&#8221; Lampke said. Judge Brian Glenny said there was no way to ensure that the<a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/05/19/hull-officials-receiving-heat-for-extending-voting-hours-due-to-massive-fire-judge-says-election-not-valid/"> town&#8217;s efforts to broadcast the information</a> reached every citizen who intended to vote. He also said police officers managing traffic around the fire did not know immediately that the polling hours were being extended. Those officers told people they were not be able to vote, and there is no way to know if those people found out later they could return to the polls.</p>

She was 79. According to the Sun This Week, elections, which were only a part of her job, were sacred, a source of both pride and stress for the former city clerk, who became a state leader in her field. Olesen managed local, state and federal elections in Burnsville with “undisputed authority,” recalled retired Deputy City Manager Tom Hansen in an online remembrance. It earned her the nickname “Little General” from Greg Konat, a former city manager, Hansen wrote. “By the time they were done, she’d be totally exhausted,” said Craig Ebeling, another retired Burnsville city manager. “She just sweat blood over the elections,” Ebeling said. “She was so committed to making sure that they were correctly done and totally and scrupulously fair. Almost to her detriment, she would just fret over them so much and be so concerned and worked with the judges so extensively. Those election judges became her personal friends, because they served for years and years.” Olesen began her career in Burnsville in 1977, serving as a bookkeeper/receptionist, parcel records specialist and deputy city clerk before working her final 16 years as city clerk. Olesen was president of the Municipal Clerks and Finance Officers Association of Minnesota in 1999 and 2000.</p>

He was 63. His 31-year tenure as city clerk spanned six mayors and three acting mayors, nine mayoral elections, and several runoffs – few without drama. Byrne was named city clerk in 1989, at age 29, after working as an aide to Mayor Anthony.  He replaced Helen Kozma, who was retiring. He had begun working in the city clerk’s office in 1982 and had moved over to Cucci’s staff after his election in 1985. “For anyone that dealt with Jersey City over the last 30 years, they would have encountered Robert Byrne and every single one of them would have left with a positive and memorable experience,” Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said.  For me, I have countless examples as he embraced me when I was an outside councilman first elected and taught me about government, he swore me in at midnight when I was first elected mayor of Jersey City, he was a self-designated counsel in my personal life as he lectured me countless times about the importance of family over politics, and he officiated my wedding at City Hall with Jaclyn.”</p>

This legislation is led in the House of Representatives by U.S. Representative Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration. The <a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-help-recruit-and-retain-election-workers/">Support our Election Workers Act </a>requires the Election Assistance Commission to distribute grants to states to provide increased pay for election workers, including people serving as poll workers and election officials. The legislation also requires states seeking grants to describe their plans to use such funds to retain qualified election workers and to recruit new election workers. The legislation is endorsed by the Campaign Legal Center, Common Cause, Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Transparency International U.S., American Federation of Teachers, Pax Christi USA, and Sojourners. “Our election workers are on the frontlines of our democracy, ensuring Americans can access the ballot box. But over the past few years, election officials and poll workers have faced a barrage of threats and intimidation and we’re now facing a serious worker shortage,” said Senator Klobuchar. “Our legislation would take steps to strengthen our support for election workers to make sure we’re able to recruit and retain these essential public servants for future elections.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> Lawmakers advanced a bill that would<a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-legislature-voting-absentee-ballot-14b8c4ec22da581ec4629e0848ecb3e3"> make it a crime to help a non-family member request, fill out or return an absentee ballot</a>. The Senate Governmental Affairs committee voted 5-2 — in a vote that fell along party lines — to advance the House-passed bill to the full Alabama Senate. The Republican sponsor of the bill said the change is needed to combat voter fraud, but opponents called it an attempt to make it harder for people to vote. The bill by Republican Rep. Jamie Kiel of Russellville would make it a misdemeanor in most cases for a person to order, request, collect, prefill or return an absentee ballot other than their own. It would become a felony to pay someone, or receive payment, for absentee ballot assistance.  “The purpose of the bill is very simple. It’s to make sure the balloting process, the election process in Alabama, is as secure as possible,” Kiel said. He argued absentee voting is less secure than in-person voting. “Most of the cases where there is voter fraud across the country are in early voting.”  The bill allows an exemption for family members to help other family members up to the “second degree of kinship” including parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles — provided they are not paid to do so. The bill also says there is an affirmative defense if the voter being helped is blind, disabled or unable to read or write, also provided there is no payment involved.</p>

The city has used mail-in ballots in local elections for the last three years. The recent code change makes by-mail voting the default “unless otherwise directed by the Assembly.” Five residents spoke against the idea at the meeting. Most were concerned about election fraud. In October 2022, nearly 33% of registered voters participated in the municipal election. Nearly 31% did in 2021, while 43% did in 2020. Voter turnout was 31% in 2019. Assembly member Christine Woll said it’s true the original intent was to increase voter participation. When analyzing the numbers, she said, it’s important to remember that voters are generally more likely to participate in highly contested Assembly races.  “Someone just brought up that this last year, it actually decreased from the year before,” Woll said. “You’ll also remember that the Assembly races were completely uncontested last year.” The ordinance passed in a 5-2 vote.</p>

In her veto message Hobbs said  HB 2305 “creates unnecessary burdens for election administrators.’’ She also said there are “meaningful privacy concerns for Arizona voters.’’ The measure was amended before it reached Hobbs to prohibit the observers that McGarr’s bill would have allowed from noting, transcribing or disclosing the personal information they see, ranging from dates and places of birth to phone numbers, driver’s license numbers and a mother’s maiden name. But gubernatorial press aide Christian Slater, in explaining the veto, said that wasn’t enough to satisfy Hobbs. “We believe the bill still contains privacy concerns, even after the amendment,’’ he said.</p>
<p>Hobbs also<a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/hobbs-vetoes-more-changes-to-handling-of-arizona-elections/article_a3aab6dc-f7ff-11ed-8fe3-7b2c7945bee8.html"> vetoed</a> a measure to force her successors as secretary of state to not perform any duties in that role in a race in which their name is on the ballot. HB 2308 was sponsored by Rep. Rachel Jones, R-Tucson. It sought to bar the secretary of state from personally performing any aspect of operations in an election in which that person is a candidate for office. In her veto message, the governor said the position is elected and that the duties make the secretary of state Arizona’s chief election officer. “There is no reasonable basis to believe that Arizonans should not trust the secretary of state to do their job impartially,’’ Hobbs wrote.</p>

Voting is getting a major facelift with basic updates in House Bill 148, like providing essential materials at all polling locations and replacing handwritten tally systems for electronic ballot scanners to count votes. The state is going further to prevent miscounts and fraud by clarifying protocols for creating a duplicate of a ballot so it can be read electronically if the original ballot is unreadable. Election judge teams will also be equal in its amount of Democrats and Republicans; other parties would be included as well.  Representative Baumbach says that efficacy is key to our election process and that the bill creates updates that will improve elections and safeguard against election fraud. Future presidential elections will put more weight in the popular vote than ever before when the Electoral College meets to decide presidential election outcomes, thanks to one of the bills, Senate Bill 57. Representative Baumbach says that the bill will give voters more confidence in presidential elections because Electoral College results will be reflective of each and every vote cast by Delaware residents. Similarly, House Bill 153 would ensure that donations made by campaigns would be formally reported. Political campaigns are currently forced to manually enter all expenditures, which can lead to discrepancies in reports. The bill would increase transparency by having expenditures as a formal category on the campaign finance reporting system. The house bills will be heading to the Senate for consideration while the Senate bill is going to be on the Governor&#8217;s desk.</p>

Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, includes guidelines that set out the minimum number of early voting locations a parish should have based on its population and area. Lawmakers on the House and Governmental Affairs Committee discussed how population shifts in their parishes show a need for new polling sites, and how some rural parish residents have to cover long distances to reach an early voting location.  Another polling site could only be added as long as parish election officials had the logistical support of the Secretary of State and the accompanying state funding, according to the proposal. It would also only permit an additional early voting site for statewide elections. Although Jenkins said merely approving his bill did not create a cost for the state, a fiscal note attached to his legislation indicated adding 30 more early voting sites would cost the state more than $11 million over four years of implementation. Jenkins said he had amended his bill to call for a minimum of 20 new polling locations, but a fiscal note for that count was not publicly available.</p>
<p>House lawmakers approved a bill that would<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/05/19/voter-registration-for-formerly-incarcerated-could-get-streamlined-in-louisiana/"> make voter registration easier for formerly incarcerated people</a> in Louisiana.<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=244319"> House Bill 396</a>, sponsored by state Rep. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, cleared the House floor in a 63-34 bipartisan vote without debate. The bill would require the Louisiana Secretary of State to create an application form that formerly incarcerated people can fill out to request their voter registration be reinstated. The state Department of Corrections is supposed to provide the Secretary of State’s Office with a quarterly updated list of people who should have their voter registrations suspended. The Secretary of State is then supposed to disseminate that information to each parish registrar of voters. However, the procedures to reinstate voter registration aren’t entirely clear or well understood among all election officials. The bill next heads to the Senate for consideration.</p>

As it stands currently,<a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/new-bill-would-allow-ranked-choice-voting-to-decide-governors-race"> ranked choice voting</a> can only be used in federal elections like congressional races, or in local races in communities like Portland that specifically approved them. Under a bill that passed in committee this week, ranked choice voting would expand to include races for governor, state senator, and state representative. According to Maine’s constitution elected officials must win by pluralities instead of majorities, and this new bill seeks to amend that.</p>

Betsy Coffia, D-Traverse City has introduced<a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2023-HB-4569"> House Bill 4569</a>, which would make Michigan the 16th state to allow its citizens to<a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2023/05/michigan-looks-at-allowing-16-year-olds-to-preregister-to-vote.html"> preregister</a> to vote when they turn 16. After preregistering, the voter would be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18. The Secretary of State and Michigan Department of Education would do annual public outreach under the bill. MDE would ensure preregistration materials are available at every public high school, and the SOS would send a postcard to every 16-to-18-year-old with a driver’s license or state ID card who is eligible to preregister but has not done so. “By allowing future voters the option of preregistration, we can direct that newfound enthusiasm towards completing their first steps in democratic participation and hopefully a lifetime of robust civic engagement,” Coffia said. Michigan’s county and municipal clerks associations support the bill.</p>
<p>Representative Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo) has sponsored a bill let voters<a href="https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2023-05-23/house-elections-committee-to-debate-absentee-ballot-changes"> request an absentee ballot online</a>. Currently voters can already ask for an absentee ballot online thanks to a 2020 Secretary of State policy. But<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/billintroduced/House/pdf/2023-HIB-4570.pdf__;!!HXCxUKc!y6cx-snlSPQwg194km3ht2FsgJG2WD84gbjTKjVor4D9hZWKE9EfZui5QTbInnVFsWMMPhs7zOY3$"> this legislation</a> would codify that practice into law. “I saw this as a win-win for voters to have easy access to an absentee ballot. I just want to be clear that this is an online application. &#8230; It is not voting online,” Rogers said. She said the security measures in her bill mostly reflect what’s currently in place. There are two types of signatures voters would be able to attach to an absentee ballot. One is “manual digital signature,” meaning a picture of their handwritten signature. The other is a digital signature already on file with the Michigan Department of State. To use the “stored digital signature,” a voter would have to verify their identity through providing information like a full ID number, birthday, partial social security number, and eye color.</p>

After listening for eight hours,<a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/nebraska-voter-id-implementation-plan-advances-despite-objections/article_c090d613-2be9-5280-b14d-afe599b6bafd.html"> senators advanced the committee bill</a>, 43-1. State Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon, the committee chairman, said the amendment was the product of weeks of work. He said it aims to carry out the will of Nebraska voters, who overwhelmingly passed the voter ID measure last year, without being so restrictive that it would deny people their right to vote. The amendment spells out what documents would be accepted to prove identity for voting, how ID requirements would be handled for mail-in ballots, how people could get free IDs for voting and when exceptions would be allowed. Under the committee plan, voters would have to start showing ID after April 1 next year. That means the requirement would be in effect for Nebraskans casting early ballots for the 2024 primary election. Voters would be able to use IDs issued by the federal government, state of Nebraska, local governments or Nebraska colleges, as long as they have the person’s name and photo. Expired documents would be accepted. Military and veteran IDs, tribal IDs and patient records with photos kept by nursing homes, assisted living facilities or hospitals also would be accepted. People casting mail-in ballots would have to include the number from their Nebraska driver’s license or state ID card or a copy of an accepted ID document. People who go to the polls without acceptable ID could cast a provisional ballot but would have to show a valid ID to election officials by the Tuesday after the election to have their vote count.</p>

The vote comes one day after the proposal passed committee, and without any of a handful of changes proposed by interested parties. The proposal, known as the DATA Act, grew out of a report commissioned by the America First Policy Institute. The think tank criticized record keeping in numerous jurisdictions, in part, because they updated it too regularly. The DATA Act would create uniform definitions for various voter data and codify specific record-keeping standards.</p>

Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, introduced the resolution she says expands voting rights and is an effort to lessen the effects of voting legislation passed by the General Assembly last year. A spokesman for Secretary of State Frank LaRose told The Center Square that LaRose’s office does not think the General Assembly is willing to expand voter registration timing. “We must make the electoral process more accessible,” Hicks-Hudson said. “This legislation will expand voting rights and participation in the electoral process in our state – something we should be protecting at all costs. It also undoes recent legislative efforts to systematically and maliciously shut people out.”</p>

The measure would allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference for primary and general elections. This only applies to elections with three or more candidates. According to the office of House Speaker Dan Rayfield, the bill would also establish an education campaign to help Oregon voters understand the ranked-choice system. “Ranked choice voting creates a more collegial electoral environment,” Rayfield said in a statement. “It allows all voters to be engaged and excited about election outcomes and encourages good candidates running good campaigns. This is about integrity, it’s about electing people in control with the will of the voters.”</p>

They are calling for a<a href="https://www.politicspa.com/gop-dems-propose-new-legislation-surrounding-elections/121589/"> runoff election system</a> to identify a “clear consensus pick.” If no candidate receives at least 50% in a primary election, a second election would be held between the top two candidates.

Failed amendments by Democrats would have changed the new law’s effective date to December, instead of Sept. 1, to give county officials time to conduct the November county and municipal elections and to transfer the duties. Another failed amendment would have given the authority to transfer election duties to the county commissioners. The bill is now on its way to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk — and could ultimately face Harris County’s opposition in court.  County Attorney Christian D. Menefee in a statement said state legislators are singling out Harris County “to score cheap political points.”  “I want to be clear: this fight is not over,” Menefee said. “We cannot and will not allow the state to illegally target Harris County.”  Harris County Elections Administrator Clifford Tatum said in a statement to Votebeat that when the provision takes effect in September, it’ll be 39 days from the voter registration deadline and 52 days from the first day of early voting for a countywide election that includes the Houston mayoral race. “We fear this time frame would not be adequate for such a substantial change in administration, and that Harris County voters and election workers may be the ones to pay the price,” Tatum said.</p>
<p>Also approved this was a bill that would<a href="https://texas.votebeat.org/2023/5/23/23735186/legislature-eliminate-harris-county-election-administrator-oversight"> let the secretary of state intervene in local elections</a>. It would grant the state the authority to investigate election “irregularities” after complaints are filed and the authority to order the removal of a county election administrator or to file a petition to remove a county officer overseeing elections, such as a clerk, if “a recurring pattern of problems” isn’t resolved. The secretary’s current role in elections is only to guide and assist counties, with no oversight powers.  Senate Bill 1933 was originally written to apply to all counties but was amended on the House floor to impact only Harris County, by the House sponsor of the measure, Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress. The House’s changes to the bill now have to receive approval from the Senate this week.</p>
<p>Th House of Representatives gave crucial approval to a Republican-backed effort rooted in conspiracy theories that would<a href="https://texas.votebeat.org/2023/5/23/23735275/texas-eric-withdrawal-voter-roll-program-election-integrity"> remove the state from a national coalition</a> that helps prevent voter fraud.<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB1070"> Senate Bill 1070</a>, authored by state Sen. Bryan Hughes, was approved by the House on a 85-61 vote. The bill would allow Texas to withdraw from the Electronic Registration Information Center, also known as ERIC, a multistate program used for checking duplicate voter registrations and cleaning voter rolls. The bill is now headed back to the Senate for approval of changes proposed by Rep. John Bucy, D-Austin, that would add requirements to comply with federal and state privacy guidelines if an alternative system is contracted by the state. Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, spoke against the bill and said it was concerning to see the Texas Legislature take such action based on a conspiracy theory.  “That’s why I don’t understand why we have this bill before us, particularly when we know the data shows that ERIC has helped Texas identify duplicate registrations, and that’s exactly what we should be trying to do,” Turner said.</p>
<p>This week, the Senate got closer to<a href="https://texas.votebeat.org/2023/5/24/23736830/hb1243-illegal-voting-felony-intent-requirement"> raising the penalty for voting illegally</a> from a misdemeanor to a felony, as well as making it easier to convict a voter without proving they intended to cast an illegal ballot. Known as House Bill 1243, it was approved by the Senate on a 19–11 vote without debate. The proposal initially only raised the penalty of illegally casting a ballot from a misdemeanor to a felony. State Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, however, added language this week saying anyone who votes or attempts to vote in an election in which “the person knows of a particular circumstance that makes the person not eligible to vote” could be prosecuted.  The addition by Hughes means the bill must now go back to the House, where it faces an uncertain path. Another piece of legislation, Senate Bill 2, contained the same language Hughes has now inserted into this bill. SB 2 died in the House after it did not meet a key deadline. The law currently requires prosecutors to prove the person intended to cast an illegal ballot, a high hurdle. The change would eliminate that intent requirement and leave someone vulnerable to prosecution for an innocent misunderstanding. That means, for example, that a person who knows they have been convicted of a felony but doesn’t realize that makes them ineligible to vote, or a person who knows they are not a U.S. citizen but does not know that makes them ineligible to cast a ballot, could be prosecuted if the bill becomes law. A person found guilty would face up to 20 years in prison and more than $10,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Republicans once again chose not to give<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/texas-legislature-online-voter-registration-18106915.php"> online voter registration</a> bills a hearing this year, making this the fourth legislative session in a row without a debate on the matter. Every session, Texas lawmakers file bills to create the online system, but committee chairs in both the House and Senate have not chosen to hold hearings on these bills since 2015. This year, lawmakers have offered 10 such bills.</p>

A private arbitration panel found last month that a report submitted by Zeidman debunked Lindell’s claims and ordered Lindell to pay him the $5 million within 30 days of the ruling. Lindell filed a motion in state court in Minnesota to try to get the panel’s ruling tossed out and have the award vacated, arguing that the panel exceeded its powers in issuing the ruling.  Zeidman responded by filing a petition in federal court in Minnesota to get Lindell to pay him $5 million plus 10 percent interest per year until it is paid, in accordance with state law.</p>

That proceeding, an unusual second trial in Lake&#8217;s legal challenge to her November loss to Hobbs, was limited to a single claim about signature verification. Lake&#8217;s legal team argued it could prove signatures were examined in a matter of seconds, so short a timeframe it did not count as verification under state law. Thompson disagreed. &#8220;Accepting that argument would require the court to re-write not only the (Election Procedures Manual) but Arizona law to insert a minimum time for signature. In a statement, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Clint Hickman, a Republican, critiqued Lake&#8217;s false claims and her effort to &#8220;discard the valid votes of hundreds of thousands of Arizona voters.&#8221; &#8220;When &#8216;bombshells&#8217; and &#8216;smoking guns&#8217; are not backed up by facts, they fail in court,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is justice, and this is what happened today in Kari Lake’s election contest.&#8221; While Lake considers whether to appeal, she may also face the prospect of additional fines. Thompson&#8217;s ruling set an expedited schedule for this week for defense lawyers to request Lake to cover their costs, if they make such an ask.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Attorney’s Office has filed a motion against Kari Lake and her legal team,<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2023/05/24/maricopa-county-seeking-sanctions-against-kari-lake-legal-team/"> asking for sanctions and attorney fees for the rejected election lawsuit</a>. Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said in court paperwork her office would request the sanctions because Lake and her team “repeatedly made demonstrably false statements to this Court” and claimed the former TV news anchor brought weak arguments and claims to the trial. In the filing, Maricopa County attorneys allege Lake’s claim regarding signature verification had “several demonstrably false statements intended to confuse the Court and expand the remand proceedings.” She alleged Maricopa County officials failed to perform any higher level signature verifications on ballots that had been flagged by lower level screeners for any inconsistency. Lake’s team also claimed 8,000 ballots were improperly rejected and not counted during the general election, but their evidence contradicted their original claim. “Yet again, Lake and her counsel presented uncertainty as certainty despite the plain text of her primary documents,” a portion of the ruling read.</p>
<p>An Arizona group that<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/21/arizona-lawsuit-voter-intimidation/"> monitored ballot drop boxes</a> for signs of fraud during the midterm elections has settled a lawsuit and agreed to “publicly condemn intimidation of any kind in connection with the exercise of the right to vote,” according to a statement from the League of Women Voters of Arizona, which had filed the suit. The organization last October sued the group formerly known as Clean Elections USA and its founder, Melody Jennings, alleging the tactics of the group and its allies amounted to illegal voter intimidation. “This litigation has been essential to protect the voters of Arizona, who have the right to cast their ballots free from intimidation, threats or coercion,” Pinny Sheoran, president of the League of Women Voters of Arizona, said in the group’s<a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-protect-voters-arizona-intimidation-drop-boxes-settled"> statement</a>. The settlement comes after a federal judge in November issued a temporary restraining order, directing those working with Jennings’ group to stay at least 75 feet away from ballot drop boxes and correct false statements they’ve made about Arizona election law. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Michael Liburdi, also prevented activists from photographing or videotaping voters to spread untrue allegations of electoral fraud.</p>

As the person who requested the recount, San Miguel resident Darcia Stebbens is required by state law to pay for the full cost: $53,346, in this case. Stebbens still owes the county $4,448. Before she pays it, however, she’s asked the county for an invoice showing line-item costs for the recount. SLO County Clerk-Recorder Elaina Cano provided Stebbens with a list of staff hours spent on the recount, as well as a list of materials used and their costs. Stebbens said the list was not sufficient. On May 1, Cano filed suit against Stebbens in small claims court for the remaining balance.</p>

Attorneys for the Florida NAACP and Florida Rising Together filed a 41-page petition last week asking the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to hear a challenge to the law. The request came after a divided panel of the Atlanta-based appeals court last month overturned much of a district judge’s ruling against the law. The petition contended that errors “permeate” the three-judge panel’s decision, including that the majority did not properly consider evidence in the case. “The stakes could not be higher: This case concerns whether the country’s third-largest state conducts free and fair elections uninhibited by what the district court found to be racially motivated voting restrictions,” the petition said. While Florida had a relatively smooth 2020 election, Republican lawmakers argued the changes were necessary to make the state’s elections more secure. Opponents, however, argued the changes were targeted, at least in part, at Black voters, who overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates. The law imposed new restrictions on mail-in voting and voter-registration groups and prohibited people from giving snacks and drinks to voters waiting in line to cast ballots. Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in March 2022 issued a 288-page decision that blocked parts of the law. “In sum, this court concludes that to the extent promoting voter confidence or preventing fraud may have motivated the Legislature in part, this court finds that the Legislature passed SB 90 with the intent to restructure Florida’s election system in ways that favor the Republican Party over the Democratic Party,” Walker, who is based in Tallahassee, wrote. “This court further finds that, to advance the Legislature’s main goal of favoring Republicans over Democrats, the Legislature enacted some of SB 90’s provisions with the intent to target Black voters because of their propensity to favor Democratic candidates.” But last month’s 2-1 decision by the appeals-court panel said Walker’s decision “does not withstand examination.” “The district court relied on fatally flawed statistical analyses, out-of-context statements by individual legislators, and legal premises that do not follow our precedents,” appeals-court Chief Judge William Pryor wrote in a 79-page decision joined by Judge Britt Grant. “On the contrary, examining the record reveals that the finding of intentional discrimination rests on hardly any evidence.” But Judge Jill Pryor, in a dissenting opinion, wrote that Walker, in a “thorough and well-reasoned order, committed no reversible error.”</p>
<p>Within hours of Gov. Ron DeSantis<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/24/two-lawsuits-filed-over-election-bill-desantis-just-signed-into-law/70254423007/"> signing into law a new package of sweeping election system changes</a>, advocacy organizations filed two federal lawsuits challenging it. &#8220;<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7050">Senate Bill 7050</a> is yet another assault on democracy and attempt to muzzle Floridians,” said Cecile Scoon, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, in a press release. Her organization, represented by the government watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, filed the first lawsuit on Wednesday. “Third-party voter registration organizations play a critical role in ensuring that every eligible Floridian has an opportunity to vote, especially Black and brown Floridians,” said Abha Khanna, a partner at Elias Law Group, in a press release. &#8220;SB 7050 threatens to disrupt and discourage these organizations from helping marginalized Floridians register to vote.&#8221; Khanna&#8217;s Democratic law firm is representing the plaintiffs in the second lawsuit: the Florida NAACP, Equal Ground Education Fund, Voters of Tomorrow Action, Disability Rights Florida, Alianza for Progress, Alianza Center, UnidosUS and the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans. Both lawsuits, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, allege the law is unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

Holkeboer is now facing charges of falsifying records and using a computer to commit a crime. Both are felonies. Attorneys for Holkeboer are asking the appeals court to grant an application for leave to appeal. Their argument claims the trial court errored by interpreting MCL 168.932 &#8220;to proscribe copying election records where the statute does not use the term &#8216;copy&#8217; or any of its synonyms,&#8221; Holkeboer&#8217;s attorneys wrote. His attorneys also argue that the trial court should have dismissed count 2, which is using a computer to commit an offense.  Kent County Prosecutor Christopher Becker filed an answer in opposition to the application.  &#8220;Notably, when asked how he would react to another poll worker taking files in the same manner, Defendant explained that &#8216;if he saw someone from his party do it, he&#8230;really wouldn&#8217;t question what they were doing,'&#8221; Becker wrote.</p>

The ruling comes after the state’s appellate court denied the Voters Alliance’s lawsuit altogether in August. While the state’s high court mostly dismissed the Voters Alliance’s challenge, the court did agree with one point: a rule implemented by Secretary of State Mark Ritchie pertaining to how absentee ballot signatures are reviewed partially conflicts with Minnesota law. The portion of the rule at issue allowed for any ballot board member to review absentee ballot signatures if the identification number on the application and ballot envelope doesn’t match. However, state law says only election judges are able to do that review. While election judges can be ballot board members, not all ballot board members are election judges. Therefore, the Minnesota Supreme Court determined the rule is invalid and election judges have to conduct that review. However, the ruling doesn’t change when ballot signatures are reviewed or provide any new reason for ballots to be not accepted.</p>

Gilbert appointed the board’s choice for monitor, Lynn DeRoche, who worked in the Elections Office for more than 16 years under former Clerk and Recorder Rina Moore and under current Clerk Sandra Merchant for about the first month of her term. Gilbert said she chose DeRoche in the interest of time, as the respondent’s proposed monitor candidates had not been consulted prior. These suggested persons included Clerks and Recorders from Ravalli County, Regina Plettenberg, and Flathead County, Debbie Pierson, among others. “This will require Ms. DeRoche and Ms. Merchant to put any past differences aside and put their efforts toward – the fair and efficient election moving forward,” Gilbert said. The decision comes in the wake of problems with Merchant’s handling of the May 2 local school board and flood district elections. For example, some voters received two absentee ballots, ballots would not fit properly in the return envelope and the polling location opened an hour late, with voters not able to submit ballots before going to work in the morning.</p>
