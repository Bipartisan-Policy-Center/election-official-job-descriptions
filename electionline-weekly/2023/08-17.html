														<p><strong>U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence Releases Nonpartisan Values to Help Drive Improvements to the Voting Experience</strong></p>
<p>The nonpartisan<a href="https://www.electionexcellence.org/"> U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence</a>, a collaborative that brings together bipartisan election officials to rally around a set of common values and standards, support each other, and keep their skills fresh, has released values that will guide the collaborative’s work as it helps to create voluntary, nonpartisan programs and resources for local election departments to improve operations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10046" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.30-PM.png" alt="" width="688" height="385" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.30-PM.png 920w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.30-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.30-PM-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></p>
<p>“These values were driven by feedback from jurisdictions that serve as few as 988 voters to as many as 4.7 million,” said Tiana Epps-Johnson, founder and executive director of the Center for Tech and Civic Life. “These values will be the north star that guides the Alliance’s work to create nonpartisan recommendations for ways election departments can make our voting systems more secure and improve the voting experience in operational areas like poll worker recruitment.”</p>
<p>The values that will guide the Alliance’s nonpartisan work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>High integrity</li>
<li>Comprehensive preparedness</li>
<li>Voter-centricity</li>
<li>Proactive transparency</li>
<li>Continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://electionexcellence.org/values">Read more about the values here.</a></p>
<p>“Values like integrity, transparency and a drive to continuous improvement are nonpartisan and will serve all election offices well, large or small,” said Pam Anderson, former Jefferson County Colorado Clerk and the 2022 Republican nominee for Secretary of State in Colorado. “It’s clear that election departments were driving the ship on the creation of these values.”</p>
<p>To date, nearly 50 election departments that serve 30.5 million voters have provided feedback into the development of the Alliance’s values. The departments range in size from serving 988 voters to as many as 4.7 million voters.</p>
<p>Later this year, the Alliance will build upon the values that have been released by sharing sets of voluntary, nonpartisan standards for local election departments. Much like a “Good Housekeeping” seal of approval, the standards will, for the first time, give voters and election officials a tool to evaluate what excellent U.S. election administration looks like.</p>
<p>The standards will cover common responsibilities managed by local election departments across the country, such as how to recruit and manage poll workers, communications and ensure safe and secure elections.</p>
<p>The public will be invited to provide feedback on the draft standards.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10047" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.16-PM.png" alt="" width="746" height="419" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.16-PM.png 912w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.16-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-2.00.16-PM-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></p>
<p>After the standards have received public feedback, the Alliance will recognize election departments’ performance alongside the standards through a certification program. For election departments that successfully meet the standards, the Alliance will award a public designation.</p>
<p><a href="https://form.jotform.com/232115522344142">Let the Alliance know if you’re interested in giving feedback on the standards or getting involved in other ways.</a> And get an Alliance poster for your election office!</p>
<p>The U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence is a nonpartisan collaborative that’s bringing together election officials, designers, technologists, and other experts to envision, support, and celebrate excellence in U.S. election administration. The collaborative is led by the Center for Tech and Civic Life.</p>

Kalshi has told the Commodity Futures Trading Commission it plans to start offering an option for users to bet on political control of the House and Senate an event contract — the event being a chosen political party’s control of each congressional chamber. It would function like a commodities contract. According to the information Kalshi submitted to the CFTC, the price would fluctuate between a penny and $1, depending on the odds, and a user would have to buy a minimum of 5,000 options, which means a minimum buy-in would be $500. Big firms that Kalshi determines have a “demonstrated established economic hedging need” would be allowed to bet up to $100 million. Kalshi pulled a similar proposal earlier this year. According to Votebeat, CFTC has rejected such proposals before, arguing that allowing people to bet on the outcome of elections might convince them to vote in favor of their financial interests, which is bad for society. In other words, elections aren’t a commodity and you can’t treat them like soybeans. Needless to say, there are concerns in the good government and elections community. “It’s not a March Madness bracket with your coworkers,” Stephen Spaulding, vice president for policy of Common Cause told Votebeat. “This is something on a much bigger scale.”</p>

The board voted to reject 302 of the 1,074 provisional ballots cast in the special August election. That&#8217;s an approximate 72 percent acceptance rate, when provisional ballots are normally accepted at a 90 percent rate. More than half of the rejected provisional ballots, 160, were voters who failed to provide an unexpired photo ID at the polls. Of those, 121 had expired ID and 39 had no photo ID at all. Board President Marilyn Jacobcik, a Republican, and board member Anthony Giardini, a Democrat, said they planned to write LaRose&#8217;s office about it. Giardini and Jacobcik said the new law potentially disenfranchises older voters who don&#8217;t have a valid driver&#8217;s license because they don&#8217;t drive, can&#8217;t drive for medical reasons, and don&#8217;t have a passport. Giardini said the 160 people whose votes were rejected because the board followed state law were otherwise &#8220;perfectly qualified&#8221; to vote in a nonpartisan election. The only reason their votes didn&#8217;t end up counting was because of the voter ID requirement, he said. &#8220;That makes me very uncomfortable. These people weren&#8217;t cheating,&#8221; Giardini said. &#8220;I think we all share that concern,&#8221; Jacobcik said.</p>

Recently, Wyoming Republican Party Chairman Frank Eathorne <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/08/15/wyoming-gop-worries-problem-states-threaten-nations-election-security/">criticized</a> the state’s county clerks for not performing audits as he and others would like to see them done. He said this showed a lack of transparency. However, Wyoming County Clerks Association President and Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin said the State Constitution does not allow clerks in the Cowboy State to perform election audits to the same degree that they are done in some other states. “We don’t believe we can do that in Wyoming because the Wyoming Constitution doesn’t allow for ballots to be made public,” Ervin said. The Wyoming Constitution states that all voters should be guaranteed absolute privacy in the appropriation of their ballots and that the secrecy of the ballot is compulsory. Ervin said the clerks have determined this to mean that ballots are to remain confidential both before and after their casting.  Ervin said even with names and other identifying factors redacted from a ballot, it could still be discovered how an individual voted based on the fact there are some precincts around the state where there are only a few registered Democrats. Also, there is the potential that someone could recognize another person’s handwriting on a write-in ballot and discover how they voted.  “That’s why we haven’t gone to the length of having a full-scale audit like you saw in Maricopa County,” Ervin told the Cowboy State Daily.</p>

Jasmine Crockett, D- Dallas, introduced the <a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/proposed-legislation-would-restore-voting-for-released-felons">Democracy Restoration Act</a> last month to restore voting rights in federal elections to all released felons regardless of parole or probation status, and regardless of state laws. Versions of the measure have been filed since 2008 but never made it to the president’s desk. The Democracy Restoration Act would restore voting rights for released felons in federal elections only. In states where eligibility doesn’t kick in during probation or parole, the voter would only be able to fill out a federal ballot. Voting rights experts and prisoner advocates blame the patchwork for confusion that can deter ex-offenders from casting ballots even when they have the right to vote or, in some cases, lands them behind bars again for an honest mistake. “When state governments create confusion about the voting laws and prosecute innocent mistakes to the fullest extent possible, people just don’t risk it,” Crockett told reporters at the Capitol on July 27. “It’s yet another way to make sure that voter suppression is real in this country.” The House included the act in two sweeping election reform bills, the For the People Act in 2021 and the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act in 2022. Both bills died in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-10040" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MorrowGA-300x271.png" alt="" width="151" height="136" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MorrowGA-300x271.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MorrowGA.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 151px) 100vw, 151px" />Morrow, Georgia</strong>: The Morrow city council recently approved a plan to let voters decide whether the city should start<a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/election-ballots-printed-english-only-morrow-voters-council-decides/85-17822a9d-75bc-4616-9849-d159dbd82946"> printing all of the municipal election ballots in more than one language</a> in addition to English. It’s been such a heated argument in Morrow that, at one point, one council member called a colleague “un-American” for wanting multi-language ballots. So, the council decided to stay out of it and put it to the voters directly. Council Member Dorothy Dean proposed that, instead of the council debating and voting on a proposed ordinance, the council should order a city-wide referendum on November 7 to let voters decide. The suggested ballot language, Dean said: “Shall the City of Morrow use bilingual ballots on all future elections? Yes or No?” Dean’s motion passed unanimously. City Council Member Van Tran is working to determine if Morrow, in fact, might actually be required by the federal Voting Rights Act to print ballots in multiple languages because of the city’s growing minority populations&#8211;never mind any ordinance or referendum.</p>

The original bill, Senate Bill 747, contained a series of what supporters described as election integrity measures, including setting an Election Day deadline for receiving absentee ballots, making voters using same-day registration cast provisional ballots and prohibiting private money in election administration. Democrats argue that these measures would make it more difficult to vote and easier to throw out legitimate ballots. The new bill keeps most of the bones, but softens certain sections and removes others that critics had called impractical. For same-day registrants, those registering to vote during the early voting period, the House’s bill does not require them to cast provisional ballots, which are normally used for those whose eligibility as voters are questioned. But it does require that they use a “retrievable ballot,” meaning that their vote may be thrown out if the county board of elections cannot verify their address. Two of the most significant provisions in the original bill are left largely unchanged. Just like in the old version, the deadline to receive absentee ballots would be set at 7:30 p.m. on Election Day. Currently, absentee ballots can be accepted up to three days past Election Day. Also, election boards at the state and local level would be prohibited from accepting any private monetary donations to help conduct elections. The bill also expands the ability of partisan poll observers to observe election procedures, though not as extensively as an earlier bill, House Bill 772. The earlier bill would have given observers broad access to voting enclosures, even allowing them some opportunities to take photos and video. The new bill takes out some of these permissions, but still clarifies that observers may hear conversations between election officials and voters, move around the voting space and see setup and tear down procedures. The new version also softens a requirement to verify signatures on absentee ballots. The original bill would have required all absentee ballots to go through a signature matching process in the 2024 general election following a pilot program in the primaries. The new version institutes only the pilot program — which cannot throw any ballots out for failing a signature match — and leaves open the possibility for signature matching in the general election depending on the results of the pilot.</p>

Legislators said county clerks are seeing a high amount of turnover because of this harassment, so, lawmakers are looking into increasing the penalties for anyone who interferes with government workers. Sen. Todd Weiler said the Criminal Code Evaluation Task Force has been asked to look into what they can do to protect government workers. They haven’t hammered out exactly what the new penalties would be for interfering or threatening a poll worker, but Weiler said it could be at least a Class A misdemeanor, or in some cases, a felony. “One idea that’s on the table, no decision has been met, is if we increase the penalties, hopefully, incentivizing people to do the right thing and not cross those lines,&#8221; Weiler said.</p>

The three-judge panel held a hearing as they weigh whether to let the map stand or to step in and draw new congressional districts for the state. The panel heard arguments this week but did not indicate when it would rule. Alabama was forced to draw new district lines after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a surprise June decision, upheld the panel’s earlier finding that the state’s then-map — which had just one Black-majority district out of seven in a state where more than one in four residents is Black — likely violated the federal Voting Rights Act. Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case Monday that the new plan, which maintains one majority-Black district, still discriminates against Black voters. They said it flouts the panel’s 2022 finding that Alabama should have two districts where Black voters comprise a majority or “something quite close to it.”</p>

Katie Hobbs when she was the secretary of state, the U.S. Justice Department said. Clark entered a guilty plea to one count of sending a communication containing a bomb threat to an election official, according to a news release. The FBI arrested Clark last year over online threats he made in February 2021. According to prosecutors, Clark sent a message through an online form maintained by the Secretary of State’s election department. He warned Hobbs she had to “resign by Tuesday Feb. 16 by 9 a.m. or the explosive device impacted in her personal space will be detonated.” He also was accused of doing Internet searches of Hobbs’ name with phrases like “how to kill” and “address.” Clark’s threat was one of countless threats made against Hobbs for her role in certifying the 2020 presidential election, which then-Republican President Donald Trump contended without evidence was stolen. Democrat Joe Biden was declared the winner in Arizona. Clark will be sentenced on Oct. 26. He faces up to five years in prison.</p>

The 41-count, 98-page indictment said Trump and his co-defendants refused to accept the fact that Trump lost in Georgia. But “they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump. That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose.” The charges are the culmination of a 2 1/2-year criminal investigation launched by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis shortly after Trump’s leaked Jan. 2, 2021, phone call with Brad Raffensperger, during which he asked the Georgia secretary of state to “find” him 11,780 votes. The indictment lays out several different areas of alleged criminal misconduct. Among them: The phone calls Trump made to Georgia officials, including Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp. The “alternate” GOP electors who cast Electoral College votes for Trump on Dec. 14, 2020 while the official Democratic electors cast votes for Joe Biden. The false testimony given to state House and Senate committees, which led to threats and harassment of Fulton County poll workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss. The copying of sensitive Georgia elections data in Coffee County, some 200 miles southeast of Atlanta, the day after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Also charged: state Sen. Shawn Still; attorneys John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Bob Cheeley, Ray Smith III and Kenneth Chesebro; former assistant U.S. attorney general Jeffrey Clark; former Coffee County GOP chairwoman Cathy Latham; Atlanta bail bondsman Scott Hall; former Coffee County elections director Misty Hampton; GOP strategist Michael Roman; publicist Trevian Kutti; Illinois pastor Stephen Cliffguard Lee; and Harrison Floyd, who briefly ran for a suburban Atlanta U.S. House seat before serving as director of Black Voices for Trump.</p>

The decision comes after Idahoans for Open Primaries, a coalition seeking to make primary elections more accessible and establish a ranked-choice voting mechanism in Idaho, sued Labrador. The group alleged that Labrador made false and mislead statements to the public about the group’s  ballot initiative. The Idaho Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Labrador’s titles were likely to cause prejudice against the measure. “Today’s decision is a major victory for the voters of Idaho,” Bruce Newcomb, a member of Idahoans for Open Primaries and former Republican speaker of the Idaho House, said in a news release. “Too many of our elected officials are handpicked by special-interest groups, not by the voters they’re supposed to serve. The Open Primaries Initiative will change that by giving all voters — regardless of party affiliation — the right to vote in primary elections.”</p>

Indiana law allows “elderly” voters — those 65 or older — to vote by mail. Indiana voters who are younger than 65 must fall within one of 12 other categories in order to vote by mail. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indiana Election Commission extended absentee-voting privileges to all registered Indiana voters for the June 2020 primary but did not renew that order for the November 2020 general election. The plaintiffs in the instant case — Indiana voters who were allowed to vote absentee in the primary, but who do not otherwise qualify for absentee voting — filed suit when the extended absentee-voting privileges weren’t renewed. They initially sought a preliminary injunction requiring Indiana to permit unlimited absentee voting, claiming that the state’s failure to extend absentee voting to all eligible voters abridged the rights of younger voters in violation of the 26th Amendment and also infringed their fundamental right to vote in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana<a href="https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/lawsuit-challenging-constitutionality-of-indianas-age-limit-on-absentee-voting-proceeding-in-in-southern-district"> denied their request</a> for a preliminary injunction.</p>

The election law,<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2022/b2021_22/measures/hb2332/"> House Bill 2332</a>, was passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 over Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly&#8217;s veto. Among its provisions was a ban on mailing voters a pre-filled application for a mail ballot. VoteAmerica and the Voter Participation Center sued, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Vratil ruled in May that the law unconstitutionally infringed on their First Amendment rights to speech and association. Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Attorney General Kris Kobach, as well as Johnson County District Attorney Stephen Howe, appealed to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June and filed their brief July 27. Schwab, Kobach and Howe have received support in the appellate court from amicus curiae briefs of four conservative groups that have been involved in election law litigation. Schwab and Kobach aren&#8217;t appealing a separate provision of the law, which prohibits out-of-state entities from sending blank applications to Kansas voters. The state agreed to a permanent injunction against that part. They also stipulated that VoteAmerica&#8217;s activities didn&#8217;t run afoul of the disputed law because they sent pre-filled applications only after a voter requested one through their website.</p>

He has filed a new lawsuit in Washoe County District Court with similar allegations of fraud and other wrongdoing. He insists, without evidence, that the election system is rife with “flaws and irregularities” that robbed him of his vote in 2020. He lost another lawsuit last year that sought heightened observation of Washoe County’s vote-counting process. Beadles’ lawsuit “contains various baseless and delusory allegations disjointed from any viable legal claim,” Deputy District Attorney Lindsay Liddell wrote in the draft motion. She described it as “inaccurate rantings of a conspiracy theorist disconnected from any legitimate claim.”</p>

The decision by Crump found that the law is unconstitutional and would disrupt this fall’s elections.  The AG’s Office filed its appeal in the Texas Supreme Court, keeping Crump’s order from taking effect. The law, which would have forced the county to eliminate the county’s elections administrator and transfer all election duties to the county clerk and the tax assessor-collector, is set to take effect Sept. 1, weeks before early voting begins for the county’s November municipal elections. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee filed the lawsuit in Travis County District Court last month and argued the law,<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB1750"> Senate Bill 1750</a>, violates the Texas Constitution because it was used by the Legislature to single out one county. Menefee asked Crump to prevent the law from taking effect.  Crump agreed and in her ruling added, “Not only will this transfer lead to inefficiencies, disorganization, confusion, office instability, and increased costs to Harris County, but it will also disrupt an election that the Harris County EA [elections administrator] has been planning for months. The Harris County Clerk and the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector have had no role in preparing for the November Election.”</p>

During the two-week trial, lawyers for the losing Republican candidates relied heavily on theories generated by their party members in lieu of testimony from voters or analysis from election law experts. Peeples said following closing arguments that he did not expect to issue a ruling for weeks.</p>

Republican lawmakers had argued the case must be dismissed because the argument raised by the plaintiff, Rise Inc., a liberal group that mobilizes young voters, relies on “a legally incorrect construction of Wisconsin’s absentee-voting laws.” However Nilsestuen ruled that a motion to dismiss was improper and the case can be argued in court. “Rather than arguing that the case is not justiciable, the Intervenor argues the merits of the case, given that its argument rests on whose definition of ‘address of a witness’ is correct,” Nilsestuen wrote in the order. “Even if I agreed that the Plaintiffs’ claims fails on the merits — and I take no position at this stage in the litigation — the proper course of action would not be dismissal.”</p>

The outcomes of the cases will affect voting rights, racial justice, executive powers, checks and balances, and so much more. On Wednesday, August 23, join us virtually at 3 p.m. ET to hear Brennan Center experts and NYU professor and MSNBC legal analyst Andrew Weissmann discuss the cases and their implications. <strong>When:</strong> August 23, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
