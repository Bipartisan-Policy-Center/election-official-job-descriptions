							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>SCOTUS rejects Independent State Legislature theory</strong><br />
<em>Majority writes that US Constitution does no insulate state lawmaker actions from review by the state courts</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>This week, the United States Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision in<em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf"> Moore v Harper</a></em>, rejecting the Independent State Legislature theory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9099" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At issue in <em>Moore v Harper</em> was whether the North Carolina Supreme Court overstepped its authority by invalidating the redistricting maps drawn by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The Legislature argued not that the state Supreme Court erred in its interpretation of state law to assess the maps, but rather that the state court was precluded by the terms of the United States Constitution’s Election Clause from restricting the state legislature’s efforts with regard to redistricting or the time, place, and manner of federal elections – a theory called the Independent State Legislature theory (ISL).</p>
<p>The case was<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/12-08/"> argued in early December 2022</a> and was definitely one of the court’s most watched cases this year because implications could be far reaching.</p>
<p>“This is a crucial opinion, released 16 months before the 2024 election,” said David Becker, executive director of the<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/"> Center for Election Innovation and Research</a>. “It makes clear that the judicial restraints that states place on legislative efforts to change election laws or procedures remain, and any effort to circumvent the rule of law will be rejected.</p>
<p>A number of elections officials on both sides of the aisle filed<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/annotated-guide-amicus-briefs-moore-v-harper"> amicus briefs</a> in the case detailing how a ruling could impact state and local elections officials. In a brief filed on behalf of<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/2022.10.26_Amici_Current%20and%20Former%20Election%20Administrators%20%20FINAL.pdf"> current and former election administrators</a>, the law firm Perkins Coie LLP explained how the ISLT would cause chaos for election officials by, among other things, depriving them of clear “rules of the road” and authoritative interpretations of key laws.</p>
<p>Another brief, filed by<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/2022.10.26_Amici_SOS%20FINAL.pdf"> Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and 12 other secretaries</a> of state underscored how entrenched state judicial review of election disputes has become and how a Supreme Court ruling limiting that review would destabilize elections.</p>
<p>Writing for the court majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that the U.S. Constitution does not, as the lawmakers had claimed, insulate their actions from review by the state courts. To the contrary, he said, state legislative power is constrained by the federal and state constitutions, as well as ordinary state laws.</p>
<p>Reaction throughout the elections community was swift and largely united.</p>
<p>“On the merits, this was a good decision. State legislatures are creations of state constitutions and must act within the parameters of those state constitutions. Moreover, none of the justices showed any support for the radical idea that state legislatures can overturn election results they don’t like. The Court’s decision today will create a more stable election landscape,” said Matthew Germer, fellow with the Governance Program at<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/"> R Street Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.electiontaskforce.org/"> National Task Force on Election Crises</a>, a, cross-partisan group of more than 50 experts in election law, election administration, national security, cybersecurity, voting rights, civil rights, technology, media, public health, and emergency response issued a statement in response to the decision.</p>
<p>“We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision today in <em>Moore v. Harper</em>, rejecting the dangerous Independent State Legislature Theory (ISLT) and reaffirming the traditional checks and balances on state administration of federal elections. The Court has affirmed that when state legislatures exercise their authorities regarding the conduct of federal elections, they do so subject to the provisions of their state constitutions, including judicial review in state courts,” the<a href="https://mailchi.mp/protectdemocracy/national-task-force-on-election-crises-statement-on-moore-v-harper-decision?e=ef7ea6018a"> statement read</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"> Bipartisan Policy Center</a> released a<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/independent-state-legislature-theory/"> report</a> on how the ISL could have undermined election principles. The report noted that in the most extreme possibility, local election administrators could be forced to run simultaneous elections—one for federal contests and one for state contests—on different ballots and with different rules.</p>
<p>“This ruling prevents a potential deluge of disruptive changes to voting during the 2024 presidential election cycle,”<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/press-release/scotus-right-to-reject-ind-state-legislature-theory/"> said</a> Democracy Program Executive Director Matthew Weil. “While we are left without clear boundaries on state court decision-making, legislators at the state level must continue to work with their governors and pass laws that respect their own Constitution’s provisions. That’s the way policymaking should work, and this ruling preserves centuries of precedent.”</p>
<p>Joining Roberts in the majority were conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett and liberal, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the dissent, saying first that the case presented no live controversy anymore since a subsequent state supreme court decision had thrown out the original ruling. Justice Samuel Alito joined that part of the dissent only. But Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the second part of the Thomas dissent, which disputed the majority&#8217;s conclusion on the merits of the case.</p>
<p>“Today the Supreme Court rejected the independent state legislature theory, the radical notion that could have undermined voting rights and upended our elections. The independent state legislature theory is now dead. State courts can now freely enforce constitutional rights and guarantees as they have for hundreds of years,” said Wendy Weiser,<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/supreme-court-rejects-independent-state-legislature-theory"> Democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law</a>. “Our system of checks and balances still stands. The court noted that federal courts can, in extreme circumstances, review state court decisions to see if they &#8216;exceed the ordinary bounds of judicial review.”</p>

Turnout was low statewide, even in<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-board-of-elections-planned-to-get-it-right-low-turnout-helped"> New York City</a>. The city deployed more than 20,000 poll workers to some 1,000 poll sites in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, for two dozen City Council primaries, two boroughwide district attorney primaries and dozens of other judicial and party positions on the ballot; the day was far less dramatic. As one of the city’s top elections officials stressed, the agency also took careful and meticulous steps to get it right — knowing full well the criticism it faced in the past. “We have humans, so we have human error like every other agency in the city of New York,” said Vincent Ignizio, the deputy executive director of the New York City Board of Elections and the agency’s main spokesperson. “Our goal is to just run free and fair elections and basically get out of the way, let the voters do what it is they need to do and be as error-free as possible.” In<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/election-board-says-delayed-primary-214700546.html"> Niagara County</a>, Democratic Elections Commissioner Lora Allan aid results were not posted as quickly as the board would have liked after polls closed Tuesday night because a computing firewall, which is designed to protect the electronic voting system from being compromised by outside forces, blocked results from being sent by local clerks&#8217; offices to the election board&#8217;s headquarters in Lockport. The<a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/oneida-county-boe-mistakenly-leaves-an-entire-town-off-the-ballot"> Oneida County</a> board of elections office will have to hold a special primary election—-after BOE officials realized a clerical error caused them to leave a Republican primary in the Town of Remsen off the ballot. The elections board said it notified Remsen, the state of New York and all the impacted candidates about the “irregularity” and are now in the process of working on rectification plans. The<a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2023/06/28/2-people-used-watertowns-special-bus-primary-day/"> Jefferson County</a> board of elections paused two polling places for this election, but provided bus service to take voters who usually use those polls to their new polling place. Only two people rode the buses all day. Redistricting caused some voter confusion at a high-rise for seniors and people with disabilities in<a href="https://www.whec.com/top-news/at-one-rochester-apartment-complex-redistricting-leads-to-voter-confusion/"> Monroe County</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9876" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ERN-300x117.png" alt="" width="300" height="117" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ERN-300x117.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ERN.png 406w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />New Report</strong>: The Election Reformers Network (ERN) recently released a new report:<a href="https://www.electionreformers.org/articles/helping-states-comply-with-the-electoral-count-reform-act"> Helping States Comply with the Electoral Count Reform Act.</a> The report is designed for state legislators and their staff, election officials, and other administrators. The report summarizes the impact of the ECRA on state law and provides six recommendations on what states need to look for—and potentially change.  “The Electoral Count Reform Act reflects a broad bipartisan consensus that clarity counts when the stakes are high and time is short,” said G. Michael Parsons, ERN Senior Counsel and lead author of the report. “The report aims to make implementation as simple as possible so states can carry on this important and timely work ahead of the 2024 presidential election.”  The ECRA updated the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which contained the ambiguous and outdated language that provided a pretext for attempts to subvert the 2020 election. Recognizing the importance of clarity for the processes governing a peaceful transfer of power, Congress affirmed the purely ministerial role of the Vice President, tightly narrowed the grounds for objection to electoral votes in Congress, and underlined the primacy of courts in resolving election disputes. In addition, the ECRA added new procedures to avoid any ambiguity around the validity of electoral votes received from the states. Because of these changes, there are now discrepancies between state and federal laws. “We shouldn’t be relying on eleventh-hour litigation in 2024 to fix foreseeable issues that can be addressed today,” said ERN Executive Director Kevin Johnson. “We don’t need to take that chance.”</p>

Featuring a flying unicorn and an extremely exuberant early voter, a design by 11-year-old Shannon Fisher won the hearts of thousands of voters to take home the winning design in the<a href="https://www.wake.gov/news/wake-county-6th-grader-wins-vote-community-election-sticker-contest"> Wake County, North Carolina</a> Board of Elections sticker design contest. “The enthusiasm and support for these students have been wonderful to see – nearly 7,000 people cast votes!” said Wake County Elections Director Olivia McCall. “We have so many talented young people in our community and we’re incredibly grateful to everyone who participated.” After launching their first ever sticker contest, the Wake County Board of Elections received more than 100 creative “I Voted Early” designs from middle and high school students across the county. Staff were then tasked with the difficult job of using contest guidelines to narrow the selection to 10 finalists. Fisher’s design edged out her fellow designers earning 28% of the vote.</p>

Tina Kotek has named<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/28/oregon-governor-appoints-new-lavonne-valade-griffin-secretary-of-state-scandal/"> LaVonne Griffin-Valade</a> as the next secretary of state following the resignation of Shemia Fagan in May. Griffin-Valade spent 16 years as a government auditor — first at Multnomah County and then as Portland’s elected auditor before leaving government service in 2014 to pursue a career in writing. “LaVonne Griffin-Valade has the professional background and ethical judgment to rise above politics and lead the important work of the agency forward,” Kotek said in a statement. “This role demands accountability and transparency, especially at this moment, and I am eager to see her leadership restore faith in the Secretary of State’s office.” Griffin-Valade will be sworn in on June 30. A release from the governor’s office said Griffin-Valade will serve the remaining 18 months of Fagan’s term. Elisabeth Shepard, a Kotek spokesperson, said it was up to Griffin-Valade whether she chooses to seek election to the office in 2024. In a statement Wednesday, Griffin-Valade said she’s up to the task. “I have the experience to bring back credibility, accountability, transparency, and trust to the Secretary of State’s office,” she wrote. “It’s never been more important to have a leader who will focus on rebuilding the public’s trust in the Secretary of State’s office, and that is exactly what I will aim to do every day.”</p>

Adams served as clerk from 2000 to 2018. She was 77 years old. While her office was at the Jefferson County Courthouse, Adams as clerk was a frequent presence around the county as she traveled to educate the public about her office, how elections work, and to encourage more citizens to participate in the elections process. “That’s one of the reasons that I have worked so hard with absentee elections &#8211; people didn’t trust the process or they didn’t think that absentee ballots were counted unless it was a very close election,”<a href="https://www.al.com/spotnews/2012/10/adams_faces_bahakel_in_rematch.html"> she told Al.com when running for re-election in 2012.</a> “If you put character and integrity into a situation like that, you get people to trust you and trust your way of doing things.” Jefferson County Tax Assessor Gaynell Hendricks praised Adams, a friend and colleague, as a stalwart who remained committed to her official duties and to her community. “Anne-Marie Adams was the epitome of a true and dedicated public servant,” Hendricks told AL.com. “The breadth and depth of her knowledge about the court system are unsurpassed. We could always depend on Anne-Marie to keep us informed on voting laws. She loved her position as county clerk. She will be missed.”</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: Rep Gary Palmer (R-AL06) reintroduced the<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/117/hr8223"> Citizen Ballot Protection Act</a> to promote election security. The legislation would allow states to require<a href="https://altoday.com/archives/52284-gary-palmer-introduces-bill-to-allow-states-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-for-voter-registration"> proof of citizenship</a> for voters by amending the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). Cosponsors of the Citizen Ballot Protection Act include Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-North Carolina), Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Georgia), Rep. Randy K. Weber (R-Texas), Rep. Clay Higgins (R-Louisiana), Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-South Carolina), Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), Rep. Mike Bost (R-Illinois), and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona). Palmer previously introduced this legislation in 2022. “Restoring faith in the ability to conduct free and fair elections in this country begins with cleaning up voter rolls and requiring proof of citizenship to prevent illegally cast ballots from swaying elections,” said Rep. Palmer. “I introduced the Citizen Ballot Protection Act because Americans deserve to know their elections are secure. It is common sense that states should be able to require proof of citizenship to ensure only citizens are voting in their elections. Unfortunately, a 2013 Supreme Court ruling prevents states from requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. This bill will fix the problem by amending the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to give states the ability to verify the citizenship status of their voters when they register.”</p>

There are more than 111,500 registered voters in Shasta County. Authored by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Democrat, AB 969 was a response to Shasta County&#8217;s decision in late January to ditch Dominion voting machines. The amended version of the bill is scheduled to be heard in the Senate’s Governance and Finance Committee on— a week after the Senate’s Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee passed the bill by a 6-1 vote on June 20. The bill is an emergency statute, so it would take effect immediately upon Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature. “I would say the bill was crafted to defend the voters in Shasta County and make sure they are not disenfranchised,” Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen said.</p>

That’s after lawmakers sent a<a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/politics-government/2023-06-27/election-bills-clear-legislature"> series of bills</a> to the governor Tuesday. One remains behind for the Senate to give a final OK to changes the House of Representatives made. The bills spell out what the new changes mandated by the amendment, like a nine-day early voting period, would look like in practice. The legislation would allow communities to open that period for longer, up to 29 days before an election, if they choose. The package would also expand absentee ballot pre-processing, implement a permanent absentee voter list, and give voters a chance to fix problems with a signature on their absentee ballot.</p>

As originally introduced,<a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1022&amp;inflect=2"> Senate Bill 70</a> would have allowed the secretary of state to create an “Election Information Portal” to let residents register to vote online when they move to a new town. The portal would also allow voters to request absentee ballots and update their name and address information within the voter file. Under current law, residents must go to their town offices in person or send a request by mail. But after the Senate passed that version by voice vote in February, the House added an unrelated amendment to the bill that would have allowed the secretary of state to give some of its federal grant money to towns to help them replace aging voting machines. But during “committee of conference” negotiations, Senate Republicans opposed that amendment. Negotiators were unable to find consensus. Committee of conference reports must be unanimous in order to advance; with a 6 to 1 vote, the compromise attempt failed.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4331" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nj-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nj-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nj-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nj-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />New Jersey:</strong> The Senate approved an overhaul of New Jersey’s<a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/new-rules-for-election-results-reporting-land-on-governor-murphys-desk/"> election reporting rules </a>, sending to Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk a bill that would end the patchwork of reporting regimes that exists across the state’s 21 counties.<a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A5176"> The bill</a>, which won bipartisan support in both chambers, would require county clerks to post election results online by 11:59 p.m. on the date of any primary or general election and continue to post them by 9 p.m. daily until all ballots are counted. The bill would require clerks, in cooperation with county elections boards, to disclose information on the number of voting machines used — whether they were used for early voting or on Election Day — as well as how many machine votes have and have not been tallied. They would also be required to report the number of mail-in ballots that have been received or counted and how many are still waiting to be processed. “This bill will ensure clarity, eliminate confusion about results, and serve to counteract misinformation that circulates on social media and elsewhere,” said Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex), the bill’s Senate sponsor. The Senate approved the bill in a 34-1 vote.</p>

Joe Lombardo signed AB192, a bill that will<a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2023/06/22/gov-lombardo-signs-bill-standardizing-nevada-mail-in-ballot-design/"> standardize the design of mail ballot return envelopes</a> across the state, revise the definition of electioneering, and require electioneering signs at polling locations to be placed so that they are clearly noticeable to election workers, voters, and electioneerers. “We extend our appreciation to Assemblywoman González for sponsoring AB192, as well as the  Secretary of State’s office for co-championing this legislation. Through our efforts to protect elections over time, we have observed recurring issues,” said Emily Persaud-Zamora, Executive Director of Silver State Voices on behalf of the Let Nevadans Vote coalition.  “This step is advantageous for the counties, especially rural ones that may have less purchasing power compared to more populated counties, given the current paper shortage,” she added. “Moreover, requiring the enhanced visibility and larger printing of electioneering signs benefits both election workers and voters. We express our gratitude to our Nevada legislators for passing this bill, and we thank Governor Lombardo for signing it into law.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3852" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ohio:</strong> Lawmakers have filed two measures that would<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/06/28/ohio-republicans-propose-two-measures-to-close-primary-elections-ahead-of-2024-presidential-race/"> establish a closed primary system</a>. The change would mean only voters who previously declared a party affiliation would be allowed to vote in partisan primary elections. Unaffiliated voters make up the vast majority of the electorate according to the latest Secretary of State data. Ohio’s voter database currently shows 1.3 million registered Republicans, 1 million registered Democrats, and 5.7 million unaffiliated. Unaffiliated voters would not be able to choose when voting to cast a partisan primary ballot under the proposed changes. One bill requires voters to declare their party 30 days ahead of an election, while the other would require it by Dec. 31 of the prior year.</p>

The bill would remove municipal elections from the language of the state’s election code as it applies to<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2023/06/house-committee-clears-bill-that-would-nix-constitutional-questions-in-off-year-elections.html"> constitutional amendment referenda</a>; the result, according to committee Executive Director Nick Himebaugh, would be that constitutional ballot questions could only appear in November elections of even years. Proposed changes to the state constitution must be passed by the legislature twice, in separate sessions, before they appear on the ballot at the next election that occurs at least three months after the second passage. “The constitutional amendment process really should not be taken lightly,” said Rep. Ben Sanchez, D-Montgomery, the bill’s prime sponsor, and “should seek to maximize voter participation and should not be done by a handful of voters.”</p>

Diaz, a<a href="https://www.sierrasun.com/news/nevada-county-to-release-election-documents-following-court-ruling/"> public records act case</a> concerning election records from the 2020 Presidential election. The court ordered the Clerk-Recorder’s Office to provide Young with election records she had requested, including over 26,000 pages that will require significant redaction of sensitive information in order not to compromise election security and voter privacy. Prior to the ruling, there was no court precedent concerning the records at issue, nor were there laws that provided clear direction.  Following Young’s original requests in 2021 and 2022, the Clerk-Recorder’s Office consulted with the Secretary of State, California’s top election official. The Secretary of State informed the Clerk-Recorder’s Office, in writing, that providing some of the records at issue “could potentially present a security risk and should not be made public.” The Secretary of State also filed a declaration with the Court reiterating its position that “these records must remain sealed and protected from disclosure.” The Clerk-Recorder’s Office, in consultation with County Counsel, followed the Secretary of State’s advice.  Contrary to that advice, the Superior Court has now concluded that the Clerk-Recorder’s Office can provide two of the requested records without violating the law or compromising election security.</p>

Voter registration groups that primarily serve Hispanic and Latino communities are the main plaintiffs in Hispanic Federation v. Byrd. They claim the new law —<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7050"> SB 7050</a> — will significantly reduce the number of voters they’re able to register. They&#8217;re seeking a preliminary injunction to block the law from taking effect on July 1.  U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee will heard arguments in the case on Wednesday.  The case focuses on a specific provision of the law that prevents immigrants from getting involved in the political process. Under the new law, voter registration groups could face $50,000 in fines for every noncitizen volunteer who &#8220;handles&#8221; or &#8220;collects&#8221; voter registration forms. Plaintiffs argue that violates the 1st and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, along with federal civil rights statutes.  The new elections law will also shorten the number of days that voter registration groups have to return completed applications to elections offices from 14 to 10. It will also increase fines for each late application by 50 times as much. Groups could accrue up to $250,000 in fines over the course of a year.  Nearly 2,000 active voter registration groups are listed in the state Division of Elections&#8217; online database. They’re typically advocacy organizations, churches and social clubs that help minority and low-income voters and seniors.</p>

J.B. Pritzker. nderson dismissed the case March 30 and approved the $35,000 in sanctions. “It’ll be a deterrent so that these fake election lawsuits don’t get filed,” said Burt Odelson, Staley Ferry’s attorney. Odelson filed a motion in April for Rule 137 sanctions against Fritz and her attorney, David Shestokas. Odelson petitioned for $40,047.25 in fees and costs for the case through April 10, but Anderson adjusted the fee to $35,000.</p>

To settle some of the debate around state elections, justices will hear arguments about whether Kansans’ right to vote is undermined by state law restricting the number of advance ballots a person can deliver to an election office. The arguments will also challenge state law requiring election volunteers to verify signatures on advance ballots. The plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Kansas Supreme Court for an injunction on these provisions while the appeals process is ongoing. The Kansas Court of Appeals issued a March opinion that the case should go back to District Court, reversing the decision of a Shawnee County judge, who dismissed the voting-access lawsuit. The court opinion indicated the plaintiffs had ground to sue.  Among other restrictions laid out in<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/measures/hb2332/"> House Bill 2332</a> and<a href="http://kslegislature.com/li/b2021_22/measures/hb2183/"> House Bill 2183</a>: Election officials must evaluate advance ballots by matching signatures on file with the county with signatures on ballot envelopes, and one person cannot deliver more than 10 advance voting ballots on behalf of other voters. The law also created new penalties for touching somebody else’s ballot, distributing ballots or altering the postmark on an advanced ballot. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed both bills, but was overridden.</p>

The lawsuit was originally filed in 2018 against then-Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican, and claimed Kentucky&#8217;s re-enfranchisement protocol for felons – involving a decision by the governor alone – violated the First Amendment because it gave the governor &#8220;unfettered discretion&#8221; over a criminal&#8217;s voting rights. Beshear took office shortly thereafter and signed an executive order to restore voting rights to all in-state, nonviolent felons who completed their sentences and paid off any fines. U.S. District Judge Karen Caldwell, an appointee of George W. Bush,<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6th-c-ky-voting-rights-dc-opinion.pdf"> dismissed</a> the case in August 2020 and ruled Beshear&#8217;s executive order provided the &#8220;non-arbitrary criteria&#8221; for reinstatement of voting rights the plaintiffs sought and, therefore, mooted the case.  The convicts, some of which were not covered by Beshear&#8217;s order because of out-of-state convictions, appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which determined their claims were not mooted. &#8220;The U.S. Supreme Court has &#8230; repeatedly underscored that a plaintiff challenging such an arbitrary licensing system on unfettered discretion grounds is not required to first apply for and be denied a license to engage in that constitutionally protected conduct before filing suit,&#8221; they said. Caldwell erred when she considered the relief granted by the governor a &#8220;partial pardon,&#8221; according to the plaintiffs, who urged the appeals court to render its own decision on the merits.</p>

While the panel ruled that others involved in the case will also have to pay for filing frivolous claims of election fraud, it ruled that a pair of lawyers won&#8217;t pay a dime. The panel found that the attorneys sanctioned failed to investigate their own claims before filing them, apparently never read the Michigan election law they accused election workers and voters of violating and filed exhibits that undermined their own allegations about Dominion voting machines. Under the decision, Powell and six lawyers involved collectively owe $132,810.62 to the City of Detroit for having to defend itself against the conspiracy-ridden lawsuit that contained wild allegations related to voting machines and voter turnout.</p>

At issue is Local Law 11, which is known by advocates as “Our City, Our Vote” and would allow non-U.S. citizens who have work permits or are legal permanent residents or green card holders to vote in elections for city offices. That includes the elections for the City Council or for the offices of borough president, city comptroller, public advocate and mayor. The law passed the City Council in December 2021, and was enacted in 2022. The very next day, a group of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit in state court in Richmond County calling the law unconstitutional. In that case, Justice Ralph Porzio sided with the plaintiffs, ruling that the city’s law violated the language of the state constitution, which refers to voting rights in the context of “citizens.” A panel of four judges from the Appellate Division&#8217;s second department heard arguments for more than an hour from attorneys on both sides of the lower court’s decision. Their ruling in the case is not expected until fall. Attorney MacKenzie Fillow, who appeared on behalf of the city, said the Appellate Division should reverse the lower court’s decision because the plaintiffs did not meet their “heavy burden” of proving the law was unconstitutional. She said the state constitution does not prevent the city from setting rules that govern its local elections.</p>

The Delaware County Democrats are violating the law in a blatant power grab by trying to remove this right.” The GOP believes Democrats are laying plans to reject all GOP nominees for the minority seat on the board, which is filled through the end of this year. The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee are backing the county GOP.</p>
<p>A state court rejected the latest Republican effort to throw out the presidential battleground state&#8217;s broad<a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2023-06-27/pennsylvania-act-77-mail-in-voting-upheld"> mail-in voting law</a> that has become a GOP target following former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims about election fraud. It is the latest of several refusals by a state court to invalidate Pennsylvania&#8217;s 2019 mail-in voting law, enacted barely months before the COVID-19 pandemic began and Trump began attacking mail-in voting. In the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-pennsylvania-lawsuits-donald-trump-82f4cc646346ee09316af4ef8738af67"> lawsuit</a> filed last year, 14 current and former Republican state lawmakers said the court must invalidate the law because two earlier court decisions triggered a provision written that says the law is “void” if any of its requirements are struck down in court. The law has a requirement that voters must hand-write a date on the outer envelope of their mail-in ballot in order for the ballot to be counted. The Republicans argued that the two earlier court decisions refused to enforce the hand-written date requirement — meaning the law should be thrown out. But the Commonwealth Court, in a 24-page opinion, unanimously found that the court decisions did not invalidate “the dating provision” of the law. It dismissed the lawsuit, in favor of Gov. Josh Shapiro&#8217;s administration and the national and state Democratic parties.</p>

The lawsuit was filed in May after members of the Sumner County Commission<a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/06/28/judge-rules-sumner-county-election-commission-suit-against-county-commission-can-proceed/"> sought to evict election officials</a> from their offices and warehouse space used to store voting machines — potentially leaving machines unsecured and out of easy reach of election officials who need ready access to them. The eviction plans came as election officials were expecting a shipment of next-generation voting machines requiring larger, secure storage and just as they were preparing for upcoming elections. The lawsuit suggested county officials’ efforts “threaten the integrity of the 2024 election before a single vote has been cast.” In denying the county commission and mayor’s motion to dismiss the case, Chancery Court Judge Louis Oliver III also admonished their attorney over the county commission’s public efforts to embarrass Lori Atchley, the elections administrator, while she is a litigant in a case against them. A temporary order barring the election commission’s eviction, issued by the judge in May, remains in place while the case continues, Lee said.</p>

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Virginia, voting rights advocacy group Protect Democracy and law firm WilmerHale filed the lawsuit against Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) as well as other state officials. The lawsuit alleges that the state violated a 150-year-old law that established the rules of Virginia’s readmission into the Union after the Civil War ended. The coalition is representing three individuals — Melvin Wingate, Tati Abu King and Toni Heath Johnson — as well as Bridging the Gap, an organization that offers aid to formerly incarcerated people. According to the lawsuit, Virginia is one of three states whose constitutions automatically disenfranchise all felons unless the governor restores their right to vote, for which felons in Virginia must individually petition the governor. At the center of the lawsuit is the Virginia Readmission Act, which prohibited Virginia’s constitution from being “amended or changed to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the right to vote, except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law,” according to the ACLU. Those felonies at the time included crimes of murder, arson, burglary and rape. The law was amended a few years later that would disenfranchise people for an expanded list of crimes, which the plaintiffs say violated the Virginia Readmission Act.</p>
