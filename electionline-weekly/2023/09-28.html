														<p><strong>New tool helps elections officials provide trusted information</strong><br />
<em>VoterCast makes the process of communicating with voters more clear and more efficient</em></p>
<p>Providing trusted information to voters is a core responsibility of election officials.</p>
<p>In recent years, it’s become even more important, as a shifting voting and media landscape causes voters to struggle to access verifiable election information. Yet communicating with voters can be confusing, time consuming, and resource-intensive for election officials, leading some to feel as though they’re not conducting sufficient outreach or in the “right” way.</p>
<p>At<a href="https://www.ideas42.org/"> ideas42</a>, we obsess over the root of challenges like these and then design solutions to address them. We’ve seen firsthand how more and better information can build trust in our democracy and deepen civic participation. To that end, we’ve conducted dozens of experiments with election officials to test and refine voter communications that inspire engagement. Now we’ve built a tool called VoterCast to scale those findings so that all election officials can efficiently and effectively communicate with voters.</p>
<p>VoterCast makes the process of communicating with voters more clear and more efficient, so that voters have the information they need to cast their vote with confidence.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="VoterCast" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_G1OLY9JLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Delivering Effective Voter Outreach Materials, Tailored to Every Jurisdiction </strong><br />
<a href="http://www.votercast.com/">VoterCast</a> provides election officials research-backed outreach materials on the subjects they most need to communicate to voters. The content offered through VoterCast is based on evidence from a wealth of research in effective communication and voter outreach. All the materials are professionally designed to be simple, clear and effective at communicating relevant election information to voters. And for election officials, every piece of content they access through VoterCast is automatically tailored to the specifics of their jurisdiction and the elections they have coming up. With just a few clicks, election officials have access to professional voter outreach materials, customized to meet their needs.</p>
<p>VoterCast enables election officials to select from a range of topics, ranging from upcoming election notifications to registration deadline alerts and poll worker recruitment messages. If election officials don’t see a topic they’re looking for, they have an opportunity to create custom materials directly within VoterCast. Once users select a topic, they can choose from a range of outreach channels, including email, text message, social media content, posters, flyers, and newspaper advertisements. Then they’re able to edit and immediately export professional materials for digital or print distribution. VoterCast takes the hassles and guesswork out of producing effective and clear voter education materials.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Voter Outreach</strong><br />
For those of us involved in the world of election administration, a voter’s decision to cast a ballot or not can be mystifying. The personal combines with the situational and the systemic. Everything from<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00565.x"> rain</a> to the<a href="https://votingrightslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Polling-Place-Consolidation-Negative-Impacts-on-Turnout-and-Equity.pdf"> number of polling locations</a> and<a href="https://www.ideas42.org/blog/overcoming-barriers-to-voting-local"> knowledge of the candidates</a> can impact voter turnout. This fact can easily dissuade election officials from pouring a lot of energy into outreach. Does it even matter?</p>
<p>The answer is a resounding yes. A growing body of research suggests that access to reliable, trustworthy information about elections is highly connected to voting. People who lack voting and registration information can be up to<a href="https://youngamericans.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hill_BIFYA_Working_Paper_08_08_2020.pdf"> 57 percent</a> less likely to vote. When they have direct access to civic information – like information directly from election officials – they feel<a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/what-helps-youth-vote-direct-civic-information-and-political-homes"> significantly more confident voting</a>. While official outreach to voters cannot solve every challenge, it can have a meaningful impact on making voters feel more prepared and confident casting their ballot.</p>
<p>With VoterCast, we hope to demystify the process of communicating with voters by giving all local election officials the tools they need to conduct outreach effectively and efficiently. To sign up, local election officials can visit<a href="http://www.votercast.com"> www.VoterCast.com</a>.</p>

Issue One found that half of the 76 million Americans who live in the western United States have a new chief local election official since the 2020 presidential election. In this 11-state region — which includes two major presidential battleground states as well as a mix of Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states and where elections are typically administered at the county level by a single official — more than 160 chief local election officials have left their positions since November 2020. This represents roughly 40% of the total chief local election officials in the region. These officials took with them more than 1,800 years of combined experience. “These turnover rates signify a crisis in our democracy. The health and vibrancy of election administrators are essential to ensuring free and fair elections in our country,” said Issue One Founder and CEO Nick Penniman<a href="https://issueone.org/press/new-report-from-issue-one-highlights-the-high-cost-of-high-election-official-turnover/"> in response</a> to these findings. The costs of this exodus are real — especially in terms of psychological duress, lost institutional knowledge, and the financial impacts of recruiting, hiring, and training new people to fill these critical positions. Congress can help remedy this crisis by providing more funding and protections to these dedicated public servants.</p>

According to the report, local election offices across the country are struggling to manage<a href="https://arizona.votebeat.org/2023/9/15/23874134/celia-nabor-maricopa-county-arizona-election-fraud-signature-verification-public-records"> a sharp rise</a> in the number of public records requests, and extensive requests coming from Local Labs in at least five states have stymied election officials, according to a Votebeat review of hundreds of records requests, as well as interviews. The requests are broad and unclear, and the purpose for obtaining the records is often not fully explained, leaving officials wondering in some cases whether they can legally release the records. Local Labs CEO Brian Timpone told Votebeat the company is using records requests in an attempt to expose election fraud that he is sure exists. The company is sometimes getting paid by GOP-backed clients to do so, Timpone acknowledged, characterizing the work simultaneously as both political research and journalism.  “We’re just trying to push for more free speech and more transparency,” Timpone said. “And no one else is doing it.” Local Labs is known for a massive network of websites that rely mainly on aggregation and automation, blasting out conservative-leaning hyper-local news.</p>

Officials from 25 counties scheduled a series of news conferences Tuesday in Tazewell, McLean and LaSalle counties. At the Tazewell event, the election officials said accusations of vote tampering and other misinformation campaigns have proliferated in each of the last two presidential election cycles, and they fear it could get worse in 2024. “You know us. Our kids attend the same schools,” Tazewell County Clerk John Ackerman said at a news conference in Pekin. “We shop at the same supermarkets. We are actively involved in the communities we represent. You also know as election authorities we are all working together regularly for best practices and procedures.” Some of the election officials described misinformation they have encountered in recent elections, including accusations that voting machines had been rigged or that tabulation machines had been hacked, and social media rumors that certain polling places were closing early or had run out of ballots. Ackerman said anyone who has questions or concerns about voting equipment or election procedures should simply contact their local election authority. “We welcome your inquiries,” he said. “Better yet, get involved in our processes. We all need more election judges. You&#8217;re never going to hear one of us say we don’t want more election judges. Get involved in the process.”</p>

The letter describes a “breakdown in communication” between the Merchant and the district during their trustee election earlier this year, as well as more than $17,000 in additional costs for both legal costs and allowing in-person voting. The letter from the school district, signed by Superintendent Tom Moore, Board Chairman Gordon Johnson and Director of Business Operations Brian Patrick, details how the rejection of the proposal for an all mail-in ballot impacted the school district’s finances since it bears the cost of the election. “This denial not only disregarded the district’s financial obligations, but also did not follow the request of the trustees who support a mail ballot election because it is cost efficient and allows the most voters the opportunity to receive a ballot and vote in the election,” the letter said. Merchant<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/09/27/cascade-county-elections-officer-refutes-claims-from-school-district/"> refuted claims</a> of poor communication and other alleged shortcomings by her office made in the letter. Merchant told the Daily Montanan in an email that having elections managed by the commission would not be necessary or positive. Merchant disputed claims of a lack of communication between her office and the school district, saying she and her office sent emails, made phone calls and attended in-person meetings. She also said the cost of the election was on par with past elections, and some irregularities from Election Day were the district’s fault.</p>

He was 72. Druckenmiller was first elected to office in 1986. HE was serving his 10th term in office. Druckenmiller was the second longest serving elected official in Linn County history. Druckenmiller began working in the Assessor’s Office in 1979 and four years later went to work under Linn County Clerk Del Riley. In 1986 he succeeded his mentor and was elected Linn County Clerk. He oversaw 141 vote-by-mail elections, the most in the United States, plus 28 poll elections. In 1982, he was appointed Linn County Commissioner, completing the term of an outgoing commissioner. He also served on the board of the Linn County Housing Authority. In 2006, he was elected president of the Oregon State Clerks Association. “Steve loved the people of Linn County and was deeply honored that they entrusted him to conduct elections all of these years,” said Roger Nyquist, chairman of the Linn County Board of Commissioners. “It was a job he did flawlessly. Steve became the wise and reasonable person in the courthouse sought out by many for advice. I feel privileged to have been his friend and I miss him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.” Druckenmiller greatly admired his mentor Del Riley who pioneered Oregon’s vote-by-mail election system. Like Riley, Druckenmiller was a strong proponent of vote-by-mail. He also spearheaded the county program by which people can register to vote when they get or renew their driver’s license. He said at the time, “We think this is a very good idea. It will make registration more accessible to everyone. If people register online, we won’t have the problems associated with trying to decipher someone’s handwriting. If we can’t read their registration, we have to spend time tracking them down to make changes.” Druckenmiller was always willing to give anyone with questions about the vote-by-mail system a personal tour through the Clerk’s Office and explain how the system works, point-by-point. He was proud of his staff and of the temporary election workers who came back year-after-year as a team. “He was a fair and honorable man with a lot of kindness and love for the people of Linn County,” said Chief Deputy Clark Marcie Richey.</p>

Council member Julie Winter sees the letter as a way for Redding to work with the county to come up with a more cost-efficient voting system that won’t burden the general fund as much, thus hurting the city’s ability to fund public safety. Redding Mayor Michael Dacquisto and Vice Mayor Mark Mezzano think the correspondence is a waste of time. While discussing the merits of the letter, Dacquisto made it clear that he opposes the letter and as the mayor will not sign it. The letter states that Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen’s cost estimates to do a hand count would increase Redding’s costs from $46,630 to $176,645 per election. “In light of our shared commitment to public safety, we earnestly request that our organizations work together to find an industry-standard voting system that is affordable to all agencies. If the County ultimately chooses a voting system that is substantially more expensive than a more traditional system, we request that the County pay the difference beyond our current pricing structure,” the letter says.</p>

The measure passed in the state House of Representatives by 136-2 and was approved by the Senate 35-0. Republicans also called for banning the outdoor ballot boxes permanently, saying they are no longer needed because the COVID-19 pandemic has ended. In addition, they want to essentially double the penalties for election law violations to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine — up from the current maximum of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. They also want a mandatory minimum of one year in prison for the Class D felony because some campaign operatives have been convicted of various actions and have not served prison time. The Legislature also voted to<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/election-security-dominates-discussion-during-legislative-special-session/3112200/"> change Connecticut’s Presidential Primary</a> date, moving the date of the primary from the end of April to the first week in April.</p>

That would include 18-year-olds who are issued a driver’s license or official state ID, people who apply for Medicaid, or people who have some other contact with the state that also proves their eligibility. The package would also allow for people and organizations to pay for buses, taxis or other transportation to the polls. There’s a question as to whether hiring transportation to take people to the polls amounts to offering voters something of value. This would eliminate that uncertainty.</p>

The state legislature tried to end that exclusion decades ago, putting constitutional amendments on the ballot in<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_Repeal_Mentally_Ill_Under_Guardianship_Voting_Limitation,_Question_5_(1997)"> 1997</a> and<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_Allow_Persons_with_Mental_Illness_to_Vote,_Question_5_(2000)"> 2000</a>, but voters rejected the changes both times. A non-profit organization tasked by the state with protecting disabled residents eventually sued, arguing that the prohibition disenfranchised residents in violation of the U.S. Constitution. This led to a favorable federal court ruling in 2001 that declared Maine’s exclusion unconstitutional. “We are creating a subset of mentally ill people under guardians who can’t vote,” Democratic State Senator Craig Hickman, who spearheaded the effort to put the matter to the vote, told Bolts. Hickman, a voting rights advocate, has also been involved in other measures to remove outdated language from Maine’s constitution. “I think it’s important to ratify this amendment. [We need to] make it clear that in this state we have no reason to disenfranchise.”</p>

The vote came around 12:30am Wednesday morning, six hours after the meeting began. During the three-plus hours of public comment, many residents also spoke in support of the plan. Two weeks ago, the Board of Commissioners delayed the vote after Chairman Joe Moss said he had a number of questions about the plan that he wanted to square up before a vote. An amendment to the Early Voting Plan, includes a couple of minor changes and clarifications to the language, plus three other additions to the early voting process. The first, is the addition of at least one security camera at each early voting site. The camera(s) would be installed in the secure rooms where election equipment and materials are kept. The second, is a live line-management tool on the County&#8217;s website, so that voters will know projected wait times at each early voting center.  The third, is that early voting centers will use watermarked ballots, something that was discussed at length during the previous meeting. The original Early Voting Agreement also includes plans for four early voting sites, funding for one full time Elections Logistics Specialist, and funding for one temporary Elections Logistics Assistant. The total cost for the original plan is $769,094.</p>

Walczyk (R-Watertown) has introduced a bill that would make<a href="https://www.thedailynewsonline.com/top_story/walczyk-introduces-bill-to-increase-penalties-for-those-who-pretend-to-be-elections-staff/article_84d3c5b9-c773-5f49-8f47-260a920591ab.html"> criminal penalties harsher for people who pretend to be election workers</a> and approach voters with claims of potential fraud. Reports of people falsely claiming to be local Board of Elections workers have come from Onondaga and Steuben Counties, prompting local officials in those areas to warn residents. Walczyk is the senior Republican on the state Senate Elections Committee, and said he is especially troubled by these recent reports. His legislation, Senate Bill 7661, would establish the crime of impersonating a Board of Elections worker or commissioner, by adding those titles to the list of titles included in the crime of criminal impersonation in the first degree, a class E felony. Introduced on Sept. 20, the bill would amend the current law which applies to police and federal law enforcement, and would go into effect on the first of November after being enacted. “Regardless of one’s political affiliation, intimidation of this kind cannot be tolerated,” Walczyk said. “In a time when faith in our electoral system is diminished, these impostors actively undermine voter confidence.”</p>

With the Senate recording a party-line vote to accept a consensus GOP measure after the House completed a similar vote late Sept. 21, <a href="https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewBillDocument/2023/7324/0/S749-PCCS15387-ST-2">the bill</a> now heads to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Cooper has promised to veto it, saying it&#8217;s a GOP power play that would result in stalemates on the proposed new board, potentially limiting access to early in-person voting and giving more opportunity to the General Assembly and courts to settle contested elections. The changes would begin Jan. 1 — sooner than a July 1 start that was contained in a version of the measure approved by the House. But Senate Republicans balked at having the changes start next summer. Under the bill, the House speaker, the Senate leader and the minority party leaders in each chamber each would pick two seats on the proposed eight-member election board — likely giving Democrats and Republicans four positions apiece. The current board appointment process, in which the governor chooses the five members, usually gives the governor&#8217;s party a 3-2 majority. The same 3-2 split also happens on county boards, which under the bill also would now be reduced to four seats, with legislative leaders each naming one appointee. The approved bill says if the new state board can&#8217;t choose an executive director by Jan. 10, then Berger would choose.</p>

While clerks would not be able to count absentee ballots until after the polls close under the &#8220;Monday processing bill,&#8221; they could perform tasks such as ensuring the voter is not ineligible due to a felony conviction, checking that the envelope contains information like a witness signature and taking the ballot out of the envelope to run it through voting equipment. Under current law, clerks cannot begin counting absentee ballots before 7 a.m. on Election Day. In past elections, particularly in Milwaukee, the counting of those ballots has stretched late into the night or early morning and leading sometimes to a late change in who prevailed in a hotly contested statewide race. The bill would require clerks to report the total number of absentee ballots at three points on Monday and Tuesday. In an Assembly informational hearing last week, county and municipal clerks said beginning to process absentee ballots earlier was one of their top priorities. A presentation from the National Conference of State Legislatures showed Wisconsin as one of only a handful of states that do not allow clerks to begin processing before Election Day.</p>

In June, the court ruled that Alabama&#8217;s Republican-drawn congressional map violated the Voting Rights Act because, in a state with seven congressional districts and a 27% Black population, the GOP-dominated legislature had created just one congressional district in which Black voters are either a majority or close to it. The court&#8217;s 5-to-4 decision upheld a unanimous decision by a three-judge lower court panel that included two Trump appointees; the lower court had required the creation of a second majority Black congressional district, and the Supreme Court agreed. But when the case was returned to the state legislature with orders to create a second majority Black district, the GOP lawmakers didn&#8217;t do that. Instead they upped the number of Black voters from 30% to 40% in one of the districts. The justices refused to delay the lower court&#8217;s drawing of a new map with two majority, or near-majority, Black districts. In an unsigned order, the court said: &#8220;The application for stay presented to Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court is denied.&#8221; No rationale was presented and there were no noted dissents. The Supreme Court&#8217;s action was a further repudiation of Alabama&#8217;s tactics, and served as a reminder that the Voting Rights Act, once viewed by the court&#8217;s conservatives as no longer necessary, continues to provide a limited but crucial guardrail against deliberate dilution of black voting strength.</p>

Former gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and her lawyer sued the county earlier this year to get access to the about 1.3 million envelopes and voter signatures on them, which they want to analyze in Lake&#8217;s ongoing effort to cast doubt on her election defeat. She lost to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs in November by less than one percentage point. The crux of the trial was a public records issue, but the climate around elections also played a central role. While Arizona Public Records Law presumes all government records are subject to public review — giving residents and the media a method to oversee the actions of government and their elected leaders — it also includes exceptions. Hannah will decide whether Recorder Stephen Richer was legally justified when his office declined Lake’s request, citing two of those exceptions. The county cites a portion of state law that makes voter signatures available only to certain individuals, like news reporters or election workers and others. The county&#8217;s attorneys also argued it is in the best interest of the state to withhold the records, because of what can be a hostile climate around elections.</p>

The campaign for John Gomes for Mayor filed a lawsuit claiming the votes in the primary were not counted correctly. He is calling for Judge William Clark to overturn the results of the primary, which showed Mayor Joe Ganim ahead by 251 votes, and to order a new primary be held. The suit is on the clock to issue a ruling before the general election which is set for Nov. 7. However, even if a ruling doesn’t come until after the general election, Atty. William Bloss, who represents Gomes, says the judge can still order a new primary to take place after a general election, which would then be followed by a second general election. The State Elections Enforcement Commission, which is already conducting its own investigation into the Bridgeport primary, worked through the weekend to copy and scan more than 10,000 absentee ballot applications and other related documents to hand over to all the parties of the lawsuit. The SEEC said in a filing however, that they still need more time to copy the inner and outer ballot envelopes. It’s a slower process because they need to avoid damaging them and are trying to preserve forensic evidence associated with them. In addition to the documents, the Gomes campaign has demanded the City of Bridgeport turn over surveillance video from all four of Bridgeport’s absentee ballot drop boxes between Aug 22nd and Sept. 12. It’s a daunting task involving 8-terabytes of digital storage and more than 2,000 hours of footage.</p>

The decision effectively let stand an April ruling by a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit that sided with the state on major issues in the case. The panel overturned much of a 2022 decision by Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who said the law was passed with discriminatory intent. The law included imposing new restrictions on mail-in ballot drop boxes and voter-registration groups and prohibiting people from giving snacks and drinks to voters waiting in line to cast ballots. Walker blocked those parts of the law, but the appellate panel overturned his decisions on the mail-in voting and voter-registration issues. The Atlanta-based appeals court rejected a request from voting-rights groups to rehear the case “en banc” — which would have meant the full court would have taken it up. “What are the supposedly racist provisions that the district judge enjoined officials from enforcing?” Chief Judge William Pryor wrote in an explanation of the decision Thursday. “They are unremarkable, race-neutral policies designed to bolster election security, maintain order at the polls and ensure that voter-registration forms are delivered on time.” But Judge Charles Wilson wrote that the panel decision “impermissibly increases the difficulty for civil rights plaintiffs seeking the protections guaranteed to them by our Constitution.” He said the full court should rehear the issues.</p>

Right to Democracy seeks to advance democracy and self-determination in U.S. territories. In a brief filed on Sept. 20, plaintiffs ask the court to reject arguments from the U.S. Justice Department that voting is not a “fundamental right” for residents of U.S. territories who could vote for president by absentee ballot in their former state of residence if they lived in any foreign country or the Northern Mariana Islands but cannot because they live in Guam or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Going further, the Justice Department argues that even assuming these discriminatory laws are unconstitutional, the federal government cannot be sued because Hawaii remains free to “fix” any injury caused by federal discrimination, the statement said. It added that the Justice Department also argues that the proper remedy for any unconstitutional discrimination would be to deny overseas voting rights in the NMI rather than extend them equally to all former state residents who lose their right to vote simply by moving overseas.</p>

A three-judge panel heard statements and asked a few questions of the appealing attorney, the county’s attorney and an attorney for the intervening Secretary of State’s in a case involving public records and the use of modems to transmit county election results to the state. The appellate judges now have 90 days to issue a ruling whether the dismissed case should be revived. Matt Benda, an attorney from Albert Lea, and Kathleen Hagen, a former county election judge from Lonsdale, sued Denise Anderson last year claiming the county didn’t fulfill their public records requests. Anne Goering, attorney representing the county, said the disputed records “do not exist.” Benda expanded the scope of the lawsuit, asking a Rice County District Court judge to ban the county from using modems to send unofficial election results to the Secretary of State. District Court Judge Carol Hanks dismissed the case in January, finding that the lawsuit was filed against the wrong county official and finding that she did not have jurisdiction to decide the challenge to the use of modems. Benda is asking the Court of Appeals to overturn the dismissal.</p>

Following the May 16 primary, Delaware County’s Board of Elections decided not to accept provisional ballots cast in person by voters who had already been told their mail ballots were rejected due to technical defects. That means that these voters were twice rejected, after trying to remedy their mail ballot mistake by voting provisionally at their nearby polling places, and ultimately were disenfranchised. One provision in the state’s election codes suggests the ballots should not be counted, while a separate provision reads differently, in favor of counting such a ballot. Whelan ruled that such ballots must be counted, writing that the law must be “liberally construed” so as to “protect the elective franchise.” His ruling applies only to Delaware County.</p>
<p>Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas Judge Lesa S. Gelb upheld the Citizens Advisory of Pennsylvania’s<a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1621242/court-affirms-groups-access-to-luzerne-county-election-video-footage"> request for access to video surveillance footage</a> of official county buildings where ballots were processed and voting equipment was maintained around the time of the November 2022 general election. Gelb’s order affirmed a final determination by the Pennsylvania’s Office of Open Records that the county had appealed. Gelb ordered the county to make any necessary redactions to protect the identities of employees within 30 days, which would involve blurring faces. Within 30 days thereafter, Citizens Advisory vice president Ben Herring must arrange inspection of the records subject to access provisions under state law, it said. Herring repeatedly emphasized Monday he is not interested in seeing the faces of workers. He said he requested a viewing of the footage amid concerns about the November 2022 general election paper shortage. Herring said he wants to see if anything appears amiss, stressing he would report anything suspicious to law enforcement. Based on his understanding, the footage would cover the county-owned voter warehouse and Penn Place Building in Wilkes-Barre.

Mealer was one of 21 GOP candidates who had filed lawsuits challenging their losses. The first trial related to the lawsuits — in which a candidate blamed her defeat on ballot shortages and allegations that illegal votes were cast — took place in August. A ruling in that lawsuit is pending. Mealer had lost her bid to become Harris County judge, the county’s top elected official who deals with spending and is in charge of local emergency response. She lost by more than 18,000 votes to Lina Hidalgo, the Democratic incumbent. In a statement, Mealer said she dropped her lawsuit because the county pushed back on her efforts to get a full accounting of problems during November’s election. “My goal in filing an election contest was not to relitigate my race, but rather to make sure future races are fair to all voters and candidates,” Mealer said. Mealer’s decision came after her original attorney had withdrawn from the case because she did not agree with Mealer’s claims of ballot fraud in the election. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said Mealer “spread conspiracy theories in an attempt to overturn the will of the voters. It’s time for the other losing Republican candidates to drop their lawsuits as well.”</p>

Levine ruled that Werner didn’t follow proper procedure in raising her complaint and didn’t have standing to file the suit. The main thrust of Levin’s ruling was that Werner should’ve first filed an administrative complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission objecting to how local officials administered the election. He also found questions over a voter’s qualifications including their residence is an issue administered by the municipal clerk. Werner named the county clerk in her suit. “The decision is a victory for student voters — who are permitted to vote where they live in Wisconsin, and for Clerk Ginny Dankmeyer — who properly oversaw the recount for the sheriff’s race,” she said.</p>
