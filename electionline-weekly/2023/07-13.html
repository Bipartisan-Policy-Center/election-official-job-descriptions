							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Journal of Election Administration Research &amp; Practice</strong><b><br />
</b><em>Third issue of Journal is now available</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>This week marks the third publication of the<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/journal-of-election-administration-research-and-practice.php"> Journal of Election Administration Research &amp; Practice</a>, a bi-annual journal developed in partnership between the<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"> National Association of Election Officials</a> (The Election Center) and<a href="https://bulletin.auburn.edu/thegraduateschool/graduatedegreesoffered/publicadministrationandpublicpolicympaphd_major/electionadmin_cert/"> Auburn University Election Administration Initiative</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9913" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-230x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-230x300.png 230w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-784x1024.png 784w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-768x1003.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal.png 836w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />The Journal is designed to address the concerns of the practice, policy, research, vendor, and advocacy communities involved in the administration of elections in the US and abroad. This is a peer-reviewed praxis journal that provides greater breadth and depth to questions about the administration of election, offering a format and content that is accessible to practitioners, as well as content that informs better policy and research.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/mitchell-brown"> Mitchell Brown</a>, professor of political science at Auburn University and Election Center board member, the original idea from the journal came from “teaching” academic research about election administration in CERA classes.</p>
<p>“In those classes, we noticed a disconnect between election officials’ knowledge of academic research on their profession and between the research topics academics were interested in and those that election officials were interested in,” Brown said. “Thus the purpose of the journal, in part, is to bridge that gap by having practitioners and policy makers speak to researchers through the policy and reflection pieces, and academics speak to practitioners through the research.”</p>
<p>Although still relatively new, the idea to bridge the gap between academia and election practitioners had been percolating almost a decade before the first two issues were published in 2022.</p>
<p>“We noticed the gap, puzzled over it, and later held the first academic-researcher symposium at Auburn in 2015. Since that time, we have continued that symposium and<a href="https://esra-conference.org/"> ESRA</a> has also worked to fill this space, as have other organizations,” Brown explained. “For the journal itself, we began by talking with publishers as well as other academics who work in the area about their interest. Then we convened a research advisory committee of election officials through the Election Center and began discussing it with them. Once we had fleshed out our vision, we took this to the Election Center board of directors to ascertain their support. And everyone was interested! It took another two years to get the first issue out, and now we are working on the 4th and 5th issues.”</p>
<p>The editorial team—Brown,<a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/kathleen-hale"> Kathleen Hale</a>,<a href="https://escambiavotes.gov/about-david-stafford"> David Stafford</a>,<a href="https://www.dcboe.org/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=f88417e4-489d-45c5-8ea7-6668bc3f1b2c"> Terri Stroud</a>,<a href="http://www.ryandwilliamson.com/"> Ryan Williamson</a> and<a href="https://www.vrsystems.com/"> Jamie Remes</a> is supported by an editorial board of more than 50 members.  Members of the editorial board compromise Election Center members, other election officials, academics who study election administration, and a few other election experts. According to Brown, the editorial team recruited from people around the country and territories who were supportive of the idea of a praxis journal and whose background and experiences would be able to help us start up the journal and institutionalize it to support the field.</p>
<p>“What we are promoting is scholarship that crosses boundaries between practitioners and academics, and that also crosses boundaries across academic disciplines,” Hale said. “We are dedicated to timely scholarship, which means thoughtful peer review within weeks. That is one of the ways that we believe the Journal will deliver value to the field.”</p>
<p>The current issue of the Journal has papers on ethics, poll workers, philanthropy, election security and voters of color to name a few.  Some of the papers have responses from elections officials.</p>
<p>“We also wanted to create an opportunity for election officials to “speak back” to the researchers. Thus, we created a response section for practitioners to write about their responses to the research. These people are hand selected based on their background and interests and are invited to write (though if anyone wanted to volunteer they would be more than welcome),” Brown explained. “Our hope is that after a few years, the gap we noticed between the practice, policy, and academic communities will close.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/journal-submissions.php">Submissions</a> to the Journal are open and currently on any topic, although the editorial team is considering a special issue for later this year or early next year on a specific topic.</p>
<p>“As we become more widely known, we expect to design more special issues that pick up on the work of new organizations in the field and the many conferences and convenings that are happening,” Hale added.</p>
<p>A key driver in the vision behind the Journal  is about building the profession of election administration itself. As the field has grown, those behind the original idea of the Journal felt the need for an accessible publication that would establish a baseline for important issues, for dialogue, and for explanations that crossed the boundaries between theory and practice.</p>
<p>“We hope that the journal is a go to source for those actively engaged in the field to share findings and opinions about the issues that matter to them, and get feedback from their peers,” Hale added.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: We’ll be highlighting some of the entries to issue three of the Journal in the coming weeks of electionline Weekly).</em></p>

							<h2>A Note From Joe</h2>
														<p><strong>Future of Election Center</strong></p>
<p>By Joe Gloria, executive officer for Operations<br />
The Election Center</p>
<p>As the new leadership team with <a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">The Election Center</a>, The National Association of Election Officials, Tammy Patrick and I are both excited <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9076" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gloria-Joseph_pic-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gloria-Joseph_pic-240x300.jpg 240w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gloria-Joseph_pic.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" />at what the future can bring in opportunities for all of our members. The history of The Election Center and its leadership in the election community makes it the best organization to provide opportunities for election officials, new or experienced.  An organization created to support election officials nationwide, regardless of political affiliation, through education and networking opportunities.  We are excited to share with you what our ideas are for new programs and operations to support election officials at a time when it is becoming even more challenging for officials to stay abreast of what’s new in their profession.</p>
<p>So what direction are we heading in, for those of you who attended our February and April conferences you’ve already experienced  the change in our workshop formats.  With the support of the Board of Directors we have adopted an approach that provides for more interaction among members and they have been very receptive, even excited about the new approach.  The goal is always to provide tools for election officials that will assist in doing the challenging work they do in upholding our democracy.  Currently our focus is on working to incorporate information and training on how to strengthen state associations, for  both election officials and state offices.</p>
<p>We are currently working on next year&#8217;s workshops and hope to make arrangements for Nashville, Portland, Oregon, and Detroit, Michigan. JEOLC will still be in Washington D.C., but may move to later in the month.  Any suggestions on future training is always appreciated and we both hope you will take advantage of talking with us directly either at conference or via email at the Election Center.</p>
<p>As most of you already know we have incorporated the Electionline into our organization and are proud to have Mindy Moretti on staff to provide election news to all election officials.  Most election officials who choose to stay abreast of what is going on in the election world log on every day to see what Mindy is providing.  We will certainly be using this well known resource as an excellent method to share information about the Election Center.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7370" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-300x93.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-768x239.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center.png 882w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Also exciting is the work we are now doing in partnership with Auburn University through our new institute and our new Journal of Election Administration, Research &amp; Practice.  We are now on Volume 3 of our new journal which combines input from respected academics and election officials currently in the field of elections. We will have new volumes available for members at our national conference in Orlando.</p>
<p>We are also currently working on improving our systems to better manage our member database, which will lead to increased access to member information.  Many members have made excellent suggestions on information which will assist them in identifying similar jurisdictions within our membership. With our new system we will incorporate the collection of additional data points from our membership to make it available to them for comparison to other jurisdictions.  We are also planning for a complete redesign of our website to incorporate a fresh marketing campaign,  electionline, and provide a new improved member web portal to further automate member updates.</p>
<p>The Election Center stands ready to do its part as a leader in the elections community for providing training and networking opportunities for our election official members.  We will continuously work to increase access to our organization and its benefits, while working to collaborate with other groups whose goal is to professionalize the election industry through education and training.  Election administrators want continued education and training to improve the efficiencies of their offices, to serve their voters in the most effective way, but access is not uniformly available and we must do what we can to assist in providing those resources. We look forward to serving you all in the future and couldn’t  be more proud to represent the Election Center now and in the foreseeable future.</p>

							<h2>Accessibility Study</h2>

</strong><em>EAC releases accessibility study conducted in Partnership with Rutgers University</em></p>

<p>The researchers focused on voter accessibility in the 2022 election, comparing the results to the same post-election surveys that were conducted in 2020 and 2012. The survey covered topics such as voter turnout, difficulties voting, assistance voting, voting methods, and treatment by election officials. The researchers also analyzed 2022 voter turnout using Census data. The findings are critical for election officials who continuously work to meet the needs of their jurisdictions and make voting accessible to all eligible voters</p>

<p>Ensuring all election officials and poll workers are equipped with up-to-date guidance and resources on the best practices for assisting voters with disabilities will be critical to improving accessibility at all polling places on Election Day or early voting. Other key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>While turnout of citizens with disabilities slightly increased from 2018 midterms, they are more likely to need assistance voting and to experience difficulties during the voting process.</li>
<li>The likelihood of difficulties voting in person in 2022 was 20% among people with disabilities compared to 6% among people without disabilities. The likelihood of difficulties voting with a mail ballot was 6% among people with disabilities compared to less than 1% among people without disabilities.</li>
<li>One in five voters with a disability either needed assistance or had some difficulty in voting in 2022, which was three times the rate of voters without disabilities.</li>
<li>Of the 15.8 million citizens with disabilities who voted, 2.2 million encountered difficulties voting in 2022, which was a slight increase from 2020 when 1.95 million of the 17.7 million voters with disabilities encountered difficulties.</li>
<li>One in five voters with a disability either needed assistance or had some difficulty in voting in 2022, which was three times the rate of voters without disabilities.</li>
<li>Voting difficulties were most common among people with vision and cognitive impairments.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5810" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />People with disabilities were more likely to vote in 2022 compared to 2018, but remained less likely to vote than people without disabilities, and were more likely to vote with a mail ballot.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Voter turnout in 2022 increased by 1.6 points among citizens with disabilities relative to the 2018 midterm elections, while it decreased among citizens without disabilities by 1.6 points.</li>
<li aria-level="1">This increase helped close but did not eliminate the turnout gap between citizens with and without disabilities, which went from -4.8 points in 2018 to -1.5 points in 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>“In 2022, election offices across the country maintained the momentum seen during the 2020 elections in creating accessible elections for voters with disabilities, but our research shows that there is still work to be done. The findings from this study are crucial to the EAC’s efforts in equipping state and local election officials with the resources and guidance they need to plan for assisting voters with disabilities and making sure their polling places are fully accessible,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick.</p>
<p>“Improving the accessibility of elections for eligible voters is central to the mission of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and this study is a crucial benchmark to track our progress year-over-year and identify areas of improvement. The EAC is committed to supporting election officials as they serve voters with disabilities and use this study to develop resources, guidance, and best practices for voters,” said EAC Vice Chair Benjamin Hovland.</p>
<p>“Tracking the experiences of voters with disabilities allows us to see the significant progress in making elections more accessible. We also know that Americans with disabilities still experience voting difficulties for a variety of reasons,” said Professor Lisa Schur, Co-Director of the Rutgers Program for Disability Research. “Our latest research reveals that people with disabilities still vote at a lower rate than the people without disabilities, making it essential for election officials to invest in their programming for voters with disabilities.”</p>
<p>Through the Help America Vote Act of 2002, the EAC is tasked with maintaining a clearinghouse of election administration information. To fulfill this mission, the EAC provides best practices recommendations, training materials, and other resources for election officials. By enhancing our work with voters with disabilities and the election officials who serve them, the EAC aims to improve accessibility and to ensure an independent and private vote for all. The EAC plans to develop more resources addressing the findings of this study in the near future.</p>

Overall, the survey finds that<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-poll-voting-machines-confidence-trust-8efb007d94c2b37a510f9d866e3c6031"> fewer than half of Americans – 44% — have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of confidence that the votes in the next presidential election will be counted accurately</a>. While Democrats’ confidence in elections has risen in recent years, the opposite is true for Republicans. Ahead of the 2016 election, 32% of Republicans were highly confident votes would be counted accurately — a figure that jumped to 54% two years later after Trump won the presidency. That confidence level dropped to 28% a month before the 2020 election, as Trump signaled to voters that the voting would be rigged, and now sits at 22% less than 16 months before the next presidential election. The AP-NORC poll suggests that the persistent messaging about the validity of the 2020 has sunk in among a wide swath of the American public. The survey found that independents — a group that has consistently had low confidence in elections — were also largely skeptical about the integrity of the 2024 elections. Just 24% have the highest levels of confidence that the votes will be counted accurately. About four in 10 U.S. adults are highly confident that scanning paper ballots into a machine provides accurate counts. Democrats are about twice as confident in the process as Republicans —63% compared to 29%. That marks a notable shift from a 2018 AP-NORC poll that found just 40% of Democrats were confident compared to 53% of Republicans.</p>

The commission’s mission is to investigate and report on issues related to civil rights, and to make non-binding recommendations. A new report recently finalized by the committee found that<a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/07/10/civil-rights-committee-finds-native-voting-rights-impeded-finalizes-recommendations/"> Native Americans living on tribal land</a> — specifically in South Dakota — face many barriers to voting rights. “There have been 25 voting rights cases in South Dakota with American Indian plaintiffs, the second largest number of cases in the country,” the committee’s policy brief says. “In nearly all, the American Indian plaintiffs either won or successfully settled.” The final report, “Voting Rights and Access in South Dakota,” lists recommendations including funding voter transportation and mobile polling locations on reservations, designating Indian Health Service locations as places people can register to vote, educating voters that they do not need identification to register to vote, and encouraging ballot drop boxes on reservations. The non-binding report of findings and recommendations will now be sent to federal, state and local officials. Charles Abourezk is an advisory committee member, as well as chief judge of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Court and chief justice of the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Supreme Court. He said the implementation of the recommendations would improve Native American voter participation and trust in the state’s election process. Committee Chair Travis Letellier is an economist. He said the diversity of viewpoints and experiences on the committee made the work challenging but also gave the report more authority. “Every person on that committee is there for a reason,” Letellier said. “They had something to add, whether it’s their personal voice or their professional voice.”</p>

Ulster County, as you may recall, is the home of the infamous “I Voted” crazy spider sticker that gained national attention in 2022. Although the<a href="https://elections.ulstercountyny.gov/student-resources/"> board’s website</a> says the contest is open children between the ages of 13 and 18, a 9-year-old niece of Ulster County Board of Elections Republican Commissioner John Quigley has emerged as a finalist Quigley said that the board has not prevented younger children from entering in the past. He pointed out that employees of the Board of Elections make a determination on who the five finalists will be. In this year’s sticker contest, 37 children entered, according to the Board of Elections. “We haven’t denied anybody the opportunity to submit stickers,” Quigley said. “We have had other individuals submit stickers outside the age group.” “There is no impropriety here,” Quigley said Friday. “it’s a sticker contest and I would invite anybody regardless of age, honestly. We would never say no to anybody who wants to submit one.” When asked if he thought the age limit should be changed, he said, “That will be something we will definitely revisit.” Quigley said his niece has been working on her art for her sticker since last year’s contest. “It is a great opportunity to teach civic engagement to our youth no matter how old or young they might be,” Quigley added. Voting remains open through July 31.</p>

The 224-page legislative package includes nearly 50 stand-alone bills, according to a House Administration Committee statement. It would give state and county elections officials access to the Social Security death list to aid in the culling of voter rolls. It would urge states to require voters to present some form of identification before casting a ballot. It would also reform the REAL ID Act to require that people’s citizenship status be printed on identification documents like driver&#8217;s licenses for the purposes of checking citizenship status at the polls. The bill also seeks to remove incentives for states to allow noncitizens to vote in local and state elections by reducing their eligibility for grants under the Help America Vote Act. Additionally, it would<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-unveil-new-election-integrity-bill-rcna93510"> override existing voting laws in Washington, DC</a>, including one that permits noncitizens to vote in local elections. It would also permanently prohibit federal agencies like the IRS from asking for nonprofit organizations’ donor lists, which proponents of the bill argue could be weaponized against conservative contributors.</p>
<p>Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Virginia) has introduced<a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/noncit_text.pdf"> H.R. 4460</a>, the<a href="https://wset.com/news/local/no-vote-for-non-citizens-act-introduced-rep-morgan-griffith-would-amend-voter-registration-law-hr-4460-national-help-america-vote-washington-dc-july-2023"> NO VOTE for Non-Citizens Act of 2023</a>. The act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to &#8220;help ensure that only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections,&#8221; according to Griffith. One of the rights and privileges granted in the U.S Constitution is an American citizen’s ability to vote in our country’s federal elections,” said Griffith. “If non-citizens are allowed to vote in our federal elections, it could invite foreign interference and dilute the voice of American citizens. The NO VOTE for Non-Citizens Act upholds Americans’ right to vote, preserving our great democracy.”</p>

During a Joint Committee on Elections hearing, Domb spoke about the need for ranked-choice voting, as well as opening up voting to noncitizens who live in Amherst, such as some international students at the University of Massachusetts who are raising their families in town. “We have a lot of folks who are noncitizens in the town of Amherst,” Domb said, adding that they have a lot of stake in town decisions. “I’m thrilled the Town Council passed this initiative and is seeking home rule support for it.” During the meeting, Amherst At-Large Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke, who served as vice chairwoman of the Charter Commission, said ranked-choice voting was a universally supported measure, and preliminary elections were removed from the charter as a result.</p>

That measure is one of more than 50 new laws that took effect July 1. More than 130,000 Oklahomans are visually impaired or legally blind, according to the American Foundation for the Blind. How many of those residents are eligible to vote is not known. The Oklahoma State Election Board is still working on implementing the new law, and agency spokeswoman Misha Mohr couldn’t say how soon blind voters will be able to request electronic ballots. “We’re in the process of looking at how that procedure will work, so we’re just a little ways out from getting that system implemented,” Mohr said.</p>

For the second year in a row, Brattleboro residents made the case to legislators that the town’s 16- and 17-year-olds should be able to vote in local elections and run for selectboard. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill to make that happen last year, and another this year. But this time around the plan has become reality.  Lawmakers overrode Scott’s veto of<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2024/H.386"> H.386</a> in a special legislative session June 20 in a 110–37 vote. The charter change takes effect immediately. State Rep. Emilie Kornhesier, D-Brattleboro, lead sponsor of the bill, said most of the groundwork for the charter change was done by youth participants — they canvassed and collected signatures to get the issue on the ballot and pass the charter change locally in 2019 with almost 70% of voters in favor.</p>

The 22-page request came just hours after U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty denied the Justice Department’s request for a stay. Doughty imposed the preliminary injunction limiting government communications with social media companies July 4. The Justice Department’s filing signaled that it could seek the intervention of the Supreme Court, saying that at a minimum, the 5th Circuit should put the order on pause for 10 days to give the nation’s highest court time to consider an application for a stay.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/738465b3-8221-4ba6-8a91-92171f73482b.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_8"> In its filing</a>, the Justice Department warned that the injunction could bar a wide swath of communications between the government and the tech industry, stopping the president, for instance, from denouncing misinformation about a natural disaster circulating online. It also said the order has the potential to disrupt communications about the fentanyl crisis or the security of federal elections, warning that it creates legal uncertainty that could lead to “disastrous delays” in responding to misinformation.</p>

Winsor issued a 13-page decision dismissing a lawsuit filed in April by the League of Women Voters of Florida and the NAACP against Secretary of State Cord Byrd. The case stemmed, in part, from a 2018 constitutional amendment designed to restore the voting rights of felons who had completed their sentences. The plaintiffs argued that the state voter-registration form violates a federal law known as the National Voter Registration Act because it does not properly inform potential voters of eligibility requirements. But Winsor ruled that the form accurately informs felons that they cannot register to vote until their rights are restored and rejected arguments that it should provide more-detailed information. “The restoration of rights remains the eligibility requirement for felons,” Winsor wrote. “And that requirement, as plaintiffs acknowledge, is included on the form they challenge. That is enough to doom plaintiffs’ challenge.” Winsor added that “if the NVRA (National Voter Registration Act) required applications to catalog every potential ‘precondition to eligibility,’ Florida’s one-page, front-and-back application form would explode into something hopelessly cumbersome, counter to the NVRA’s goal of promoting convenient registration.”</p>

It was one of several unproven conspiracy theories floated after President Donald Trump was defeated in the 2020 election. True the Vote has refused to provide details and documents supporting its allegations that several unnamed organizations paid unnamed individuals $10 per absentee ballot delivered to drop boxes across metro Atlanta. True the Vote objected to revealing information about an anonymous source who allegedly collected ballots and delivered them to drop boxes. The court effort against True the Vote follows more than a year of attempts by the State Election Board to find out whether the organization’s allegations are true.</p>

In light of the added requirements, the organization, along with the League of Women Voters of Idaho,<a href="https://www.idahopress.com/boiseweekly/news/babe-vote-suspends-voter-registration-files-injunction/article_37ca423c-1cd7-11ee-9410-cfd162296dfd.html"> filed a motion</a> on Thursday, July 6 to halt enforcement of the new law. The law stems from House Bill 340, passed in Idaho’s 2023 legislative session to “revise provisions regarding voter identification and proof of residence.” Sam Sandmire, Babe Vote coordinator, said the new law requires proof of residency beyond what was previously required, but it’s confusing what the new requirements actually are. For instance, said Sandmire, proof of residency may now have to be provided to the county clerk, or possibly even the Secretary of State. “We still have some questions about the law,” she said. The new law makes it harder for people to complete their voter registration because it may require documentation most people don’t have on-hand, such as a rental agreement, property deed or utility bill, said Sandmire. Babe Vote and The League of Women Voters of Idaho, represented by Perkins COIE law firm, requested that Ada County District Court issue a preliminary injunction to keep the law from being enforced until their previously filed lawsuit is resolved.</p>

McMillen’s ruling is most likely the final hurdle for a decision on whether to charge nine individuals who allegedly obtained and tampered with voting machines in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Attorney General Dana Nessel appointed Muskegon County Prosecutor DJ Hilson more than 10 months ago to determine whether to charge nine individuals for allegedly taking ballot tabulators from rural Michigan counties across the state to ostensibly examine them for evidence of election fraud in early 2021. McMillen, answering the formal question posed to the court by Hilson, ruled state law broadly prohibits possessing one of the machines without a court order or permission from the secretary of state. According to the ruling, Hilson empaneled a grand jury and it indicates he may use the jury to decide whether to indict the individuals in the investigation.</p>

Federal law conflicts with North Dakota Century Code, putting him at risk of criminal prosecution if he “chooses incorrectly” which law to enforce, Splonskowski’s lawsuit claimed. “North Dakota law and Defendant’s enforcement of it harm Mr. Splonskowski because they put him in the position of having to choose between dictates of state law to accept and allow votes to be cast after Election Day and federal law that requires a single election day,” the civil complaint said. The lawsuit names North Dakota Election Director Erika White as the defendant. Splonskowski has asked the U.S. District Court to declare North Dakota violates federal law by allowing ballots that come in after Election Day to be counted.  He also asked White be banned from enforcing the North Dakota law and training elected officials to accept what he called &#8220;late ballots.&#8221; North Dakota allows counties to accept absentee ballots in person the day before Election Day. If mailed, the ballot must be postmarked the day before, as well, according to Century Code.</p>

In a voluntary interview with law enforcement, Armold said the audit was not performed because it was a long election, and “everyone was tired,” according to a<a href="https://yukonprogressnews.com/2023/07/04/former-canadian-county-elections-chief-get-deferred-sentence/"> report</a> in the Yukon Progress. Armold pleaded guilty to the charge of failure to perform duties on June 28. All the uncounted votes were from a polling precinct in Mustang. Armold received a plea agreement that included a one-year deferred sentence and a $1,272 fine, one dollar for each vote left uncounted. Armold was further ordered to pay a $30 victim’s compensation assessment along with court costs. Canadian County District Attorney Angela Marsee told the Yukon Progress it is not believed the votes would have altered the results of the election, nor was the failure to perform the audit done for fraudulent purposes.</p>

The suit comes after the branch of the American Civil Liberties Union approached the board in May and warned that a suit would follow if certain provisional ballots weren’t counted. At least two members of the board said the situation should be reconsidered, considering the undue burden placed upon the voters. At that meeting, election officials said they were bound by a Commonwealth Court ruling dictating that these specific ballots are not to be counted. “They previously submitted a mail-in ballot and were notified that it would not count and they voted a provisional ballot that they would not lose their fundamental right to vote,” Schneider told the board. “The provisional ballots should be counted.” The county issued a statement Saturday: “The county strongly supports the ACLU’s request that the Court of Common Pleas clarify the rules for voters whose mail-in ballots are canceled by the county election department for ministerial errors as required by prior state Supreme Court decisions.” The suit revolves around the plaintiffs’ attempts to vote on May 16.</p>

The county’s suit aims to stop Senate Bill 1750 from going into effect Sept., less than two months before the voter registration deadline an start of early voting for the November election. The state law eliminates the elections administrator position established by Harris County Commissioners Court in June 2021 and returns election duties to the two elected offices that previously held them, the county clerk and the tax assessor-collector. More than half of Texas&#8217; 254 counties have appointed elections administrators, including several of the most populous, such as Bexar, Tarrant, Dallas and Collin. County Attorney Christian Menefee has argued the Texas Constitution prevents state legislators from writing laws that single out one county. &#8220;(SB 1750) abolishes the elections administrator office in only those counties that have an elections administrator and have a population of more than 3.5 million, importantly, on Sept. 1, 2023,&#8221; Menefee said. &#8220;It does not apply to counties that grow into that population in the future.&#8221; The bill initially applied to counties with at least 1 million residents, before it was narrowed to include only Harris. The county will ask the judge to temporarily block the measure from going into effect on Sept. 1 and schedule a hearing in the next few weeks, Menefee said.</p>

A trial had been scheduled to begin in September. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Republican National Committee and four election observers who do not live in Green Bay’s city limits. It alleged Green Bay City Clerk Celestine Jeffreys prohibited observers from viewing the entire in-person absentee voting process. According to the lawsuit, Jeffreys did not let election observers in a public hallway where voters were filling out ballots, performing witness certification and depositing ballots. Brown County Circuit Court Judge Marc Hammer issued a temporary order directing the city to give election observers more access to in-person absentee voting. A final order as part of the settlement requires the city to continue doing so. The final order also says the city cannot unreasonably restrict people from observing the &#8220;public aspects&#8221; of in-person early voting, including signing of witness certification and depositing absentee ballots in the collection box. However, the settlement does not require either party to admit wrongdoing and requires both sides to cover their own legal fees.</p>
