							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Virginia post-election reports</strong><br />
<em>Reports provide transparency and serve as learning tool</em></p>
<p>M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>There’s a story behind every vote cast and millions of stories behind every election year. Lots of anecdotes and lots of data.</p>
<p>While<a href="https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/studies-and-reports"> EAVS</a> from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the<a href="https://elections.mit.edu/#/"> EPI</a> from the MIT Election and Data &amp; Science each provide a state-by-state, nationwide look at elections, one state — Virginia — wanted to provide a deep dive at how elections are run each cycle in the commonwealth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9541" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-23-at-11.34.52-AM-300x57.png" alt="" width="300" height="57" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-23-at-11.34.52-AM-300x57.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-23-at-11.34.52-AM.png 712w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Back in<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/Post-ElectionReportNovember2018rev.pdf"> 2018</a>, then-Virginia Election Commissioner Chris Piper got the idea to create a state level post-election report to promote transparency and find ways to improve the elections process.</p>
<p>Since then, the<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/"> Virginia Department of Elections</a> has produced a<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/post-election-analysis/"> post-election report</a> each cycle that takes a look at everything from impacts of new legislation to risk-limiting audits to voter education campaigns to the complaints received via the call center and online.</p>
<p>“We started this after my first general as commissioner in an effort to be transparent,” said Piper who is now with<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group</a>. “The goal was to show the election warts and all and have a record of where we were in 2018 so when we’re looking back to see what we’ve done to improve.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3340" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The office has now produced reports following each election year, most recently under the guidance of new Elections Commissioner Susan Beals.</p>
<p>“The report serves as an important historical record of each election, while also providing metrics that can be used to track improvements in how we conduct elections and serve voters,” Beals said of the report and her decision to continue the work started by her predecessor.</p>
<p>Beals said that each item discussed in the report lists key takeaways for the department to implement in the areas of training, compliance and guidance sent to partners in the field.</p>
<p>This year’s report included a new addition, a survey of the state’s local election officials.</p>
<p>“This year, we expanded the transparency of the report to include grassroots feedback from the field through a mixed-method survey of registrars. Of the 133 general registrars who were sent the survey, about 66%  responded,” Beals said. “Their responses helped us to internally evaluate and reflect on our roles as election administrators and highlighted ways to provide better customer service to both registrars and voters.”</p>
<p>Dave Bjerke, director of elections/ general registrar of voters for the<a href="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/135/Voter-Registration-Elections"> City of Falls Church</a> said that while registrars regularly talk amongst themselves and will likely not discover much of anything new in the report, it’s good to have an official report reflect what is actually happening for the public to consume. It will also be used to go to legislators later. He was pleased to have the registrar survey included this year.</p>
<p>“It was good to see registrar’s perspectives included. It’s essential that we be included but registrars receive so many surveys as it is that taking surveys sometimes feel burdensome and not worth it,” Bjerk said. “However this one feels worthwhile, especially including quotes from our field.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7070" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VAIvoted-296x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="233" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VAIvoted-296x300.png 296w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VAIvoted-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VAIvoted-768x778.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VAIvoted.png 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />The work on the report is done in-house at no additional costs other than staff time.<a href="https://helphopelive.org/campaign/21866/"> Dave Nichols</a>, election services manager for Virginia Department of Elections has always been a big part of the production of the report. We wanted to give Dave a special shout-out as he recovers from transplant surgery.</p>
<p>MIT’s<a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/charles-stewart-iii"> Charles Stewart</a> says the post-election report produced by Virginia — in addition to some other unique reports the state produces — is invaluable.</p>
<p>“Virginia is notable for having a group of really important post-election reports that provide a degree of transparency that is distinct among the states. One of those is the post-election report, released after every state election, that addresses a number of items describing how the election was conducted. It is fact-filled and honest,” Stewart said.</p>
<p>It not only reports basic facts that all states report — like the number of new registrants over the past year — but it also reports statistics about complaints received at call systems and assessments from local officials about what worked and what didn’t work.</p>
<p>“It gives voice to local officials to report on the challenges of new legislation and it names names,” Stewart said. “This report goes alongside Virginia’s incredibly detailed reports on list maintenance, voter registration, election-night reporting, and change logs (my favorite) make the state one of the top two or three states in terms of reporting pertinent information to the public after the election.”</p>

The award is given every year to a public official or governmental unit for protecting and promoting election integrity and verifiable elections. “The award is additional recognition of the Postal Service’s successful processing and delivery of Election Mail, which has grown exponentially in recent years,” said Adrienne Marshall, the Postal Service’s director of election and government mail services. “Our 635,000 employees are proud to provide this service for customers who choose to use the U.S. Mail to participate in the democratic process.” The Election Verification Network is comprised of election officials, researchers and advocates focused on secure, transparent and verifiable elections. “The USPS is the only entity in the country that serves every single community, delivers to every voter, and serves every election office across the United States,” said Amber McReynolds, a member of the USPS Board of Governors and current chairwoman of the Board’s Election Mail Committee, in nominating the Postal Service for the award. “USPS has a vital role in the election process — not only for delivering ballot mail but also for polling place notifications, voter registration mailings and election education mailings.”</p>

Prior to their announcement about leaving, Representatives from the group’s member states met remotely for about three hours to discuss the changes promoted by Republicans, which included dropping a requirement for members to mail notices to people who are eligible but not registered to vote. Currently, ERIC is comprised of 32 states and the District of Columbia, but that number will drop once Alabama, Florida, Missouri and West Virginia formally depart later this year. “The action Ohio is taking today follows nearly a year of good faith, bipartisan efforts to reform ERIC’s oversight and services,” Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who is considering a run for U.S. Senate in 2024, wrote in a letter. “Unfortunately, these attempts to save what could be an unparalleled election integrity service have fallen short.” <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/03/22/iowa-joins-red-wave-exodus-from-multistate-compact-seeking-accuracy-of-voter-lists/">Iowa</a> Secretary of State Paul Pate said he would recommend to the governor and Legislature that the state end its membership in ERIC because of the organization’s decision not to amend the membership agreement. He also said the departure of several other states makes the network less valuable. According to the Associated Press, it appears likely that other Republican-led states could also leave. Alaska “will continue to review its membership in ERIC and we do not intend to make any immediate decisions,” Division of Elections spokesperson Tiffany Montemayor said in an email to the AP.  In <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/09/texas-voting-eric/">Texas</a>, state election officials announced plans last week to conduct their own “interstate voter registration crosscheck program,” although it’s unclear how they plan to do that and how effective such an effort would be, especially if it involves only a handful of states. Meanwhile, legislation has been introduced that would compel Texas to withdraw from ERIC. Legislation has also been introduced in <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/03/22/gop-bill-would-remove-arizona-from-eric-the-database-designed-to-combat-voter-fraud/">Arizona</a> that would force the state to drop out of the interstate system.</p>

Claudia Tenney is taking aim at what she calls &#8220;<a href="https://auburnpub.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/tenney-targets-zuckerbucks-that-went-to-cayuga-33-other-ny-counties-in-2020/article_3371bfe6-492c-5b70-831f-db593577e871.html">Zuckerbucks&#8221;</a> — grants that were awarded in 2020 to nearly 2,500 election offices, from a nonprofit organization supported by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.  Tenney, R-New York, has reintroduced a bill that would prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations from donating money or services to election administration agencies. The legislation is in response to the Center for Tech and Civic Life&#8217;s giving before the 2020 presidential election. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $250 million to the organization.  Tenney asserts that 92% of the center&#8217;s grants were given to &#8220;left-leaning districts.&#8221; Heavily populated cities that sought the grants received more money than small rural counties, but the organization said &#8220;there were no partisan questions in the grant applications&#8221; and funding decisions &#8220;were not made on a partisan basis.&#8221;</p>

Under existing law, a registered voter in Alabama may only vote by absentee ballot if they meet one of the criteria prescribed by law for voting absentee. Currently under Alabama law, voters must declare that they will be out of town, incapacitated or otherwise unable to get to the polls in order to cast an absentee ballot. HB 95 would do away with the requirement to fit any of those criteria and allow any registered voter to vote by absentee ballot without an excuse.</p>
<p>House Bill 100 would allow disabled voters to<a href="https://www.apr.org/news/2023-03-20/legislation-introduced-in-alabamas-2023-session-creates-new-rules-for-absentee-voting-voters-with-disabilities"> designate an individual to deliver their application for an absentee ballot and absentee ballot</a> to the election manager.

The measure would require those who do so to surrender their early ballot, then fill out another one in person. That is after producing identification. The move is being billed as a method to get more rapid results. Early ballots dropped off on Election Day aren’t tabulated until later.  Counties faced backlash in November’s election after it took several weeks to know who won their races. However, many races were very close, with the Attorney General Kris Mayes only winning by a few hundred votes. Opponents say the measure would add hurdles to those who drop off their ballots at polling places.</p>
<p>Insisting that a<a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/arizona-bill-requires-use-of-only-u-s--built-voting-machines/article_583b3ee6-c812-11ed-9186-635c61fd3b9b.html"> “made in USA”</a> label means more security, state lawmakers are moving to require that all election equipment be built only with domestic components and assembled in this country. Only thing is, there apparently are no such machines right now that meet those specifications. So Rep. Steve Montenegro, R-Goodyear, has agreed to craft his legislation so it doesn’t kick in until 2028. And even then, any equipment that counties already have would be exempt. But even assuming a domestic manufacturer could be found by then, that’s just part of the problem. Sen. Ken Bennett, R-Prescott, pointed out that<a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2613/2023"> HB 2613</a> would even preclude a tallying machine from having parts from elsewhere that couldn’t possibly affect the outcome of the vote, like plastic housing. And as crafted, all HB 2613 requires is that the parts be sourced and the assembly be conducted in the United States. None of that precludes a foreign firm that has set up shop here — and there are plenty, including major semiconductor chip manufacturers — from meeting those requirements. Montenegro said his measure, which already has been approved by the House may need work before it goes to the full Senate.</p>
<p>Senators voted this week to<a href="https://www.kawc.org/news/2023-03-22/arizona-would-be-subject-to-new-elections-when-voters-say-they-were-disenfranchised"> require new elections</a> any time a certain number of voters claim they were &#8220;disenfranchised.&#8221; SB 1695, given preliminary approval on a voice vote, would define that to include any time people signed affidavits they had to wait more than 90 minutes outside a polling place. But as crafted, it may not differentiate between those who couldn&#8217;t vote and those who stayed and eventually did cast a ballot despite the wait time. And it wouldn&#8217;t take much. As crafted by Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, just 1,000 sworn affidavits from voters in Maricopa County saying they were disenfranchised would require a judge to order a new election there within 60 days. And it would take just 250 affidavits from smaller counties to rerun their elections. What also would trigger a new vote would be if any election official violated any section of the state Election Code or provisions of the Elections Procedures Manual. But the measure does not spell out which violations would count or whether even a minor infraction would toss out the results.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of six conservative-led states, Senate Republicans want to<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/03/22/gop-bill-would-remove-arizona-from-eric-the-database-designed-to-combat-voter-fraud/"> pull Arizona’s membership from ERIC</a>. A last-minute amendment to Sen. John Kavanagh’s<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78737?SessionId=127"> Senate Bill 1135</a> would essentially set Arizona on a path to leave ERIC, as well, even though its sponsor says it would put that decision in the hands of ERIC itself.  In its original form, SB1135 focused on new regulations and procedures for early voting. But the amendment would preclude the state from being a member of a multistate voter registration organization that requires members to provide information from voter registration records or driver’s licenses “that is otherwise required to be confidential.” That information includes full or partial social security or driver’s license numbers or any records from the Arizona Department of Transportation.  The bill would also ban Arizona from being a member of an organization that requires the mailing of voter registration forms to people who are not registered to vote.</p>

The new law makes it so that candidates cannot register as write-in candidates. It also says that no votes for write-in candidates will be counted in elections. The governor also signed<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FHB1510.pdf"> House Bill 1510</a> into law, which changes when special elections can be held. Now, special elections can only be held on the second Tuesday of March or November during presidential election years or the second Tuesday in May or November any other year. There is an exception for emergency special elections that says special elections can be held any month of the year if certain qualifications are met. The changes will go into effect on January 1, 2024. And there are new rules for paper ballots in Arkansas due to the signing of<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FSB250.pdf"> Senate Bill 250</a>. If a county decides to use paper ballots in an election, the new law says those ballots must be compatible with the state’s electronic vote counters. The ballots have to be put through the machine before being counted by hand. And that count has to be done with numbers submitted to the Arkansas Secretary of State less than 24 hours after the polls close.</p>

The bill, from Assemblyman Bill Essayli, R-Riverside, would have ended universal vote-by-mail in the state, returning to pre-pandemic ballot rules. The bill also would also have reinstated a ban on “ballot harvesting,” the practice of collecting multiple ballots and turning them in en masse, by making it so only family members could handle or turn in someone’s ballot. Finally, the bill would have made Election Day a state holiday, which Essayli said might give conservative supporters of the bill heartburn but which would expand voter access to the polls. Assemblyman Isaac Bryan said that AB 13 “undoes the righteous work” that has been done over the last several years to make voting more accessible, especially to people of color or who have disabilities.</p>
<p>Assembly member Isaac Bryan (D-Los Angeles) says some<a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2023/03/22/proposed-bill-would-overhaul-referendum-petition-process-in-california/"> referendum petition circulators</a> misrepresent what their petitions would do and who they work for. He’s introducing a bill that seeks to address those issues.  If passed,<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB421"> the bill</a> would require campaigns to disclose key information on the front page of the referendum petitions, like a summary of the measure and the names of its top three donors, in an effort to increase transparency. It would also introduce additional government oversight in the signature-collection process: Paid signature gatherers would be required to register and take training courses with the Secretary of State’s office. And at least 10% of signature gathering efforts would have to be done by volunteers. “What this bill will do is remove some of the paid signature gathering incentives and for actual volunteers — actual people who care about the issues — to go out and convince other people to care about the issues, the way the referendum and ballot process was intended,” Bryan said at a press conference. If passed, the new rules would be applied to both referendum efforts and other petitions to change recently-passed state legislation.</p>

Under the legislation, there would be 10 days of early voting for statewide and municipal elections, not including the Monday before Election Day to give officials time to rest and reset polling locations.

Registered voters already receive polling location information and a calendar of important dates, but Griffith says her legislation adds to that traditional voter info. If passed, the notice will be mailed no later than 30 days before the primary election. The legislation also directs the Dept. of Elections to follow a procedure in existing Code for attempting to update and verify voting registration records should the notice be returned as undeliverable. The bill is in committee, and Griffith is confident it will move quickly to the full House for consideration. The legislation has bipartisan support.</p>

One bill, the<a href="https://boltsmag.org/washington-dc-voting-registration-reforms/"> Automatic Voter Registration Expansion Amendment Act</a> will overhaul the city’s approach to voter registration. D.C. will use the information it collects when residents interact with public agencies like the Department of Motor Vehicles to create a running list of people who are “preapproved” to vote. For people on this list, there will be no need to register in advance of an election; all they will have to do is vote. This new law would pair with<a href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B24-0507"> a reform</a> that the council has adopted but is not yet law, which would set up universal mail-in voting: That bill would apply to people on the “preapproved” list. As a result, D.C. would mail ballots to people it knows are eligible to vote—even if they have not registered. That bill was approved unanimously by the D.C. council in December and signed by the mayor. It became law after the customary congressional review that all D.C. bills undergo expired this week.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://boltsmag.org/washington-dc-voting-registration-reforms/"> Local Residents Voting Rights Act</a>, also became law this week. The U.S. House voted to block it in January in a resolution proposed by the GOP and supported by some Democrats, but the Senate did not follow up by the March 14 deadline that was set by the chamber’s parliamentarian.  As a result, noncitizens who have been residents of D.C. for 30 days will be able to vote in local elections—including for mayor, city council, education board, and ballot initiatives. The law would not apply to federal elections.</p>

Rep. Joe Alfieri, R-Coeur d’Alene, pushed House Bill 137, saying it would provide enhanced elections security and prevent voter fraud. Alfieri didn’t provide specific examples of anyone in Idaho forging affidavits to vote, but he said there is a potential for fraud and affidavits make it easier to cheat. After a nearly hour-long debate, the Idaho House voted 33-36 to kill House Bill 137, which is now dead for the session.</p>

Rep. Tim Wesco (R-Osceola) said his bill simply extends voter ID requirements used for in-person voting to voting by mail. “I’ve long felt that the process of simply matching signatures as the means of verifying the authenticity of an absentee ballot application is insufficient and extremely subjective,” Wesco said. Democrats objected, saying Wesco’s bill creates an unnecessary hurdle. But Sen. J.D. Ford (R-Indianapolis) said if they’re going to add this requirement, then vote-by-mail should be open to everyone. He proposed an amendment to eliminate the excuses needed to cast a mail-in ballot.</p>

Eric Brakey (R-Auburn), to drop certain<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/legislators-weigh-much-politicking-allow-035900437.html"> electioneering restrictions</a>. It would also allow candidates to tell voters what office they&#8217;re running for. But others say the rules about conduct at the polls should be even tougher. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Peggy Rotundo, a Lewiston Democrat, would add new restrictions on campaign buttons at the polls. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told a legislative panel that &#8220;any scintilla of electioneering has no place anywhere near a polling place.&#8221; &#8220;Voters should feel comfortable walking into and out of their polling place without feeling obligated to speak to candidates trying to convince them of their qualifications or pressured to have to change their vote based on this interaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>State and local election officials challenged a proposal to<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2023-03-22/bill-would-ban-ballot-drop-boxes-in-maine"> outlaw ballot drop boxes</a> used by the majority of Maine&#8217;s nearly 500 municipalities in the last election.<a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0424&amp;item=1&amp;snum=131"> The proposal</a> by state Sen. Eric Brakey (R-Auburn), would join Maine with the roughly dozen states that have banned ballot drop boxes since 2020. Popularized during the pandemic, the drop boxes are an alleged conduit for fraudulent voting — claims that have been widely disproven. In testimony before the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, Brakey described drop ballot boxes as less secure than in-person voting. He framed his bill as an effort to restore voter confidence. His assertions were contested by civic engagement groups, the association representing local election clerks and deputy Secretary of State Joann Bautista. They explained that drop boxes are often bolted to the ground or attached to municipal buildings and the ballots in them routinely collected and checked against local voter rolls before being counted.</p>

The first reading is supposed to happen at council’s next April 4 meeting. A second reading, with a vote, is expected April 18. “Whereas the City Council of the City of East Lansing has determined that the ordinance is not actively enforced by the city and that the form of voter outreach set forth in the ordinance has been largely replaced by online voter initiatives, it is further unnecessary due to changes in state law allowing for same day voting,” Chubb said before the moratorium vote. The city had recently been sued by East Lansing-based Hagan Realty Inc., claiming the city has been violating landlords&#8217; First Amendment rights by forcing them to provide voter application forms and other information to new tenants.</p>

The vote at this week’s meeting came just days after the Bemidji Charter Commission also voiced their support in favor of the practice. The resolution passed in a 4-2 vote, with Mayor Jorge Prince and Ward 2 Councilor Josh Peterson in opposition. If approved at the state level, where<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?session=ls93&amp;number=HF2486&amp;session_number=0&amp;session_year=2023&amp;version=list"> a bill</a> is currently going through committees, the city council would need to unanimously approve the use of ranked choice voting for implementation. If it is not approved, a vote to adjust the city charter as needed would be put before the citizens as a ballot question.</p>

Opponents of the bill say this would hypothetically prevent a church from helping homebound members cast their ballot. But Secretary of State Michael Watson says it’s a security precaution. In a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/mississippi-approves-ballot-collection-ban/"> statement</a>, Reeves said the intent of Senate Bill 2358 was to “uphold the integrity of the election process” by prohibiting individuals or organizations from handling “massive amounts of absentee ballots” during an election, a process he claims is an “open invitation for fraud and abuse.”</p>
<p>House lawmakers have also advanced<a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2023/pdf/history/HB/HB1306.xml"> HB 1306</a> which would enhance penalties for Mississippians who vote twice in an election. This action is currently classified as a misdemeanor, which would be changed to a felony charge. Republican Representative Prince Wallace says systems are in place to prevent someone from voting twice, but Democratic Representative Zakiya Summers asked during floor debate what happens when someone slips through the cracks.</p>

The 82-page bill also would prevent interstate collaboration with organizations designed to share voter poll data, such as the Electronic Registration Information Center, which Missouri left earlier this month. The bill also contains a provision allowing any registered voter eligible to vote in an election to contest the results of that election in court. Several citizens spoke in support of the bill, charging that voting machines are not properly accredited and are susceptible to cybersecurity risks. Speaking in opposition, Eric Fey, Democratic director of elections for St. Louis County, countered that machine-produced results are always audited. Fey added that voting machines make it easier for voters to correct their ballot if they made mistakes, and that counting ballots by hand has historically made elections susceptible to fraud, such as stuffing ballot boxes and marking tally sheets incorrectly.</p>

Patrick Yawakie, speaking on behalf of the Blackfeet Tribe, said the tribe would like to see an amendment added that would ensure the bill would not interfere with aspects of operating a satellite ballot office, including providing donated labor, internet services, cybersecurity and other in-kind donations. The bill passed third reading in the Senate on a 34-14 vote. In the hearing Tuesday, the bill received seven proponents and three opponents.

The three bills are LB457 introduced by Senator Rick Holdcroft, LB193, and LB808 by Senator Steve Halloran. In sum, the three bills would require all voting machine parts to be manufactured in the United States to lessen the chance of foreign tampering, to implement video recording devices in all voting locations, as well as giving counties the option to hand recount future legislative races instead of machine counting. Supporters based their arguments off of claims of people receiving mail-in ballots who no longer live in the state, as well as the possibility of new technology that could allow unauthorized individuals to compromise voting machines. The opponents based their claims on the lack of official evidence of intentional voter tampering, and the fact that the bills would cost Nebraska taxpayers $16 million. The government, military, and veterans affairs committee will decide whether to vote these bills to the debate floor.</p>

James Ohrenschall, D-Las Vegas, would require counties and cities that choose to stop using voting machines purchased with state funds to return the money to the state. The bill comes in response to some counties that considered using paper ballots and hand counting, ostensibly to ensure election integrity. The bill would not be retroactive, meaning counties that have already opted to stop using voting machines wouldn’t be required to pay the money back. If passed, the bill would become effective on July 1. The proposed legislation was suggested by an interim legislative committee, which voted in August to request a version of the bill be introduced during the 2023 legislative session.</p>

When the Legislative session started three months ago, lawmakers had more than 30 bills related to elections in front of them. By this point in the session, that number has been whittled down, but there are still at least a dozen remaining. One bill being considered – HB 1273 – would do away with approval and ranked-choice voting; another – HB 1230 – would increase penalties for people that willfully violate the state’s signature-collecting laws. Another bill, HB 1529, would ask the Legislature to study the state’s campaign finance laws so lawmakers can make changes to the statute next session.<a href="https://ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-overview/bo1192.html?bill_year=2023&amp;bill_number=1192"> House Bill 1192</a> takes out the word ‘electronic’ from voting systems. It also allows county auditors to start counting early and absentee votes three days before election day. It also clarifies that in a presidential year, electors meet on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their votes in the electoral college. This week, the house also passed<a href="https://ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-overview/bo2292.html?bill_year=2023&amp;bill_number=2292"> Senate Bill 2292</a>, which says a person can’t cause a disturbance at a polling place.

It also adds language that a person may register to vote if their sentence has been discharged, terminology the Department of Corrections uses to indicate that a sentence has been completed with no further obligations to the state. Rep. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, who introduced the bill, said the bill simply seeks to align what the Department of Corrections and State Election Board view as a completed sentence.  “Folks will feel comfortable being able to instruct folks on what they can and cannot do, and I absolutely think that’s important,” Goodwin said. “If people are misinterpreting the law, which has happened with senators and representatives getting it confused, that’s why we need to do our level best to make the language as simple as possible.”  The bill cleared the House Ethics and Elections Committee without objection and is eligible for consideration on the House floor. The deadline for bills to pass out of their chamber of origin is Thursday, March 23. As the House committee considered the bill, State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said its passage would allow state and county election officials to offer better guidance to people with felony convictions. “I think spelling it out in black and white in the statute will make it much, much clearer not just for election officials, but also for prospective voters,” Ziriax said.</p>

Mastriano&#8217;s new bill would allow any registered voter to be a poll watcher in any precinct across the state, meaning that someone from Beaver County can travel 340 miles to Philadelphia to monitor proceedings at a polling location they&#8217;ve never seen. Current law requires watchers stay in their home county.  The bill also mandates that watchers have a clear view of pre-canvassing ballots from no more than six feet away, and also includes language that penalizes election officials who impede poll watchers.

He explained his reasoning for the veto of Senate File 131 in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Chuck Gray, but started with defending Wyoming’s election integrity. The governor said election integrity and security were campaign issues for several candidates, which led to bills being brought forward to address those concerns and follow through on campaign promises in the general session. “I want to be clear. At no time have I been presented with facts of fraud, mismanagement, or malfeasance in Wyoming’s election process. Even so, over the past month, I have signed those bills which strengthen election integrity and security, such as codifying existing election rules,” he wrote. However, he said the prohibition on delivery of unsolicited ballot forms bill was “superfluous and potentially confusing” when it came to his desk. Although there were amendments before SF 131 made it to final reading in the House, it was a small bill originally designed to bar anyone except a county clerk or the secretary of state from distributing “an absentee ballot request form by mail, email, or any other means, which claims to be an official elected document, to any qualified elector.”</p>

Attorneys for Dominion argued that Fox recklessly repeated false accusations from supporters of former President Donald Trump that its machines and the software used were responsible for Trump’s 2020 election loss. Documents released during the lawsuit have shown that top Fox executives and personalities didn’t believe the claims but aired them anyway. “There was a deliberate decision by those responsible for the broadcasts … to let the story be out there,” Dominion attorney Rodney Smolla said, adding that Fox News was desperate to win back viewers infuriated that the network had correctly called Arizona, a key battleground state, on election night for Joe Biden. “What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief.” Fox contended it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations — a sitting president’s claim that the election was being stolen from him. “We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis told lawyers for both sides he hasn’t made up his mind. “I need to be educated,” the judge said as the hearing began. “I haven’t pre-decided this.”</p>

The complaint challenges how the Maricopa County recorder applied its signature verification policies during the election. The Supreme Court said since it was a challenge of application, not the policies themselves, it could move to a trial court. The Supreme Court won’t hear the case. As for the other six challenges, the Supreme Court said they were focused on the proceedings in the trial court and were made on “insufficient” grounds. Also in the Supreme Court’s order were possible sanctions for Lake’s claim that “35,563 unaccounted-for ballots were added to the total of ballots at a third-party processing facility.” Lake has argued that elections officials failed to follow the law when they declared Democrat Katie Hobbs won the race for governor in November. A trial court and the Court of Appeals had thrown out Lake’s legal claims. The Supreme Court did not make any judgment as to whether Lake’s claim would succeed.</p>

Arkansas election officials from using bar-code voting machines left open the possibility that the Nebraska-based manufacturer could be sued if Conrad Reynolds can show evidence of wrongdoing by the company. Election Systems&#8217; lawyer Kevin Crass with the Friday Firm had argued that the company should be dropped from the lawsuit because the machines complied &#8220;with all applicable law and standards&#8221; and the litigation included no allegations Election Systems had broken any laws. The remaining defendants are Republican Secretary of State John Thurston and the State Board of Election Commissioners. State records show the secretary of state has paid out $331,720 to Election Systems, with $315,000 in election-related services and $16,720 in technical services. The suit alleges the machines fall short under a provision of Arkansas Code 7-5-504 that require such machines &#8220;shall permit the voter to verify in a private and independent manner the votes selected by the voter on the ballot before the ballot is cast.&#8221; Likewise, the machines do not comply with the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002, which governs federal elections, the suit states.</p>

The legal action targets what is known as Florida’s<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/us/politics/florida-lawsuit-voter-registration.html"> “wet signature” requirement</a>, which mandates that anyone registering to vote who is not listed in the state’s driver’s license database sign their application with a pen. The plaintiffs contend that the rule creates a particular hardship for people of color, older residents and those with lower incomes who might not readily have access to a printer — and that it puts the onus on them to return applications to the state. Last year, a federal judge in Texas sided with Vote.org in a 2021 lawsuit over that state’s wet signature requirement. The judge ruled that the mandate violated the federal Civil Rights Act, a decision that the state is appealing. Vote.org filed a similar lawsuit last year against Georgia, which the state unsuccessfully sought to have dismissed. “Rules like this are death by a thousand paper cuts,” Andrea Hailey, the chief executive of Vote.org, said.  Florida law specifies that voter registration applications must contain an original signature, but the groups said that it wasn’t until 2021 that the state clarified what that meant. The rule prevents Floridians from using Vote.org’s mobile tool, which uses digital signatures, to register to vote on their phones, according to the organization. “It’s sort of a no-brainer in this moment in time,” Hailey said of mobile registration. “Most real estate transactions happen with digital signatures. Banking happens with a digital signature. How many times a day do people in the business world use DocuSign to sign all sorts of important agreements and documents?”</p>

Rather than engage with this growing youth activism, Idaho’s existing political power has tried to suppress it.&#8221; According to the lawsuit, &#8220;the number of 18- and 19-year-olds registered to vote in Idaho increased 81% between 2018 and 2022, the largest such increase nationwide by far.&#8221; Turnout by young voters has also surged — 48% of eligible voters aged 18 to 29 cast ballots in 2020. And last year, an 18-year-old high school student, Shiva Rajbhandari,<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/shiva-rajbhandari-school-board"> won a seat</a> on the Boise School Board.  For 13 years, Idaho has had a law in place requiring voters to show a valid photo identification before voting. Acceptable forms of ID have included student ID cards, along with driver&#8217;s licenses, other photo IDs issued by the state Department of Transportation available to those who don&#8217;t drive, passports, tribal photo IDs and, since 2017, concealed-carry licenses. Signed into law by Governor Brad Little on last week, House Bill 124 was sold as an election integrity bill, meant to clamp down on voter fraud by forcing voters to bring forms of identification issued by the government — unlike student IDs, which are issued by schools.</p>

The lawsuit was filed in 2021 by Loud Light, the League of Women Voters of Kansas, the Topeka Independent Living Resource Center and the Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.  They challenged provisions of a law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature that limit how many advance mail ballots individuals can collect and require election officials to match the signatures on an advance ballot to a person’s voter registration record. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach said Friday he would appeal the ruling. The unanimous opinion, written by Judge Stephen Hill, said the two provisions impair the right to vote. “It was by free elections that we gained statehood. Thus, voting rights are preserved in the Kansas Constitution,” Hill wrote. “Great care must be taken when trying to limit or infringe on those rights. Voting was important then. Voting is important now.” The court sent the lawsuit back to Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson, who originally dismissed it in April 2022 after finding the restrictions were reasonable. The ruling does not strike down the law. But it requires Watson to review the lawsuit using “strict scrutiny,” which is the highest standard of legal review.</p>

According to the lawsuit, some residents in District 93 received ballots without the runoff election as an option to vote on. The suit claims Wilson illegally made residents reach out to the office to request a new, correct ballot instead of issuing new ballots to all voters.  Last week the Louisiana Secretary of State&#8217;s Office issued the following statement acknowledging the ballot errors:  &#8220;Of the more than 14,000 absentee ballots sent by the Orleans Parish Registrar&#8217;s office, a small number of voters in House District 93 may have received the wrong ballot style via mail for the March election due to a packaging error. This issue has since been corrected. The suit asks that Wilson&#8217;s office issue new absentee ballots to all voters to ensure their votes are counted. A New Orleans judge has<a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/orleans-registar-of-voters-sued-absentee-ballots-decision/43389604"> ruled</a> in favor of the registrar’s office.</p>

The suit claims the city is violating landlords&#8217; First Amendment rights by forcing them to provide voter application forms and other information to new tenants. &#8220;Where East Lansing&#8217;s interest is to disseminate an ideology or policy relating to voting, no matter how acceptable to some, those interests cannot outweigh the First Amendment right to avoid being the courier of the government&#8217;s message,&#8221; said the suit filed in U.S. District Court. A 2013 city ordinance requires landlords to give tenants specific information on how to register to vote, provide them with a voter registration application and inform them that further information is available on the state elections website, the lawsuit said. Violations are a civil infraction. The ordinance does not specify the penalty, although city code generally sets a fine of up to $1,000 for civil infractions, according to the suit.</p>

It is not the purpose of the program to enlist support for any particular reform proposal. Neither MEVC nor Leadership Now endorses a particular proposal. But the program will cover the reform proposals, and speakers and panelists will express their views on them. At the core of the April 4 program will be a panel moderated by E.J. Dionne, nationally syndicated columnist and long-time student of and commentator on the country’s presidential election process and the Electoral College system. <strong>When:</strong> April 4 at 2:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1. HAVA designates a 110-member Standards Board to assist EAC in carrying out its mandates under the law.
