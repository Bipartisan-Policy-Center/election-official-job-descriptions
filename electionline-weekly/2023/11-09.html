														<p><strong>There are no off years</strong><br />
<em>A look back at Election Day 2023</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4575" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/scenes-election-day-2023-americans-head-polls/"> Election Day 2023</a> was supposed to be a<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/06/election-preview-stress-test-2024/71395541007/"> harbinger of what’s to come in 2024</a>, as some asserted, then 2024 should be relatively smooth sailing with a few isolated equipment problems and polling place issues because that’s how things played out this week.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/cisa-sees-smooth-election-day-operations-no-credible-threats/"> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) said that it had seen no credible threats to election infrastructure and processes as many states held off-year elections for state legislative and other offices.</p>
<p>“We continue to see no specific or credible threats to election infrastructure,” a CISA spokesperson said at a media briefing. “We remain confident in the security and resilience of the elections process because of the extensive preparation that goes into every election,” the spokesperson said, including “rigorous defense in depth approach to election infrastructure security at the state and local level, and then numerous safeguards in place at every stop of the election process.”</p>
<p>The two issues that seemed to garner the most headlines were an issue with equipment in<a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2023/11/07/northampton-county-voting-machines-errors/"> Northampton County, Pennsylvania</a> and ballot shortages in<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2023/11/07/hinds-county-ballot-shortages-causes-legal-mess-on-election-day/"> Hinds County, Mississippi</a> that left voters waiting in line for hours and a court-order to keep the polls open till 8pm, although advocates had asked for 9pm. Other jurisdictions faced equipment problems and ballot shortages as well, but none seemed to attract the attention that these two did.</p>
<p>Several jurisdictions had additional eyes on them either from<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ri/pr/justice-department-monitor-polls-compliance-federal-voting-rights-laws-several"> the U.S. Department of Justice</a>, state and local watchdogs or the media. Officials from DOJ monitored elections in Union County, New Jersey for Sec. 203 compliance and the Civil Rights Division also monitored Pawtucket and Woonsocket, Rhode Island; Madison County and Panola County, Mississippi; and Prince William County, Virginia for compliance with the federal voting rights laws.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-08/dominion-voting-machines-shasta-county-election"> Shasta County, California</a>, where Tuesday’s school board and fire protection district elections had county officials bracing for the worst after the county commission and state officials disagreed on how ballots should be counted, there was minimal conflict. The<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-11-08/election-monitoring-group-says-theyve-found-ballot-errors-in-cascade-county"> Cascade County, Montana</a> Election Protection Committee reported several issues on Election Day in the county where the new clerk’s capabilities had been called into question earlier this year. And in<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/virginia-county-stumbles-first-election-conspiracy-fueled-staff-exodus-rcna123800"> Buckingham County, Virginia</a>, where the entire elections staff quit earlier this year because of election conspiracy <img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-8105 alignright" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-768x593.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />theories, results weren’t posted until 10 a.m. Wednesday. Local officials did not immediately respond to questions about the late results. Andrea Gaines, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Elections, said the county struggled to input results. And while it wasn&#8217;t entirely smooth sailing, Election Day in <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/harris-county-polls-election-day-18457633.php">Harris County, Texas</a>&#8211;the first since a state law changed how elections are administered there&#8211;was relatively uneventful.</p>
<p>While the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67339979"> BBC had a report</a> that some of the issues that arose on Election Day fueled conspiracy theories and fraud allegations, their examples came from Twitter/X which unfortunately cannot be relied upon for much these days and officials in the affected jurisdiction were quick to refute the accusations with facts.</p>
<p>On a positive note, while ballots are still being counted and there may be a recount or two, at press time, we could find no reports of any losing candidate challenging the results of their election.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />
While the equipment issues in Northampton County, Pennsylvania garnered most of the headlines on Tuesday, there were some other issues.</p>
<p>During Election Day, election officials and a warehouse crew helped  poll workers with small machine issues and user errors at voting sites across<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2023/11/07/north-jersey-voters-face-minor-ballot-glitches-election-day/71489702007/"> Bergen County, New Jersey</a>. According to<a href="https://www.richmondregister.com/madison-co-voting-machine-issues-persist-into-election-day/article_c596a2e0-7da8-11ee-9b5c-07a1c57eb784.html"> Madison County, Kentucky</a> Clerk Kenny Barger, the computerized system was not accurately calculating where people touch the screen when they vote. Voting equipment at the Department of Transportation voting location in<a href="https://www.conchovalleyhomepage.com/election/voter-equipment-at-txdot-location-malfunctions-on-election-day/"> San Angelo, Texas</a> malfunction. According to the Election Administrator, Vona Hudson, a scanner at the location presented an alert which prevented voters from scanning their ballots. All ballots which could not be scanned during the incident were placed in an emergency slot. In<a href="https://www.whsv.com/2023/11/08/staunton-precinct-track-after-morning-voting-machine-mixup/"> Staunton County, Virginia</a> ballot scanners were showing error messages in one precinct because it turns out the wrong equipment was delivered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />On Election Night, a new system of counting ballots and software errors slowed things down in<a href="https://www.ideastream.org/government-politics/2023-11-08/new-system-software-error-stalled-election-results-in-cuyahoga-summit-counties"> Cuyahoga and Summit counties in Ohio</a>. A system error slowed the ballot count in<a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/officials-montgomery-greene-county-total-ballot-counts-not-impacted-by-data-error/GVCMJDJBXNDXZGGGY6DT35YNLE/"> Montgomery County, Ohio</a>. New tallying software in<a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/voting-suffolk-board-of-elections-nassau-p9rk9h29"> Suffolk County, New York</a> meant slower reporting. The<a href="https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/your-local-election-hq/wayne-county-board-of-elections-working-to-provide-election-results-after-trouble-with-card-counts/"> Wayne County, New York</a> Board of Elections was finally able to release results after “running into trouble” with card counts Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t all bad news either! Several jurisdictions used new equipment both in polling places and behind the scenes to process and count ballots and there were positive reports from a number of those.</p>
<p>Voters in<a href="https://www.wbng.com/2023/11/08/chenango-county-officials-say-smooth-voting-goes-accordingly-with-new-machines-this-election/"> Chenango County, New York</a> got to use new equipment for the first time and Democratic Election Commissioner Carly Hendricks said the day was a success. “So, it was really successful, we really didn’t have any problems,” said Hendricks. “There were some hiccups like we mentioned the jitters of the poll workers, you know getting used to the machines and what they were capable of and not you know I don’t want to say mess up, but you know afraid to do something because they didn’t want to break them or mess something up, but it went well, we were pleased with how it went.” And in<a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/local/central-georgia-election-officials-say-garvis-system-succeeds-houston-county-peach-county-secretary-of-state-office-peach-state/93-d4918284-178c-4b70-a5d9-c8fbe2e4fed9"> Georgia</a>, the state’s new GARViS system was put to the test and got high marks from local elections officials. Georgia election officials say they faced few, if any, problems and/or errors during this fall&#8217;s local elections. &#8220;It was a great, easy day,&#8221; Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office, said. &#8220;You kinda hold your breath when you do something new, and it worked out great.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Elections on the ballot</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9939" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JeffCoCOIVoted-300x297.png" alt="" width="244" height="242" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JeffCoCOIVoted-300x297.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JeffCoCOIVoted-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JeffCoCOIVoted-768x761.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JeffCoCOIVoted.png 894w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" />Elections officials were on the ballots in several states including Kentucky, Mississippi and Washington. Additionally, several localities and the state of Maine voted for election administration measures.</p>
<p>Incumbent<a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/07/kentucky-election-results-secretary-of-state-race-michael-adams-faces-buddy-wheatley/71331245007/"> Kentucky</a> Secretary of State Michael Adams (R) defeated challenger Charles “Buddy” Wheatley. Adams captured 61% of the vote, while Wheatley got 39%. “On this stage I told you the mission impossible had become mission accomplished,” Adams said at a press conference Tuesday night.  “We’ve taken Kentucky from the bottom in election administration to the top, and, thanks to your support, we’ll continue making it easy to vote and hard to cheat,” Adams said. Adams was known in his first term for expunging thousands of inactive voters from the rolls and working with Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to make voting safer in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic − despite receiving death threats for it. Adams said there was no evidence of mass voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, which former President Donald Trump claimed was stolen from him. Wheatley, who was twice elected to the state House, agreed with Adams on that point.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.wapt.com/article/candidates-for-mississippi-secretary-of-state-michael-watson-ty-pinkins/45737432"> Mississippi</a>, incumbent Secretary of State Michael Watson (R) defeated Democrat Ty Pinkins. Watson, 45, from Pascagoula, served in the state Senate from 2008 to 2020. He ran his own law firm, focusing on business, construction and probate law. He was elected secretary of state in 2019. Pinkins, 49, from Vicksburg, is a decorated U.S. Army veteran who served three combat tours, a former White House communications aide and former lawyer with the Mississippi Center for Justice.</p>
<p>In Washington,<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/julie-wise-trouncing-doug-basler-for-king-county-elections-director/"> King County</a> Elections Director Julie Wise easily defeated Doug Basler for a third term. Wise led Basler 83% to 17% Tuesday night. Basler would need nearly three-quarters of remaining estimated votes to break even, according to a Seattle Times analysis.<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/king-county-elections-director-race-elections-veteran-vs-election-denier/"> The campaign pitted</a> Wise, a nonpartisan elections professional, against a candidate who has repeatedly thrown around evidence-free accusations of massive elections fraud. Wise has spent her entire career at King County Elections, beginning 23 years ago as a temp answering phones and working nearly every role in the office before winning the top job eight years ago. She is nationally certified in elections administration and has never affiliated herself with a political party. In<a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/fell-leads-race-to-remain-snohomish-county-auditor/"> Snohomish County</a>, Garth Fell, a one-term incumbent with 24 years of county elections experience, led former election certification specialist Cindy Gobel, with an initial count of 59.7% to 40%.  “I’m proud to see a big showing from Snohomish County voters,” Fell said after initial results dropped Tuesday night. “It validates all the hard work we’ve been doing.” In August’s primary, Fell led with 40.2% of the vote. Gobel followed with 32.8%. The two garnered enough votes to oust Robert Sutherland, a 2020 election denier and former Republican lawmaker running on greater transparency.</p>
<p>For the third time in 26 years,<a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2023/11/08/politics/maine-question-8-guardianship-voting-rights-rejected/"> Maine</a> voters rejected a ballot initiative that would repeal a constitutional prohibition on voting for those under guardianship for reasons of mental illness. The no side of Question 8 had 52.5 percent of votes to 47.5 percent for the yes side, according to unofficial reports to the Bangor Daily News after the Associated Press called the race on Wednesday. There is no practical effect from the result because Maine<a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2023/10/10/politics/guide-constitutional-amendments-maine-november-ballot-joam40zk0w/"> has not enforced</a> the voting prohibition since a federal judge found it unconstitutional in 2001. Voters also shot down attempts to take this provision of the state Constitution off the books in 1997 and 2000.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://dcist.com/story/23/11/08/rockville-voters-oppose-lowering-voting-age-local-elections/"> Rockville, Maryland</a> voters were presented with four advisory questions including one about lowering the voting age to 16 for local elections. According to unofficial results, 8,593 voters chose no and 3,542 chose yes. A third option of “no opinion” garnered 249 votes. At least seven other Maryland jurisdictions do allow 16-and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.</p>
<p>An overwhelming number of voters in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/08/greenbelt-rockville-noncitizen-voting/"> Greenbelt, Maryland</a> — 67 percent — voted in favor of expanding ballot access in local elections to noncitizens. Should local officials in Greenbelt take voters’ wishes to heart, legislation will be enacted to make the city of roughly 25,000 people the 12th municipality in Maryland to extend voting rights in local elections to all residents regardless of citizenship status</p>
<p><strong>Ranked Choice Voting</strong><br />
It was a big day for ranked choice voting. Ranked choice  was used successfully in 11 cities across six states, including for the first time in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7077" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-300x163.png" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-300x163.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-1024x558.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV-768x418.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCV.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Additionally, voters in three Michigan cities —<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2023/11/see-which-kalamazoo-county-ballot-proposals-passed-in-tuesdays-election.html"> Kalamazoo</a>,<a href="https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2023-11-08/east-lansing-approves-ranked-choice-voting-rejects-new-swearing-in-dates"> East Lansing</a> and<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/07/jackson-grossbard-southfield-clerk-royal-oak-ranked-choice-voting-marijuana-measures/71473322007/"> Royal Oak</a> — voted to adopt ranked choice voting. 71% of Kalamazoo voters, 52% of East Lansing voters, and 51% of Royal Oak voters voted for ranked choice.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnetonka-votes-to-keep-ranked-choice-voting/600318188/"> Minnetonka, Minnesota</a>, residents voted against a ballot measure that would have repealed ranked choice and in<a href="https://easthamptonma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6426/Specimen-ballots-for-the-November-7-2023-City-Election-PDF?bidId="> Easthampton, Massachusetts</a>, voter approved expanding the use of ranked choice from single winner races, such as mayor and precinct councilors to multi-winner city races, which include elections for at-large city councilors and school committee members.</p>
<p>“Election Day 2023 showed once again that voters want ranked choice voting,” said Deb Otis, director of research and policy at<a href="https://fairvote.org/"> FairVote</a>. “American voters are dissatisfied with our politics, and in 27 city ballot measures in a row, they’ve said ‘yes’ to better choices, better campaigns, and better representation. Everywhere it’s used, voters like and understand RCV, taking advantage of the opportunity to vote honestly and express more choices. We’ll continue this progress later this month in Utah and again in 2024, when at least Oregon and Nevada will vote on adopting RCV statewide and five states and territories are poised to use RCV for their presidential primaries.”</p>
<p><strong>Polling Places</strong><br />
As with any Election Day, there were a hodgepodge of issues at polling places throughout the country, some more serious than others.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3340" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Police were called to a polling place in<a href="https://www.wave3.com/2023/11/07/lmpd-arrests-man-polling-location-alleged-interference/"> Louisville, Kentucky</a> Tuesday morning and arrested 40-year-old Jacen Cockerell who was wielding a flag attached to a fishing pole and allegedly made threatening gestures toward voters. Cockerell is accused of intimidating at least one voter, preventing them from casting their vote. The arrest citation said Cockerell also damaged a voting machine by ripping off the printer attached to it. He was arrested and charged with two counts of menacing, one count of tampering, destruction of a voting machine, and election interference.</p>
<p>There were at least two reported incidents involving guns at polling place. An incident involving a man who allegedly brandished a sidearm in a threatening fashion at a polling place in<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-ptb-munster-poll-gun-st-1109-20231108-iwzozjqterakxazqc7dxgp2loq-story.html"> Munster, Indiana</a> is under investigation, according to officials. Munster Police Chief Steve Scheckel said police are investigating the incident that happened Tuesday afternoon involving a man who allegedly was wearing a sidearm. “From what I understand, he got in an argument with another person at the poll,” Scheckel said. In<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/crime/2023/11/man-who-left-wallet-at-harrisburg-polling-place-brought-7-guns-along-to-retrieve-it-police.html"> Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a> a man who forgot his wallet at a polling place threatened workers and brought a gun to the building over $100 he claimed was missing according to police. Police said officers made it to the polling place before Lassiter returned and made contact with him as he was pulling into the parking lot. Lassiter is charged with disorderly conduct, making terroristic threats and possession of instruments of a crime.</p>
<p>Fist fights, brawls, commotions, whatever you call them, dust-ups between candidates and others broke out in several areas on Tuesday.

<p><strong>Poll Workers</strong><br />
A number of poll workers were recognized for their long service to democracy.

In<a href="https://www.wabi.tv/2023/11/07/maine-volunteer-works-local-election-day-before-100th-birthday/"> Ellsworth, Maine</a>, poll worker Sylvia Lock spent the day before her 100th birthday working the polls like she always does. Lock has been working at the polls since she moved to Ellsworth in 1978.<a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2023/11/08/roanoke-poll-worker-retiring-after-37-years-volunteering/"> Roanoke, Virginia</a> poll worker Jane Smith has worked her last election after manning the polls for 37 years. She signed up after hearing about the need when voting in 1986. In<a href="https://sanduskyregister.com/news/489336/a-persistent-poll-worker/"> Erie County, Ohio</a>, for more than 50 years, Shirley Mapus has served as a local poll worker on Election Days in November and at other times, such as during primaries.</p>
<p>“Every election, she never says, no. She’s such a joy, and when she comes in, she was here at 6:59 this morning, not even scheduled until 7:30. She truly just enjoys serving the public and being a volunteer and a community servant,&#8221; Toni Dyer, City of Ellsworth city clerk said of Lock.</p>
<p>In Roanoke, Smith acknowledged the time commitment, but noted that it was worth it.</p>
<p>“We are charged that we do it safely. And we do it according to law. And so, it’s an important job,” explained Smith. “And besides, you get to see everybody in the smiles and it’s a beautiful day, and you’re helping the process without being in the process.”</p>
<p>In<a href="https://kdvr.com/news/politics/colorado-politics-news/sibling-election-judges-in-jefferson-county/"> Jefferson County, Colorado</a>, siblings Carissa Thompson and Mark Lauwers serve as election judges to honor their mother Teri, who wanted to be an election judge before her sudden passing last year. “The two of us were talking about doing this together this year, and then she passed the next week, so that was really hard. It was a shock. It was not anything expected,” Thompson said. As difficult as it has been moving on with life after her passing, the pair signed up to work at the elections office in her honor while serving their community. “The political duress that’s been out there — I want to be a part of something that can reinvigorate the election system and just be a part of our civic duty to be part of the election process, and just see how it works from the inside instead of just putting my ballot in the mail and letting that go and seeing the results, then that’s it,” Lauwers said.</p>
<p><strong>Et Fin</strong><br />
As longtime readers of electionline know, it’s not officially an Election Day until somewhere in America,<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2019/08-15/"> a car crashes into a polling place</a> — and hopefully no one is hurt. This year was no exception and there was an added bonus of a fender bender in a<a href="https://www.kxly.com/news/it-felt-reckless-kootenai-county-elections-office-sees-trouble-before-election-day/article_3cbcbf40-7781-11ee-b2ec-0f047d478500.html"> Kootenai County, Idaho</a> early voting location parking lot and in<a href="https://coloradosun.com/2023/11/03/aurora-church-ballot-box/"> Adams County, Colorado</a> a construction vehicle destroyed a ballot drop box.

Katie Hobbs, who previously served as the secretary of state, recently<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/02/hobbs-seeks-arizona-elections-boost-with-executive-orders-funding-allocation/71425286007/"> issued several executive orders</a> based on recommendations from an elections administration task force. In addition to the executive orders, she announced that $2.3 million in coronavirus relief funding would go toward the changes. The funding comes from Arizona&#8217;s share of the American Rescue Plan Act. It will fund an elections fellowship program to train and recruit election workers, and provide temporary staffing for counties ahead of next year&#8217;s election. The funds will help maintain the state&#8217;s voter registration database, pay for security and poll worker recruitment, and support other election initiatives. The governor&#8217;s executive orders give Arizonans more opportunities to register to vote, make state facilities available as voting locations, and allow state employees to work the polls on election days while still collecting their paychecks. Two of those orders make permanent changes implemented by former Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, during the 2020 election cycle to accommodate the coronavirus pandemic and adequately staff polling locations. One executive order allows state employees to take paid leave to work at polls during a statewide election beginning as soon as the March presidential preference election. It directs the Arizona Department of Administration, the state workforce&#8217;s human resources department, to make rules expanding what is formally called civic duty leave, which permits employees to be paid if they go to vote or serve as jurors. Another executive order allows state buildings to be used as polling places or ballot drop-off sites in any statewide election.</p>

By comparison, 6% think AI will decrease the spread of misinformation while one-third say it won’t make much of a difference. Just 30% of American adults have used AI chatbots or image generators and fewer than half (46%) have heard or read at least some about AI tools. Still, there’s a broad consensus that candidates shouldn’t be using AI. When asked whether it would be a good or bad thing for 2024 presidential candidates to use AI in certain ways, clear majorities said it would be bad for them to create false or misleading media for political ads (83%), to edit or touch-up photos or videos for political ads (66%), to tailor political ads to individual voters (62%) and to answer voters’ questions via chatbot (56%). The sentiments are supported by majorities of Republicans and Democrats, who agree it would be a bad thing for the presidential candidates to create false images or videos (85% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats) or to answer voter questions (56% of Republicans and 63% of Democrats). The poll found that Americans are more likely to consult the news media (46%), friends and family (29%), and social media (25%) for information about the presidential election than AI chatbots. The vast majority of Americans are similarly skeptical toward the information AI chatbots spit out. Just 5% say they are extremely or very confident that the information is factual, while 33% are somewhat confident, according to the survey. Most adults (61%) say they are not very or not at all confident that the information is reliable. Americans largely see preventing AI-generated false or misleading information during the 2024 presidential elections as a shared responsibility. About 6 in 10 (63%) say a lot of the responsibility falls on the technology companies that create AI tools, but about half give a lot of that duty to the news media (53%), social media companies (52%), and the federal government (49%). The poll of 1,017 adults was conducted Oct. 19-23, 2023, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, designed to represent the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.</p>

The Ready, Set, Vote! patch program is the first of its kind in Girl Scouting and was born out of a partnership between Girl Scouts River Valleys and the<a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/secretary-simon-honors-girl-scouts-for-voter-outreach-efforts/"> Office of the Secretary of State</a> following the recent passage of the Democracy for the People Act, which includes a provision allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote. “We know that when people are engaged in democracy at a young age, they are more likely to remain engaged throughout their lives,” said Simon. “Each Girl Scout who earns this new patch is not only becoming more involved in their government themselves, but they are also learning about the value of bringing their community along with them.” Girl Scouts earned their patches by reading a letter from the Secretary of State’s office, completing a practice voter registration form, researching who represents them at different levels of government, and sharing what they learned with three friends to encourage civic engagement by young people. “The world changes for the better when young people find their voices and learn how to use them,” says<a href="https://www.girlscoutsrv.org/en/news/girl-scouts-river-valleys-launches-new-early-voter-education-patch-in-partnership-with-sec-of-state.html"> Girl Scouts River Valleys</a> CEO, Marisa C. Williams. “Our Girl Scouts are doing just that by enthusiastically kicking off their voting journeys, becoming more informed and engaged constituents, and calling upon their peers to do the same. These seemingly small actions make a profound difference at an important time for our democracy.” As many as 800 local Girl Scouts will be eligible to earn the patch this year, which will prepare them to pre-register as voters, so they’re fully prepared to vote in their first election. One question, is it too late to earn one of these? This editor’s stint in the Girl Scouts ended sometime in the very early 80s, but once a Girl Scout always a Girl Scout right?!</p>

Holbrook’s drawing of a flag-toting “I voted” manatee was selected from among 50 pieces of art turned in as part of the Manatee County Supervisor of Elections&#8217; local contest that has become a fun tradition for Manatee County high school students in recent years. During non-election years, the SOE has worked with the School District to solicit art from future voters around the county. This year, the SOE invited Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Manatee County members to the competition. Lauren’s design, 1 of 16 submitted by Club members, will appear on 300,000 stickers. “I took a civics class in school last year and understand the importance of voting,” Lauren said regarding her inspiration to enter the contest. “My family is very excited that I won. I appreciate my Boys &amp; Girls Club for encouraging me to submit my design.” “Lauren’s design will be proudly displayed by voters across the county in March, August, and November of 2024 when our voters exercise their right to participate in the election process,” said Supervisor of Elections Mike Bennett. “I extend sincere thanks to each Manatee County high school student whose interest and creativity led them to participate in this fun and challenging contest, and to the valued teachers and mentors who guide and encourage. We enjoyed seeing all of the wonderful designs, and wish you the very best as you go forward.”</p>

She was 80. Snipes served as a longtime elections supervisor, being elected to full terms in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016. Snipes’ staff listed a number of her office’s accomplishments through the years: Increasing voter education outreach, offering a robust high school pre-registration program for students about to turn 18, being the first supervisor to publish ballots in three languages, and making sure the county had up-to-date voting equipment. Joe Scott, Broward County’s current Supervisor of Elections, called Snipes “excellent at recognizing talent.” He said many of the staff working in the Broward elections office today were hired and trained under Snipes’ tenure. “The success our office has with outreach and voter turnout can be attributed to her vision for the county,” Scott said. “She has made a footprint in touching the lives of children who are now leaders in our community. It’s an honor for our office to continue her legacy.” After working as a teacher and principal, Snipes was appointed to the supervisor’s role in 2003 by then-Gov. Jeb Bush.</p>

He was 71.  “He will be truly missed but his presence will always be here with us,” said Wandy Taylor, chairwoman of the Gwinnett County Board of Registrations and Elections. “He has made such an indelible impression in Gwinnett County.” Day was involved in the Gwinnett County Democratic Party for more than 30 years, including a stint as chairman from 1992 to 1996. He was also part of the Democratic Party of Georgia. He served on the county elections board for more than 10 years, including a two-year term as chairman from 2017-19. Candidates came to see him as an expert on election law issues, said Steve Reilly, a close friend and former county party chairman. Day recently served on a state-appointed panel that reviewed Fulton County elections. On the Gwinnett elections board, Day was part of a majority that last year threw out conservative efforts to disqualify tens of thousands of voters. He led the board when it came under fire in 2018 for its high absentee ballot rejection rate. At the time, he called for clearer state laws — and mature behavior from vitriolic residents.</p>

Researchers at<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"> Reed College’s Elections and Voting Information Center</a> (EVIC) spent months interviewing nearly all Oregon county clerks and have compiled the sobering findings in a study to be<a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023I1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/277604"> presented before the Legislature this week</a>.  “This report is a grim but realistic look at what our county clerks face,” said Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade. “But it’s also a testament to their professionalism and ingenuity.” The researchers found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staffing recruitment and retention is hampered by out-of-date job classifications, compensations, and perceptions of the work. Staffing today is at or below staffing levels from a decade ago.</li>
<li>Public records requests are becoming increasingly burdensome, as false information is spread and distrust in elections systems continues to fuel more frequent and complicated requests for information.</li>
<li>Local elections offices are experiencing retirements, resignations, and loss of expertise. Since 2020, 34% of county clerks have retired or resigned.</li>
<li>Oregon’s funding model for county elections, dependent largely on fluctuations in interest rates and the real estate market, is inadequate for election needs. Counties are already laying off workers because of this outdated funding model.</li>
<li>Elections officials and staff are subject to unacceptable levels of abuse, threats, and harassment, driving many of them to quit despite expressing their pride and passion for the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a flashing red light on the dashboard,&#8221; said Paul Manson, the research director with Reed College&#8217;s Elections and Voting Information Center.</p>
<p>Manson told<a href="https://www.klcc.org/politics-government/2023-11-06/study-election-staffing-lags-behind-growth-of-oregon-voterbase"> KLCC</a> since automatic voter registration was introduced in 2016, election workers have had to field more questions from an influx of new voters. Meanwhile, he said they&#8217;ve faced an increasingly politicized environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The job has changed fundamentally,&#8221; said Manson. &#8220;These frontline workers and managers are interpreting laws and helping voters access their constitutional rights, while managing public records requests and media requests.&#8221;</p>

Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) introduced the legislation Tuesday — election day in several states — to add Election Day to the list of federally recognized holidays. Fitzpatrick said the change would allow all Americans “more flexibility and accessibility” to cast their ballots and Dingell said she wanted to make it easier, not harder, for Americans to vote. The<a href="https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/_cache/files/1/f/1f7cda31-4b1a-49e9-b9b4-f322b51e91bc/F8112BCEB7BA7ED7A166D292D6794281.text---election-day-act.pdf"> legislation</a> is brief and does not include many of the features that have been combined in previous attempts to make Election Day a holiday, such as increased access to mail-in voting. 65%. That’s the percentage of Americans who said they support making election day a national holiday, according to a 2018 poll from Pew Research Center. There have been a number of bills introduced in both the Senate and the House in recent years to attempt to make Election Day a federal holiday. In 2018, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced legislation to make Election Day a holiday, but it was never voted on. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) introduced legislation to do the same in 2021 but it also never saw a vote. In 2022, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act received the support of nearly all Democrats in the Senate but fell short of the votes needed to pass. That legislation would have made Election Day a national holiday, automatically registered all voters and ensured access to mail-in ballots, but it was not successful. Most recently, over the summer, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) introduced legislation that would make Election Day a national holiday and would also create an automatic online voter registration system and require that all states offer voters same-day registration. In July, King<a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/maine-senator-introduces-bill-to-make-election-day-a-public-holiday-election-interference-january-6-donald-trump-electoral-college-popular-vote-voter-registration-turnout-participation-gerrymandering-dark-money-spending-democracy"> said</a> his legislation had the support of 40 senators.</p>

Berny Jacques, R-Seminole, and Rep. Taylor Yarkosky, R-Montverde, filed the bill (HB 359) for consideration during the legislative session that will start in January.  Under current law, counties must use electronic or what are known as “electromechanical” systems to tabulate votes.  But the bill, filed a year before the 2024 elections, would allow votes to be counted by hand.  The bill, in part, also would prevent the Florida Department of State from authorizing voting systems that use hardware or software designed, owned or licensed by foreign companies.</p>

Kara Hope (D-Holt), sets penalties for intimidating or preventing an election official from performing their duties.  A violation of the law would be a misdemeanor punishable by 93-days imprisonment or a fine of up to $500, or both. A second violation would increase penalties to a $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison. A third violation would be a felony, punishable by a $1,000 fine and up to five years in prison. The bill defines election officials as a public officer, public employee, election inspector, member of the Board of State Canvassers, member of a board of county canvassers, member of an absent voter counting board, county clerk, or city or township clerk who has a duty to perform in connection with an election conducted under the Michigan Election Law. It also defines intimidation as “a willful course of conduct involving harassment of another individual that is intended to cause the individual to fear physical injury, that would cause a reasonable individual to fear physical injury, and actually causes the individual to fear physical injury.” It would not include constitutionally protected activity or conduct that serves a legitimate purpose. The Democratic-led package passed along party lines.</p>
<p>Members of the House also voted to advance a set of bipartisan bills<a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/17/lawmakers-push-forward-on-package-addressing-deepfakes-in-political-ads/"> which would require disclaimers</a> on political ads with audio, images or videos generated using artificial intelligence and create penalties for trying to deceive voters close to an election by using deepfake technology. Under these regulations, qualified political advertisements pertaining to any candidate, election or ballot question would have to clearly and conspicuously state that they were wholly or partially generated by the use of AI, with different requirements based on the advertisements format. Failing to meet these rules would result in a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. Maximum fines for a second violation would be raised to $1,500. A third and any subsequent offense would be a felony punishable by a fine of up to $2,000, two years in prison or both. Each advertisement aired or distributed would be considered a separate violation. The bills also place restrictions on individuals outside of a campaign committee who circulate political materials created by AI without including a disclaimer and create exceptions for parody ads and some exceptions for the media.</p>
<p>The House has passed a bill allowing<a href="https://www.9and10news.com/2023/11/08/michigan-house-passes-bill-to-allow-voting-preregistration-for-16-17-year-olds/"> 16 and 17 year-olds to pre-register</a> to vote in a move that advocates hope will expand civic participation. The bill passed in a 56-53 party line vote, with all Democrats supporting the measure and all present Republicans voting against it. Currently, teenagers in Michigan are able to register to vote at the age of 17 years and 6 months, becoming eligible to vote in elections beginning on their 18th birthday. Under the bill, 16 and 17 year-old applicants would be allowed to pre-register their information before beginning the currently established voter registration process. Applicants are required to have lived in Michigan for at least 30 days and attest that they live in the township or city in which they’re applying. Upon turning 17 and 6 months, an applicant would become a registered elector and become eligible to vote in the first election occurring on or after their 18th birthday. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Betsy Coffia, D-Traverse City, who said the measure would increase civic participation and investment in elections.</p>

And elections would only be allowed on two days – one in April and one in November – while still offering the early voting options voters already have. The legislation would also require all municipalities to use the state voting system in their local elections. The bill’s sponsor says a handful of smaller cities and towns are using their own systems for their own elections, but the State Election Commission wants everyone under the same system for all races. “It gives confidence to the voter because imagine if you’re a voting and you’ve always voted on our system, and you walk in there, and there’s something different in front of you for this election,” Newton said. “It’s confusion, but also, it hurts the trust in the system because why are you using a different system for just this one election?” The House passed this bill earlier this year – and a group of senators has been working on it this fall. But the full Senate won’t be able to debate and vote on it – until the legislature returns here in January. Senators are also considering closing a loophole in state law that requires incumbents to stay in office – potentially against their will – if a candidate challenges municipal election results. Their amendment would, instead, allow the winner to take office, once results have been certified – while the challenge proceeds in the court system.</p>

The resolution was sponsored by five lawmakers including Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and a frequent adversary of Vos.  The<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/reg/asm/resolution/ar18"> resolution</a> alleges Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe encouraged local election clerks to ignore state laws on things like absentee ballot application procedures and ballot drop boxes. It also alleges Wolfe&#8217;s actions promoted out-of-state actors whose objective was &#8220;to administer Wisconsin&#8217;s elections in 2020 and aid in the defeat of President Donald Trump,&#8221; echoing an unsubstantiated claim often floated by Trump himself. Wolfe has repeatedly denied that she took any actions as administrator with the aim of favoring either party, calling those suggestions conspiracy theories. Brandtjen first circulated the impeachment resolution for cosponsors on Sept. 21. After it was officially introduced Thursday, Vos assigned the resolution to the Assembly Committee on Government Accountability and Oversight, a step his office described as a simple procedural move, telling WisPolitics it was &#8220;referred like any other bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Senate voted Nov. 7 to approve<a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/wisconsin-senate-approves-three-republican-backed-elections-amendments-to-the-state-constitution/"> three proposed amendments</a> to the state constitution addressing conservative concerns about elections administration. The proposed legislation would outlaw private funding for elections administration, enshrine existing voter photo ID requirements in the state constitution and specify that only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in state and local elections. The Nov. 7 votes along party lines were the Senate’s second round of approval for the proposals to outlaw private elections funding and specify that only U.S. citizens can vote in local elections. GOP leaders have said they plan to put those amendments before voters in the statewide April and November 2024 elections, respectively. The Assembly was scheduled to vote Nov. 9 on all three amendments advanced by the Senate.</p>

Plaintiffs include political advocacy groups Mi Familia Vota, Voto Latino, and the Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander for Equity Coalition, as well as the Tohono O&#8217;odham Nation, the Democratic National Committee and others.  The challenged laws are<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/76970"> House Bill 2492</a> and<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/76970"> House Bill 2243</a>. Passed in 2022, the laws are blocked from taking effect until the conclusion of the trial. The laws require already registered voters to show proof of citizenship to remain registered to vote in presidential elections or vote in any federal election by mail, and require county recorders to terminate registration of anyone who hasn’t provided the necessary documents.  Plaintiffs argue the laws place an unnecessary burden on those who are already eligible to vote but don’t have access to the required documents: a birth certificate, passport, driver’s license, tribal identification number or a naturalization number. Witnesses also challenged provisions of the laws requiring voters to write their place of birth on their registration form, which is optional under current law. The laws require recorder’s office employees to use five federal databases to verify citizenship status: the state Motor Vehicle Department, the Social Security Administration, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement program, the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, and “any other state, city, town, county or federal database” that the county recorder has access to.</p>

The integrity of the election on whether to oust Councilmember Jessie Lopez first came under legal scrutiny when Orange County Registrar Bob Page alerted the city in late October to what he said was an error in the district boundaries used to define the recall. State law requires that, in the case of a local recall election, ballots go to voters within the district boundaries as they existed when the official was elected. Santa Ana, like many cities in California, went through redistricting after the 2020 Census and the boundaries of the city&#8217;s Ward 3, represented by Lopez, shifted while she was in office. But the city used, and the registrar accepted, the district&#8217;s current boundaries and population size to determine the number of signatures needed to trigger an election and who should get to vote. Griffin denied the request Tuesday during a hearing in Santa Ana and scheduled another court date for January 2024. Tim Rush, who chairs the recall campaign against Lopez, said his group followed what they thought was the law. &#8220;We did exactly as we were told by the election official,&#8221; he said. In this case, the election official is the Santa Ana city clerk. The registrar&#8217;s office is administering the election on behalf of the city.</p>

We have absolute autonomy, and we really don’t rely on anyone or any entity for us to do that. The same cannot be said of voting.”  Kobach is asking the high court to overturn of a court of appeals decision that declared voting a fundamental state constitutional right. If Justices choose to uphold the ruling, the Republican-dominated Legislature would be restricted in the extent to which they can pass election legislation in the future, because the right to vote would be held to the same high standard of protection as other constitutional rights, such as abortion.  Kobach’s underlying argument is that Kansans’ right to vote has not been impeded by state law restricting the number of advance ballots a person can deliver to an election office. He also argues that state law requiring election volunteers to verify signatures on advance ballots is not unduly burdensome — a notion voting advocacy groups have fought against. His opponent Elisabeth Frost, an attorney representing several voting rights advocacy groups in the case, said “signature matching is worse than flipping a coin,” in terms of accuracy, and said Kansas had been “securing elections just fine” without the additional measures.</p>

The court<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/11/02/minnesota-appeals-court-says-mille-lacs-judge-overstepped-in-blocking-felon-voting-rights"> granted a writ of prohibition</a> against Mille Lacs County District Court Judge Matthew Quinn two weeks after Quinn handed down sentences that contained an identical memo calling a new voting law unconstitutional. In the order, Chief Judge Susan Segal wrote that Quinn had no authority to declare unconstitutional the law that allows people with felony convictions to vote after they complete their prison sentences. And Segal said Quinn’s actions were “unauthorized by law.” Two of the individuals barred from voting as part of their sentences appealed the rulings and called on the Court of Appeals to prevent Quinn from issuing similar sentences in the future. State Public Defender Bill Ward, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Secretary of State Steve Simon and the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota signed on in support. The court’s legal direction vacates the orders and blocks similar actions in the future.</p>

The law, which took effect in January, created a new type of &#8220;affidavit ballot&#8221; for first-time voters who don’t show proper identification and proof of residency at the polls. Those who fail to provide the documents within seven days will have their ballots thrown out, and the vote totals would be adjusted. Previously, such voters filled out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days, and those who didn’t could be investigated and charged with fraud. But the votes themselves remained valid. Several individual voter and advocacy groups filed lawsuits last year, days after Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed the bill into law. They argued that it violates the right to privacy the state added to its constitution in 2018 because it would diminish the secrecy of ballots and tie voters’ names to the candidates for whom they voted. But a judge recently granted a request from the secretary of state and attorney general to dismiss the cases. Temple agreed with the defendants that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law. The individual plaintiffs already are registered to vote and thus can’t argue the changes will harm them, he said. And they don’t have standing as taxpayers objecting to the expenditure of public funds, he said, because the law doesn’t appropriate money.</p>

He was put on paid administrative leave in early August by the elections board after Sheriff Dave Duchak notified the board a complaint had been received about questionable procurement practices.  The sheriff’s office has completed the investigation, and Prosecutor Tony Kendell said a criminal charge is pending. Ridgeway acknowledged that in his statement, writing, “I understand that criminal charges will be issued, and I will be held accountable for my error in judgment.” A date for a court hearing was not yet available. The report filed by sheriff’s investigators and obtained this week stated the complaint came from the county auditor’s office and involved allegations of forgery and tampering with records.</p>

Alaina Lofgran was charged by the Utah Attorney General&#8217;s Office on Thursday with eight counts including willful neglect of duty, destroying ballots, destroying public records, all third-degree felonies; tampering with ballots, a class A misdemeanor; improper distribution of ballots and unofficial misconduct, a class B misdemeanor. The case against Lofgran began when Lt. Governor Deidre Henderson sought an investigation earlier this year. An affidavit filed with the charges accused Lofgran of not preserving thousands of ballots from the 2020 election for the 22 months required by law. They were discovered missing as a result of a lawsuit over elections in the county. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes&#8217; office alleges ballots from the 2022 election were found in a shred bin. &#8220;A week or two later, shortly after Thanksgiving 2022, the deputy county clerk observed Defendant putting the 2022 ballots in the shred bin again. The deputy county clerk asked Defendant what she was doing. Defendant responded that they had completed the election reports and stated, &#8216;we don’t need them anymore,&#8217; referring to the 2022 ballots,&#8221; Utah Attorney General&#8217;s investigator B. Smith wrote in the affidavit. &#8220;The deputy county clerk questioned Defendant, asking if the office had &#8216;learn[ed] our lesson&#8217; about throwing the ballots out. Defendant repeated that the county did not need the ballots anymore.&#8221;</p>

That’s also a felony, and if convicted, they could be sentenced to two to 12 years in prison, fined, and never be able to regain the right to vote. The Montgomery County District Attorney and the county’s administrator of elections have said generally that prosecutions of this type have occurred in the past as part of a continuing effort to maintain accurate voter rolls. The current cases were brought before a Montgomery County grand jury in August, and defendants were indicted that month. Arrest warrants went out in August, defendants were arrested and cases went to  court in September.  Bond was initially set at $2,500.</p>

In public letters issued to Colorado County, Runnels County, Smith County and Upton County, the department detailed its findings following its investigation and asked the counties to work with the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorneys&#8217; Offices for the Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Districts of Texas to resolve the identified civil rights violations. The election websites for the four Texas counties provide important information about how to vote, such as registration requirements, identification requirements and voting information for people with disabilities. The websites also link to other critical information, including details about early voting and voting on election day. The department found that the websites are not accessible to those who are blind or have low vision, or who cannot grasp a mouse, and use screen readers, keyboards or other assistive technology. For example, on all four of the election websites, menus and links do not function properly for people who use a keyboard to navigate, and posted documents are inaccessible to people who use assistive technologies. Because the election websites are inaccessible, the counties deny people with vision and manual disabilities equal access to election programs and online services provided through these websites and fail to ensure effective communication with people with disabilities.</p>

According to The Washington Post, Gibbons’s suit s among the first in the country to make that argument. The Supreme Court has held that it is illegal to fire most government workers over politics. Her attorney hopes it will be a test case, drawing a line in the sand that will help other election workers under partisan political fire. In 2022, Republican Betty Gibbs was installed on the Lynchburg election board, along with one Democrat and another Republican. Gibbons’s lawsuit claims the Republican Party withdrew election Gibbs from a nomination to the election board in 2019 because she had allegedly violated election procedures as a poll worker by twice closing electronic polling books that help election workers track voters during elections. Gibbs denies the allegations in a response her attorney filed to Gibbons’s lawsuit. Gibbons’s lawsuit also alleges that Gibbs told a Republican who worked for the election office, Aimee Mayer, that she planned to delete from the absentee voter rolls anyone whose ballot was returned as undeliverable, in violation of the process set by state and federal law. In court filings in response to Gibbons’s lawsuit, the attorney for Gibbs and Steve Troxel denied any political motivation for the registrar’s removal and said state law allows the board to replace the registrar at the end of his or her term every four years. Troxel and Gibbs seriously considered Gibbons for the job but thought her performance was deficient, according to the filings. They said that Gibbons had communication issues with the board and the public and that her ability to train election workers was poor, and they cited the mistake she made while processing absentee ballots in 2020 as well as other errors. Gibbs also said Gibbons was unwilling to work with her. Gibbons said that was inaccurate. he suit claims that Gibbons’s removal was illegal because the Supreme Court has held that many public employees cannot be dismissed for solely partisan reasons, since it violates their First Amendment right to free speech and political association. The opening paragraph of the lawsuit asserts that the board was intent on pressing Trump’s “big lie” and the “ancillary supposition that local election administrators who are not part of their Republican faction are not to be trusted.” The lawsuit cites Gibbs’s alleged comments about wanting to remove Gibbons even before she was on the election board, her statements on Jan. 6, 2021, and her accusations of corruption in the registrar’s office among other evidence that her motivation was political. Gibbons is seeking a preliminary injunction to be reinstalled as registrar, but a hearing has been delayed while an appeals court weighs the defendants’ motion to dismiss the suit. A lower-court judge denied it.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/events/america-at-250-democracy-and-the-american-revolution/">America at 250: Democracy and the American Revolution</a>: The year 2026 marks the 250th anniversary of American independence, yet the nation’s founding is controversial now in ways it has not been in decades. In the inaugural symposium of AEI’s “We Hold These Truths: America at 250” project, renowned historians and political scientists will explore what the contested idea of democracy meant to participants in the American Revolution. For some, democracy represented a way to organize government, while others understood it to be the transformative philosophical bedrock of the new republic’s political, social, and cultural institutions. Examining the democratic culture that the American Revolution created can help us understand the framework within which we continue to debate the structure and purpose of the system of government that binds us together today. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 15 at 9am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online and Washington, DC.</p>
<p><a href="https://issueone.org/events/conspiracies-on-social-media-when-nothing-is-true-and-everything-is-possible/">Conspiracies on Social Media: When Nothing Is True, and Everything Is Possible</a>: Conspiracy theories are intriguing, shocking, and often ridiculous. But too often, these theories take hold and have very real consequences, including undermining public trust in the media and our government, and in extreme cases, inciting violence and ripping families and communities apart. When accepted at scale, conspiracy theories threaten the stability of our democracy. Social media has given new life to conspiracy theories and false information, propelling them around the world in the blink of an eye, giving greater power to conflict entrepreneurs, and forming powerful communities around conspiracies. Over time, conspiracism eats away at the broader information ecosystem, making it difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. This is especially true in non-English speaking communities, where content moderation has been less robust. Conspiracies on Social Media: When Nothing Is True, and Everything Is Possible — an event sponsored by Issue One’s Council For Responsible Social Media — will convene experts in democracy, technology, and information integrity for an analysis of how we reached this point, what about the design of social media makes it such a powerful tool for false information, and what we can do to fortify our information ecosystem ahead of the 2024 election. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 15, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/events/defending-democracy-environment/">Defending Democracy</a>: Authoritarian exploitation of the world’s natural resources — with China and Russia at the forefront — is increasingly an issue of national and global security. It is a threat to the resurging alliance of democracies and the effort to roll back authoritarian actors globally. China’s appetite for natural resources to feed its economic growth has undermined democratic institutions and environmental commitments, leaving local communities across the globe exposed to environmental exploitation and degradation with little political recourse given the involvement of their government in opaque and illicit deals. Similarly, Russia’s war against Ukraine has had severe environmental impacts, and its access to natural resources in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East help bypass sanctions, and fund its growing network of state-supported private military groups, like the Wagner Group, to prop up unpopular, exploitative regimes that are its allies. Both China and Russia exploit the environment as an instrument of authoritarian political and economic control, such as in Tibet and in Ukraine’s eastern provinces. Simultaneously, there is growing awareness and unified action among the community of democracies to stem the worldwide rise in authoritarianism, and to demonstrate the ability of democracies to better deliver on the issues that matter to citizens globally, like the environment. Against this backdrop, join NDI and Foreign Policy as we highlight the people and policies that have become “game changers” to strengthen democracy and civic activism, protect the environment and natural resources, and help defenders of democracy counter illiberal influences in their own countries. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 15, 10 a.m. Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_2bOEy9VuSMqgTa2gxVDbjg#/">Covering the Risks to Elections on the State and Local Level: Views from the Beat Reporters</a>: The Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA promotes research, collaboration, and advocacy under the leadership of UCLA Law Professor Richard L. Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Jonathan Lai (Philadelphia Inquirer, Politico), Carrie Levine (Votebeat), Patrick Marley (WaPo), and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez (WaPo).

<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2023/11/17/eac-virtual-meeting-voluntary-electronic-poll-book-pilot-program-report-november">EAC Virtual Meeting on E-poll Book Pilot Program Report</a>: On Friday, November 17, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) will host a virtual public meeting on the 2023 EAC Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Pilot Program Report.

The Commissioners will also hear a presentation from Jay Phelps, Director of the EAC’s Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP), on the pilot report. <strong>When:</strong> November 17, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/events/structural-election-reform-what-is-happening-in-the-states/">Structural Election Reform: What is Happening in the States</a>?: A bipartisan bill recently introduced in the Wisconsin legislature would enact final-five voting for state elections. Next year’s mayoral election in Burlington, Vermont, will be conducted using ranked-choice voting. And Idaho citizens may be voting in 2024 on a ballot initiative to consider opening its partisan primaries. Various states, counties, and municipalities are enacting systemic election reforms, aiming to improve governance by altering the incentives of candidates running for elected office. These reforms include preferential voting (e.g., ranked-choice voting), open primaries, jungle primaries and runoff elections, proportional representation, and nonpartisan redistricting. Where are these reforms occurring, and what concerns are prompting these changes? Join AEI’s Kevin R. Kosar and a panel of experts for a discussion on how efforts to enact systemic election reforms might shape the future of American politics. <strong>When:</strong> Dec. 4, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
