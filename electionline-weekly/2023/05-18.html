							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>​​<strong>A key, a map, and a bible</strong><br />
<em>Successful succession planning requires all three</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Since 2019, North Carolina has had 49 changes in county elections directors. In some of the state’s 100 counties those leadership roles have changed more than once in that timeframe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-9729" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18B-1024x570.png" alt="" width="354" height="197" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18B-1024x570.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18B-300x167.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18B-768x428.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18B.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" />“With such a significant change in personnel, we struggle to fill the void of institutional knowledge, and the State Board has to put even more effort and emphasis on filling that void when all other projects, legislative changes, and statutory responsibilities do not stop,” said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the<a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/"> North Carolina Board of Elections</a>.</p>
<p>There is no elections’ master plan for transitions within the elections field. Brinson Bell said that in  an ideal world, there’s succession planning, but in small and medium-sized jurisdictions, that’s not always possible. She added that no matter if it’s because of retirement, something untimely, or someone winning the lottery, it’s imperative to cross train and document procedures to make for a smoother transition.</p>
<p>“Transitions should come with a key, a map, and a bible, said Noah Praetz with<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group</a>. “The key gets access to facilities and people. The map calendars daily election management &#8211; offering accountability and a chance at getting through an election in one piece.  And a standard operations bible ensures trusted and sure footing along the way.”</p>
<p>Praetz noted that most incoming elections officials are only given a key. Some are offered a map. Few are given a bible.</p>
<p>North Carolina’s transition numbers will soon jump again when longtime<a href="https://www.wake.gov/departments-government/board-elections"> Wake County</a> Elections Director<a href="https://www.wake.gov/news/longtime-elections-director-set-retire-may"> Gary Sims retires at the end of the month</a>. Sims had planned to retire in 2021, but he wanted to make sure his successor would have the keys, a map and most importantly the bible.</p>
<div id="attachment_9730" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9730" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9730" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SimsMcCall-300x287.png" alt="" width="300" height="287" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SimsMcCall-300x287.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SimsMcCall-768x735.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SimsMcCall.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9730" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Olivia McCall and Gary Sims</em>.</p></div>
<p>“This truly is retirement. I was going to in 2021, but I wanted to see us on the other side of the pandemic, and I wanted to get us through the 2022 elections knowing how things have changed after the 2020 elections. Timing is everything,” Sims said. “I have been working all these years to build an office with amazing staff, a good organizational plan, and have the resources available to take on the rapid growth and size of this county. If everything was not perfectly in place, I would have never considered it.”</p>
<p>Incoming Wake County Elections Director Olivia McCall has probably come as close to anyone as getting a transition bible. McCall joined the team in Wake in 2008 right out of college and worked her way up through the ranks. Sims said if he didn’t think McCall was the right person at the right time for the job, he would have stuck around for a bit longer.</p>
<p>“Since I decided to stay after 2021, Olivia and other key staff knew my timeline. This gave us two years to focus on a successful transition to carry on and have successful, open, and fair elections moving into the future,” Sims said. “Olivia has been my right hand for many years, and she is included in every single thing I do and the direction this office moves in. Trust is key, and I trust her to carry on in something I have devoted so much of my life to.”</p>
<p>For McCall, she noted that the transition to director is bittersweet since she will miss working with Sims, but she said she’s ready for this next chapter, thanks to the effort Sims has put in.</p>
<p>“This is not a transition that happens overnight, succession planning is real and Gary has made it a priority to leave the organization knowing that our team will be able to expand on our solid foundation and bring new and innovative ideas to elections,” McCall said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-9728" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18A-1024x576.png" alt="" width="382" height="215" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18A-1024x576.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18A-300x169.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18A-768x432.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18A-1536x865.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Newser05.18A.png 1908w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" />Brinson Bell said the state board has considerable efforts to improve communication with the counties, increase support, and expand training opportunities. New directors complete a week-long, intensive New Director Training program, which covers the most practical items like processing voter registration forms and list maintenance procedures to the managerial duties like budgeting.</p>
<p>“Throughout the year, we have Huddles twice per month to provide legislative and legal updates, refreshers on procedures, and training from our partners like the U.S. Postal Service and CISA,” Brinson Bell said. “We hold statewide conferences for elections office staff and board members once in odd years before municipal elections and then also before the even-year primary and general elections. And possibly most importantly, we’ve developed a collaborative approach to work by creating HUBS (Help Us Be Successful), which are groups of state and county staff organized around key subject areas like in-person voting and voting systems. Procedural documents, website content, new initiatives and more are developed and vetted through the HUBS to engage the stakeholders who are making elections happen in our state.”</p>
<p>McCall said one thing that Sims taught her is you can’t do it all, you have to be able to get the right people in the right place in your organization and work together as team, share your knowledge and empower others to bring the next great idea. McCall also added that Sims showed her is not to be afraid to show your passion for what you do in elections. Brinson Bell echoed this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9731" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WakeCoNCEarlyVoteSticker-300x293.png" alt="" width="300" height="293" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WakeCoNCEarlyVoteSticker-300x293.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WakeCoNCEarlyVoteSticker.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Few realize the sacrifices that Gary and so many others in our profession have made to work in this field. I know first-hand how late into the night he stayed at the office or monitored email from home to make sure things went off without a hitch, not just in Wake County but in making himself available to all counties,” Brinson Bell said. “He has created an incredible operation in a state-of-the-art facility to make sure the voters of Wake County have the best voting experience possible.”</p>
<p>As for what’s next for Sims? A vacation to start.</p>
<p>“I am embarrassed to say that I have not had a vacation since 2007.  Never enough time to get away.  Something is always going on,” Sims said. “Now, when I get back from my vacation, I know I will be bored after the first day, so I will get back into something. Just keeping my options open and I will decide what when I get back.”</p>
<p>And for those who have come to enjoy the<a href="http://msweb03.co.wake.nc.us/bordelec/downloads/12DoE.mp4"> wildly entertaining videos</a> the elections staff in Wake County create (guilty!), don’t worry.</p>
<p>“Our staff really enjoy working on those and it helps our office have a little fun and connect with one another,” McCall said. “We will continue to make these videos to share a glimpse into the behind the scenes of what makes elections work!”</p>

Overall voting went smoothly in most jurisdictions. But as with any election there were some hiccups. In<a href="https://www.lmtribune.com/nez-perce-county-city-of-lewiston-dealing-with-internet-trouble-voting-going-ahead-mostly-as/article_d5d4eda4-f434-11ed-a387-cfd547dc9453.html"> Nez Perce County, Idaho</a> elections officials were forced to use hotspots to sync e-pollbooks after the county and city of Lewiston had countywide internet connectivity issues. Things were smooth sailing in Kentucky where<a href="https://www.dailyindependent.com/news/here-we-sit-poll-workers-report-low-turnout-on-rainy-primary-election-day/article_eacd3546-f406-11ed-9b8e-47caae79e738.html"> turnout</a> was low and fortunately severe<a href="https://www.wymt.com/2023/05/16/no-polling-stations-have-been-relocated-due-any-severe-weather-warnings/"> weather</a> didn’t have an impact on the election. Voters in several counties got to test out <a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/voters-say-electronic-poll-books-improved-their-voter-experience/article_495f8fc4-f429-11ed-b255-4762962cc31d.html"> new e-pollbooks</a> on Tuesday and the reviews were positive. Many voters credited the e-pollbooks with speeding up the process. &#8220;Now, once you get your slip, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s pretty fast. Just go in one the booths, get done, put it in that machine. But I just thought it would be — I&#8217;ve been out here a lot of times, the line be all the way out here. So I was really fast,&#8221; said McCracken County voter Rosalyn McNac.<a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2023/05/16/working-primary-in-nky"> Kenton County</a> poll worker Miriam Luca was on the job again this year helping run the polls and encouraging people to vote before the election. “I want to improve the system. I’m not going to change it, because only one person doesn’t change, but it helps to spread the word which helps. It’s like a domino: you start spreading the word, you start changing things,” she said. Incumbent Republican Secretary of State<a href="https://www.wkyufm.org/news/2023-05-16/kentucky-secretary-of-state-adams-says-primary-win-a-victory-against-misdirection-and-misinformation"> Michael Adams</a> won his primary election. He will face Democrat Charles “Buddy” Wheatley who ran unopposed in his primary.

The hiccups included road construction near one<a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/politics/elections/road-construction-impedes-access-to-voting-precinct-in-york-county/521-b0a41b56-0d1f-4c06-9984-5084f127c818"> York County</a> polling place that forced the polls to stay open late, a missing voting machine in<a href="https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/elections/whitehall-voting-machine-misplaced-found-locked-in-a-closet-with-a-christmas-tree"> Lehigh County</a> (found locked in a closet with a Christmas tree), one polling place in<a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1608922/hunlock-township-polling-place-runs-out-of-paper-ballots"> Luzerne County</a> that briefly ran out of ballots and some confusion about a consolidated polling place in<a href="https://www.tnonline.com/20230516/confusion-at-the-polls-in-tamaqua/"> Schuylkill County</a>. <a href="https://www.delcotimes.com/2023/05/16/theyre-wonderful-electronic-poll-pad-tested-at-11-precincts-in-delaware-county/"> Delaware County</a> successfully tested e-pollbooks.

What doesn’t happen a lot, but did happen recently in Winona County, Minnesota is<a href="https://www.winonapost.com/news/after-tie-in-election-tie-breaker-spitzer-advances/article_f087ff5a-f0d9-11ed-9fe5-b3c5fea73c30.html"> the tie-breaker ending in yet another tie</a>. In a special election for county board, Pat Heim and Bill Spitzer each ended up with 184 votes. “As soon as we saw the tie we cross-checked everything that night and we re-cross-checked everything in the morning, and I am confident we have a tie,” Auditor-Treasurer Chelsi Wilbright said. Minnesota law says the tie must be decided by drawing of lots and the candidates agreed to draw cards with the highest card winning. Wilbright provided a brand new, freshly shuffled deck of playing cards and low and behold each candidate drew an ace. According to the Winona Post, before the original draw, Wilbright and the candidates clarified what the rules would be if they drew the same card: Keep drawing until one person wins. So, the two drew again. This time, Spitzer turned up a king, Heim a three. Heim could request a recount, but he said in an interview that he won’t. “Absolutely not. We’re moving forward. I think Bill will do a great job,” he told the Post.</p>

Unlike in 2013 when the<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2013/01-31/"> Defiance County, Ohio</a> board of elections go the “Scandal” treatment courtesy of Shonda Rimes and had no idea how their county became part of the plotline, officials in Milwaukee were ready for Sunday night because Milwaukee County Election Commissioner Claire Woodall-Vogg<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/16/was-succession-election-episode-real-00097151"> consulted with the writers on the show</a> on central count and Wisconsin law.

Sen. Scott Kawasaki (D-Fairbanks) had championed a bill that combined election reform measures in the final weeks of the legislative session. But the Senate decided against bringing the bill to a chamber vote, effectively extinguishing the odds that the bill would pass in the current session. That bill, salvaged from unsuccessful 2022 election legislation, would have established a ballot curing process, signature verification, ballot tracking, language assistance for voters not fluent in English, and requirements to more regularly update voter rolls, among other elements. Kawasaki said that he had been working hand-in-hand with Rep. Sarah Vance, a Homer Republican, on election-related legislation — in an effort to speed toward passage before the session deadline — but it appeared they had run out of time. “It’s just, I think, an issue of timing, an issue of deliberation time, and an issue of having enough scheduling to be able to meet the requirements of having a bill pass the House,” said Kawasaki, adding that he anticipates the bill could have “smooth sailing” next year.</p>

Under the new law, local governments or political parties cannot distribute applications for<a href="https://www.wndu.com/2023/05/16/indiana-bill-increasing-requirements-absentee-voting-signed-into-law/"> absentee ballots</a> in mass, but they can still provide them to individuals who request them. Additionally, the new law requires that mail voters include a form of ID — like the last four digits of their social security number and either a driver’s license number, state ID number, or voter registration number — when submitting an absentee ballot application.</p>

Bellows told a legislative committee ay that some school districts have recently voiced concerns about operating as a voting site during the day, in one case just weeks after responding to school shooting threats. Some towns have pushed to move voting locations out of their schools, but Bellows says finding alternate sites with adequate parking and accessibility can be a challenge. Bellows is pushing for a new bill that would create a working group to study the issue. &#8220;And then identify possible changes to a statute, to protect voter accessibility and safeguard the security of schools used as a polling place, and then make those recommendations,&#8221; Bellows says. Bellows says one possible solution would be for school districts to make election day an in-service day, meaning students would have the day off. Some Republicans on the Legislature&#8217;s veterans and legal affairs committee pushed back on the bill, saying that schools and municipalities already have the authority to make decisions around polling sites, without the need for legislation.</p>

The suspension comes just five days after a group of five Ypsilanti landlords — Ian Greenlee, Stewart Beal, Karen Maurer, C. Hedger Breed and Robert Barnes — sued the city in federal court over the requirement, which has been on the books since 2018. The city is putting the law on hold “based on city attorney advice until the ordinance is amended,” according to the Tuesday city council motion, which passed without discussion after the body discussed the suit in closed session. Ward 1 Council Member Me’Chelle King was the only no vote on the action.</p>

Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, sent the bill back to the House asking that a litany of amendments be removed, including one that would set Missouri’s presidential primary on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March. Last year, the legislature opted to switch back to a caucus system. The push to go back to a primary started almost immediately, and the House added the proposal to a bill sponsored by Koenig that focused on transportation development districts. While senators seemed sympathetic to reinstating the presidential primary, the other amendments on the legislation caused a bipartisan group of lawmakers to stand up and block its passage.</p>

Greg Gianforte signed into law a bill that would<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/05/15/gianforte-signs-into-law-insulin-cap-bill-preventing-private-contributions-to-elections/"> prevent private donations</a> to elections offices in the state, with limited exceptions for tribes donating space, volunteer hours or their own funds for elections purposes. The bill came about following the “Zuckerbucks” conspiracy, a phrase that stems from election skeptic circles surrounding a $350 million donation from Mark Zuckerberg to the nonprofit Center for Technology and Civic Life during the 2020 election. The skeptics believe the money influenced the outcome of the election. Bill sponsor Sen. Shelly Vance, R-Belgrade, mentioned a report titled “Zuckerbucks in Montana” during her testimony in committee from a group called the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which is known for suing government entities to purge voter rolls. Violators of Senate Bill 117 can spend up to 10 years in prison or pay a fine up to $50,000.</p>
<p>A bill to prohibit<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/05/15/gianforte-signs-into-law-insulin-cap-bill-preventing-private-contributions-to-elections/"> noncitizens</a> from voting, which is already illegal across the U.S., was also signed into law. Sponsored by Rep. Zach Wirth, R-Wolf Creek, House Bill 712 was introduced after two Philippine citizens were referred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for allegedly falsifying voter registration forms in 2021 in Phillips County.</p>

They decided to back a months-long push by State Sen. Tom Brewer, the committee chairman, to “keep things simple.” They chose his proposal, 6-0, over State Sen. Julie Slama’s “more conservative vision for voter ID,” as she described it. Slama slammed the Brewer proposal and Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, whose office worked with Brewer to develop the amendment. She called the measure “unconstitutional” and an “abomination” because it would let people write down their own ID numbers on requests for ballots by mail. Evnen said he has long supported efforts to require voters to show ID and said the decision on how to implement voter ID is the Legislature’s to make. He said Brewer asked his office to draft an amendment that followed state and federal law, including election case law. The committee amendment, Evnen said, allows for a digital process to send in verification of a voter’s photo ID and codifies the process of checking citizenship at the time of voter registration, the current practice. He said Slama’s citizenship checks risked violating federal law.</p>

The bill, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), would require county clerks to post unofficial results daily by 9 p.m. until all votes are counted. It would grant officials until 11:59 p.m. to post the preliminary results on Election Day. By issuing unofficial results regularly and including some information about uncounted ballots, lawmakers hope to restore faith in elections damaged by unfounded voter fraud claims propagated by former President Donald Trump. “We see the impact of that since 2020 in New Jersey when, after the ’21 gubernatorial election in particular, there was confusion by New Jersey voters on how the reports were done that day, and confusion on whether it was 100% of the votes cast, whether there’s still votes to be counted,” said Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime Senate sponsor. The measure advanced Thursday would require election officials, as far as is practicable, to post — in a single report — the number of ballots they have received, those they’ve counted, and those they’ve left to count. That includes the number of mail-in ballots received, tallied, or still need to be processed. The measure would require the New Jersey secretary of state to draft standardized reporting guidelines for each of the state’s counties. At present, there’s little uniformity in the format or timing of counties’ election results reporting, and some counties typically report results far more slowly and less frequently than others. It would not require election officials to count ballots each day, only that they report unofficial results.</p>

A new bill, making its way to the governor’s desk  would require multiple protections to be in place before Oklahoma can join any multistate voter list maintenance organizations, which help states in removing voters who have moved or are deceased. The bill requirements make ERIC ineligible for Oklahoma membership because of the organization&#8217;s refusal to accept reforms that many member states demanded. The measure authorizes the Attorney General to take action against any multistate voter list maintenance organization that inappropriately shares Oklahoma data. If the Attorney General chooses not to take action, the Secretary of the State Election Board may bring civil action. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House jointly may also bring civil action.</p>
<p>A group of lawmakers filed a resolution this week to reject alleged attempts by<a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-lawmakers-file-resolution-aiming-to-stop-attempts-to-silence-tucker-carlson-justin-humphrey-rob-standridge-dominion-voting-machines-senate-concurrent-resolution-11-fox-news-fired-leftist"> Dominion Voting Systems</a> to silence Tucker Carlson. “These leftist attempts to silence one of the greatest voices for truth today should not be tolerated in America,” Rep. Rob Standridge said. “If these recent reports prove true about Dominion demanding Tucker Carlson be fired as part of a settlement, that will only add to the reasons to keep them from operating in our state.” According to the lawmakers, Senate Concurrent Resolution 11 would direct continued opposition to Dominion Voting Machines operating in Oklahoma and &#8220;would support Carlson in his efforts to be a voice of truth.&#8221;</p>

Patricia A. Serpa (D-Dist. 27, West Warwick, Coventry) allowing<a href="https://warwickpost.com/house-oks-bill-allowing-voters-to-automatically-disaffiliate-after-primary-voting/"> independent voters</a> in primary elections to automatically disaffiliate. Under current law, when a voter who is not affiliated with any political party chooses to vote in a party primary, that voter is automatically registered as being affiliated with that party. Those voters can choose to disaffiliate immediately by filling out a form.  The proposed legislation (<a href="http://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText23/HouseText23/H5612.pdf">2023-H 5612</a>) would make that disaffiliation automatic for all independent voters. The legislation to allowing primary voters to automatically disaffiliate would also solve the growing problem of those who vote in primary elections through the use of mail ballots. While those who vote in person can sign a disaffiliation form at the polls, those who mail in their ballots receive no such form and are sometimes surprised to find later that they now have a party affiliation. “About 46% of Rhode Island voters choose to remain unaffiliated,” said Serpa. “And with the growing trend of mail ballots, and the growing use of provisional ballots from voters who didn’t realize they had to fill out a form to remain unaffiliated, this will help us to stop disenfranchising voters who simply forgot to fill out some paperwork after the last primary election.” The measure now moves to the Senate, where similar legislation (<a href="http://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText23/SenateText23/S0115.pdf">2023-S 0115</a>) has been introduced by Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis (D-Dist. 33, Coventry, West Greenwich).</p>

Senate Bill 1070 was set to allow Texas to withdraw from the<a href="https://texas.votebeat.org/2023/5/17/23727762/texas-eric-bill-voter-roll-program-conspiracy-theory"> Electronic Registration Information Center</a>, also known as ERIC, a multistate coalition used by dozens of states for flagging duplicate voter registrations and cleaning voter rolls. After a series of procedural moves, the bill was sent back to the House Elections Committee, which again approved it hours after it was received.  The bill is now headed back to the House chamber to be considered for a vote. The Texas Legislature is scheduled to end May 29. Texas law requires the state to participate in a multistate information-sharing program to clean its voter rolls. The state budgets $1.5 million annually for costs associated with ERIC: about $115,000 for its membership dues and the rest for postage, mailing, and printing costs to send notices to residents whom ERIC identifies as eligible voters who are not yet registered, an effort the program requires of its member states.  In March, after Hughes filed his bill, the Texas secretary of state’s office announced it was taking steps to develop the state’s own program.</p>

The bill also eliminates what’s called the “sore loser provision,” which prevents candidates who lose a party’s primary from running in the general election as an Independent. Supporters say the aim is to have candidates be more transparent with voters. “It seemed fair and party neutral and something that is in line with election law nationwide,” said Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison County. The Senate needs to vote once more on the bill, likely during a veto session at the end of June before it heads to back to the House of Representatives. Governor Phil Scott has indicated he is opposed to ranked-choice voting. The legislation will also allow limited electronic ballot submissions.  Voters with disabilities and overseas voters would be allowed to submit their ballots electronically through a secure portal, Hardy said. Those ballots would then be printed and put into a tabulator, rather than digitally entered into the tabulator through the electronic portal, she specified.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson has ruled that Kari Lake will have<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/05/15/kari-lake-granted-new-trial-must-prove-maricopa-county-ignored-signature-verification-rules/"> one last chance</a> to argue in court that her 17,000-vote loss 2022 election should be overturned — but to actually do so, she will have to prove conclusively that Maricopa County brazenly failed to verify tens of thousands of early voter signatures and that, in doing so, the county affected the outcome in the election. Thompson ruled that Lake can take her sole remaining claim to trial on Wednesday, made clear that the former GOP gubernatorial nominee has her work cut out for her: She must prove her allegations by “clear and convincing evidence,” something he noted she hasn’t yet done in her monthslong litigation trying to toss out the November election. Noting that Lake’s allegation of election fraud “leaps over a substantial gap in the evidence presented,” Thompson wrote in a ruling Monday ordering the new trial that the evidence she has presented “falls far below what is needed to establish a basis for fraud.” Thompson also rejected Lake’s bid to revive a claim regarding logic and accuracy testing of Maricopa County’s ballot-on-demand printers and tabulators that was previously dismissed. Lake’s attorneys argued that new evidence uncovered after the claim was dismissed warranted its reconsideration.</p>
<p>A Ninth Circuit panel took up the question of whether Arizona can enforce a law that advocacy groups say will disenfranchise Arizona voters. <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AZ-SB1260.pdf"> SB1260</a>, signed into law in June 2022, would require county recorders to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-to-decide-constitutionality-of-new-arizona-voter-registration-law/"> cancel a voter’s registration</a> and remove them from the state’s permanent vote-by-mail list if they’re registered to vote in a different county. It also would make it a felony to “provide a mechanism for voting to another person who is registered in another state,” regardless of if that person now lives in Arizona and intends to vote only in Arizona. In September, a federal judge in Arizona granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on both the felony and cancellation provisions, but not the removal provision. Then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich appealed the decision the next day. Since the lawsuit was filed, Kris Mayes and Adrian Fontes have taken over as attorney general and secretary of state, respectively.  The Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans argues in its lawsuit that the felony provision is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. It says “a mechanism for voting” can be interpreted in a variety of ways, including the act of registering to vote, leaving the alliance and co-plaintiff Voto Latino wondering if registering new Arizonans would be a felony if they don’t first cancel their past voter registrations. The plaintiffs claim all three provisions violate procedural due process afforded by the National Voter Registration Act, as the challenged law doesn’t require county recorders to contact voters directly to cancel old registrations — something required by the National Voter Registration Act. They also say the new law places an undue burden on citizens’ right to vote since the onus is on them, rather than the county recorders, to ensure they are following the new guidelines.</p>
<p>Mohave County Superior Court Judge Lee Jantzen heard arguments this week on whether or not to grant<a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/national_news/hamadeh-asks-for-more-ballot-inspections-to-prove-ag-s-race-was-unfairly-won/article_79e559b0-e359-5ca9-9751-53e0276cb8c2.html"> losing attorney general candidate</a> Abraham Hamadeh another opportunity to challenge the results of the election he lost by just 280 votes. Attorneys for the failed Republican nominee argued that more than 1,000 thwarted votes tipped the outcome against him, but were unable to present more than speculation to the court. A decision on the case’s future is expected in the coming weeks, though an exact date wasn’t set.</p>

The litigation was brought by Republican state Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest and the Arkansas chapter of the League of Women Voters. Represented by attorney David Couch, they&#8217;re asking Pulaski County Circuit Judge Herb Wright declare Act 236 unconstitutional. No hearings have been set. The law requires that petitions for proposed statutes, known as initiated acts, and constitutional amendments get signatures from residents of at least 50 of the state&#8217;s 75 counties before those proposals can be considered by voters. Before the law was changed in March, petitioners needed to collect signatures from 15 counties. Thurston&#8217;s response to the suit, filed by Assistant Attorney General Justin Brasher, claims the secretary is protected from litigation by sovereign immunity since the plaintiffs cannot prove the new law requires Thurston to do anything wrong. Thurston further argues that the law meets constitutional muster in that it comports with the state Constitution, which requires signatures from &#8220;at least 15 counties.&#8221; He further disputes that the plaintiffs have any grounds to sue since they have not been affected by the new signature requirements.</p>

The suit — initially filed in D.C. Superior Court in March but moved last week at the District’s request to U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia — argues the legislation “dilutes” the votes of citizens and notes that it permits noncitizens to be elected to public office, including as mayor. “Noncitizens do not have a fundamental right to vote in the United States,” the suit said. It is seeking an injunction preventing the board from registering noncitizen voters, counting their votes or spending funds to implement the legislation. A spokesperson for the D.C. Board of Elections declined to comment, saying the board does not comment on pending litigation. The D.C. attorney general’s office also declined to comment.</p>

He was sentenced to two years of supervised probation and 50 hours of community service. He is also ordered to pay off all his court fees. Rivers was among the near two dozen inmates facing various voter fraud crimes related to the 2020 general election that followed a voter drive held by the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Office at the county jail after the passage of Amendment 4. Prosecutors argued Rivers should have not registered to vote given the outstanding fees and restitution related to his felony charges, despite him claiming he was told by election officials he was eligible to register. Rivers also cast a vote in the 2020 election, an act which led to his guilty verdict. &#8220;I think the outcome is not what we wanted, but I don&#8217;t think the outcome is terrible,&#8221; said Rivers&#8217; attorney Andrew Darling. &#8220;I think this sends a message that even though the law says if you do the stuff you&#8217;re supposed to do you can vote, it sends a message that we don&#8217;t want you voting.&#8221;</p>

The appellate court sent the case back to a judge to decide whether to allow an outside review of Fulton County’s 147,000 original absentee ballots. The lead plaintiff in the case, Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, said he hopes to finally be able to find suspicious-looking ballots — with perfectly filled-in ovals and a lack of fold marks — that Republican vote-counters said they saw during a statewide audit. No fraudulent ballots<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/no-counterfeit-ballots-found-by-georgia-election-investigators/OFRHJDGKOJH7BMKCH77VMR63NM/"> were found</a> by state elections investigators, but supporters of Republican President Donald Trump want the courts to help them pursue allegations that illegitimate ballots contributed to Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. Three vote counts and multiple investigations have countered allegations of fraud, including claims of ballot-stuffing at drop boxes, dead voters, forged signatures and “suitcases” full of ballots.</p>

The underlying<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Indiana-Mail-Voting.pdf"> lawsuit</a> was filed in April 2020. Spearheaded by several voters and voting rights groups, the lawsuit claimed universal mail-in voting should be allowed for two reasons: the Covid-19 presented serious risks to in-person voters and the age requirement of 65 or older to vote by mail is discriminatory. The case<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/hoosier-state-voters-ask-panel-to-ok-expanded-absentee-voting/"> reached</a> the Seventh Circuit later that year. In October 2020, the Chicago-based appeals court handed down a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/seventh-circuit-refuses-to-allow-all-indianans-to-vote-by-mail/"> ruling</a> that denied all Indiana voters the right to mail in their ballots.  “Indiana’s absentee-voting regime does not affect plaintiffs’ right to vote and does not violate the Constitution. In the upcoming election, all Hoosiers, including plaintiffs, can vote on Election Day, or during the early-voting period, at polling places all over Indiana,” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Michael Kanne, a Ronald Reagan appointee. The unfavorable ruling did not end the lawsuit, and this week the case was back before the Seventh Circuit, this time focusing solely on the age discrimination claim. The panel judges did not indicate when they would issue a ruling.</p>

It’s outrageous and it’s unconstitutional,” said Erick Kaardal, Thomas More Society special counsel, in a statement. The Ypsilanti ordinance requires landlords give tenants voting and election information provided by the city, as well as details about city anti-discrimination rules and tenants’ rights and responsibilities, at the time of occupancy. The city provides copies of the information free of charge, and it must be mailed to tenants or provided in-person. Failure to comply with the law could result in an escalating set of fines starting at $50 and going up to at least $300, according to the lawsuit. Kaardal said in an interview that none of the landlords have been cited for noncompliance. But, the lawsuit states, they would rather remain silent about voter registration information, exercising their First Amendment protections.</p>

Local judges recused themselves from the case, which is common when a case is filed against Cascade County and local officials. Gilbert has set a May 23 hearing on the Great Falls Public Library board’s<a href="https://theelectricgf.com/2023/05/12/court-orders-merchant-to-mail-library-levy-ballots-by-may-17-sets-hearing-on-library-request-for-monitor/"> request for the court to appoint a monitor over their levy election</a> over concerns of Merchant’s handling of elections so far. “Each of these elections has featured severe errors and unlawful deviation from statutory requirements,” according to the library’s suit. “The errors and unlawful deviations are severe enough that they threaten the validity of the elections.” The library suit alleges a serious of errors in the May 2 elections, including improper signature verification, disenfranchising voters by not sending absentee ballots properly or at all to eligible voters, not allowing voters in a subprecinct to vote, opening polls at hour late, improperly folding ballots, sending ballots to ineligible voters in the West Side Flood and Drainage District, and anti-library lobbying within the election office, among other issues. In setting the hearing, Gilbert ordered that Merchant’s office “ensure that ballots are sent to absentee electors by May 17, 2023, in complete and accurate format. Respondents shall further ensure that all other deadlines relative to the library mill levy special election are met in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>The secretary of state is<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-05-17/secretary-of-state-appeals-court-ruling-on-voting-laws"> moving forward with an appeal to the state’s high court</a>, asking that four voting laws passed in 2021 be allowed to stand. The laws – which eliminate same day voter registration, restrict acceptable types of voter ID, restrict who can get an absentee ballot and regulate ballot collection efforts – were struck down last year in Yellowstone County District Court as unconstitutionally burdensome for voters. The Secretary of State’s office argues in its appeal to the Montana Supreme Court that the district court erred in its decision and that bills fall within the Legislature&#8217;s authority as the sole regulator of elections in the state. The Montana Democratic Party, Western Native Voice and Montana Youth Action originally sued over the laws, and will now file a response to the appeal.</p>

Juncai was charged in January 2022 by federal prosecutors on four counts of making threatening phone calls against a state elections worker in early 2021, charges that carried a maximum penalty of two years in prison for each count. According to<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-charged-threatening-nevada-state-election-worker"> court filings</a>, Juncaj is alleged to have made four threatening phone calls to an employee of the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office on Jan. 7, 2021 — the day after the attempted insurrection in Washington, D.C., by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Juncaj reportedly told the employee that “I hope you all go to jail for treason. I hope your children get molested. You are all going to (expletive) die.” Attorneys for Juncaj had argued that the case should be dismissed as an initial investigation into his calls by state police was dropped amid concerns that the threats were not specific enough to warrant further action. The case was brought as part of a federal Justice Department task force launched in 2021 designed to prosecute threats of violence against election workers. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar called the verdict a “massive disappointment.” “The employees of the Secretary of State’s Office deserved justice for the unacceptable threats and harassment they’ve faced,” Aguilar said in an emailed statement to The Nevada Independent. “Election workers need to know the law will protect them. We must take action now.”</p>

According to the interim town moderator Jonathan Wood, the woman was voting in the March 28 town election when a tabulating machine rejected her ballot several times. She then folded the ballot and shoved it in the machine, jamming it, Wood said.  When Wood tried to remove the ballot, the woman struck him in the face, giving him a bloody nose, Wood said at the time. Class B felonies are punishable by up to seven years in prison. Thomas has filed a<a href="https://manchesterinklink.com/raymond-woman-files-self-defense-notice-in-alleged-poll-worker-attack/"> self-dense notice</a> and will appear in court June 16.</p>

One Person One Vote, a nonpartisan coalition, announced it filed a lawsuit in the Ohio Supreme Court challenging the controversial election. Dennis Willard, spokesperson for One Person One Vote, said, “Our complaint asks the Ohio Supreme Court to call this election what it is: illegal. Just five months ago, the General Assembly specifically prohibited all statewide special elections in August. Secretary (Frank) LaRose explained that August elections have ’embarrassingly low’ turnout and are bad for taxpayers, election officials, voters, and the civic health of our state. To that end, the General Assembly revised Ohio law to allow elections only during November, March, or May and they’ve done nothing since that time to change the law. Constitutional amendments may be voted on in November, March or May – not August – and we’re confident the Court will agree.” State lawmakers in the House and Senate passed Senate Joint Resolution 2 on to put a measure on a special election ballot in August to require a 60% supermajority of Ohio voters to amend the state’s constitution, a move some lawmakers hope will make it less likely that voters will make abortion legal in November.</p>

A Berks County Court of Common Pleas judge denied the GOP&#8217;s initial petition for a recount in December 2022. Petitions were initially filed on behalf of 94 voters who alleged that voting machines were changing votes cast for Republican candidates to Democrats on the ballot. The party sought a recount in 30 of the county&#8217;s precincts and the filing delayed the certification of the November election.</p>
