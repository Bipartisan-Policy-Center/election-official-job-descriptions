														<p><strong>How’m I Doin’?<br />
</strong><em>An Introduction (and Look Ahead) to Program Evaluation in Election Administration</em></p>
<p>By Doug Chapin, Fors Marsh (and electionline Director Emeritus)</p>
<p>Ed Koch, former New York City mayor (1978-1989), was famous for greeting his constituents, on street corners or in the subway, with a simple phrase: <em>“how’m I doin’?”</em> It was his way of reconnecting with them and asking them to give <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7613" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MinneapolisED-11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MinneapolisED-11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MinneapolisED-11.04.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />him honest appraisals of his performance.</p>
<p>For the election field, that simple question must feel dangerous given how loudly (and sometimes violently) critics have been offering their own “feedback” since 2020. And yet, with federal grants for election cybersecurity and COVID-19 assistance in the field – and a growing push for regular funding for election administration – there will be a time very soon where state and local election officials and anyone else doing work in this space will have to become familiar with program evaluation: the formal process by which funding recipients tell Congress or other funding sources <em>how I’m doin’</em>.</p>
<p>To date, program evaluation has not been used in the election funding space, but it is already a well-recognized concept; indeed, many federal grants – including, for example, DHS’ State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program – include<a href="https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/department-homeland-security-notice-funding-opportunity-fiscal-year-2022-state-and-local#f"> language like this</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7925" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WIdropbox-244x300.png" alt="" width="244" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WIdropbox-244x300.png 244w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WIdropbox.png 614w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" />Recipients … are encouraged to incorporate program evaluation activities from the outset of their program design and implementation to meaningfully document and measure their progress towards the outcomes proposed.</p>
<p>These activities are in addition to financial or progress reports, and they are designed to go beyond what a grantee did with the funds to a demonstration of what the funding did. Many agencies already do this as a matter of course, as demonstrated by Fors Marsh’s existing work with the Federal Voting Assistance Program, Internal Revenue Service and Small Business Administration, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Evaluation can take many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact evaluations, which use sophisticated design and analytical techniques to establish direct causal impacts between grant funding and desired outcomes;</li>
<li>Outcome evaluations,  which do not establish causality but seek to establish correlations between grantee activities and their intended outcomes;</li>
<li>Process or implementation evaluations assess whether or not the process for implementing the grant-funded program is on track – and in turn can suggest topics for measuring the impacts or outcomes of specific activities;</li>
<li>Formative evaluations usually take place before a project starts and are designed to identify how a grantee will track and measure resource inputs, process steps and outcomes (anyone familiar with “logic models” will recognize this type); and</li>
<li>Descriptive studies are background work done to survey the field for relevant examples, practices, etc. that set the stage for both the program itself and evaluation of its progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods used in each of these evaluations vary widely based on the project, ranging from quantitative analysis on complex experiments to qualitative research based on in-depth interviews or textual analysis – and every mixture in-between. However it’s done, the overall goal is to tell the story of how grant funding did (or didn’t) achieve policymakers’ desired aims.</p>
<p>While some of this work can be done retrospectively on work that is complete or in progress, more often than not program evaluation works best when it is built into the process from the outset. Given the increasing bipartisan demand at the federal level for evidence-based policymaking (as evidenced by a 2018 law of the same name) it is likely only a matter of time before formal program evaluations come to the federal election grant funding arena. Offices that get ahead of these requirements will likely have the best results going forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-9445" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-23-at-10.13.21-AM-300x102.png" alt="" width="259" height="88" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-23-at-10.13.21-AM-300x102.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-23-at-10.13.21-AM.png 378w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" />Given the current fraught environment for election officials, it may seem daunting to self-report on grant progress – but it can also be a fantastic opportunity for you to tell your own story and demonstrate not just the wisdom of current federal grants but also build policymakers’ confidence in the value of ongoing financial support for the elections field.</p>
<p>As always, my colleagues and I at Fors Marsh are happy to assist – and help you be ready to answer that very important question: <em>How’m I doin’</em>?</p>

One polling place in Dane County was<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2023/02/21/dane-county-village-brooklyn-moves-voting-after-gunshot-closes-polls/69928213007/"> forced to move to a back-up location</a> after shots were fired outside of the original polling place. Voting was delayed for about an hour and a half in the Village of Brooklyn after sheriff’s deputies locked down a community building that served as the village’s sole polling site, according to Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell. A 75-year-old man was arrested two and a half hours after the incident was reported and charged with disorderly conduct while armed. Some polling places in Madison saw<a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/dane-co-clerk-some-polling-places-run-out-of-pre-printed-ballots-but-no-voters/article_0c60ebe8-b254-11ed-91f8-fbc87f80daed.html"> shortages of pre-printed ballots</a>, but Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell stressed no voters were turned away due to a lack of ballots. The<a href="https://www.nbc15.com/2023/02/22/town-middleton-voters-notice-difference-polls/"> Town of Middleton</a> Board added a polling place and electronic check-in books to make voting more efficient during the 2023 Spring Primary. In addition to the new polling place, the board used American Rescue Plan Act funding to purchase 14 Badger Books which poll workers can use to check-in voters digitally. Chief Election Inspector Bob Betzig said the change is much needed after some voters waited more than two hours to exercise their right to vote during the November 8, 2022, Election. “What you don’t want to do is discourage anyone from coming in and voting which I’m sure there were people who went home last time out of need,” he said. “They had to get back to watch their kids or do something. That’s not right.” It was a family affair in the Town of New Haven where Cheryl Coon, her daughter Kim Musiedlak, and her granddaughter (Kim’s daughter) Maya all worked the Feb. 21 primary election. “Nowadays with all the talk of election fraud and such it is really an honor to have people come forward to serve as poll workers,” said New Haven town clerk Kenneth Crothers. “Cheryl Coon is a long-time and trusted poll worker and member of the community.” “He gives us way too much credit,” said Coon lightheartedly of Crothers. “We only do a good job because he is so organized and gets everything prepared for us and we just follow his direction.” In<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/elections/virginia-special-election-wrong-sized-ballots/65-bc36f4f3-8669-4468-9930-dad848fbc72d"> Virginia</a> there were a couple of special elections including one in Prince William County for the Gainesville District seat on the county board. Election morning got off to a bumpy start after it was discovered that ballots were too wide to fit into ballot scanners. According to local media, the ballots were about 1/16 of an inch too bid. Eric Olsen, Director of Elections in Prince William County said his office was notified as soon as polls opened and staff worked to reporting ballots. New ballots were printed at both the precincts and the main office of elections. The ballots printed at the precincts were used until the main office could print a larger number of ballots and deliver them where needed. &#8220;Regarding the few ballots that were unable to scan in the early hours of the day, our officers followed protocol with securely collecting those, and they will be hand-counted at the end of the night as part of final reporting procedures,&#8221; Olsen said in a statement. According to Olsen, most precincts only received about five of the wrong-sized ballots before replacement ballots were printed and delivered.</p>

The EAC appoints two members from each state to the 100-member LLC after soliciting nominations from each state’s election official professional association. Members of this advisory board, which was established in June 2021, must be serving or have previously served in a leadership role in a state election official professional association when appointed.

Trujillo for championing Native American voting rights. The award was accepted by Trujillo’s granddaughter, Patricia Abeita, in a ceremony held during the NASS 2023 Winter Conference. Over 70 years ago, Trujillo initiated a court challenge to a provision in New Mexico’s constitution which barred Native Americans from voting. In 1948, a District Court sided with him by deciding it was unconstitutional. This important action expanded voting rights to all Native Americans in New Mexico. &#8220;As a World War II veteran, educator and Isleta Pueblo tribal member, Miguel Trujillo lived a life of service and purpose. His work to expand voting rights to New Mexico’s Native American pop­ulation was a significant contribution to our democracy. NASS and our members admire his ef­forts, and it is our tremendous privilege to bestow our highest honor on him,&#8221; said NASS Presi­dent and New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way. Trujillo was nominated by New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. “Miguel Trujillo’s selfless efforts to expand the franchise are a high mark in the fight for voting rights in the United States,” said Toulouse Oliver. “Though less known than other civil rights pio­neers, the consequences of Mr. Trujillo’s actions have had an enormous impact on expanding the most fundamental of our civil rights. The legacy of Miguel Trujillo is one of dignity, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication to furthering the civil rights of Native Americans and I’m proud to see him recognized as the recipient of the 2022 Margaret Chase Smith American Democracy Award.”</p>

The first election-related bill from Sen. Clyde Chambliss (R- Prattville) would require paper ballots for all elections. The second prohibits any vote county machines from connecting to the internet. The current administrative code already has those rules in place. Chambliss said these bills would cement them into law. “If there is a problem, say a lightning strike or computer failure or something like that, we always have a paper trail to go back and to make sure that we have the count exactly right,” Chambliss said.  New Secretary of State Wes Allen supports the proposals. He said even though Alabama has secure elections, strengthening the current rules is important to voters. Montgomery County Probate Judge JC Love said these bills wouldn’t impact election operations in his county. “No, it doesn’t change anything that we do,” Love said. “It just puts it into law.”  He said the county uses paper ballots already and none of the voting machines connect to the internet or modem technology.</p>

The bill passed 31-29 and now heads to the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Its primary sponsor is Republican Rep. Rachel Jones. It would require secretaries of state to recuse themselves from overseeing their own elections and to publicly appoint others who would do the job, instead. The bill was initially introduced when Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, was secretary of state while she was running for governor last year. The House passed the bill after its Municipal Oversight and Elections Committee passed it last month alongside three other election-related bills sponsored by Republicans. Jones at the time described the bill as “one more step toward a transparent election process” in the state.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5404" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arkansas:</strong> A bill that would ban absentee<a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2023-02-16/effort-to-ban-ballot-drop-boxes-advances-in-arkansas-legislature"> ballot drop boxes</a> in Arkansas gained approval from a Senate committee. Members of the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committee passed<a href="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/de/48/8d9dedc74f78afec1e13926de54c/sb258.pdf"> Senate Bill 258</a> sponsored by Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, with only one lawmaker, Sen. Clarke Tucker, voting against it. Tucker, a Democrat from Little Rock, said he didn’t understand the argument that ballot drop boxes create a higher potential for voter fraud. “Where you drop mail at the post office, that’s not manned. You can stuff as many items into a drop box at a post office as you want, they can be mailed to the circuit clerk,” Tucker said. “So how does the risk for fraud exist in a drop box that does not exist with sending items through the mail?” Dees responded that the goal of the bill is to make it harder for bad actors to submit fraudulent absentee ballots. “Each drop box across the country acts as a beacon of mistrust for voters. I do believe it increases the potential for fraud… there’s the potential for someone to do the same things that we’re talking about with drop boxes through the mail, but by allowing drop boxes, it only intensifies the opportunity,” Dees said. Currently no counties in Arkansas have used unmanned ballot drop boxes for elections. Absentee voters are required to mail in their ballots or deliver it personally or by a designated bearer to their county clerk’s office. The bill passed the committee on a voice vote and now goes to the full Senate for consideration.</p>
<p>A new<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FHB1457.pdf"> bill</a> filed in the Arkansas house would make all<a href="https://www.4029tv.com/article/proposed-arkansas-bill-would-clear-up-rules-for-poll-watchers/42998619"> poll watchers</a> go through the same training courses. One of the bill&#8217;s primary sponsors Kim Hammer says there were disparities in the way poll watchers were trained during the last elections.  &#8220;One situation is the location of where a poll watcher can be,” he said. “How close to the proximity of seeing somebody vote. Whether or not they can handle the paper ballot. Even down to what they&#8217;re allowed to wear.&#8221; Under this bill, the state board of elections would develop a training course. People would have the choice of doing it online.</p>
<p>A state Senate committee advanced a bill which would require the state Board of Election Commissioners to conduct an<a href="https://www.ktlo.com/2023/02/22/senate-committee-oks-bill-to-require-election-integrity-review/"> election integrity review of election-related documents and records following each election cycle</a> in the odd-numbered years after an election. Under the bill, the counties selected to participate in the election integrity review would be chosen at random in a public meeting of the state Board of Election Commissioners; designated by a two-thirds vote of the board if information obtained through the complaint process or by a certified election monitor indicates that a substantial violation of election or voter registration laws may have occurred in that county; or designated by the Legislature’s Joint Performance Review Committee. The board would be required to pick 15 counties by designation or by random selection by Jan. 31 of the odd-numbered year to participate in the election integrity review, starting Jan. 1, 2025. The board may conduct an election integrity review of election-related documents and records prior to Jan. 1, 2025, as a pilot program. The election integrity review would include not less than 15 counties and no more than 20 counties in an odd-numbered year under SB272.</p>

State election officials urged caution before lawmakers change Georgia’s voting system and impose new costs on taxpayers. The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Max Burns, said that he wants voters to know that their choices are counted correctly rather than having to trust votes encoded in bar codes, also called QR codes. “The intent is to make sure that the voter has confidence that what their paper ballot indicates is what was actually counted,” Burns said of<a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20232024/214851"> Senate Bill 189</a>. “If you look at the QR code, that gives some people concern because they can’t read it.” The secretary of state’s office has previously evaluated a different way of removing bar codes. Ballots could be printed with ovals next to candidate names, and then the ovals could be read by scanning machines. “The system that the Legislature directed to be acquired is serving Georgia voters well and we have seen rising confidence,” Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said. “Any changes should look to enhance the voter experience and be responsible with both state and county tax dollars. The current proposal doesn’t take these into account and would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.”</p>

Rep. Tina Lambert, R-Caldwell, sponsored<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0124/"> House Bill 124</a>, saying it would help prevent fraud at the polls — without citing any specific instances in Idaho where student IDs were used to commit voter fraud. “The problem with student ID cards is that they are not secure,” Lambert said on the House floor. “Proof of identity is not required in order to get one. Some are going to say that this bill will prevent young people from voting. That is certainly not the goal. The goal is simply to ensure that only qualified people are voting in Idaho elections.” Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, debated against passing the bill, saying removing student IDs basically amounts to a poll tax by forcing students — particularly young people who don’t drive or have a driver’s license  — to obtain another accepted form of identification to cast their ballots. If the bill removing student ID cards is passed into law, the only acceptable forms of identification for voting in Idaho would include: An Idaho driver’s license or ID card issued by the Idaho Transportation Department; A passport or photo ID card issued by the U.S. government; A tribal photo ID card; or a license to carry concealed weapons or an enhanced license to carry concealed weapons. House Bill 124 passed 59-11, with every Democrat voting against it. The bill heads next to the Idaho Senate for consideration.</p>
<p>The Senate State Affairs Committee<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/3-voting-bills-pass-idaho-state-affairs-committee/"> moved three voting bills</a> forward on Monday, all supported by Secretary of State Phil McGrane.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/S1078/"> Senate Bill 1078,</a> would add candidates to the state’s existing voting guide. Currently, the state only provides a pamphlet including information on referendums, initiatives and ballot questions, not candidates. The bill would add to the Secretary of State’s voter’s guide for the primary and general elections.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0011/"> House Bill 11</a> also sailed through Senate State Affairs after passing the House of Representatives unanimously. The bill would prohibit the state from accepting private money to pay for elections.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/S1048/"> Senate Bill 1048</a> passed the committee and will move to the Senate floor. That bill amends existing law regarding post-election audits. The bill creates an exemption for precincts that had a close race and are already within the legal margin for a free recount.</p>
<p>A bill has been introduced to a House committee that would pre-emptively ban<a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/politics-government/2023-02-21/idaho-gop-targets-ranked-choice-voting-in-new-bill"> ranked choice voting</a>.</p>

Under current law, if you mail in your application to get a vote-by-mail ballot, you prove your identity by signing that application. The signature is then matched against the signature on file with your local election administrator’s office. Rep. Tim Wesco’s (R-Osceola) bill,<a href="https://beta.iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/house/1334/details"> HB1334</a>, asks those voters to include the last four digits of their Social Security number and either their driver’s license number, their state ID number or their voter registration number. Wesco said they can include only one of those numbers but it could delay their application from being approved if the numbers don’t match with their voter registration file. Alternatively, Hoosiers could send in a photocopy of voter ID (such as a driver’s license) with their vote-by-mail application. Rep. Tonya Pfaff (D-Terre Haute) said the bill seeks to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. “And if it makes it harder for any one person to vote, especially the elderly, it’s voter suppression,” Pfaff said.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3684" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Kansas:</strong> The Senate debated<a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/02/22/kansas-senate-moves-to-ban-ballot-drop-boxes-limit-advance-voting-and-write-in-candidacies/"> four election bills</a> banning use of ballot drop boxes, setting a tighter deadline for mail-in advance voting, permitting candidates for local nonpartisan offices to add party affiliation to ballots and compelling write-in candidates to affirm their candidacy three weeks before an election. In its original form, Senate Bill 208 would have rationed ballot drop boxes in Kansas to a maximum of one per county, whether that was Johnson County with more than 600,000 residents or Greeley County with 1,200 people. The bill was crafted so the lone box for advance ballots would be placed inside the county election office. That box would be continuously monitored by two people of different political parties during office hours. Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, offered an amendment banning use of drop boxes statewide. It passed 22-16, with Republicans and Democrats voting against it. Under Senate Bill 209, the three-day grace period for mail-in advance ballots would be repealed. That state law creating that buffer was adopted in 2017 by votes of 40-0 in the Senate and 123-1 in the House. It was a response to service changes by the U.S. Postal Service that were expected to slow mail delivery. The Senate bill would set a hard deadline for all advance ballots at 7 p.m. Election Day, Thompson said. If the same provision had been in statute during the 2020 election, it would have blocked counting of 32,000 ballots statewide. The objective of Senate Bill 210 was to nullify city ordinances and county resolutions forbidding candidates for nonpartisan offices from including their party affiliation on ballots. Passage of the bill would let candidates for school board or city offices voluntarily have their political party membership displayed on ballots after July1. Under Senate Bill 221, write-in candidates for state and local elections would be required to file an affidavit before the election to confirm interest in seeking nomination and election to that office. Write-in votes wouldn’t be counted if candidates for the Legislature, state Board of Education, district or magistrate judge, district attorney, county offices and first-class city offices failed to submit an affidavit at least three weeks from Election Day. It wouldn’t apply to township elections</p>

Jared Bauman of Louisville, passed 99-0 and now heads to the Senate. The measure gives voters in Metro Council districts the power to cast ballots for their representatives weeks after vacancies, changing a process that now lets the council choose who will hold empty seats between scheduled elections. “This appointment process has long been considered undemocratic and undesirable across the council, across the county and across this General Assembly,” Bauman said in a floor speech. HB 191 requires a special election 60 days after a seat becomes vacant. A special election would not occur if the vacancy happens less than three months before a scheduled November election for a term set to expire in January; in that case, the council president would appoint someone to finish the term. If a vacancy happens within three months of an election and the term won’t expire in January, the winner of the November election would serve the remainder of the term. Each special election would cost an estimated $50,000, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.</p>

The bill now heads to Gov. Tim Walz, who’s said he’ll sign it. “People in our communities are being taxed without being able to vote on their own representation,” said Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park. “It undermines the very concept of our union of the United States.”  More than 50,000 Minnesotans would regain the right to vote if the bill (<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=house&amp;f=HF0028&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2023">HF28</a>) is signed into law. Minnesota law currently allows formerly incarcerated people to vote after finishing all of their sentence, including probation, parole or any form of supervised release. Minnesota has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country but some of the longest probationary periods of any state.  Restoring the right to vote is part of the Democratic push to expand voting rights, as Republican states across the country have sought to restrict voting by eliminating ballot drop boxes and shortening early voting periods. Sen. Warren Limmer, R-Maple Grove, introduced a litany of amendments to restrict people who have committed various crimes from voting, including violence, sex trafficking and child rape. Republicans said the amendments would support victims. All of the amendments introduced by Senate Republicans — which were similar to the amendments introduced by House Republicans — failed to pass.</p>

Her bill spells out details related to voting, including a provision that restricts election observers at jails unless the sheriff accommodates those visitors. “With certain exceptions, the provisions of election law apply to the polling places established in jails, voting at such polling places and registering to vote on the day of the election at these polling places,” the bill states.</p>
<p>Asm. Greg Hafen, R-Pahrump, has introduced<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/9679/Text"> Assembly Bill 88</a>, which would narrow the<a href="https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2023-02-20/civic-engagement/nv-bill-proposes-stricter-identification-requirements-to-vote/a83014-1"> acceptable forms of ID</a> in-person voters would need to show to cast a ballot. They include a driver&#8217;s license or identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, or tribal voters, one issued through their federally-recognized tribe. Hafen has said the measure is about fighting election fraud and restoring election integrity. The bill would also require mail-in ballots to be returned with not only a signature, but the last four digits of a voter&#8217;s Social Security number, as well as their driver&#8217;s license or ID card number.</p>

In New Hampshire, voters registering at the polls on Election Day without an ID sign an affidavit attesting that they are domiciled in the state and then cast a ballot. Former state Supreme Court justice turned state Rep. Robert Lynn, R-Windham, has filed legislation to stop that. Democrats said the bill is a solution in search of a problem. They pointed to the exhaustive investigations of voter affidavits by the state attorney general&#8217;s office, which roots out voter fraud and prosecutes it. They also question whether the restriction on who can vote is legal under the constitution. While the bill could prevent some cases of fraud, election officials said it could make obtaining a ballot more difficult for qualified voters as well. &#8220;We had voters who have always voted in the same ward, and two elections in a row, their name&#8217;s not on the list,&#8221; said Elizabeth Corell, Concord Ward 5 supervisor of the checklist. &#8220;Now try telling them they don&#8217;t have the right documentation to vote. I mean, really, if you want to see anger, that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re going to see it.&#8221;</p>

Currently, every county clerk in New Jersey reports initial results on their websites on Election Day, but in the following days some clerks neglect to update the results frequently or at all, and there’s no mechanism for determining how many votes remain uncounted. That causes a lack of transparency in close races where late-counted votes mail-in or provisional ballots could shift the final outcome. “In recent years, we have seen how inconsistent reporting can lead to voter confusion and, unfortunately, faster conspiracy theories online,” testified Micauri Vargas of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. “This bill will help address those issues.” Two other bills that were approved,<a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A5175"> A5175</a> and<a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A5177"> A5177</a>, concern a wide array of primary and general election deadlines related to filing petitions, printing ballots, conducting recounts, and more. “[These bills] are a result of some unintended consequences that arose from a bill the legislature passed back in June of 2022,” Committee Chair Anthony Verrelli (D-Hopewell) said. “As anyone who deals with these types of matters knows, when you change one election deadline, there is a potential for that to have a ripple effect on deadlines in various other statutes.” Finally, one bill would require county clerks to provide accessibility-oriented mail-in ballots for voters with disabilities and allow those ballots to be returned electronically in some cases. The bill drew a large number of supporters, many of them from the blind community, who said that voting should be made far easier for people with disabilities.</p>

The bill was approved on a 38-0 vote and now the bill goes to the House for committee approval. Under our current law, if someone seeks to intimidate a voter or challenger or watcher at the polls, by threatening force or violence or economic retaliation for the purpose of interfering, interfering with them voting for them, or preventing them from impartial administration of our election code that is a fourth degree felony,” bill sponsor Sen. Katy Duhigg, D-Albuquerque, said. “What this bill does is it also extends the same protections to the people who are actually putting our elections on: our election workers, everyone from Secretary of State to county clerks to municipal clerks as well as their employees and agents.” The bill came following threats against election officials in recent elections.</p>
<p>A bill<a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2023/02/16/bill-prohibiting-firearms-at-polling-places-moves-to-house/"> prohibiting firearms at polling places</a> passed the Senate and now heads to the House for consideration.<a href="https://nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?Chamber=S&amp;LegType=B&amp;LegNo=44&amp;year=23"> SB 44</a> was passed on a 28-9 vote. “(SB 44) prohibits the carrying of a firearm within 100 feet of a polling place during an election, with an exception for peace officers,” bill co-sponsor Sen. Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said. “This puts in place the same rule that already exists when a polling place is at a school. Currently, when a polling place is at a school, you cannot have a firearm. This bill creates the same standard for other polling places, not at schools. I think given where we are in our political discourse, I would say that elections and firearms really don’t mix. And so this bill simply creates a level playing field for our polling places.” The bill was approved after two floor amendments failed and after about 45 minutes of discussion.</p>

Senate Bill 73, which now heads to the House for consideration, would allow unaffiliated voters to select a major party ballot and vote in a primary election without having to change their registration status. Sen. Jerry Ortiz y Pino, an Albuquerque Democrat, joined nine Senate Republicans voting against the measure, saying it takes responsibility out of voting. “I just see this as a kind of Generation X kind of thing where we don’t really want to have any responsibilities for helping to raise money for a candidate or work for the candidate or the party. We don’t want to have to make phone calls for the party. We don’t have to want to do anything but just show up and vote,” he said.</p>

The election reform law is called “The Data Act,&#8221; and the idea is to pull data from the County Board of Elections to make election cycles more clear-cut. Larose issued the directive this, week saying it would help with transparency in the election cycle. He said this bill would take away the headache from counties during ballot cycles on how they report to the Secretary of State&#8217;s office. This would change workflow by taking ballots that are cast and electronically streamlining it to the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office. It would instruct all of Ohio’s 88 county boards of elections to immediately implement the reforms required under House Bill 458 for the May 2023 primary election. LaRose said that under this senate bill his office would be able to draw the data out and send it directly to the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office. Gavarone and LaRose say it could get rid of any election fraud, and give voters confidence that a better election system in place.</p>

County court clerks are already required to submit monthly notifications of felony convictions to the county election board secretaries, so this will be a similar process.” Sen. Howard says the bill would make the cancellation of voter registration necessary for anyone excused from jury duty for not being a U.S. citizen. It was also require county court clerks to create a list every month of everyone who falls under this category and hand that information over to their county election board secretary. According to Howard, the bill would then require the secretary to cancel the registrations of those people and report them to the district attorney as well as the U.S. attorney for that county. The measure will now move to the House for further review.</p>

Senate Resolution 1, proposed by Shemia Fagan, Oregon’s secretary of state, condemns violence against election workers and applauds them for “their professionalism and dedication to upholding fair and safe elections.” In written testimony, Fagan called Oregon’s 36 county clerks the state’s “unsung heroes.” All 17 Democrats and five Republicans, including  Senate Minority Leader Tim Knopp of Bend, voted for the bill. Seven Republicans voted against it along with independent Sen. Brian Boquist of McMinnville.  A few opponents, including Sen. Daniel Bonham, R-The Dalles, said they support Oregon’s election workers and condemn violence but oppose the resolution because it doesn’t address issues like “ballot harvesting” – when political operatives collect ballots and turn them in – or alleged votes by dead people. The resolution now heads to the House for consideration.</p>

It’s presented by Rep. Scott Odenbach. The Spearfish Republican argued most voting should be done on election day. “Now we have what many have described to me as election month, or election quarter,&#8221; Odenbach said. &#8220;Absentee voting goes on too long, increasing the burden on our auditors to staff and maintain voting centers, and in the future could provide opportunities for fraud as it goes on and on. A third concern was the ballot drop boxes, which are so rife for fraud and abuse, and I think is something we should stop before it becomes another thing we take for granted as another part of our elections.” The bill, along with making ballot droboxes illegal, would shorten the early voting period from 45 days to 30. Despite the intention to lessen workloads for election workers, the bill faced opposition by county auditors themselves. That includes Susan Kiepke from Davison County. “I would just like to say that auditors across the state run their elections with the utmost integrity,&#8221; Kiepke said. &#8220;We’re talking about our reputations. We don’t want our reputations tarnished and we take elections very seriously. I will never be in favor of shortening the absentee voting time. It is not a burden on auditors. It’s part of our job.” Auditors from Davison, Harding, and Pennington Counties also spoke against the bill.</p>

State Rep. Carrie Isaac (R) of Wimberley filed House Bill 2390, one of over 100 election-related bills that have been filed this session. Voting rights advocates say the bill is a targeted attack on the political power of young voters. Alex Birnel, advocacy director for MOVE Texas, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on increasing voter engagement said House Bill 2390 has no clear purpose other than to decrease young voter turnout. &#8220;The bill text is so short that it doesn&#8217;t illuminate any further why this bill would be filed other than to directly target places where universities have large enough voting populations to flip the county, like we saw in Hays County back in 2018,&#8221; he said. House Bill 2390 is, however, only one of a slew of wide-ranging election bills this session, several of which aim to make voting more accessible to young people. State Rep. Gina Hinojosa (D) of Austin introduced House Bill 644 in November which would require colleges with 8,000 students or more to have at least one polling location — essentially the opposite of House Bill 2390. Also in November, State Rep. Erin Zwiener (D) of Hays County filed House Bill 75, which would make student ID&#8217;s acceptable identification for voting, as they are in most other states. Currently, Texas recognizes concealed handgun carry licenses, but not student ID cards, as acceptable voter ID.</p>

Virginia and Kentucky are the only states that say everyone convicted of felony is permanently barred from voting.

The commission was established in 2002 by the Help America Vote Act. Sheridan County Clerk and Recorder Eda Schunk Thompson said her office already follows rules that would be codified by the bill. “(The bill) would require that electronic voting systems used by county clerks be certified and meet certain standards, which has all been followed to this point,” she said. Beginning during the 2020 election, each Wyoming county used a commission-certified electronic voting system that met the criteria laid out in HB 47. HB 47 also requires voting system vendors to acquire a certificate of good standing from the secretary of state and EAC certification for any new electronic voting systems. Schunk Thompson said she and fellow county clerks are in favor of the legislation following a committee amendment. The amendment removed text from the bill that would have allowed a state entity to make decisions on the county-owned electronic voting systems without county input. Sen. Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, and Sen. Brian Boner, R-Douglas, proposed amendments on the Senate floor that would have replaced all or a portion of the bill text removed by the committee.

The Senate voted to withdraw House Bill 103 from the Corporations Committee on a close 16-14 vote on Feb. 14 per that chamber’s rules that allow for bills to be reintroduced in another committee, though this isn’t a regular practice. Sponsored by Rep. Jeremy Haroldson (R-Wheatland), the bill has been touted by Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray who claims that crossover voting has tainted the integrity of the state’s elections. The bill would prohibit voters from changing parties before the first day on which an application for public office may be filed. It would also impose a 14-day blackout period before a general election that would prohibit party switching and disallow voters to cancel their registration during these periods with the objective of preventing those seeking to re-register with a new party affiliation.</p>

It passed the Senate on a 24-7 vote on Feb. 2 and passed the House Judiciary Committee on a 9-0 vote on Feb. 21 before being referred to the House Appropriations Committee on Feb. 22. “This is a bill that&#8217;s been actually on my heart and on my mind for my entire tenure in the Wyoming Legislature, 10 years of [my] tenure,” said Sen. Eric Barlow (R-Gillette), the sponsor of the bill. “And it comes from going door to door and going to those doors, when you knock on the door and they say, ‘Don&#8217;t worry about me. I can&#8217;t vote.’” The bill would allow for the restoration of rights for those not convicted of “violent felonies.” Those convicted of murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first or second degree, robbery, aggravated assault, strangulation of a household member, aircraft hijacking, arson in the first or second degree, aggravated burglary, multiple domestic battery charges, or bodily injury on a peace officer wouldn’t qualify for any restoration of their civil rights. It would also allow for the restoration of second amendment rights on the state level that are taken away after being convicted of or pleading guilty to a felony charge(s).</p>

In a 12-page opinion, Judge Kent Cattani said Lake’s legal arguments highlighted various Election Day “difficulties.’’ “But her request for relief fails because the evidence presented to the superior court ultimately supports the court’s conclusion that voters were able to cast their ballots, that votes were counted correctly, and that other basis justifies setting aside the election results,’’ he wrote for the three-judge panel. And in doing so, the appellate judges rejected Lake’s contention a new vote is required based on the mere possibility that whatever occurred on Election Day could have changed the results. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson dismissed eight of her claims as being outside the scope of what Arizona law permits in election challenges, or for other reasons. That left her contention that Maricopa County officials, either negligently or intentionally, altered on-site ballot printers. Some machines printed out ballots with a 19-inch format rather than the standard 20 inches. That made them unreadable to the tabulators at vote centers. Cattani said there was “ample evidence’’ the problem resulted from mechanical malfunctions that were ultimately remedied. In a Twitter post, Lake said she told supporters she would take the case all the way to the Arizona Supreme Court.</p>

Records show Xavier Lavell Kevon Artis, 23, accepted a plea agreement from the State Attorney&#8217;s Office and was adjudicated guilty and sentenced to 13 months with credit for 277 days. Artis won&#8217;t serve any additional jail time, as his sentence will run concurrently with the five years he received in August 2020 on burglary and weapon charges. Court records show Artis is scheduled to be released from state custody on Aug. 22, 2024. Artis is the sixth of 10 inmates to be adjudicated guilty on various crimes related to the 2020 general election following a voter drive held by the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Office that occurred at the county jail after the passage of Amendment 4.</p>

Trump and his allies broke Georgia laws by meddling in the 2020 election. The final five pages of the grand jury report were released las week. Members of the special grand jury agreed unanimously that there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election as Trump and his supporters had claimed. A majority of the panel also recommended that prosecutors should pursue perjury charges against at least one witness they believe lied under oath in their testimony. No witnesses were named and no new evidence revealed. There was also no mention of the panel’s highly-anticipated recommendations for who should be charged with state crimes. Those portions are likely to be released only after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis makes indictment decisions, which could take weeks or longer. “It’s certainly not definitive on whether Trump should be charged,” said attorney Norm Eisen, who co-authored a report on the Fulton probe for the Brookings Institute. “But the declaration that they found that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election is another nail in Trump’s coffin.” In the report, grand jurors wrote that they heard “extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts and state of Georgia employees and officials, as well as from persons still claiming that such fraud took place.” But they said they were unanimous in finding “no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden has ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-rules-in-favor-of-raffensperger-over-georgia-voting-law-records/FWYOIIILSNAUZGLHCDS5L62XOU/"> turn over communications</a> with organizations suing Georgia over the state’s voting laws, deciding in favor of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as he tries to show that the federal government collaborated with his opponents. McFadden ruled Monday that the Justice Department must disclose documents it has withheld during an ongoing lawsuit that alleges racial discrimination in Georgia’s voting laws passed after the 2020 general election. The Justice Department’s lawsuit alleges the law illegally targeted Black voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in elections. In response to the lawsuit, Raffensperger filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the Justice Department’s communications with other plaintiffs, including Democrat Stacey Abrams, Fair Fight Action, the Black Voters Matter Trust Fund and the 6th District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. The department refused to disclose documents that it claimed were protected among litigants with similar interests. Raffensperger then sued.</p>
<p>A legal watchdog group has asked the State Bar of Georgia to<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/group-files-complaints-against-georgia-attorneys-over-issues-stemming-from-2020-election/F7W425SJQJHLTLU6I5GAFZCZ5Q/"> discipline three attorneys</a> who filed lawsuits challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election. The 65 Project also filed an ethics complaint against a fourth Georgia attorney for the way he represented a star witness who testified before a U.S. House committee that investigated the events that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The 65 Project — named for the 65 unsuccessful lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters — says it is seeking accountability for attorneys who aided Trump. It has filed ethics complaints against dozens of attorneys in various states. The complaints say the lawsuits relied “solely on unfounded conspiracy theories, easily proven false, with no basis in law or fact.” They say the attorneys knew the lawsuits lacked merit but filed them anyway and violated several professional rules of conduct. The complaints say the attorneys should be disciplined because they “served as part of a coordinated attempt to abuse the judicial system to promote and amplify bogus, unsupported claims of fraud to discredit an election that Mr. Trump lost.” The attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

They are claiming in a writ mandamus that<a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/new-orleans-live-mardi-gras-parades/42991090"> more than 25,000 people in New Orleans are listed as active voters, but are not</a>. They claim, in the legal filing, that 546 dead people are still listed as active voters in the city. And they say that 21,436 people are listed as active voters in the city but have moved out of Louisiana. Organizers need to secure more than 50,000 signatures to try and trigger a recall election for Cantrell. The number of active, registered voters is key to their effort as the required signatures are based on the number of active, registered voters. The Secretary of State&#8217;s Office issued the following statement regarding the voter rolls:  &#8220;Secretary Ardoin and the Elections Division have made the integrity of voting rolls their highest priority and have championed the effort to add a supplemental annual canvass period for parish registrars of voters, which passed the legislature in 2021 (HB138 by Farnum) and was later vetoed by Governor John Bel Edwards. Our office supported this effort again in 2022 (HB35 by Farnum), which passed both houses of the legislature and was again vetoed by the governor.  &#8220;Parish registrars are both constitutionally and statutorily tasked with the management of Louisiana’s voter rolls. Among the many tools that are available to them are lists provided by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections and the Louisiana Department of Health. &#8220;There are a number of federal and state laws governing the requirements for registrars to remove a voter from the voter rolls, including matching data points for voters that moved to another jurisdiction, had a change in qualified status as a result of a criminal conviction, or have passed away.</p>

The justices let stand without comment the Maryland Supreme Court’s order, which Cox had argued violated a constitutional provision that leaves it solely to state legislatures to determine how ballots are counted. State courts may have no role in that determination, attorney C. Edward Hartman III wrote in Cox’s unsuccessful petition for Supreme Court review. Cox did not immediately return telephone and text messages Tuesday seeking comment on the high court’s denial of his petition. The Maryland State Board of Elections declined to comment on the denial. The board had waived its right to respond to Cox’s petition unless the justices requested a response. That request was never made.</p>

A host of reforms have been proposed, like opening primaries up to independent voters or implementing top-two, top-four, and even top-five systems. Yet, while primaries are often among the most consequential contests in American politics, voters are largely uninterested. Primary turnout in most races is abysmally low, and in some states is trending down. Are new forms of primaries part of the prescription for what ails American politics, and what can be done about low turnout? Join the Bipartisan Policy Center, election experts, and policymakers for a discussion examining primary turnout and reform, including new 50-state analysis of 2022 midterm primary turnout and the impact of reforms like Alaska’s new top-four system. <strong>When:</strong> March 9, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</span></p>
