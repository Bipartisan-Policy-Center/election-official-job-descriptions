							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New survey from Brennan shows high turnover of local election officials</strong></p>
<p>By Ruby Edlin and Lawrence Norden<br />
The Brennan Center</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-april-2023">new Brennan Center survey of 852 local election officials</a> from around the country shows that many have left the field, and more are planning to go.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />Twelve percent of the local election officials who responded to the poll began their service after the 2020 election cycle. Another 11 percent say they are very or somewhat likely to leave before November 2024. In the time between the presidential elections in 2020 and 2024, that’s the equivalent of approximately <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-shows-high-turnover-amid-safety-threats-and">1.5 election officials leaving every day</a>.</p>
<p>The loss of institutional knowledge that accompanies such high turnover can mean that there’s less awareness of resources available to officials. Large numbers of resignations in the workforce can also risk more administrative mistakes, which can fuel conspiracy theories and threats, continuing the cycle that has led to resignations in the first place. The findings of our survey provide some reasons that people are leaving, and clues as to what can be done.</p>
<p><strong>Dangers on the job</strong><br />
Threats, abuse, and harassment continue to be a significant concern for local election officials, according to the survey. Nearly one in three election officials polled have been harassed, abused, or threatened because of their job. Alarmingly, more than one in five are concerned about being physically assaulted on the job in future elections, and 45 percent expressed concern for the safety of other election officials and workers in future elections. Not surprisingly, more than half of respondents expressed concern that the attacks will make it more difficult to retain or recruit election workers in future elections.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of funding hurts election security</strong><br />
Seventy-four percent of local election officials say they need their annual budget to grow to address security and election administration needs over the next five years. The Department of Homeland Security’s announcement requiring more federal grant money be dedicated to election security was a step in the right direction, but our survey shows there is more work to do.</p>
<p>Election officials who responded to the survey say increased funding would allow them to invest in more poll workers and improved voting equipment, cybersecurity, physical security of election offices, and more. The Brennan Center estimated in 2022 that implementing basic physical security measures to protect election workers would cost about $300 million over the next five years.</p>
<p>Election officials reported that a lack of funds prevents the full adoption of basic physical and cybersecurity measures. The vast majority of the election officials we polled who received free cyber hygiene scans and physical security assessments from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency implemented at least some of the recommended improvements. However, for those who did not adopt more recommendations, lack of funding was the top reason why.</p>
<p><strong>Political interference</strong><br />
According to the survey, election officials continue to express concern about political interference in alarmingly high numbers. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported that they are worried about political leaders engaging in efforts to interfere with how their fellow election officials do their jobs. And more than one in nine say they are concerned about facing pressure in future elections to certify election results in favor of a specific candidate or party.</p>
<p><strong>Federal support</strong><br />
Most election officials who responded feel that the federal government could be doing more to help, with only 27 percent saying that the federal government is doing a “good job” supporting them in their roles. That’s not surprising: Congress provided just $75 million in new money for elections last year, a drop in the bucket for additional costs election officials are facing to protect their staffs and voters from physical threats, and far less than the $600 million the Brennan Center estimated last year will be needed over the following five years to replace aging voting machines being used in our polling places.</p>
<p>Many survey respondents, especially election officials who began service after the 2020 election, also said they aren&#8217;t aware of the full range of federal services available to them. To address this, federal agencies that provide resources to election officials should develop a plan to establish regular contact with election officials through the 2024 election, promote federal funding opportunities and resources, and provide election officials with a venue to highlight questions and concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">****</p>
<p>With the 2024 presidential election approaching, now is the time to ask what we can do to further strengthen election administration given the threats to both election officials and infrastructure. We should work to strengthen cyber and physical protections for election offices, increase funding, and elevate available resources for election officials.</p>

The system involved in the previously undisclosed breach was not for casting or counting ballots, but rather was used to report unofficial election results on a public website. The breach was revealed during a presentation this week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, which is focused on cybersecurity. Officials did not identify the local government that was targeted. If not expelled from the site, the hackers could have altered or otherwise disrupted the public-facing results page — though without affecting ballot-counting. Major Gen. William J. Hartman, commander of U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force said his team identified the intrusion as part of what he termed a “hunt-forward” mission, which gathers intelligence on and surveils adversaries and criminals. The team quickly alerted officials at the U.S. cybersecurity agency, who then worked with the municipality to respond to the intrusion. Hartman said his team then acted “to ensure the malicious cyber actor no longer had access to the network and was unable to come back into the network in direct support of the elections.”</p>

The<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-04-21/citizens-group-files-ethics-complaint-over-cascade-county-elections"> complaint was filed</a> with the Commissioner of Political Practices. “The voters of Great Falls have the greatest interest in clear, timely, and certain information regarding the election, and in its successful operation,” the letter from attorney Ralph Graybill read. “Failure to conduct the library election or failure to adhere to your full responsibilities to conduct it fairly and in accordance with Montana law will likely severely damage the Great Falls Public Library and may result in legal action against you.” The complaint, which was made against Cascade County Commission Chair Rae Grulkowski, Merchant, and Cascade County Election Specialist Devereaux Biddick, said the elections office was involved in distributing anti-library levy stickers within the office during business hours. The complaint said she threatened calling law enforcement against people taking photos, as well as “allowed her staff to taunt and harass elections observers, and the press; (and) allowed her staff to chant and sing religious songs.” The complaint also said Merchant and Grulkowski were enlisting the help of volunteers that self-identified as election deniers and the volunteers had no oversight by the county.</p>

This week, the supervisors approved hiring seven more people to help move to a full hand count of ballots. According to the Record Searchlight, with the approval, the price tag to do a hand count of ballots now exceeds $1.5 million ― about three times more than if the county would have kept its contact with Dominion Voting Systems and continued with electronic ballot tabulations. Supervisor Patrick Jones pondered whether volunteers could be used to help count the ballots. Registrar of Voters<a href="https://thefulcrum.us/faces-of-democracy-cathy-darling-allen"> Cathy Darling Allen</a> has said that counting staff and poll workers must be paid, according to California Election Code 12310 and 15103. In mapping out future costs, during her presentation to supervisors, Deputy County Executive Officer Erin Bertain said the total estimated cost increases to go to a hand count through fiscal year 2024-25 would be at a minimum $3.8 million. She called it a conservative estimate. “I’m really angry. What I’m angriest about is this decision was based on a feeling because people don’t trust a machine and I have a hard time wrapping my head around that,” Supervisor Mary Rickert said. “I also feel that the board should have considered all this information prior to making a decision. I think it’s reckless and irresponsible. I’ve used those words before, that the decision to terminate the Dominion machines happened so quickly without this information coming forward.”</p>

Saltman</a>, a voting expert with the National Institute of Standards and Technology has died. He was 90. Saltman is best known now for writing a report warning about the issues with hanging chads on punch-card ballots more than 10 years before the 2000 election. In a<a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/accuracy-integrity-and-security-computerized-vote-tallying"> 132-page report published</a> in 1988, Saltman detailed how hanging chads — the tiny pieces of cardboard that sometimes aren’t totally punched out on ballots — had plagued several recent elections, including a 1984 race for property appraiser in Palm Beach County, Florida. “It is recommended,” Mr. Saltman wrote, “that the use of pre-scored punch card ballots be ended.” “It has always puzzled me why my report never got a wider acceptance,” he told USA Today in 2001. “It takes a crisis to move people, and it shouldn’t have.”</p>

Election officials from both political parties requested the change and say it’s especially important to help counties meet new demands. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-276"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 276</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would nearly double the funding counties receive from the state. Colorado currently chips in $0.80 for each active voter in large counties. Smaller counties get $0.90. Clerks say that covers only about a fifth of what it actually costs to run their elections. Under this new measure, the state would pick up closer to half or 45 percent of the total cost. Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office was asking for key changes. One concern is where the additional money will come from. Griswold supports the idea of counties receiving more financial help for elections but isn’t happy that the bill would take that money from her office’s funds.  The secretary of state’s office is primarily funded through business licensing fees. The as-introduced bill would force it to come up with an additional $5 million the first year it takes effect. During the final Senate vote, the chamber agreed to commit $2.5 million from the general fund to help reimburse counties for the 2024 general election. The measure now heads to the House.</span></p>

Ron DeSantis doesn’t have to resign from office to run for president. Under the bill, approved along party lines, voter-registration groups could face a maximum of $250,000 in fines each year — five times the current $50,000 annual cap — for violating laws such as failing to submit completed registration applications to elections supervisors within 10 days. The bill (SB 7050), which now will go to the House, also would shorten the time for voters to request mail-in ballots. The measure also includes a contentious provision that would change the wording on voter-registration cards. The proposed change came after about 20 people were arrested for voting illegally, including some who believed they were eligible to vote because county supervisors of elections had provided voter ID cards. The bill would change the wording on voter-registration cards to make it clear that the onus is on individuals -– not on state or local elections officials — to determine voting eligibility. The bill also would require county clerks of court to provide weekly reports to elections supervisors identifying registered voters who have been convicted of felonies and whose voting rights haven’t been restored. Currently, the state Division of Elections sends lists of flagged voters to local officials, who are responsible for removing people from the voting rolls.</p>

During debates, Republicans argued that the change would boost voter confidence in elections. “We had ballots that continued to come in for three days and flipped a couple of races before it was all over, and that erodes voter confidence,” said Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, who carried the bill in the House. However, some Democrats argued the grace period should stand so that mail has time to be processed at the post-office.</p>

<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0379?ys=2023RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB379</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0535?ys=2023RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB535</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This was the largest bill that lawmakers approved, and it does several things. First, it gives voters more options to fix a common mistake with mail-in ballots &#8211; a lack of a signature or an unclear one. Without that signature, the ballot would not be counted, says Senator Cheryl Kagan of Montgomery County. The same bill also makes a significant change that could bring final results quicker. Maryland is currently the only state that doesn’t allow local boards of election to start processing &#8211; much less counting &#8211; mail-in ballots until two days after Election Day. For next year, those boards can start processing ahead of time according to Kagan. She explains the difference between processing and counting. The bill also changes the primary election date for 2024. It initially was supposed to be April 23rd, but that date conflicts with Passover. It will now be May 14th.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb1200?ys=2023RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1200</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Lawmakers also approved paying election judges more. They’ll be paid at least $250 per day depending on experience. They’ll also be paid for each training course they complete. Kagan says that’s needed to recruit more judges. “We don’t pay them enough, and there’s a lot of stress that day and the hours are extremely long,” Kagan explains. “We also need people from both parties. And unaffiliated people are welcome too.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0863?ys=2023RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB863</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This bill changes how the Maryland Board of Elections could potentially remove the Maryland Administrator of Elections, who oversees voting in the state. Currently, it only takes three of the five board members voting yes. Democrats and Republicans each get two members on the board, with the final seat (which decides the majority) going to the party of the sitting Governor. That means a party-line vote could remove the administrator. SB683 requires four of the five now vote in favor of removal, something Kagan says will require bipartisan agreement for such a drastic step.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0287?ys=2023RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB287</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0509?ys=2023RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB509</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These measures require the Maryland Board of Elections to post municipal election results on its website. Municipalities have 30 days to send results once they’re certified to the state board. Supporters say it will make it easier to find local election results having them on one site, as opposed to 24 individual local pages.</span></p>

Previous law treated them like any other voter, requiring ballots be at local clerk offices by the time polls close. Military spouses and voting-age dependents also fall under the bill. The six-day ballot extension was among a laundry list of voting access expansions put in the state constitution after Proposal 2 passed with 60% of the vote in November. SB 259 and other bills to follow aim to implement what passed.</span></p>

For voters, that likely will mean heading to closed party caucuses to choose who will be at the top of the ballot next year, rather than casting a vote for a candidate at a traditional polling place. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Cyndi Buchheit-Courtway, R-Festus, faced little debate before it was rejected on a 65-56 vote, with 31 members voting “present.” Legislation needs 82 votes in the House to become law. In arguing in favor of restoring the primary, Buchheit-Courtway said forcing people to attend caucus meetings will suppress turnout. Party leaders on both sides of the aisle earlier called on lawmakers to approve the switch in order to include as many people as possible in the election process. But lawmakers were reluctant to reverse course after they eliminated what is considered a nonbinding “beauty contest” last year.</span></p>

Under current Montana law, city and school elections are purposefully not held on with the general election, and the same is true for special district elections, such as fire boards.  “I don’t think it’s a great idea to constantly be having elections. Voters are tired and confused,” said Hopkins. The bill failed in committee after testimony from local elections officials. Fergus County Clerk and Recorder Janel Tucek said Hopkins never discussed his bill with the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders. Tucek worried that piling so many different elections onto one date was a recipe for error, and she doesn’t think it will improve voter numbers, either. “Someone said the ballot would be 6 feet long if all the elections were on it,” she said. “I know ours would be four or five pages long. How many voters will care enough to get to the bottom, which is where all the local elections will be?”</span></p>

The city is seeking proposals from qualified individuals, teams, organizations or firms to create and coordinate what it calls a “vigorous voter education campaign” that includes an education, partnership and outreach plan. According to the city, the focus is on hard-to-reach voters. The winner will also manage sub-grants to community partners. The council approved spending the money at the same April 19 meeting it voted to change the City Charter to implement the voting system approved by the passage of a series of reforms at the November 2022 general election.</span></p>

The changes are among those requested by county commissioners and election officials for more than three years to speed up the tabulation of votes and to help clear up voter confusion surrounding absentee and mail-in voting process. Republican lawmakers on the committee, who voted as a bloc against the bill, raised concerns about provisions that they feared would violate the secrecy of the ballot and would potentially allow for voters to vote twice. Along with moving the start time for getting ballots ready for tabulation sooner than the 7 a.m. Election Day start currently allowed by law, the legislation would leave the use of the inner, or privacy, envelope for returning a ballot up to the voter’s discretion. The measure also would require counties to notify a voter if they fail to sign or date the outer envelope containing their ballot to give them a chance to correct it so their votes can be counted. Another change in this bill is it alters the deadline for applying for mail-in ballot by mail to 11 days before an election from the current seven days. But it would open up the opportunity for a voter to go in person to the county election office to apply for a ballot up until 5 p.m. the day before the election.</span></p>

Bob Hall of Edgewood, passed 17-12 along party lines. The bill — if approved by the state House — would eliminate countywide voting centers on Election Day and require residents to vote at an assigned precinct, typically in their neighborhood. Larger voting centers would be permitted through early voting. Currently, 90 counties — including large metro counties like Harris and Dallas as well as rural ones — are approved by the secretary of state’s office to use countywide voting centers on Election Day. Officials with the secretary of state’s election division have said the program — which began in rural counties — is popular among voters because it allows them to vote anywhere in the county.

The bill was proposed by state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston. The bill was passed during the ongoing 88th legislative session in a 20-11 Senate vote.</span></p>

The officers would report to the secretary of state. The marshals would have the power to intervene in local elections and issue orders if they believe an election administrator is running afoul of the law. Sen Paul Bettencourt said he introduced the proposal to stop rogue election administrators from contravening Texas law while conducting elections. The Houston Republican has filed several bills in response to an unfolding legal battle over how Harris County conducted the November 2022 election Bettencourt called a “fiasco.” Under</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB220"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the proposed law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the secretary of state would appoint a “chief election marshal” for geographical regions of roughly one million people. The chief marshal would have the authority to deputize other law enforcement officers as long as they are with DPS. Designated election marshals would have the power to issue commands to local election administrators to halt any conduct they believe violates the law, initiate investigations and make arrests. While the proposal targets county officials who conduct elections, critics of the bill believe it could have a chilling effect on nonwhite voter turnout and lead to discrimination. Democratic senators from Harris County were the most vociferous in their opposition to the bill. Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, said Bettencourt’s bill was “like taking a sledgehammer to swat a fly.”</span></p>

It said Smartmatic infringed two patents related to improved voter-assistance terminals and ballot-marking devices in voting machines that allow for &#8220;more accurate, secure, and efficient voting,&#8221; especially for users with physical impairments. ES&amp;S said it learned of Smartmatic&#8217;s alleged infringement when the companies both submitted bids for a project to modernize Los Angeles County&#8217;s voting system, which Smartmatic won. It asked the court for an undisclosed amount of damages, including lost profits from the Los Angeles County project. ES&amp;S dropped one of the patents from the case last year. Andrews ruled that the relevant parts of the remaining patent relate to the basic process of voting, covering the abstract idea of &#8220;giving voters a choice of returning or depositing their ballot.&#8221; The judge also said the patent did not include an &#8220;inventive concept&#8221; that would save it.</span></p>

Lindell launched a &#8220;Prove Mike Wrong Challenge,&#8221; in August 2021, to further his election conspiracy theories. Lindell offered through one of his companies a $5 million reward for anyone who could prove that &#8220;packet captures&#8221; and other data he released there were not valid data &#8220;from the November 2020 election.&#8221; Robert Zeidman entered the challenge with a 15-page report that concluded the data from Lindell did not &#8220;contain packet data of any kind and do not contain any information related to the November 2020 election.&#8221; A panel of contest judges that included a Lindell attorney declined to declare Zeidman a winner. So Zeidman filed for arbitration under the contest rules. After conducting an evidentiary hearing in Minneapolis in January, the three arbitrators ordered Lindell to pay Zeidman $5 million. &#8220;He proved the data Lindell LLC provided, and represented reflected information from the November 2020 election, unequivocally did not reflect November 2020 election data,&#8221; the arbitrators wrote. &#8220;Failure to pay Mr. Zeidman the $5 million prize was a breach of the contract, entitling him to recover.&#8221; Lindell told The Associated Press that he has no intention of paying and that he expects the dispute to land in court.</span></p>

The underlying class action was filed by a nonprofit organization in 2016, claiming language on the state’s mail-in voter registration forms was discriminatory because it blocked from voting anyone convicted of a “crime of moral turpitude.” At times, the state has attempted to further define the phrase to include convictions for specific violent crimes, thefts, human trafficking and crimes against children, but it remained open to interpretation.  The majority opinion, written by Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat, who was appointed to the court by Gerald Ford in 1975, recognizes that the 1901 Alabama Constitution was “intentionally enacted to discriminate against and disenfranchise Black Alabamians.” But it also acknowledges the language leading to the “moral turpitude” clause ultimately adopted by the Legislature in 2017 received the support of 76% of voters on a constitutional amendment in the 1996 primary election and was subsequently granted preclearance from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

The groups allege that the form’s lack of information regarding the voter’s eligibility requirements for those with previous criminal convictions “creates confusion, impedes the organizations’ voter registration activities and puts people in danger of criminal penalties,” according to a press release. In addition, the plaintiffs are calling for the court to declare that the current voter application registration form should be thrown out, and for the state to “convey” the revised application and its content to Florida’s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, so that they “may develop a voter registration application that is the same in content, format and size as the uniform statewide uniform voter registration application” as currently prescribed in state law, according to the lawsuit.</p>

Groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia are seeking a preliminary injunction as part of a broader lawsuit that challenges changes to state election law Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican legislative leaders pushed through the General Assembly along party lines. Senate Bill 202 requires voters seeking to cast absentee ballots to show a photo ID, a provision that already applied to in-person voting. The law also limits the number of absentee ballot drop boxes and prohibits non-poll workers from handing out food and drinks within 150 feet of voters standing in line. “There can be no reason for denying food or water to people in long polling lines, other than trying to prevent them from exercising their freedom to vote,” Poy Winichakul, senior staff attorney for voting rights with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Monday. “These barriers to voting must be removed so all Georgians can have a voice to advocate for their communities in the crucial 2024 elections.” Civil rights groups sought to block the line relief ban before last year’s elections. But a federal judge denied the motion last August, arguing changing election laws close to an election would confuse voters.  However, the ruling only applied to last year’s elections, leaving the door open for the law’s opponents to seek court relief before next year’s voting.</span></p>

But as part of a plea deal, prosecutors agreed to no jail time for Funk. Latchana sentenced Funk to 24-months probation, along with a fine and court costs.

She was arraigned last month in the 90th District Court in Emmet County on one count of common law offenses, which is a felony, and one count of willful neglect of duty, which is a misdemeanor. An arraignment is a formal reading of the charges. Duntley has not been convicted of a crime.</p>

Miller filed an open public records request in February for access to copies of all ballot test decks used to conduct logic and accuracy tests for all equipment related to Election Day, early voting and mail-in voting for the 2022 general election, which he believed should be available through the common law right of access. The request was denied on March 1 because “ballot test decks are exempt from disclosure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A:1.1 as technical information regarding computer hardware, software and networks which, if disclosed, would jeopardize computer security for future elections,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit argues that the OPRA request was valid and the information records are public and not subject to any privilege or exception. &#8220;The test decks are public records because they are created and received by public officials,&#8221; the lawsuit said.</span></p>

Court documents show that between the dates of Sept. 30, 2022 and Nov. 4, 2022 Schoonhoven attempted to vote more than once, having voted absentee, and then attempted to vote again in-person. The documents specify that Schoonhoven either did vote, or offered to vote twice. He pled not guilty, claiming that he’d forgotten he had already voted.

He was accused of issuing threats on the internet to kill children, Jews and election workers. In November 2022, Goltz, age 51 at the time, was a Canadian citizen living in Lubbock, according to previous court records. He was using Gab.com and Patriots.win to discuss his frustration with the election results in Arizona. Concerning an election official in Arizona he wrote, “Someone needs to get these people AND their children.” As part of the plea deal he admitted he wrote the threat. He also admitted writing, “Yeah, but when it’s me, I’m willing to take lives. That’s the difference. If you’re being unfairly and illegally persecuted, it’s built right into the Constitution that you are supposed to protect yourself against a tyrannical government. This means their children are not off limits either.” The plea deal said Goltz admits he sent the threats on the internet from his home. They were meant to be true threats and understood as true threats. Goltz took a deal on the first count against him a federal indictment, namely, Interstate Threatening Communications. The other counts against him were dropped. If a judge accepts the deal, Goltz will be sentenced at a later date to no more than five years in federal prison.</span></p>
