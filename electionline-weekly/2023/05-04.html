														<p><strong>State associations step up as local officials step out</strong><br />
<em>State associations work to address knowledge gaps with training and networking</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>The elections industry is losing key staffing at an alarming rate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A recent<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-april-2023"> survey</a> from the Brennan Center found that 12 percent of local election officials began their service after the 2020 election cycle. Another 11 percent of current officials say they are very or somewhat likely to leave before November 2024.</p>
<p>If these officials follow through and exit their positions, we will have lost approximately 1.5 election officials per day between the November 2020 and 2024 elections.</p>
<p>Those elections officials, many who have been on the job for years, are taking with them volumes of institutional knowledge. The loss of that knowledge needs to be addressed quickly. And one way to do that is by bolstering the efficacy of state associations.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic,<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> The Democracy Fund</a> began convening state associations twice a year to provide state associations leadership a space to collaborate, network and discuss the trainings they provide to their members.<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"> The Election Center</a> has since picked up that mantle and recently held<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/events-calendar/2023/ECSW-Houston-2023-Agenda.pdf?r=1"> workshops geared toward state associations</a>.</p>
<p>“Election Center’s April Special Workshop is perfectly positioned to become the annual convening of the state association and training authorities,” said<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/board-of-directors.php"> Tammy Patrick</a>, chief executive officer for programs at The Election Center “Working with the Auburn CERA program staff and others specializing in curriculum development we can help to direct and develop robust offerings across the country — augmenting existing programs with an infusion of new ideas and creating programs where none exist.”</p>
<p>In addition to The Election Center, next week, The Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota will host a daylong conference on<a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/election-administration/profession-democracy-election-administration-and-state-associations"> The Profession of Democracy: Election Administration and State Associations</a>. The event will be both in-person and online.<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado Director of Elections</a> Judd Choate is among the speakers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8973" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/EarlyVoting-247x300.png" alt="" width="247" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/EarlyVoting-247x300.png 247w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/EarlyVoting.png 744w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" />“The single most difficult challenge facing election administration is low information – i.e. people don’t understand how elections work. We typically think of this as a voter problem, but it might surprise you — as it did me in 2021 — that election administrators can be susceptible to these same conspiracy theories when they suffer from a weak understanding of the protocols that protect election outcomes,” Choate said. “A robust training and certification program, coupled with a strong state association of election administrators creates the best two-step approach to head off insider threats and protect election administrators from being picked-off by election deniers. Sophisticated and supported election professionals are more apt to stand up to misinformation.”</p>
<p>There are currently<a href="https://electionline.org/states/"> 168 state associations</a>. While some function with volunteer leadership, from within the membership, some, like Colorado and now Missouri, have a paid staff person who performs tasks of running a statewide organization—rather than having that work fall on the election official members who have so many other duties to attend to. [<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: electionline does its best to keep the<a href="https://electionline.org/states/"> State Association page</a> up-to-date. Please send any updates/corrections to mmoretti@electionline.org]</p>
<p>The<a href="https://maccea.org/"> Missouri Association of County Clerks &amp; Election Authorities</a> (MACCEA) recently made the decision to bring on an executive director to run the association. Fey said the impetus for establishing the ED position really emanated from MACCEAs membership.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3340" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Just like administrators all over the country, our members have been dealing with the challenges of heightened scrutiny, public records requests, and staff turnover,” said Eric Fey, director of elections for<a href="https://stlouiscountymo.gov/st-louis-county-government/board-of-elections/"> St. Louis County, Missouri</a>.. “Our executive board could see that these challenges required more robust educational opportunities, conference planning, and communication than our traditional model of volunteer leadership could provide.”</p>
<p>Of course state associations can also provide so much more than just trainings.</p>
<p>“At the most elemental level the state association is where you can go to be with people who ‘get you’ and understand what you’re going through. It’s a safe place to share ideas, commiserate, and find solutions to your challenges which nobody else understands,” said Fey “Of course we don’t agree on everything, but ultimately we have each other’s backs regardless of party affiliation. It’s no exaggeration to say that state associations are critical to the profession of election administration.”</p>
<p>Fey said he often give the example of a typical rural Missouri county clerk who has a staff of two or three people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“These clerks have no legal counsel to speak of and if they find themselves at odds with the secretary of state, their county commissioners, or the other elected officials in their courthouse it can be an extremely intimidating and isolating experience,” Fey said. “Fellow association members are really the only resource our members can turn to in situations like these.”</p>
<p>In Colorado, Matt Crane serves as the<a href="https://www.clerkandrecorder.org/"> Colorado County Clerks Association</a> executive director. He travels the state speaking to county commissioners, local press, and citizen groups, some of whom are hostile to facts. Crane takes the heat for the local official, giving them space to do their jobs.</p>
<p>The role of state associations in communicating information out to their members has always been an important facet of ensuring uniformity and consistency of understanding of state laws, policies, and procedures. These channels have also been critical in combatting the spread of mis-/dis-/malinformaiton (MDM).</p>
<p>Choate noted that in Colorado, when election deniers make unsupported claims about our elections, the speaks with one voice to provide facts instead of conjecture, information instead of guesses.</p>
<p>“A strong state association of election administrators helps in two specific ways. First, individual local officials have limited power to propose policy changes. But when 64 of those local officials speak with one voice – representing an entire state – they carry tremendous influence. This allows the association to help craft legislation and strengthen election policies in ways that election officials in other states cannot,” said Choate. “Second, election administrators often find themselves fending off misinformation from policymakers and voters. A strong association can speak with one voice, through an executive director or president, creating ‘cover’ for election administrators who might leave the profession due to harassment or otherwise might be susceptible to election deniers.”</p>
<p>Associations are one way that the voices of election officials, the true election experts, can be elevated to the needs that professionals have in how to best serve their voters. Access to all election professionals across the state and across the country should be commonplace—yet, it remains a challenge to participate for some smaller, rural jurisdictions based on resource constraints.</p>

<p>The University of Minnesota CEA program conference (May 10th, 11am ET) is a one-day conference that lays out how to professionalize your state’s election administration through training, certification, and creating a strong association. In the end, a professionalized workforce is the key to growing and keeping good election administrators, which is the best defense to doubts about free and fair elections. Please join us.

According to the data, voter turnout for the 2022 U.S. congressional elections was the second highest for a nonpresidential election year since 2000, with 52.2% of the citizen voting-age population participating. And registration rates were the highest for a midterm election since 2000, with 69.1% of the citizen voting-age population registered to vote, up 2.2 percentage points from 66.9% in 2018. For the 2022 election, the survey found that nearly one-third (31.8%) of all voters cast ballots by mail, up from 23.1% in 2018. Almost half (47.1%) voted before Election Day, up from 37.8% in 2018. Other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Among those who were registered but did not vote in the 2022 elections, the most common answer given for not voting was, “Too busy, conflicting work or school schedule.”</li>
<li>The most common way people registered to vote was at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV); 29.8% of respondents reported registering at their DMV.</li>
<li>Among the citizen voting-age population, homeowners had higher voter turnout than renters, with 58.1% of eligible homeowners and 36.5% of renters voting.</li>
<li>Turnout rates for the citizen voting-age population differed by length of residence, 67.6% for those living in the same place for five years or longer and 40.5% for those in their current residence for one year or less.</li>
<li>Turnout was higher among the married (61.2%) than unmarried (42.5%) citizen voting-age population.</li>
<li>Turnout was higher among veterans (62.7%) than among nonveterans (51.3%).</li>
<li>Native-born citizen voter turnout was 53.4%, greater than the 41.4% turnout of naturalized citizens.</li>
<li>The South had the nation’s lowest voter turnout (48.9%), while turnout in the West (54.7%), Midwest (54.1%) and Northeast (53.8%) were not significantly different from each other.</li>

In<a href="https://www.wyso.org/government-poli/2023-05-02/new-voter-id-requirements-debut-on-this-election-day"> Ohio</a>, counties held the first election since the passage of the state’s new voter ID law and by most reports, there seemed to be few problems. &#8220;I didn’t see any issues really at all,&#8221; said Aaron Ockerman, executive director of the Ohio Association of Election Officials. &#8220;It was super low turnout, which we had kind of expected. <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/03/ohio-voter-id-law-officials-report-few-issues-in-may-election/70174380007/">It was a good dry run for the new law</a>. The stress test will come in November.&#8221; In<a href="https://www.ideastream.org/government-politics/2023-05-02/akron-primary-day-voters-mostly-unbothered-by-2023-voting-law-changes"> Akron</a> the larger issue seemed to be the<a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2023/05/02/poll-workers-see-location-confusion-and-low-turnout-on-election-day-akron-mayor-race-board-elections/70155755007/"> reduction of polling places</a>. Summit County previously had 420 precincts. It now has 371. “We only had the one person upset to the point of not wanting to go ahead and vote somewhere else, but I think he’s going to change his mind. I hope he did,” polling location manager Vanessa Winborn said. “Please don’t let this discourage you. You came this far. It’s just up the street.” A bomb threat at high school the<a href="https://www.morningjournalnews.com/news/local-news/2023/05/salem-students-evacuated-following-bomb-threat-polling-location-changed/"> City of Salem</a> forced the relocation of one polling place and <a href="https://www.reviewonline.com/news/local-news/2023/05/board-of-elections-thanks-poll-workers-for-quick-evacuation/">poll workers were praised</a> for how they dealt with the site relocation mid-vote.  It was a quiet election day in<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-ptb-election-day-roundup-st-0503-20230502-og237pef5fbndf3hzdhemohbjq-story.html"> Indiana</a> where Secretary of State Diego Morales was overseeing his first election. “I cannot say thank you enough to the hardworking county clerks, election workers, and volunteers.  Primary Election Day would not be a success without your commitment,”<a href="https://www.therepublic.com/2023/05/02/morales-visits-nexuspark-during-columbus-city-primary/"> said Morales</a>. One vote center in Indianapolis was put on lockdown for about two hours due to nearby police activity that had nothing to do with the election. The<a href="https://cbs4indy.com/indiana-news/ips-school-voting-center-on-lockdown-due-to-nearby-police-presence/"> Marion County</a> Election Board asked voters to avoid IPS Clarence Farrington School during the lockdown and advised voters to visit other nearby voting centers. Students and poll workers observed lockdown procedures until the lockdown was lifted. In<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/05/02/cascade-county-ballots-put-out-an-hour-late-copp-complaint-rejected/"> Cascade County, Montana</a>, which has been in the news lately due to concerns about the administration of elections a <a href="https://www.montanarightnow.com/great-falls/ballot-counting-malfunction-delays-cascade-county-election-results/article_9b8bf86a-e9c4-11ed-a67d-c7df35ca19df.html">Great Falls school election</a> got started about an hour late because polling staff didn’t have the necessary voter rolls. The late delivery seems to have stemmed from <a href="https://theelectricgf.com/2023/05/02/polls-opened-late-for-gfps-election-due-to-confusion-over-voter-registers/">miscommunication</a> between the county clerk’s office and school system. According to The Electric, the county also got a<a href="https://theelectricgf.com/2023/05/02/county-elections-officials-starting-ballot-counts/"> late start in ballot counting</a> and stopped for the night at 12:50 a.m. with the promise to begin counting again at 10 a.m. Wednesday. While results were posted on Wednesday, ballots were <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/05/03/ballots-are-still-being-counted-in-cascade-county-library-announces-emergency-election-meeting/">still being counted Wednesday night</a>.</p>

Challengers Randy Johnson and Suzy Roberts won decisive victories against Supervisor Mark Nichols and Clerk Stephanie Scott, respectively, according to unofficial election results.  Johnson garnered 394 votes to Nichols&#8217; 222, and Roberts nearly doubled Scott’s support; 406 Adams Township voters cast a ballot for Roberts while Scott had 214 votes. Adams Township resident Gail McClanahan filed recall language in May 2022 against the duo which stated that in October 2021 Scott was stripped of her ability to administer elections in Adams Township by Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Hillsdale County Clerk Marney Kast’s office was then tasked with administering elections in Adams Township and her office later seized other election materials including ballots from the November 2020 presidential election from the Adams Township Hall out of “security concerns.”</p>

Her resignation comes about a week after news broke that she had a secondary job with a cannabis company that played a key role in an audit conducted by her office. According to the Oregon Capital Chronicle, Fagan submitted her resignation to Gov. Tina Kotek several hours after she told Kotek and announced it publicly, according to documents shared by the Secretary of State’s office. “While I am confident that the ethics investigation will show that I followed the state’s legal and ethical guidelines in trying to make ends meet for my family, it is clear that my actions have become a distraction from the important and critical work of the Secretary of State’s office,” Fagan wrote. “Protecting our state’s democracy and ensuring faith in our elected leaders – these are the reasons I ran for this office,” she continued. “They are also the reasons I am submitting my resignation now.” It’s now up to Kotek to determine<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/05/02/oregon-secretary-of-state-speculation-replace-shemia-fagan/"> who will replace</a> Fagan upon her resignation next week.

In the interim, Deputy Secretary of State <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=143942">Cheryl Myers</a> will have oversight of the office beginning May 8.</p>

The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials, as well as provisions from the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation led by Klobuchar and supported by all Democratic Senators. The Election Worker Protection Act would:  Establish grants to states and certain local governments for poll worker recruitment, training, and retention, as well as grants for election worker safety; Direct the Department of Justice to provide training resources regarding the identification and investigation of threats to election workers; Provide grants to states to support programs protecting election workers’ personally identifiable information; Establish threatening, intimidating, or coercing election workers as a federal crime;  Expand the prohibition on voter intimidation in current law to apply to the counting of ballots, canvassing, and certification of elections; Extend the federal prohibition on doxxing to include election workers; and Protect the authority of election officials to remove poll observers who are interfering with or attempting to disrupt the administration of an election.</p>

The first bill that passed mandates the use of paper ballots. The second bans electronic vote-counting machines that connect to the internet. Supporters of the bill say these clarify the administrative code and provide other benefits to the state elections system. “The whole purpose of having paper ballots because you can go through and count and make sure if a machine says there’s 607 ballots in this box, you can go through and count and make sure there’s 607 pieces of paper,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Baldwin County. These bills now go to Gov. Kay Ivey for possible signage. If signed, the paper ballot bill goes into effect immediately and the vote counting bill will be in effect three months after signage. Secretary of State Wes Allen said he is in support of both bills.</p>

It would establish a ballot curing process, signature verification, ballot tracking and requirements to more regularly update voter rolls, among other elements. It does not include any reforms to how campaigns are financed, nor does it alter the state’s ranked-choice voting system. The provisions would allow voters to correct errors on their ballots once they are submitted, allow election workers to more reliably verify the identity of voters, and allow voters to track their by-mail ballots after they are submitted. The bill aims to address several ongoing concerns with Alaska’s elections, including onerous requirements that have been blamed for reducing turnout in rural parts of the state and among voters for whom English is not a primary language. It would also address concerns raised in a lawsuit filed last year, which accused the state officials of violating voters’ constitutional rights by failing to implement a process to fix defective ballots. The bill would give voters the opportunity to correct their ballots if there are errors, including a missing or unverifiable signature or identifier. Under the bill, the state Division of Elections would be required to contact voters by phone or mail to inform them of issues with their ballot, and then provide them the opportunity to correct it.</p>

This year, the bill seeks to make several changes, including expanding voting access on tribal lands and establishing personal income disclosures for political candidates.  The House passed SB 276 in a 44-19 vote, following the Senate&#8217;s 29-6 passage last month. The bill will next go back to the Senate to approve changes made by the House, and then to the governor for final consideration. One of the most significant components of the bill seeks to improve voting access for Native American tribes.  If passed, the bill would expand the state&#8217;s automatic voter registration system to include tribal membership lists — making Colorado the first state in the country to do so, Fenberg said. It would also increase the number of in-person voting sites on tribal lands before and on Election Day. SB 276 also seeks to improve timeliness in ballot counting by requiring clerks to begin counting ballots at least four days before an election for counties with more than 10,000 electors. Currently, counties can start counting ballots as early as 15 days before an election, but it&#8217;s not mandated. Other notable changes the bill would make include increasing state reimbursements of county funds spent on elections; increasing voter service centers on private college campuses and in jails; allowing the use of digital IDs to vote; and, requiring clerks to update information about cured ballots every 24 hours.</p>

Brian Kemp signed into law a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/kemp-to-sign-ban-on-donating-money-to-georgia-elections-offices/JHTULLJU3NGWFGD4MBOUWBFSNY/"> ban on donations</a> to county election offices, making it a felony for local governments to accept money from nonprofit organizations that gave millions of dollars during the 2020 presidential election. Limiting outside election money became a priority among Republicans in Georgia and across the country after the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which was funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, contributed more than $400 million to election offices nationwide during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. About $45 million of that money was given to local election offices in Georgia. Under the legislation, DeKalb will be able to keep the $2 million grant, which was previously allowed under state law. But any county government official who accepts future outside money could face felony charges punishable by at least a year in prison and a $10,000 fine. Contributions will still be allowed to the state government, which could then decide how to distribute funding among counties.</p>

Senate Bill 282 would provide a remote-accessible vote-by-mail system. If passed, the bill would allow voters with a &#8220;print disability&#8221; such as blindness, low vision or learning/physical disabilities to mark, verify and return a mail voting ballot electronically. The bill was filed by Feb. 2 by Sen. Julie A. Morrison, D-Deerfield, and has been referred to assignments twice, the last time March 31.</p>

The Senate voted 25-15 to sustain the Governor’s veto. “This bill eliminates the three-day grace period for mail-in ballots often used by those in the military serving across the country or overseas,” Gov. Kelly said after her veto. “It would also likely result in too many rural Kansans not having their votes counted in important elections. That is unacceptable. We should be doing everything we can to make it easier – not harder – for Kansans to make their voices heard at the ballot box.”</p>

The bill (S 8 / H 26) by Sen. Liz Miranda and Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven would remove the constitutional amendment that was added in 2000 when voters approved a statewide ballot question making it illegal to vote from prison while serving a felony sentence. Similar bills have been filed in the past, but the  Election Laws Committee vote marks the first time the proposal was favorably reported out of a committee, enabling it to move on in the legislative process. &#8220;We should be furthering democracy. When I look at the commonwealth disenfranchising close to 5,000 people who had the right to vote until it was taken away — I think it&#8217;s a stain on our commonwealth&#8217;s history, here where we think of ourselves as the bastion of democracy,&#8221; Miranda said.</p>

Rep. Ben Baker, R-Neosho, sponsor of<a href="https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HJR"> House Joint Resolution 66</a>, said his bill would enshrine Missouri’s current voting system in the state Constitution to resist movement toward adopting ranked-choice voting. Baker said ranked-choice voting is too complex and drags out tabulating election results. He argued that supporters of ranked-choice voting like it because it allows unpopular candidates to win elections that they couldn’t otherwise. Rep. Ashley Aune, D-Kansas City, said the problem with the current voting system is that voters do not always have a choice. Under the current system, Aune said Republicans in conservative districts are pressured to move far to the right to appeal to voters and secure the primary nomination. Once they win the primary, voters can only vote for “the most extreme Republican.” “(With ranked-choice voting,) it’s not a situation where you’re just voting against someone,” Aune said. “We have to give people options to vote for. The two-party system, one against the other, it really doesn’t work. I don’t think it makes sense for a democracy.”</p>

County counsel Bruce Bergen said the decree is the result of discussions between the U.S. Department of Justice, the county clerk’s office and board of elections, regarding a federal requirement for bilingual voting material. “In order to ensure the continued access to bilingual paperwork and other documents in voting, the county and the other bodies have agreed to take certain steps,” Bergen said. “There is no wrongdoing that the county has been accused of.” Commissioners also approved adding $23,025 to its contract with Royal Printing Services, for a total contract amount not to exceed $2,563,755, due to a new law that requires the set up and printing of bilingual versions of machine/official ballots, sample ballots, emergency ballots and overseas ballots, according to the resolution. County Clerk Joanne Rajoppi said the spending request was made as a result of the federal consent order. “Right now, the county does about half of its ballots in Spanish, which is determined by the state of New Jersey,” Rajoppi said. “As of November, the federal government has mandated that all of our ballots be printed bilingually, as well as all of our election materials.”</p>

The Senate passed the bill, written by state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a Republican, on April 18. It will now go up for debate on the House floor.  The bill was originally written to affect all counties with populations of more than 1 million residents, but it was changed to focus solely on Harris after Bettencourt’s office conducted a survey of Texas’ largest counties and found that only Harris County had continuous problems, said Rep. Briscoe Cain, who presented the House version of the bill —<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB3876"> House Bill 3876</a> — in committee. The Texas Election Code allows counties’ election commissions, based on their individual needs, to assign election duties to the county clerk and tax assessor-collector — which are elected positions — or to create an elections department and appoint a nonpartisan elections administrator. According to Votebeat, some supporters of the bill urged members of the House Elections Committee to return election duties to elected officials everywhere in Texas and not just in Harris County.</p>
<p>The House gave preliminary approval to<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB1243"> House Bill 1243</a>, sponsored by state Rep. Cole Hefner (R-Mt. Pleasant) with a 83-63 vote to a bill that would reinstate<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/27/texas-house-illegal-voting-felony-penalty/"> felony-level punishment</a> for residents who vote illegally. The bill reverses a change state lawmakers made in 2021 when they downgraded illegal voting to a misdemeanor as part of a sweeping overhaul to the state’s election laws. “We must ensure that Texans are confident that the legitimate votes they cast will be counted and are not canceled out by someone who has knowingly or intentionally cast an illegal ballot,” Hefner said. Republican leaders have said that the 2021 change was a mistake. The key difference between the current House and Senate bills is whether a person can be prosecuted if they knowingly voted illegally. The Senate’s version, sponsored by Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Mineola Republican, changes the existing legal wording to what’s known as the “intent requirement.” Under the rewrite of the state’s election laws passed two years ago, a person only illegally votes if they “knowingly or intentionally” vote or attempt to vote in an election in which the person “knows they’re not eligible” to vote. The Senate version up for debate would change that language to include anyone who votes or attempts to vote in an election in which “the person knows of a particular circumstance that makes the person not eligible to vote.” Those circumstances could include having been convicted of a felony or not holding U.S. citizenship.</p>

City voters on Town Meeting Day approved measures to allow noncitizens to vote as well as use ranked-choice voting in all city elections, including mayor. The method &#8212; formerly known as instant runoff voting &#8212; is already used for city council elections. Rep. Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, who is a Progressive / Democrat for Burlington says “We’re very confident and excited that this will allow a more representative democracy so people could actually make their choices and not be forced into sort of a binary choice between who they think is actually likely to win and having to worry about a spoiler vote or anything like that people can really say I think these two top candidates are great, and will have more choices as a result, which is great for democracy in Burlington.” The Senate now takes up the charter changes. Governor Phil Scott in 2021 vetoed similar noncitizen voting measures in Winooski and Montpelier, saying he opposed the “patchwork” approach to changing voting on a town-by-town basis.

Jay Inslee for consideration would<a href="https://www.nbcrightnow.com/news/state/washington-elections-bill-generates-more-distrust-in-the-system/article_c6d07271-0354-5e32-8124-fd209e60a7d8.html"> exempt various aspects of the election system from public records requests</a> and centralize all local records requests with the Secretary of State&#8217;s office. While supporters of <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5459&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false">Senate Bill 5459</a> say the bill will protect private information about voters and the technology used in ballot counting, critics argue that it will make citizens less trusting of the election process. Under existing law, citizens can submit public record requests regarding their local voting system with the county auditor. Since the 2020 election, the number of requests has increased from 400 in 2019 to 1,300 in 2022, according to the Washington Association of County Auditors. SB 5459 would centralize all those requests with SOS, which has a statewide voter database. The bill also exempts certain aspects of the voting system involving private contractors. Any records of the system infrastructure would be withheld from the public for 25 years if the contractor says releasing the records would put the system at risk. A new Public Records Act exemption would be created for voted ballots or copies and images of them.</p>

Wisconsin drivers would have been automatically registered to vote under another of Evers’ proposals, which has been shot down by Republicans before. The proposal would have required applications for a license or identification card to inform applicants that the information would be made available to the Wisconsin Elections Committee, and give them a choice to opt out. The governor&#8217;s budget allocated $172,700 for the Wisconsin Elections Commission and the Department of Transportation to implement automatic voter registration. The state DOT would have received another $349,000 in fiscal year 2023-24 to address one-time costs.</p>

Brown pleaded guilty in November to attempting to influence a public servant, a felony, and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. She will be required to testify against former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters at her trial in October as part of the plea agreement. Brown has already served two days of her jail sentence and has until noon Friday to report to finish out her 30-day sentence. She was also ordered to serve two years of unsupervised probation and complete 100 hours of community service. She was granted a deferred judgment for the felony charge with the same conditions as her probation but must also pay a $2,000 fine. Upon completion, the felony charge will be dismissed from her record. If she fails to comply with the conditions she would be re-sentenced for the felony charge which could result in probation or prison time.</p>

The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis approved the elections law as GOP leaders across the country pushed to make voting changes after former President Donald Trump’s loss in 2020. The law imposed new restrictions on mail-in voting and voter registration groups and prohibited people from giving snacks and drinks to voters waiting in line to cast ballots. Walker last year<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/03/31/federal-judge-says-parts-of-2021-florida-voting-law-are-unconstitutional/"> ruled that the law</a>, challenged by voting rights groups, was intentionally intended to discriminate against Black voters. The judge also made the rare move of putting the state under a process known as “preclearance,” meaning that he would have to approve any changes to certain parts of state election laws. The split ruling by the panel said Walker’s decision “does not withstand examination.” “The district court relied on fatally flawed statistical analyses, out-of-context statements by individual legislators, and legal premises that do not follow our precedents,” Chief Judge William Pryor wrote in a 79-page decision joined by Judge Britt Grant. “On the contrary, examining the record reveals that the finding of intentional discrimination rests on hardly any evidence.” Judge Jill Pryor issued a dissenting opinion.</p>

The extension comes after Cathy Latham, a South Georgia-based “alternate” elector, filed a motion on Friday which echoed Trump’s claims. McBurney on Monday indicated he would consider Trump and Latham’s motions together and gave the DA’s office until May 15 to respond to their motions. The office’s response had been due May 1. The court motions, filed by Trump’s Atlanta-based attorneys in late March and by Latham last week, also seek to quash the release of the final report authored by the special grand jury that aided Willis and any evidence collected by the group.</p>
<p>Critics of Georgia’s<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-machines-dominion-georgia-elections-2a276689a0f1aed859dfd1bff06e70ae"> voting machines</a> say they are unconstitutional and should be scrapped in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. State election officials dismiss their concerns as unfounded and argue that the state’s voting system is safe and secure. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg held a hearing this week on motions filed by election officials, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and members of the State Election Board, asking the judge to rule in their favor based on the facts presented without going to trial. Lawyers for the activists argued there are disagreements on the facts in the case and that the merits of the arguments need to be fully explored at trial. Totenberg had extensive questions for both sides and did not indicate when she would rule.</p>

The lawsuit says that under laws passed in 2019 and 2021, convicted felons are automatically granted the right to vote when they have been out of prison for five years. But, the lawsuit points to an apparent quirk in the law that treats some formerly incarcerated people different than others. Those who are registering to vote for the first time don’t have to show any paperwork to register, according to the lawsuit. But those who were already registered to vote when they were convicted of a crime had their placed on “suspended” status, according to the lawsuit, and they have to obtain and present paperwork proving that they are eligible. The lawsuit alleges that the requirement is the result of a misreading or misapplication of state law. It asks the federal court in Baton Rouge to halt the practice.</p>

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Richard Crist, James Gordon, and Leslie Wallace were arrested and charged with conspiring to violate the rights of county voters during the 2021 election cycle. The arrests are only the latest in an ongoing federal probe of GOP officials in the county.

On voter ID, the Republican majority reversed a trial court decision that struck down the 2018 law. The trial court had ruled that GOP legislators passed the law in part to retain General Assembly control by discouraging Black Democrats from voting in legislative elections. But Associate Justice Phil Berger Jr.<a href="https://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=1&amp;pdf=42280"> wrote</a>, in part, that the trial judges erred in relying on a federal court ruling striking down a 2013 voter ID law as tainted by racial discrimination. Although a federal lawsuit challenging the voter ID law is still pending, the State Board of Elections said Friday that staff would start working toward “a smooth rollout” of the ID requirement with municipal elections this fall. Voters also previously approved a separate photo voter ID mandate for the state constitution, although that amendment remains stuck in litigation that wouldn’t affect Friday’s ruling.</p>
<p>In another ruling, the state Supreme Court overturned a trial judge’s ruling that had<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/formerly-incarcerated-north-carolinians-t-223904812.html"> restored the voting rights to thousands of formerly incarcerated residents</a> serving felony sentences. The State Board of Elections said later Friday it has updated voter registration applications to comply. Now, once again, people serving a felony sentence cannot register or vote until their sentence ends, including any period of probation, parole or post-release supervision. Elections officials will use lists of people serving felony sentences to cancel registrations of people who are now ineligible, the board said. Arguments in the case, known as Community Success Initiative v. Moore, centered on whether the state law that delineates how people’s voting rights are restored is constitutional and whether it had discriminatory intent. The high court reversed the trial ruling 5 to 2, split along partisan lines, with Republican justices in favor of reversal and Democrats against. For the majority, Justice Trey Allen wrote that it is “not unconstitutional to insist that felons pay their debt to society as a condition of participating in the electoral process.” “The General Assembly did not engage in racial discrimination or otherwise violate the North Carolina Constitution by requiring individuals with felony convictions to complete their sentences — including probation, parole, or post-release supervision — before they regain the right to vote,” Allen wrote.</p>

The company reserved the right to refile the federal case at a later date. The suit came in response to accusations made by members of True the Vote  that onnech had allowed the Chinese government to access a server in China that held the personal information —  including Social Security numbers, phone numbers, bank account numbers and addresses — of nearly 2 million U.S. election workers. True the Vote’s “unique brand of racism and xenophobia” had defamed Konnech and its founder, Eugene Yu, the lawsuit said. According to the Houston Chronicle, the suit had a brief and tumultuous history on the Houston docket. In late October, True the Vote leaders testified that they had learned concerning information about the software company from FBI agents. The federal judge pressed the conservative leaders to disclose more of the details of their accusations. He then held the founder and a contractor for the conservative group in contempt and ordered them to serve time in jail. Then in February, the federal judge recused himself. Konnech asked the newly assigned judge to dismiss the case &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; against True the Vote. The company is also withdrawing its case against Catherine Engelbrecht, the organization&#8217;s founder, and contractor Gregg Phillips, according to court documents.</p>

														<p><a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/election-administration/profession-democracy-election-administration-and-state-associations">The Profession of Democracy: Election Administration and State Associations</a>: Elections administrators, the people who referee our democracy, are literally and figuratively under threat. Long hours, harassment, malicious open records requests, hyper partisanship – these and other factors are driving people out of elections administration. How do we attract and retain people willing to make a career of elections administration while meeting the training and collegial demands of a more professionalized workforce? The Certificate in Election Administration’s spring conference will explore the state of election administration professionalism, the role state associations play in the development of a vibrant, resilient field, and national and state-specific training programs that can help drive the profession forward. <strong>When:</strong> May 10. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/trust-issues-in-political-institutions/">Trust Issues: Examining Declining Confidence in Political Institutions</a>:  Trust is a keystone of institutions, but that keystone is increasingly weak. Across nearly all institutions—government, business, media, religion—trust is at an all-time low, with no shortage of polls showing the continuing decline. According to Pew Research Center, only 21% of Americans recently said they trust the government in Washington to do what is right “just about always” or “most of the time.” Can these trends be reversed or are our democratic institutions stuck cursing the storm? Join the Bipartisan Policy Center and the National Capital Area Political Science Association for a conversation with experts investigating the causes and consequences of declining trust in society, as well as prospects for restoring this essential element of national strength. <strong>When:</strong> May 10, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
