														<p><strong>Introducing RABET-V</strong><br />
<em>An Innovative Approach to Securing Non-Voting Election Technology</em></p>
<p>By Jared Dearing, Sr. Director of Election Best Practices<br />
<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center for Internet Security</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>As a first-of-its-kind methodology, the RABET-V program is about more than simply enhancing the security of our election technology; it&#8217;s about continually improving the security landscape and ensuring the integrity of our democracy.</em></p>
<p>Nearly every aspect of our election processes depends on technology, making robust and efficient security verification of those systems critical. Election officials at the state and local levels need confidence that their non-voting election infrastructure is secure, reliable, resistant to threats, and serves the needs of users. The Center for Internet Security® (CIS®) is proud to announce the operational phase of an innovative solution that meets this demand: the Rapid Architecture-Based Election Technology Verification (RABET-V) program.</p>
<p><b><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9859" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RABET-V-Electionline-Article-Graphic-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RABET-V-Electionline-Article-Graphic-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RABET-V-Electionline-Article-Graphic-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RABET-V-Electionline-Article-Graphic-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RABET-V-Electionline-Article-Graphic-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RABET-V-Electionline-Article-Graphic.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></b><strong>What is RABET-V, and Why Should I Care?</strong><b><br />
</b><a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/elections/rabetv?utm_source=electionline&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=eiisac&amp;utm_content=rabet_v">RABET-V</a> is a technology verification solution that empowers elections officials to make better-informed decisions as to which non-voting election technology to use in their districts by giving them detailed, thorough assessment information about the technology products they use and the organizations that develop those products, regardless of whether the non-voting technology is homegrown or from a technology provider.</p>
<p>RABET-V was developed to provide assurance to election officials of the performance of their non-voting equipment. RABET-V is rapid, reliable, and cost-effective, providing a comprehensive testing standard that gives election officials assurance in the security, usability, accessibility, and other critical factors of non-voting election systems in use, or being considered for use, in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>How Does RABET-V Help Election Officials?</strong><b><br />
</b>RABET-V accomplishes all that traditional product verification does, but where other product verification processes stop, RABET-V is just getting started. In addition to an enhanced product verification assessment—think penetration testing or compliance testing—RABET-V also evaluates overall organizational maturity and architectural effectiveness, including meeting usability and accessibility requirements. RABET-V’s unique approach to scoring enables election officials to make apples-to-apples comparisons between technology products during procurements. RABET-V moves past a simple baseline certification, providing both technology providers and state officials key insights into the products overall security posture while incentivizing ongoing organizational maturity and product security.</p>
<p><strong>How Does RABET-V Help Technology Providers?</strong><b><br />
</b>RABET-V provides technology providers with critical insights into their own systems and architecture, identifying gaps and security weaknesses, subsequently delivering to technology providers a roadmap of how to continually mature their organization and their product(s) over time.</p>
<p>By aligning their product offerings with the rigorous RABET-V standards, technology providers can leverage their RABET-V verification as a market differentiator when garnering business from state and local election officials, while officials know with much greater detail both what they’re getting, and how likely it is to stand up to a constantly evolving threat environment.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Use RABET-V to Secure Non-Voting Equipment?</strong><b><br />
</b>The RABET-V program focuses on both the technology product and the technology providers themselves, evaluating their company’s maturity, the consistency of the organization’s procedures and policies, and the quality of the product’s architectural approach. This comprehensive assessment paints a more holistic picture of non-voting election technology and its reliability.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Traditional testing methods often discourage product improvements due to the time-consuming and costly re-verification process required with each incremental update to technology. RABET-V, however, changes this paradigm, introducing an iterative assessment model that encourages continual improvement and enables election officials to deploy an up-to-date, fully patched version of the software sooner.</em></p>
<p>This is achieved through a risk-based testing approach that reduces the cost of re-verification and saves time and effort, for technology providers.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes RABET-V a Streamlined and Cost-Effective Solution for Technology Providers?</strong><b><br />
</b>RABET-V is a more cost-effective approach for technology providers. The organizational and architectural assessments of RABET-V require a small upfront investment which pays off in the long run by allowing mature organizations to streamline future testing. This reduces costs by focusing re-verification on the aspects of the system affected by changes, rather than reviewing the entire system each time.</p>
<p>In addition, by creating the environment for a consistent national approach, RABET-V can reduce the cost of having each technology provider go through similar but non-standard testing procedures in each state or locality.</p>
<p>Initial estimates indicate that the RABET-V program will provide substantial cost savings for technology providers compared to traditional testing methods. By using one streamlined testing approach (RABET-V) in multiple states, technology providers, and ultimately states, should experience substantial cost reductions.</p>
<p><strong>What Evidence Is There That RABET-V Is Effective?</strong><b><br />
</b>The pilot testing of the RABET-V process, with participation from five separate technology providers, proved that the program can consistently apply rigorous assessments of the organization and the company’s product offerings.</p>
<p>The RABET-V pilot program measured the ability of RABET-V to apply the assessment methodology consistently, efficiently, and effectively across several aspects of non-voting systems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product security verification</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Organizational maturity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Long Does the RABET-V Verification Process Take?</strong><b><br />
</b>RABET-V offers election offices in all jurisdictions a quicker means of verifying all aspects of non-voting systems – from security to accessibility, and from reliability to architecture.</p>
<p>Initial iterations of a brand-new product can usually be completed in less than two months—far quicker than traditional testing methods, while revisions of previously-verified technology can take as little as a few days with RABET-V.</p>
<p><strong>How Do Election Officials Get Started?</strong><b><br />
</b>RABET-V is set to launch in September 2023, with tester accreditation beginning in August 2023.</p>
<p>Getting started with RABET-V is as simple as taking the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Start a conversation with your technology providers about the RABET-V program</em>: Ask your technology providers: &#8220;Are you planning to use RABET-V to verify your non-voting election technology is secure?&#8221;</li>
<li><em>Collaborate with your procurement organizations:</em> Ask your procurement organizations: “How can we implement RABET-V and RABET-V-verified non-voting election technology into our procurement chain?”</li>
<li><em>Work closely with elections technical staff</em>: Ask your elections technical staff: “What support do you need to sufficiently test and protect non-voting systems?”</li>
</ul>

While there were some competitive primaries, overall turnout was relatively low on Election Day, although early voting was brisk. “Our absentee voting has been quite high,” said<a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2023/06/20/slow-steady-turnout-primary-day-central-virginia/"> Henrico County</a> Registrar Mark Coakley. “We’ve had over 20,000 voters vote absentee either by mail or in person, so that’s why you’re seeing a low election day turnout so far.” Vote totals were delayed in<a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/prince-william-elections-chief-vote-totals-delayed-due-to-technical-difficulties-with-new-state-reporting/article_15cdf01c-0fd9-11ee-9add-cf9b9346fdee.html"> Prince William County</a> Tuesday night due to &#8220;technical issues&#8221; with the state&#8217;s reporting system, according to county Registrar and Elections Chief Eric Olsen. The county elections office was having difficulties uploading the county vote totals into the state’s new “results reporting system,&#8221; Olsen said. A power outage affected voting at two polling places in<a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/power-outage-affects-polling-places-kempsville-area-virginia-beach/291-29e752d2-c105-44ac-abae-2acdd1e68c82"> Virginia Beach</a> Tuesday afternoon, the city&#8217;s registrar said. Voting wasn’t stopped, but because the tablets used to run the votes are on battery power, and teams from the city went out with power inverters to keep those machines powered, according to the registrar.<a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-primary-election-arlington-voters-vote-juune-20-ballots-what-is-ranked-choice-voting-how-does-it-work-elections-county-board-race-community-polling-sites-registration-"> Arlington County</a> tested out ranked choice voting for the first time and some voters expressed confusion about the new system.</p>

Though State Election Board members voted against replacing Fulton’s bipartisan election board, they also urged the county to continue its progress in preparation for next year’s presidential election. “The performance review helped incentivize Fulton County to make improvements to their elections, which doesn’t surprise me. When under scrutiny, people do in fact change,” State Election Board Chairman Bill Duffey said. “There has to be an assurance of readiness for success in the 2024 election.” Fulton election officials told the board that the performance review failed to find any violations of state laws as the county made substantial improvements to training, processes and procedures.</p>

The report was released last week, more than seven months after the election, and highlights staffing issues that have plagued the county for years. Luzerne District Attorney Sam Sanguedolce said there is “no question” turnover was the primary issue, echoing findings from<a href="https://pennsylvania.votebeat.org/2023/2/15/23601266/luzerne-county-voting-problems-ballot-paper-shortage-turnover"> a February report by Votebeat and Spotlight PA</a>.  The report also detailed new information about the county’s scramble to deal with the paper shortage on Election Day and debunked rumors that the situation was intentional. The investigation also found that the problem was less widespread than initial reports suggested. Crucially, the report examined and dismissed public claims that Republican areas had been specifically targeted by the paper shortages in order to suppress or disenfranchise Republican voters. Sanguedolce’s report found that the cause of the ballot paper shortage were part of a complicated series of events that led up to and continued throughout Election Day. The report also pointed out that after the 2021 primary — when Republican ballots displayed on voting machine screens were mistakenly labeled as Democratic — an outside consultant called The Elections Group had developed a timeline of tasks to be completed by election office employees in preparation for the 2022 election, including ordering paper and making sure enough of it made it to each polling site.  It appears the timeline was not followed, and it is unclear whether Gilbert McBride was aware of it.</p>

The report outlines key policy priorities to help election administrators meet their staffing needs and diversify the pool of poll workers ahead of the 2024 election. Poll worker shortages can contribute to long lines, closed polling locations, and significant wait times. To combat these challenges, voting rights experts from Fair Elections Center, a nonpartisan voting rights organization, have identified solutions that help to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide flexibility in recruitment by shifting from jurisdiction-specific to statewide residency requirements</li>
<li>Allow 16-year-olds to be poll workers</li>
<li>Launch accessible online poll worker applications in each state</li>
<li>Create opportunities for voters without party affiliation to serve</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no “off years” when it comes to election preparation. Training skilled poll workers is a year round effort and vital to improving election administration nationwide. Even in non-federal election cycles, poll workers are key investments and play an important role in maximizing voter turnout.   In 2016, Fair Elections Center developed<a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/8/b4r7tcxh6zrr9962mkju590cd/4/293a8ad8e0f10a27cedb0cce3677f306309f796736e636ab5d67130d992abc74"> WorkElections</a>, a project aimed at helping election administrators throughout the United States recruit new poll workers. This unique recruitment web portal has created the underpinning of recruitment efforts for national organizations and major recruitment strategies used by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and Power the Polls since the pandemic driven shortages of 2020.</p>

Their reasoning was the sticker designs should incorporate the words “Carson City,” making them specific to elections in the capital city. “Previously, we did an ‘I Voted’ sticker contest that was open to Carson City seniors in the 2020 election cycle,” said Carson City Chief Deputy Clerk Miguel Camacho. “This time around, we opened it up to residents in Carson City as a whole.” The public art contest ran from March 30 to April 26. The two winning stickers will be provided to Carson City voters in <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-9858" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CarsonCityIVoted2-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />the next election cycle. Clerk-Recorder Scott Hoen reminded the board and audience members that 2024 will have three elections. “We’re having a presidential preference primary in February, the primary in June and the general in November,” he said.

Katie Hobbs (D) has vetoed more elections-related bills including<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78691?SessionId=127"> Senate Bill 1095</a>, which would have required envelopes in which early ballots are mailed to inform voters that dropping off their early ballot after the Friday before the election could result in delayed election results. The Arizona Association of Counties did not support this bill, and said that county recorders believed it would cause confusion since they advise voters to mail their ballots by the Wednesday before Election Day. “I am concerned that this bill could have the effect of discouraging voter participation,” Hobbs wrote in her veto letter. “These concerns outweigh any potential benefits that this bill may present.”</p>
<p>Hobbs also vetoed<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78985?SessionId=127"> Senate Bill 1332</a>, which would make Arizona’s<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/02/09/bipartisan-support-for-bill-to-make-all-arizona-ballots-a-public-record/"> cast vote record</a> available to the public.  “Any bill that permits releasing the Cast Vote Record must ensure that a voter’s privacy is protected,” Hobbs wrote in her veto letter, echoing the concerns of critics that this bill could result in the unintentional release of personal information about voters.</p>
<p>Another election bill on Hobbs’ chopping block was<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/79268?SessionId=127"> Senate Bill 1595</a>, which would have required early voters to either return their ballot by 7 p.m. the Friday before the election or present their ID, if they drop it off after that. Proponents said the bill was an effort to speed up the tabulation of election results by requiring ID for those who drop off their early ballot at the last minute, requiring a scramble to verify signatures on those ballots. “This bill fails to meaningfully address the real challenges facing Arizona voters,” Hobbs wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/79270?SessionId=127">Senate Bill 1596</a> also got a Hobbs veto. The bill would have required counties to go back to a precinct voter model, with established voting locations for each precinct, with the option of adding voting centers where anyone within a county can vote. Maricopa and Pima counties in recent years have transitioned to using only voting centers, which allows voters to cast a ballot at any voting site within the county. The bill would also have required state and local governments, including school districts, to provide space for polling places, if requested. “This bill creates an unfunded and untenable mandate for schools and communities,” Hobbs wrote. “This bill once had an appropriation, demonstrating that it needs funding to be viable. However, it was not included in the budget, and as such, I cannot support it.”</p>

Senators Caroline Menjivar and Monique Limón, both Democrats, introduced the legislation, which seeks to register about 5 million more voters. As of May 2022, California has about 21.9 million registered voters, about 82% of the 26.9 million adults in the state who are eligible to vote, according to a Public Policy Institute of California report. However, researchers did find that those likely to vote in California are disproportionately white, older, more educated, affluent, natural-born U.S. citizens and homeowners. The bill, should it pass, would remove barriers to increasing voter registration among people of color, women, and other harder-to-reach populations in the state, Senator Limón said in a news release. California’s Motor Voter program, implemented in 2018, registers eligible residents completing a driver’s license, state identification, or change of address transaction unless they opt out. While the current process has been successful, the bill would expand the process by automatically registering people who complete a transaction at the DMV first, and then providing the option via mail to opt out later.</p>

Stephanie Bolden (D-Wilmington) is hoping the 5th time is the charm as she continues her effort to change the First State&#8217;s political calendar. Bolden is backing<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=140544"> House Bill 215</a>, that would<a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/early-voting-delaware-legislators-again-contemplating-moving-primary-to-april/article_591a80e6-0bd9-11ee-ba23-1fdb6f8c2e8c.html"> shift the date of Delaware&#8217;s primary election</a> from early September to the fourth Tuesday in April. Currently, Delaware joins New Hampshire and Rhode Island in holding the country&#8217;s latest primaries, with each choosing the first Tuesday after the second Monday. Rep. Lyndon Yearick (R-Magnolia) backed the bill in the House Administration Committee, saying the late date of Delaware&#8217;s primaries serves to limit the time a candidate has to go from the primary to general election stage. The late April date is intentional, as it would mirror when Delaware holds their Presidential Primary, removing a scenario where Delaware voters would go to the pull on separate dates for Presidential Primary, Delaware Primary, and then the General Election.</p>

John Bel Edwards<a href="https://lailluminator.com/briefs/la-sec-of-state-asks-governor-to-not-veto-voter-canvass-bill/"> asking him to not veto a bill</a> that would allow his agency to perform a supplemental voter canvass every year.  The legislation is<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB646&amp;sbi=y"> House Bill 646</a>, sponsored by Rep. Les Farnum, R-Sulphur. The majority-Republican legislature has passed similar versions of the bill in two previous sessions, and Edwards has vetoed them each time. They are unnecessary because parish registrars already conduct voter canvasses once every year, the governor has said. An annual voter canvass looks for residents who have changed addresses or moved out of state. The parish registrar mails them a new voter identification card to fill out. If they fail to return the card, they can be moved to an inactive voters list. Farnum’s legislation would allow Ardoin’s office to send similar cards to people who have been inactive voters for at least 10 years. If those people fail to return the cards, they could be purged from voter rolls.</p>

LD 1869, introduced by Sen. Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), would have required that municipalities submit a report to the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices within 30 days of “spending funds received from a private source in excess of $100 on the administration of an election.” Such a report would need to include “the amount of the funds received by the municipality, the source of the funds and a detailed explanation of how the funds were spent.” This requirement was set to take effect on January 1, 2024. Maine Secretary of State Shanna Bellows (D)<a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getTestimonyDoc.asp?id=174359"> testified</a> in opposition to the bill, accusing it of “sowing disinformation about our elections here in Maine.” Bellows argued that “the Elections Division has never accepted funding from private, partisan sources to conduct state and federal elections and will never do so.” “Again, while the underlying intent of this bill may be benign the way elections are discussed is very important and any suggestion of fraud or malfeasance – where there is none – is incredibly dangerous,” Bellows said.</p>

Ranked choice voting was specifically rejected by Massachusetts voters during the 2020 election.</p>

Tampering with voting equipment, ballot boxes, Statewide Voter Registration System, registration lists or polling rosters is also illegal under this law. Violating this law will result in a gross misdemeanor, damage penalties and up to $1,000 for each violation.</p>

The proposed system would also let voters change their party affiliation online and amend information in the voter file, such as their name and current address.  If approved by lawmakers and signed by Gov. Chris Sununu, the bill would not take effect until January 2024 – just ahead of the state’s presidential primary, which is typically held in February. The Secretary of State’s Office is already moving to replace its “legacy voter database” this year and upgrade to a more modern system, Secretary of State Dave Scanlan told lawmakers.</p>

Under the bill, county clerks in New Jersey would be required, in consultation with county boards of elections, to periodically report the unofficial tally of election results on the night of any primary and general election, every day thereafter and until the final tally thereafter. Under current law, district boards of elections are required to post a notice every two hours on Election Day indicating the cumulative number of voters who have voted in the election by machine and provisional ballot. The bill would further require that the district level results for the in-person early voting period, the Election Day vote, and the vote-by-mail vote be reported on the county clerk’s Internet site upon certification of the results. The bill, S-3594, was released from committee by a vote of 11-0.</p>

Roy Cooper vetoed in past years and to remove his control over the State Board of Elections. By identical party-line votes favoring the GOP, the chamber agreed to two measures that would affect election administration and the details of voting in the nation’s ninth-largest state, where statewide elections are often close.  The bills’ sponsors contend the changes will rebuild trust in election results, protect lawful voting and help create election rules with bipartisan backing.  In one significant provision, traditional absentee ballots not received by county election offices by the time in-person balloting ends at 7:30 p.m. on the date of the election would no longer count. Currently such ballots received by mail up to three days after the election can be counted if postmarked by the election date.  In another bill also approved 28-19, the State Board of Elections would increase from five members to eight, with its members no longer appointed by the governor but by legislative leaders of both major parties. The shift in the absentee ballot deadline is among three provisions that Cooper vetoed in 2019 or 2021 and are contained in one of the bills that was approved.  A second previously vetoed provision bars election boards and county officials from accepting private money to administer elections. And the other previously vetoed item directs state courts to send information to election officials about potential jurors being disqualified because they aren’t U.S. citizens for their eventual removal from voter rolls. The pair of measures now go to the House, where, as in the Senate, the GOP now holds veto-proof majorities. Cooper’s previous vetoes on the three items had stuck at the time because Democrats held enough seats to uphold them.</p>

Proponents say the current system too easily allows people to flip back and forth and mess with their opponents&#8217; elections. The legislation comes less than one year before Ohioans will select nominees for president and Ohio&#8217;s 2024 U.S. Senate race. &#8220;Just like a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers should not be selecting a Cincinnati Bengals quarterback, the members of each political party should be selecting their candidate,&#8221; said Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, who&#8217;s sponsoring one of the proposals. &#8220;This bill simply helps to assure election integrity and increases voter confidence.&#8221;<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb208"> House Bill 208</a> and<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb210"> House Bill 210</a> are similar in spirit, but they differ on key details. In both cases, voters would select their political party on a registration application or update form. They could choose from a party recognized by the state or write in another established party not listed on the form. Voters could still indicate if they prefer to be unaffiliated, meaning they would only be able to cast ballots on local or statewide issues. Under House Bill 210, sponsored by Gross, Ohioans who wish to select or change their political party for an upcoming primary must do so by Dec. 31. Anyone who submits a form after that would have to wait until the following year to vote in a partisan primary. House Bill 208, introduced by Rep. Thomas Hall, R-Madison Township, would let voters make that call up to 30 days before the election. Hall did not respond to an interview request.</p>

Greg Abbott<a href="https://texas.votebeat.org/2023/6/20/23767777/texas-voting-mail-ballot-disabilities-abbott-veto"> vetoed a bipartisan bill</a> that would have expanded vote-by-mail access for people with disabilities — specifically people who are blind or paralyzed and need assistance marking their ballot.  Advocates say Abbott’s veto of<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB3159"> House Bill 3159</a> is a blow for voters with disabilities who have for years called for the Legislature to grant them a way to mark their mail-in ballots without having to rely on anyone else.  Co-authored by state Rep. Jeff Leach, R-Plano, and state Rep. John H. Bucy III, D-Austin, the bill would have allowed voters who need help casting a ballot, such as people who are visually impaired or are paralyzed, to do so “privately and securely” by requesting an electronic ballot and using a computer to mark their choices. The bill still would have required those voters to print out, sign and return their ballots by mail. The bill requires voters who want to vote by mail using the electronically delivered accessible ballot to affirm they “have a sickness or physical condition preventing them from appearing at the polling place on election day without a likelihood of needing personal assistance or injuring [their] health.” In a resolution explaining his veto, Abbott called the intent of the bill “laudable” but said the bill does not limit the use of an electronic and accessible ballot by mail only to voters with disabilities. He says the bill would allow “any voter who qualifies to vote by mail to receive a ballot electronically.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Abbott signed into law two<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/abbott-legislature-harris-county-elections-18160690.php"> bills targeting Harris County</a> elections, triggering a legal showdown in which the county is expected to argue the actions violate the Texas Constitution.  Senate Bill 1750 abolishes the county&#8217;s elections administrators office. The other measure, Senate Bill 1933, allows certain individuals to file election complaints that could place Harris County election officials under &#8220;administrative oversight,&#8221; meaning that they would need to clear all election policies and procedures with the secretary of state. The first bill transfers election administration duties to two elected officials — the county clerk and the tax assessor-collector —  ending Harris County&#8217;s three-year run with an appointed elections administrator.

Attorneys for Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd want U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor to dismiss a lawsuit filed in April by the League of Women Voters of Florida and the NAACP. The lawsuit contends that the state’s voter-registration form violates a federal law known as the National Voter Registration Act because it does not properly inform potential voters of eligibility requirements. That has resulted, in part, in high-profile arrests of felons who thought they had regained voting rights, according to attorneys representing the voting-rights groups. By seeking changes in the voter-registration form, the plaintiffs are asking the state to “nip this problem in the bud,” Eliza Sweren-Becker, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, told Winsor during the hearing. An attorney for Byrd, argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed and that the state is complying with the federal law. He also contended that the voter-registration form would become unwieldy if it had to provide a wide range of information about restoration of voting rights.</p>

The Southern Coalition for Social Justice and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional on Fourteenth Amendment grounds. “The undisputed record also shows that county prosecutors have interpreted and enforced the Law inconsistently,” the motion reads. “While some prosecutors have charged individuals who mistakenly voted before completing their post- release supervision, others have declined to prosecute individuals where there was no evidence of intent.” That motion also states that about Black residents make up 22% of North Carolina’s population, but almost 64% of those investigated by the State Board of Elections under the Strict Liability Voting Law between 2015 and 2022. More than two-thirds of the 441 cases investigated after the 2016 general election audit involved Black voters.</p>

The court court determined that lawmakers legally set an Aug. 8 election for Issue 1. If approved, the measure would require 60% of voters to enact new constitutional amendments, instead of a simple majority of 50% plus one. Issue 1 would also change the signature-gathering process citizens must follow to place amendments on the ballot. It requires citizen groups to get voter signatures from all 88 counties, instead of 44, to place an amendment on the ballot. And it would eliminate a 10-day period that petitioners are granted to replace any invalid signatures. The One Person One Vote coalition<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/12/advocates-sue-over-ohio-august-election-on-constitutional-changes/70212652007/"> sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose</a> in May and asked the court to direct LaRose to scrap the Aug. 8 election. The group contends it&#8217;s not legal because of Ohio&#8217;s new voting law, which limits when August special elections can be held. Instead, advocates argued, amendments proposed by the Legislature must appear on the ballot during a November general election or spring primary. The Ohio Constitution says lawmakers can put ballot questions before voters at &#8220;either a special or a general election as the General Assembly may prescribe.&#8221; Republican justices said that rule trumps the new voting law, meaning they could set the election through a joint resolution.</p>

The appeal filed by Franklin County voter James Gimenez sought to upend a settlement reached in May 2022 after three Latino voters sued Franklin County and its board of commissioners for diluting the votes of Latino voters. Justice Mary Yu<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wa-supreme-court-franklin-county.pdf"> rejected</a> Gimenez’s appeal to the state’s high court on Thursday, explaining that his arguments are informed by an incorrect interpretation of the act’s definition of a “protected class,” claiming that it protects some racial groups while excluding others. “The WVRA protects all Washington voters from discrimination on the basis of race, color and language minority group,” Yu wrote. “On its face, the WVRA does not require race-based favoritism in local electoral systems, nor does it trigger strict scrutiny by granting special privileges, abridging voting rights or otherwise classifying voters on the basis of race. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs have standing and that the WVRA is valid and constitutional on its face.”</p>

The court’s decision means as found guilty of committing the crimes, but is not legally responsible for committing them, per state statutes, because of his mental condition. Miecielica was ordered into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington County on June 1 for a supplemental examination and report, according to court documents.</p>
