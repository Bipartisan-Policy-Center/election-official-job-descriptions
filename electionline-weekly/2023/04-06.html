							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Securing 2023: Defending US elections through investment and reform</strong><br />
<em>New report offers key recommendations for 2024</em></p>
<p>The<a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/"> Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund</a> and<a href="https://issueone.org/"> Issue One</a> recently released a new report that outlines <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8863" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy-300x156.png" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy-300x156.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />thirteen steps the federal government and state legislatures should take to make our elections stronger and more secure going into 2024.<a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/securing-2024/"> Securing 2024: Defending US Elections through Investment and Reform</a> is anchored by key recommendations that have had strong bipartisan support in recent years.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the proposals included in the report connect to the persistent lack of sufficient federal funding for local and state election administration. Our election infrastructure is chronically underfunded, which forces many elections officials across the country to face difficult budgetary decisions when administering their elections. Ensuring robust annual appropriations for election funding is a critical step to help state and local election officials meet basic modernization, staffing, and security needs, as well as implement many of the other reforms detailed in the report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8509" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-2.49.28-PM-300x136.png" alt="" width="300" height="136" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-2.49.28-PM-300x136.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-2.49.28-PM.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“The demands and expectations facing election officials have increased exponentially in recent years,” said David Levine, report co-author and Elections Integrity Fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at GMF. “Federal and state legislators have an opportunity right now to ensure that ongoing challenges—from cyber threats and disinformation to the pace at which we count ballots—don’t undermine elections in 2024 and beyond. Republicans and Democrats must show a united front and deliver much-needed funding to keep our elections safe and fair.”</p>
<p>Congress took an important step at the end of last year by passing a bipartisan update to the Electoral Count Act, closing a loophole governing how Congress counts electoral votes in presidential elections. This success is an indicator that there is bipartisan agreement that improving the security of our elections before 2024 is essential, and it offers a roadmap for future reforms that will secure our democracy.</p>
<p>“Election officials ensured that the 2022 midterm elections were a success, but it’s time that our federal and state leaders step up, take action, and deliver the proper funds and resources these officials need to do their job safely and effectively,” said Issue One’s Legislative Manager and report co-author Gideon Cohn-Postar. “It’s vital that Republicans and Democrats work together now to strengthen the security and accessibility of our elections before the 2024 cycle.”</p>
<p>In addition to regular, sufficient federal funding for elections, other key recommendations from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving election officials more federal resources to counter cyber threats, including those from foreign adversaries;</li>
<li>Criminalizing threats or attacks against election workers;</li>
<li>Enacting privacy protections for election workers by prohibiting doxxing and giving at-risk individuals the ability to remove personal information from public information requests and searches; and</li>
<li>Improving election officials’ ability to counter election-related disinformation, including on social media platforms.</li>

							<h2>2023 Elections</h2>
														<p>Voters went to the polls in at least seven states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin — for statewide and local elections, as well as special elections. Turnout was high for Wisconsin’s statewide supreme court election, but low in Chicago’s mayoral runoff, despite high early voting numbers. Weather played a major role in Illinois and for what may be the first time ever, the NFL Draft had an impact on voting in Missouri. Here’s a brief look at how things played out this week in some states:</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8881" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22-300x266.png" alt="" width="150" height="133" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22-300x266.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22.png 458w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Colorado:</strong> Several cities held local elections this week including Denver. Pre-election day turnout was relatively low in Denver, but a rush of<a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/last-minute-voters-cause-small-delay-in-ballot-counting-denver-election-officials-say"> last-minute voters</a> in the Mile High City caused some delays in ballot-counting. Around 175,000 people in Denver in the 22 days since ballots were mailed on March 13, according to Paul D. López, City of Denver clerk, however about 55,000, around 30% of the ballots, came in in the last two hours of Election Day. Despite the deluge of last-minute votes, Lopez anticipated all the unchallenged ballots will be counted by the end of the day Wednesday. The Denver elections office has until April 12 to cure challenged ballots. Given the 17-candidate field for mayor, it’s likely that once all the ballots are counted and cured that a<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/discussion-ignites-surrounding-ranked-choice-voting-option-denver/"> runoff</a> will be necessary.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5905" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chicago-I-Voted-300x257.png" alt="" width="191" height="164" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chicago-I-Voted-300x257.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chicago-I-Voted-1024x878.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chicago-I-Voted-768x658.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chicago-I-Voted.png 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" />Illinois:</strong> Severe spring weather was the story of the day for elections officials and voters in Illinois. Numerous vote centers in<a href="https://qctimes.com/news/local/live-updates-wind-gust-hit-90-mph-power-outage-affecting-polling-centers-schools-out-early/article_ffa7c037-375f-5dfd-ab2c-ab2312b0dedd.html"> Rock Island County</a> lost power during the height of storms. Election officials in<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/aurora-area-residents-weather-storm-232000602.html"> Kane, Kendall and DuPage</a> counties said that despite some stormy weather Tuesday, residents still showed up at the polls to vote on Election Day. Officials with all three counties said they saw dips in people coming in to vote during the storm which produced plenty of rain and some sizable hail Tuesday afternoon in the Aurora area. When<a href="https://www.25newsnow.com/2023/04/05/tazewell-county-clerk-offers-assistance-fulton-county-after-election-night-storms/"> Fulton County</a> was unable to gather all the election equipment compile results because of severe weather,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TazewellCountyClerk/posts/598678465622361"> Tazewell County</a> Clerk John Ackerman stepped up to offer assistance. Tazewell County too experienced storm-related issues. Ackerman posted on the county’s Facebook page that approximately 150 election judges, election staff and tabulation facility volunteers had to shelter in-place for about 45 minutes as storms rolled through. “No Tazewell County Election Judge was left in harm’s way during this potentially dangerous time,” Ackerman wrote. “While plans had been discussed and procedures outlined for an emergency situation like the one that unfolded last night, this was the first time those plans and procedures where implemented.”  In<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-lns-lake-county-election-turnout-st-0405-20230404-4n75izbdtjcebcxvh45sus7pty-story.html"> Lake County</a>, a polling place in Waukegan opened around 40 minutes late, and three voting sites in Highland Park were shuttered for approximately 90 minutes because of a lockdown and gun threat at nearby Highland Park High School Tuesday morning. The Waukegan polling place stayed open till 7:40pm and the three locations in Highland Park remained open till 8:35 p.m.<a href="https://1430wcmy.com/2023/04/05/lasalle-county-clerk-says-her-first-election-went-phenomenally/"> LaSalle County</a> Clerk Jennifer Ebner says her first election she ran went really good. She credits her staff for what they do. The<a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20230405/system-glitch-caused-some-election-night-confusion-in-kane-county"> Kane County</a> Clerk&#8217;s election website was shut down around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday after officials realized a problem in uploading reports from the county&#8217;s tabulating system. When the website came back online a little after midnight, some unofficial vote tallies were lower than they were before the website went down. &#8220;It was an error,&#8221; Kane County Clerk Jack Cunningham said. &#8220;And when we found it, we corrected it as quickly as we could.&#8221; In<a href="https://www.theintelligencer.com/news/article/results-come-quickly-consolidated-elections-17879284.php"> Madison County</a> results rolled in quickly this year. “We’re cooking down here,” Madison County Clerk Linda Andreas said about 8:20 p.m. Tuesday. As of Tuesday night, turnout in the<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-runoff-elections-turnout-early-voting/"> Chicago</a> mayoral runoff election totaled about 35%, with 558,547 total ballots cast. With more than 90,000 mail-in ballots that could still come in and be counted over the next two weeks, that figure will certainly rise, though even if all those ballots are returned, turnout will still fall short of the 41% seen in the 2015 runoff election. Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Max Bever said Tuesday&#8217;s turnout was a slight improvement from the first round of voting on Feb. 28, when turnout stood at 32.1% before outstanding mail-in ballots came in over the next two weeks.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7825" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BooneCoMOIVoted-300x242.png" alt="" width="221" height="178" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BooneCoMOIVoted-300x242.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BooneCoMOIVoted.png 394w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" />Missouri:</strong> Overall Election Day was smooth in most Missouri jurisdictions, although there were some noteworthy issues. Voters in<a href="https://www.kctv5.com/2023/04/04/voters-headed-union-station-deal-with-parking-issues-detours/"> Kansas City</a> attempting to vote in Union Station were forced to deal with road closures due to the upcoming NFL Draft. Some voters said they had a hard time finding where to park to get the polls because of road closures and there not being enough signage or directions provided. “They have to understand we are sharing a big parking lot with the NFL, with the post office,” said Shawn Kieffer, Director of Elections. “There’s less spots but still plenty of parking in the facility.” In<a href="https://www.ozarksfirst.com/your-local-election-hq/voters-confront-springfield-poll-worker-wearing-maga-hat/"> Greene County</a>, the police were called due to a heated confrontation at a polling place between a poll worker wearing a MAGA hat and voters. “I came here personally and spoke to the election judge,” said Republican Clerk Shane Schoeller, who’s announced a bid for Missouri Secretary of State next year. The election judge put a different hat on and was allowed to remain at the polls for the rest of his shift. Schoeller said voters are allowed to wear political attire as long as it’s unrelated to any ballot issues in that specific election. However, he said election judges should refrain from wearing anything political in nature that could disrupt the voting process, including MAGA clothing. In<a href="https://krcgtv.com/news/local/columbia-police-investigation-locks-down-polling-location-on-election-day"> Boone County</a> one polling place was forced to go into temporary lock down because of a nearby police investigation of a man with knife.</p>

In<a href="https://fox11online.com/news/election/city-green-bay-borrows-voting-machine-brown-county-replacement-not-working-botanical-garden-polling-place"> Green Bay</a>, when a voting machine at the Green Bay Botanical Garden and its backup both failed to function, the city borrowed a voting machine from Brown County. Voters in<a href="https://www.kenoshanews.com/news/kenosha-voters-brave-the-rain-during-spring-election-tuesday-clerks-note-consistent-turnout/article_356a7b6a-d31c-11ed-8319-7b1b6c3d3d62.html"> Kenosha</a> braved the rain on Tuesday, but  none of the severe weather like that in Illinois. In Wauwatosa, longtime poll worker Dawn-Marie Metz spent Tuesday serving as a door greeter at her assigned polling place. &#8220;Giving back to my community and then seeing how elections are run, it&#8217;s made me feel much more safe and secure with our election process,&#8221; Metz explained. &#8220;It is an arduous process and people take it seriously and we take a lot of time doing it.&#8221; One polling site in<a href="https://www.wqow.com/news/politics/large-voter-turnout-in-eau-claire-causes-one-polling-site-to-run-out-of-paper/article_f1c90140-d363-11ed-ac42-03c9695e8881.html"> Eau Claire</a> ran out of paper ballots for about an hour during the afternoon, but voters were able to use the site’s electronic voting machine.</p>

According to the report, Nearly 3,000 organizations in all fifty states organized events to encourage their friends and neighbors to vote early. This coalition included national name brands like MTV, Patagonia, Paramount, Twitter, The League of Women Voters, Snapchat, YMCA, NAACP and many more. On the ground, thousands of local nonprofits, businesses, campus groups, election leaders and libraries organized in their community to increase the number of ballots cast ahead of Election Day. The topline result was that early voting increased by 5.8 million votes over the 2018 midterms.</p>

The front part of the office was completely reworked. Officials say it will help improve the flow and access for voters. The project started back in mid-December. ARPA money was used to pay for the remodel, which came in under budget at $420,000. The<a href="https://news.wgcu.org/election/2023-04-05/lee-county-elections-opens-branch-office-in-lehigh-acres"> Lee County, Florida</a> Supervisor of Elections Office has opened a new branch in Lehigh Acres, which will also serve as an early voting site.

The bulk of the damage occurred in a conference room and while they are all being inspected, it seems that the county’s voting equipment survived. The<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/county-to-renovate-elections-division/article_5ae2cfbc-cd97-11ed-82b6-97927dd955cb.html"> Mesa County, Colorado</a> commission recently approved spending $133,000 to renovate the elections division.

According to the Daily Montanan, an estimated 150 people packed the meeting room and another 100 tuned in online. In March Merchant sent emails to school districts telling them the planned mail-in ballot election would not be possible and she also requested that the Great Falls Public Library postpone its election to September. Merchant said during the presentation absentee ballots will be going out April 17 and a poll election will be conducted for the school board election on May 2, a break from the typical mail-in ballot election where ballots are sent to all registered voters in the county. She also confirmed the public schools mill levy election will take place on June 6. More than 80% of Cascade County voters typically vote by mail, but Merchant said Merchant said sending ballots to just absentee voters would be cost-effective, citing the cost of the multiple envelopes and materials as well as the cost involved in using an out-of-county ballot sorter. Merchant, a local businesswoman, won the clerk and recorder’s race in November after a hand recount by fewer than 40 votes against 16-year incumbent Rina Moore. One resident asked if Merchant could explain how she felt about mail-in ballots, to which she said her feelings on mail-in ballots were not relevant. “The people have elected me to this office for transparency and integrity, and that’s what I intend to fulfill,” she said. “I am a citizen just like you are, a citizen of Cascade County, and I also vote here too. I put my ballot in the box just like everybody else does. And I also want fair, transparent and secure elections.”</p>

The 2022 “Why Vote?” theme encouraged students to consider the importance of voting and how it corresponds to their beliefs and values. This year’s ceremony honored 34 student winners and their teachers from across the state. More than 19,000 students participated in the 2022 PTV program and more than 1.5 million students have participated since the program’s inception. “It is an incredible honor to recognize the work of our young Mississippians during the PTV Awards Ceremony,” Watson said. “We are thrilled to have them participate in the program, but more importantly, we are proud they are engaged in learning about the elections process. Thank you to all the teachers, parents, principals, and other administrators who contribute to the success of the program and help instill civic responsibility among our students.”</p>

Johnson won the Democratic Senate primary in a runoff, however in 1977 Luis Salas,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/lbj-stolen-election-tapes-box-13-mangan-5a81206d635d632daa9dbe6219ac3848"> a Texas election judge went on the record</a> with the Associated Press detailing how the election was actually stolen on behalf of Johnson who was a congressman at the time. The story made headlines in 1977 and now, the audio recordings from Salas’ interview with AP reporter James W. Mangan are available on the LBJ Presidential Library Museum’s archival website. After Mangan’s death in 2015 at the age of 87, his family found the labeled cassette tapes at his San Antonio home and donated them last summer to the library on the campus of the University at Texas at Austin. Mangan’s son, Peter, told the AP listening the tapes was like getting “a little window into history.” On one cassette, he said, it sounds like his father is in his car, reciting what he’d just been told.  “You can hear cars going by and he’s kind of, you can tell he’s a little excited, because I think he finally got the goods,” Peter Mangan said. Johnson, elected to the U.S. House in 1937, had run for U.S. Senate in 1941 and lost to then-Gov. Wilbert Lee “Pappy” O’Daniel in an election widely accepted by historians to have been corrupt, Mark Lawrence, the library’s director, said. “The standard story that gets told, and I think there’s an awful lot to it, is that when LBJ’s second chance comes along in 1948, he’s determined not to have the election stolen from him again.” James Mangan retired from AP on Jan. 1, 1989, after a 36-year career with the company that took him to cities across the U.S. and to Europe. With each move, Peter Mangan said, his father held on to the Box 13 tapes. “He always kept these,” he said, “so I know they must have been important to him.”</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> The Alabama Senate approved two bills that would<a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2023/apr/05/alabama-senate-approves-bills-tfp/"> codify current voting practices</a>. Senate Bill 9 and Senate Bill 10, both sponsored by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, passed through the chamber. SB 9 requires the use of paper ballots in voting machines. SB 10 prevents the use of voting machines that connect to the internet. Each passed on 29-0 votes. Both measures passed April 4. Kathy Jones, president of the Alabama League of Women Voters, previously told the Alabama Reflector that she is concerned about potential impact on voters with disabilities. &#8220;It is a preemptive law,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Right now, all of our ballots are done with paper. That is just how things are done here in Alabama. This law seems to prohibit having any alternative to a paper ballot for those who are disabled or incapacitated.&#8221; The bill moves to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Republican state lawmakers are moving on multiple fronts to head off a possible voter initiative that would implement<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1843162/republicans-make-moves-ban-ranked-choice-voting-it-reaches-arizona-ballot"> ranked choice voting</a> in Arizona. The efforts come even as the groups considering a measure for the 2024 ballot remain in the early stages of their effort and concede it may not even move ahead. Last week the Republican-controlled Legislature placed their own measure on the ballot precluding the non-traditional election format they contend disenfranchises some primary elections. The proposal, HCR2033, would preempt any effort to change primary election laws to advance more than one person per political party to the general election.’</p>
<p>The state Senate has advanced a bill that would<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1843292/arizona-senate-moves-bill-would-remove-some-active-early-voting-list-after-one-cycle"> remove voters from the Active Early Voting List</a> if they do not vote after one election cycle. Currently, they’re removed after two consecutive cycles. Sen. Juan Mendez (D-Tempe) said the measure is disrespectful, and makes voters jump through hoops. “Removing people from the Active Early Voting List without their approval simply because they choose to sit out one election cycle is too harsh of a punishment just to appease the conspiracies that try to slander our process of voting by mail,” Mendez said. Republican Sen. John Kavanaugh (Fountain Hills) spoke in favor of the measure. He said the voters can easily stay on the list, even after missing an election. The bill now waits to be signed or vetoed by Governor Hobbs.</p>
<p>A bill that would require<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1843287/house-committee-advances-bill-requiring-247-ballot-drop-box-surveillance"> 24/7 surveillance of ballot drop boxes</a> continues to move through the Arizona Legislature. The measure was approved Monday by the House Appropriations Committee. The bill would block county recorders from using drop boxes that are unmonitored, unless they are inside  a polling place or county office. Outdoor boxes would only be used if at least two election workers, one Republican and one Democrat, watch the box 8am to 5 pm, with a livestream at night. It would also not allow most voters to drop off ballots from their cars. Proponents argue drop boxes don’t satisfy constitutional requirements for secrecy in voting. Those opposed say the bill is based on falsehoods and would disenfranchise voters. It now goes to the House floor.</p>
<p>The Senate voted to<a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/arizona-senate-votes-to-bar-official-from-overseeing-some-elections/article_0bd9bc9a-d324-11ed-a97b-7f6b4dec962d.html"> require that the state’s top election official not participate</a> in overseeing elections in which he or she is on the ballot. That leaves the proposal one vote away from heading to Democratic governor and former secretary of state Katie Hobbs. The legislation proposed by Rep. Rachel Jones, R-Tucson, has its roots in unfounded complaints by some losing Republican candidates in the 2022 election that Hobbs put her thumb on the scale for Democratic candidates while serving as secretary of state. Those who accused Hobbs of having a conflict of interest included Kari Lake, who lost her race for governor to Hobbs, and Mark Finchem, who lost his bid to replace Hobbs as Arizona&#8217;s top election official to Democrat Adrian Fontes. All Democrats in the Senate voted against the measure, House Bill 2308, as did all House Democrats when it passed out of that chamber in February, saying it was prompted by baseless conspiracy theories.</p>

House Bill 1513, which also would permit the attorney general to file civil suits for election-related offenses, received a vote of 83-9. The measure, which has the support of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and 58 co-sponsors in the House, moves to the Senate for further action. The bill&#8217;s sponsor, Rep. Austin McCollum, R-Bentonville, said the legislation would codify the Election Integrity Unit, which Griffin has established already, and create a civil cause of action for the attorney general based on already existing criminal violations. &#8220;The idea is to give a collateral attack here with a lower burden of proof,&#8221; McCollum told House members. HB1513 would allow the attorney general to bring civil action against a person or entity believed to be &#8220;engaging, has engaged, or is about to engage in any act or practice declared unlawful&#8221; under state election laws. Under the bill, the Election Integrity Unit would be required to track all alleged violations, complaints and investigations related to election integrity in a database. The secretary of state and the State Board of Election Commissioners would have secure access to the database. The Election Integrity Unit under the bill also would oversee the attorney general&#8217;s election law violations hotline. The group would have to respond to notifications and complaints regarding alleged violations of voter registration and election laws and refer notifications and complaints to the State Board of Election Commissioners for investigation. The integrity unit also could receive sworn statements and issue subpoenas to compel the production of records and other documents.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> Florida Republicans have dropped a proposal into the state Legislature that would erect even more barriers to<a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/04/04/late-filed-election-law-revision-would-add-yet-more-barriers-to-the-right-to-vote/"> voter-registration drives and use of mail-in ballots</a>, along with steeper fines for registration groups that make any wrong steps and the potential that voters could see their ballots trashed. The proposal (<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7050">SB 7050)</a> reduces the number of days a third-party voter-registration organization has to deliver an application to 10 days, and any day after that they would be fined $50 per each day it is late, up to a maximum of $2,500. For each application delivered after book-closing, meaning the deadline to register in advance of any election, the groups would be fined $100 per each day late, up to a maximum of $5,000. Under existing law, those groups are fined $50 for each application delivered to the division of elections more than 14 days after it was submitted to the third-party organization, and $100 if submitted after book closing. These groups must provide a receipt to each applicant upon accepting possession of the application. And the groups would have to re-register with the state for every single election cycle. Plus, the bill would require all first-time Florida voters who have never been issued a current and valid Florida driver license or a voter ID card or a Social Security number to vote in person the first time. The 98-page committee bill was not published until 2:09 p.m. on April 3, less than 24 hours before it was to be heard for the first time — nearly halfway through the 60-day legislative session. “Prudence” was the reason for the delay in producing the election package, said Danny Burgess, the Republican representing parts of Hillsborough and Pasco counties who’s sponsoring the measure. But he stressed that there’s plenty of time to improve the bill. The Republican-controlled Senate Ethics and Elections Committee signed off on the measure (SPB 7050) in a<a href="https://news.wgcu.org/government-politics/2023-04-05/elections-changes-backed-in-senate-changes-viewed-as-sweeping-with-restrictions"> party-line vote</a>. The House has not released its version of the legislation.</p>

The measure was passed in response to a Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights. Under the new law, concealed-carry weapons won’t be allowed at a hefty list of “sensitive places,” which includes polling places. “Our overriding priority was public safety,” Blangiardi said, at a bill signing ceremony.</p>

That would be up from the current threshold of 6% of voters in 18 of the 35 legislative districts.  Legislators who opposed Senate Joint Resolution 101a said it would have made it functionally impossible to qualify a ballot initiative or referendum for the ballots and given any one legislative district “veto power” over the other 34 districts.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Republican-backed proposal that would require Indiana voters to submit more identification information to obtain<a href="https://apnews.com/article/indiana-tighter-mail-voting-laws-2ec6d4629a1543ce2e845271a3864491"> mail-in ballots</a> was endorsed by the state Senate despite objections from opponents that it would make voting more difficult for many people. Senators voted 36-12 in favor of<a href="https://beta.iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/house/1334/details"> the bill</a>, which would require voters submitting a paper application for a mail ballot to include a photocopy of a government-issued identification card or at least two ID numbers, such as their 10-digit driver’s license or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Supporters say the measure is aimed at increasing voter confidence in elections by putting Indiana’s ID requirements for mail-in ballots in line with those for in-person voting. Opponents counter that the additional requirements may disenfranchise some people, especially older voters who could find it difficult to navigate the additional requirements and those who aren’t able to print a copy at home of their driver’s license or other photo ID.</p>

The House voted 56-64 to sideline House Bill 2053, which was approved by a bipartisan majority of 28-12 in the Senate. It would have given the Republican and Democratic political parties the option of participating in a preference primary March 19, 2024, rather than continue the traditional caucus system whereby Kansans convene across the state to pick partisan winners. However, on April 4, Dozens of the House members<a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/04/04/kansas-house-on-second-thought-rallies-to-pass-bill-on-2024-presidential-primary/"> flip-flopped</a> to salvage a bill that was easily passed by the Kansas Senate and would authorize expenditure of as much as $5 million to stage a presidential preference primary next March. State representatives soundly criticized House Bill 2053 on Monday before rejecting the measure 56-64 in the GOP-controlled House. Under light of a new day, the House voted 86-32 to adopt the legislation and forward it to Gov. Laura Kelly. The Senate vote had been 28-12, meaning both chambers ended up approving the bill with two-thirds majorities necessary to override a veto by the Democratic governor.</p>

Had it been in place last August, the first bill would have pushed the Cantrell recall well over the signature cutoff, while the second would have spared organizers from having to produce records that provided a window into their opaque campaign. While state Rep. Paul Hollis, of Covington, and Sen. Cameron Henry, of Metairie, are both Republicans, they say their bills aren’t sour grapes over the failure of a recall that targeted a Democratic mayor. Instead, they are designed to address shortcomings in state law, laid bare during the recent recall effort.</p>

The bills would provide “election integrity” for Louisiana, according to Ardoin.<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=244017"> House Bill 159</a>, sponsored by Rep. Les Farnum, R-Sulphur, would require parish registrars to conduct an extra voter canvass each year. Under current state law, registrars must conduct a voter canvass every year. The Farnum bill would double their work.  Winn Parish Registrar of Voters Bryan Kelley, who’s president of the Louisiana Registrars of Voters Association, said a canvass is a way to keep the voter rolls as accurate as possible. <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB311&amp;sbi=y">House Bill 311</a>, sponsored by Rep. Blake Miguez, R-Erath, is a constitutional amendment that would prohibit election officials from accepting private donations to pay for things such as tents, signs and other items used on election days. This year’s bill is markedly different as it suggests a connection between Zuckerberg and foreign governments. In previous years, the bill’s plain language prohibited donations from “profit or nonprofit corporations.” This year’s version instead frames such donations as “funds, goods or services donated by a foreign government or a nongovernmental source,” suggesting that foreign countries tried to corrupt local election officials in Louisiana.<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB361&amp;sbi=y"> House Bill 361</a>, by Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville, that would prohibit the use of TikTok on state devices or networks. Ardoin, Gov. John Bel Edwards and state Education Superintendent Cade Brumley have already banned the application from state-owned devices. <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB135&amp;sbi=y"> House Bill 135</a>, by Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, would prohibit registered sex offenders from serving as election commissioners. The proposal follows a<a href="https://lailluminator.com/briefs/sex-offenders-could-be-banned-as-election-commissioners/"> recommendation</a> from the state Board of Election Commissioners.<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB216&amp;sbi=y"> House Bill 216</a>, by Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Houghton, would allow for military members and their dependents stationed in Louisiana to serve as election commissioners.<a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23RS&amp;b=HB174&amp;sbi=y"> House Bill 174</a>, by Rep. Julie Emerson, would protect the personal, identifiable information of active duty military members and their dependents who request absentee election ballots from being released in a public records request.</p>

It would require voters to show ID when voting, including providing their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number when they cast a mail-in ballot. It also requires the DMV to issue voter identification cards free of charge to voters who need them. Voters would also have to opt-in instead of automatically receiving a mail-in ballot. And it moves up the deadline for when mail-in ballots must be returned. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada voters support showing ID to vote, including 62% of Democrats, according to an early February poll by O.H. Predictive Insights and The Nevada Independent.</p>
<p>Under<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/10004/Overview"> AB246</a>, sponsored by Assemblywoman Selena Torres (D-Las Vegas) and 20 other lawmakers, county election officials would be required to make<a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bill-would-provide-election-materials-for-chinese-residents-in-clark-county"> voting materials available in the language</a> of a given minority group if there are at least 5,000 “voting age citizens” in the county who are members of that minority group and are of “limited-English proficiency.” The measure would expand on a section of the federal Voting Rights Act that requires states and counties to provide language assistance during elections for groups who are unable to speak or understand English well enough to participate in the electoral process, if the number of voting age citizens from that group is greater than 10,000 or 5 percent of the voting age population. Under that law, Clark County is required to provide materials in Spanish and Tagalog, and Nye County is required to provide materials in Shoshone. “Every Nevadan has a fundamental right to participate in the electoral process,” Torres said during a hearing of the bill Tuesday. “However, this right is often restricted for limited-English proficient Nevadans due to language barriers that discourage them from participating in the process.”  Under an amendment presented by Torres on Tuesday, the threshold for non-English language ballot materials would be cut in half, requiring election materials be provided in Chinese in Clark County and in Spanish in Washoe County, which already voluntarily provides ballots in Spanish.</p>
<p>Lawmakers heard a bill that would expand already-existing voting rights to<a href="https://apnews.com/article/nevada-voting-jail-bill-25480a5e80e3700b8aef1670054d3fe2"> pretrial detainees</a> in jails, marking the latest effort to make voting easier for pretrial detainees that is playing out in different forms nationwide. The bill would make an electronic absentee ballot system available to pretrial detainees that is currently tailored toward military, disabled or overseas voters. It also streamlines a process for same-day voter registration for those eligible in county and city jails, which is already offered in some counties but would streamline it at the state level. A sweeping amendment \ pared down the bill’s focus away from establishing physical polling places in city and county jails and instead toward ensuring — and in some cases expanding — absentee ballot access for those already eligible. “We are simply ensuring that eligible electors have the ability to vote in the same early, special, primary and general elections that they would have had the opportunity to vote in had they not been temporarily incarcerated,” said bill sponsor Democratic Assemblywoman Brittney Miller, of Las Vegas.</p>

The proposal comes as the Democratic National Committee is poised to put South Carolina at the head of the nominating queue. Under the proposed amendment, language that mirrors current state law dictating the scheduling of presidential primary would be inserted into the constitution. The amendment reads: “The secretary of state shall ensure that the presidential primary election be held seven or more days immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election.&#8221; The proposal is the Senate leadership’s response to the DNC-backed calendar change. Under the DNC proposal, which is expected to be finalized this summer, New Hampshire could still vote second in the primary calendar, on the same day as Nevada. To make it into the constitution, this proposal will need to win three-fifths support in the New Hampshire House and two-thirds support from voters in 2024.</p>

Under New Mexico’s legislation, automatic voter registration will be provided for U.S. citizens during transactions at state motor vehicle offices and voting rights will be restored to felons immediately after incarceration. It also will streamline the distribution of absentee ballots that can be returned by mail and make absentee ballot voting easier for Native Americans living in remote stretches of tribal land. Under the bill, Native American communities also would have greater flexibility in designating voting locations, including ballot drop boxes. Some tribal residents were cut off from polling locations by local emergency lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Statewide, county clerks will distribute absentee ballots automatically in every election to people who sign up for the service. Before now, voters had to request an absentee ballot with each election in a voting process that can involve three or four mail deliveries. The law also will require that each of New Mexico’s 33 counties maintain at least two monitored ballot drop boxes. County clerks can request an exemption.</p>
<p>The governor also signed a bill that makes permanent the secretary of state’s<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-elections-politics-d9add065bd7a9d02b26508e533805711"> election security program</a> and increases compensation for election workers. The other measure signed is aimed at addressing the safety of election workers and officials. Under the legislation, the crime of intimidation will now include acts against employees and agents of the secretary of state’s office, county clerk offices, municipal clerks and election officials themselves.  Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, said she believes the three bills balance voter access protections with maintaining election security.</p>

The measure would not apply to military or overseas absentee ballots. It must also pass the House Rules Committee before reaching the floor for a vote. While Republican sponsors, like Rep. Ted Davis of New Hanover County, say the change is needed to restore trust in elections, critics say it would disenfranchise lawful voters of all parties. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper successfully vetoed a similar proposal in 2021, saying the bill “virtually guarantees that some (votes) will go uncounted.”</p>

Doug Burgum. An amendment to the bill to grandfather Fargo&#8217;s approval voting system failed in the House. Defenders of approval voting, which became law in Fargo behind a 2018 ballot measure, said it was another example of government overreach. Mayor Tim Mahoney said he was very disappointed by the bill&#8217;s passing, which he defined as a substantial loss for the &#8220;longstanding respect for Home Rule authority and local control.&#8221; &#8220;Approval voting was enacted in Fargo by the people, not the elected officials. In fact, over 30,000 Fargo voters (64% of those casting ballots) supported approval voting after a successful initiated measure campaign. Today&#8217;s actions silence those Fargo voters,&#8221; Mahoney said.</p>
<p>House Bill<a href="https://www.ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-overview/bo1167.html"> 1167</a> , by Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, passed in a 39-5 vote and now goes to Gov. Doug Burgum. The state House of Representatives in February passed the bill unanimously. The bill states: &#8220;The governor may not issue an executive order that suspends or amends a provision in a statute, order, or rule relating to a state or local requirement regarding<a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-senate-oks-bill-to-ensure-physical-polling-places"> minimum number of physical polling places</a>.&#8221; Burgum in 2020 signed an executive order waiving the requirement that counties provide at least one physical polling site for the June 2020 election due to the coronavirus pandemic. The House and Senate in 2021 had passed the previous bill, but the Senate reconsidered it and it failed by a single vote.</p>

Mark Pody, R-Lebanon, said the intent of the bill (<a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0978">SB0978/HB0828</a>) is to “remind people they have to vote in the proper political party that they’re in.”  But Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, questioned whether such signage could discourage people from voting. Yarbro noted the state does not require any formal party registration in order to vote in primaries and such signage could serve to wrongly signal to voters that they had failed to take a necessary step before voting. The proposed law requires yellow signs to be prominently displayed at each voting site that warn voters that casting a ballot in a political party’s primary without being a member of, or affiliated with, that party is a Class C misdemeanor.  Tennessee currently has open primaries; voters aren’t required to register with a political party in order to vote, leaving it to voters to self-declare their party affiliation and vote in the primary of their choosing.  State law specifies a voter may cast a ballot in a primary who is a “bona fide member of and affiliated with the political party in whose primary the voter seeks to vote” or “at the time the voter seeks to vote, the voter declares allegiance” to that party.  A violation of the law is a Class C misdemeanor, which comes with a punishment of up to 30 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $50.</p>

SB 990 was presented to the committee, where it was discussed and left pending. The bill, written by Sen. Bob Hall (R-Edgewood), would eliminate countywide polling places, which are polls where county residents may vote regardless of precinct. This bill would restrict voting location to the voter’s precinct, rather than allowing them to vote in designated polls across the county. The bill passed the committee with a vote of eight ayes and two nays. It will be reported favorably to the full senate, and is left pending at this time.</p>
<p>Texans could be on a<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2023/03/31/skipping-elections-could-put-texas-voters-at-risk-of-being-purged-from-rolls-under-bill/"> “suspense list”</a> if they fail to vote in two consecutive federal elections under a controversial bill a Senate panel. Voter registrars would have to check whether Texans had moved if they skipped casting ballots in that time, according to the proposal. Currently, registrars don’t place someone on such a list, which can lead to registration being canceled, unless a voter registration certificate is returned in the mail. County officials mail the postcard-like document in January of odd-numbered years. Under Brenham GOP Sen. Lois Kolkhorst’s<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/SB00260I.pdf#navpanes=0"> Senate Bill 260</a>, the address-verification process instead would be triggered by a voter’s inactivity.

The jury that is scheduled to be seated in the trial in several weeks won&#8217;t have to weigh their validity; instead, the judge will instruct them that they are false. &#8220;The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that [it] is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,&#8221; Davis wrote in a 80-page decision notable for the tough stance it took against Fox&#8217;s legal defense. That means Dominion can now publicly say the allegations made on numerous Fox broadcasts about the election company have been declared by a court of law to be false. In a further instance, Davis ruled against Fox&#8217;s argument of a &#8220;neutral reporting&#8221; privilege that protects it from any liability if it accurately conveys the allegations of newsworthy people. The network&#8217;s lawyers say it was covering inherently newsworthy claims about a national election made by inherently newsworthy people &#8211; a sitting president and his lawyers and surrogates.  Davis utterly rejected that approach, as a matter of law and a matter of the facts in this case.</p>

He granted the state request for the change of venue, though not to the location sought by Solicitor General Joshua D. Bendor, who represents Attorney General Kris Mayes. The state had requested the case be heard in Maricopa County Superior Court. The judge also stated he had wanted to oversee the court proceedings, and had no intention of handing the case off to another judge if that was the reason the change of location was requested. “I want the case,” Fink said. Bendor told Fink they wanted the case to be moved to Maricopa County to save taxpayer money for travel from Phoenix to Bisbee. He also said Maricopa County’s technology to stream the hearings was better. “The state statute allows a case to be moved to a more convenient location.”</p>

The suit alleged that Sec. Jena Griswold violated the National Voter Registration Act by failing to remove ineligible voters from the state’s rolls. That discrepancy led to artificially high registration rates in many counties, the lawsuit claimed. As a part of its agreement to dismiss the case, Griswold denied all claims that Colorado violated federal laws that govern voter roll maintenance. But her office agreed to provide Judicial Watch with public data from a federal survey on an annual basis for the next five years. “We have a very rigorous list maintenance process and I do not believe that this litigation is about anything based in fact,” Griswold said.  Her office settled the lawsuit to prevent “further unnecessary drain” on state resources, she said. She also characterized the lawsuit as a meritless attack on democracy. “Election disinformation continues to plague the nation and Colorado, and organizations like Judicial Watch share responsibility for the ongoing threats to democracy,” she said.</p>

Anderson wrote the case “is, in sum and substance, an attack on the legitimacy and security of our elections.” “Setting aside the electorate’s voice in the County Clerk’s race based on how many votes someone else got in some other race, and based on mathematical probability analyses would disenfranchise all voters who voted and who did nothing wrong in exercising their right to vote,” Anderson wrote. The judge said Fritz sought “an extraordinary remedy to match her extraordinary claims” by asking the court to declare the Will County clerk’s office vacant and order a new election conducted with only paper ballots that are hand counted.</p>

In a lawsuit filed this month, a GOP party official from the city of Suffolk claims that Miyares (R) and Youngkin’s chief of staff, Jeff Goettman, “aggressively upbraided” and “bullied” Beals to change the nomination method for an open, Suffolk-area state Senate seat from a primary to a convention. Youngkin, Goettman and Miyares have declined to comment on those claims. They were not defendants in the suit, which names only Beals, the state Department of Elections and the state Board of Elections.</p>
