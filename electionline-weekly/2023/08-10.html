							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>An Invitation to a New Election Audit Framework</strong></p>
<p>By Jennifer Morrell<br />
The Elections Group</p>
<p>Audits, tests and quality control measures play an important role in ensuring the quality and efficacy of the goods and <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/audit-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/audit-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/audit.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />services we use every day. In industries where there is little-to-no room for error, these measures are vital. In order for these measures to be meaningful, standards become critical.</p>
<p>Elections should be no different, and election professionals have had a front row seat as interest in election audits grew exponentially in recent years.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, in jurisdictions large and small, election professionals across the country have been diligently working to improve their processes and procedures to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the elections they conduct. In some cases this includes efforts to implement audits or improve existing audits, tests and quality control checks, despite a lack of standards for performing these critical functions.</p>
<p>Informed by these experiences and in response to the growing interest, The Elections Group recently launched its <a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/exploring-audits-series">Exploring Election Audits Series</a> to help election officials identify principles, standards and audit best practices that apply to the entire election administration process – not just voting machines and tabulation equipment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7828" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-300x136.png" alt="" width="300" height="136" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-300x136.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-768x349.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />By putting forth a set of recommendations and methods for enhancing election audits, the series represents an invitation to an important and ongoing discussion. The content of the series is not meant to be perfect or exhaustive. We want to inspire an honest conversation about how best to audit elections. It is essential that, as the keepers of our democratic process, election officials continue to lead and engage in these conversations.</p>
<p>We hope you will join us as we continue to kick off these conversations on<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_mzTY47t8Q1iPeQbmskXlzw#/registration"> Aug. 17 at noon (EDT)</a>, when we will host a webinar discussing the series and its recommendations. Register<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_mzTY47t8Q1iPeQbmskXlzw#/registration"> here</a>.</p>
<p>To help us develop the recommendations, our team of former election officials conducted systems mapping exercises, research and interviews over the course of a year. During two three-day sessions, we convened more than 30 current and former state and local election officials from across the country in audit workshops to gather ideas for how audits can <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10025" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-9.48.20-AM-284x300.png" alt="" width="284" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-9.48.20-AM-284x300.png 284w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-9.48.20-AM.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" />enhance election integrity and help build public trust.</p>
<p>In our report and series of guides, we suggest a new framework for election administrators and other qualified auditors to conduct both pre- and post-election audits of key election administration processes, including ballot management, ballot proofing, mail ballot validation, tabulation and voter list maintenance.</p>
<p>Implemented effectively, the recommended framework can help election officials improve their processes and procedures – everything from the voter registration process to the way that ballots are accounted for and reconciled – while enhancing public confidence in our elections.</p>
<p>The framework includes a set of standards and principles for conducting election audits. These principles and standards, developed by our bipartisan group of election officials, lead to high-value audits that are conducted ethically and independently and that produce clear, evidence-based reports.</p>
<p>As we continue this conversation, we hope that you will choose to be an active participant in it. The content of the series is not static, and we encourage readers to provide us with ideas and feedback so that we can further the work of establishing election audit standards.</p>

							<h2>Election Security News</h2>
														<p><strong>New Regional Election Security Advisors Bolster Support for Local Election Officials Ahead of 2024</strong><br />
<em>CISA advisors will help local election officials confront evolving and growing threats to election security. </em></p>
<p>By Derek Tisler and Owen Bacskai<br />
The Brennan Center</p>
<p>With the 2024 election cycle fast approaching, a confluence of<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/securing-2024-election"> serious international and domestic threats</a> risk jeopardizing <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />U.S. election security. Ongoing global conflicts abroad mean that powerful countries with the motive and ability to meddle may continue to try to interfere in U.S. elections. At home, the deliberate spread of election disinformation — which recent advances in<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-ai-puts-elections-risk-and-needed-safeguards"> artificial intelligence</a> could exacerbate — is fueling cyber and physical security threats to both election infrastructure and election workers. But late last month the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced that it will hire election security advisors in each of its regional offices, taking an important step to bolster support for the local election officials administering American democracy in the wake of these challenges.</p>
<p>In recent years, state and local election officials have been asked to confront these evolving and growing security threats with limited resources and support. A recent Brennan Center survey found that<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-shows-high-turnover-amid-safety-threats-and"> most local officials</a> feel that the federal government could be doing more to help, and only 27 percent say the federal government is doing a “good job.”</p>
<p>And as election officials face widespread<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/election-officials-under-attack"> harassment, threats, lies, and exhaustion</a>, many are leaving the profession. One in five local election officials are expected to be administering their first presidential election in 2024, according to the<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-shows-high-turnover-amid-safety-threats-and"> survey</a>. That number is even higher in states like North Carolina, where at least<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/30/us-election-officials-leaving-2024-elections-north-carolina"> 40 of the state’s 100 counties</a> have replaced their election director over the last four years, or Nevada, where<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-nevada-2024-primaries-election-officials-466311be8c99e2e4a4e6e54fbd0df58b"> 10 of the state’s 17 counties</a> have changed their top election official since 2020. The loss of institutional knowledge and experience may be especially difficult to navigate for the<a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/the-state-of-election-administration-in-2022/"> nearly half</a> of election offices that operate with one or fewer full-time employees, or jurisdictions with budgets falling short of<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-protecting-election-workers-threats-physical-violence"> what</a><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-protecting-election-infrastructure-against-insider"> is</a><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-machines-risk-2022"> needed</a> to confront today’s security challenges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />CISA’s hiring of regional advisors is an important step to help address some of these concerns. As CISA Director Jen Easterly<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-establishes-regional-election-security-advisors-strengthen-front-line-support-election"> stated</a>, “[t]hese election security advisors will help build even stronger connective tissue between state and local election officials and our team at CISA.” That connective tissue is especially important when election administration is decentralized across thousands of local jurisdictions in the United States, yet each individual jurisdiction must confront similar security challenges stemming from national or international causes.</p>
<p>Since 2017, CISA has worked with states and localities to combat cyber and physical security threats. Through this work, the agency has built strong relationships with<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Year_in_Review_2020_Final.pdf#page=10"> many state and local officials</a> across the country. Its efforts helped ensure 2020 was, according to a statement by CISA’s then-assistant director and elections experts, “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election">the most secure in American history</a>.”</p>
<p>However, until now, CISA’s regional directors have been responsible for<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-federal-departments-and-agencies-can-help-secure-americas-elections"> too broad a range</a> of security personnel and issue areas to meet the needs of election administrators. While CISA already has specialists in areas like cybersecurity, protective security, and emergency communication, the agency has less dedicated expertise in the unique context of elections. As a result, many of CISA’s key election-related services are not effectively reaching the officials they are intended to support. Our<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-april-2023"> survey</a> found that there’s significant room to improve awareness of CISA’s key security resources and grant funding programs, especially among officials who started after the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The agency’s new plan will help address these issues. The new regional election security advisors — which Director Easterly<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-establishes-regional-election-security-advisors-strengthen-front-line-support-election"> outlined</a> as being “experts in the infrastructure, jurisdictional requirements, and operating environments unique to their regions” — will give the agency both the knowledge necessary to address specific election security concerns and the capacity to do affirmative outreach to election officials on CISA products. They will be well-positioned to learn what threats election officials in their region are facing and which protective practices are working, then share best practices with the nationwide election community to help enhance security measures. And the large number of talented, trusted, and well-connected election officials currently leaving the field<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-federal-departments-and-agencies-can-help-secure-americas-elections"> could be excellent potential applicants</a> for these positions.</p>
<p>When it comes to securing U.S. elections, CISA’s new initiative is only a start. The challenges facing our election systems require a response at all levels of government, and there is<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/securing-2024-election"> more that federal, state, and local officials</a> must do to safeguard the democratic process ahead of 2024. CISA can further utilize its reach and expertise by amplifying accurate election information and helping election officials protect against the rising risk of insider threats, while the Department of Justice can increase outreach and collaboration with state and local law enforcement to better protect election workers against violence and intimidation. At the state level, lawmakers can expand legal protections for elections workers and outline restrictions to safeguard election systems from tampering and unauthorized access. Officials at all levels can ensure that election workers have the resources they need to defend personnel and infrastructure.</p>
<p>That said, CISA’s announcement sends the important message that the agency understands the challenges ahead and is finding ways to help. As Director Easterly<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-establishes-regional-election-security-advisors-strengthen-front-line-support-election"> points out</a>, optimally supporting state and local election officials “means meeting them where they are.” By installing regional election security advisors, CISA is moving towards that goal by enhancing its election expertise, deepening its connectivity to states and localities, and ensuring that its capabilities and services are reaching the officials carrying out our elections. Those efforts, together with other federal and state agencies working to support local election officials, will be an important part in ensuring a free, fair, and accurate election in 2024.</p>

							<h2>2023 Elections</h2>
														<p><strong>Voters in at least six states cast ballots this week</strong><br />
<em>Special elections, statewide primaries and local elections on tap</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline</p>
<p>Statewide primaries, local elections and special elections were held in at least six states this week. Most eyes were on Ohio where voters were voting in a special election on a ballot measure that would determine how future constitutional changes would be considered. Mississippi held a statewide primary and in Michigan, some localities were voting in the first election since the implementation of Proposal 2.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong><br />
Voters in the Buckeye State headed to the polls for a single-issue special election on Tuesday. On the ballot was<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion-2024-election/70550016007/"> Issue One</a> which would determine how future state constitutional amendments are approved.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wyso.org/2023-08-07/early-voting-on-ohios-issue-1-proves-to-be-a-popular-option-in-the-aug-8-election"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6020" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-300x268.png" alt="" width="300" height="268" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-300x268.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-1024x913.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-768x685.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted.png 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Early voting</a>, particularly in urban areas, was especially brisk with<a href="https://www.wyso.org/2023-08-07/early-voting-on-issue-1-in-ohio-ends-with-no-waits-in-rural-areas-long-lines-in-urban-counties"> long lines</a> forming on the final days. Almost 700,000 Ohioans cast ballots in the early voting period leading up to the Aug. 8 special election. More than 118,000 Ohioans have voted early, either by mail or in person, during the last three days of early voting alone. Polls in<a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/polls-close-voters-still-in-line-at-franklin-county-board-of-elections/"> Franklin County</a> stayed open an additional 90 minutes on Sunday to accommodate lines of early voters. In<a href="https://local12.com/news/local/hamilton-county-early-voting-turnout-special-election-breaks-record-issue-one-in-person-vote-ballot-majority-pass-amendment-board-elections-cincinnati-ohio"> Hamilton County</a>, Board of Elections director Sherry Poland says the amount of voters was unprecedented. &#8220;Our early in-person voting turnout has been record-breaking. Actually, as of today, we do expect to have more early in-person voters in this special election than we had in the Novembers 2022 election,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Voting<a href="https://www.wtol.com/video/news/politics/elections/ohio-special-election-day-sees-high-voter-turnout-officials-say/512-d3158df4-69a1-4748-a574-7a6af63e8548"> was brisk in many places</a> on Tuesday and while there were some isolated issues, overall things went well.</p>
<p>Aaron Ockerman, director of the Ohio Association of Election Officials said that election<a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/election-day-issues-are-an-opportunity-not-obstacle-to-teaching-about-security-of-the-voting-process"> as a whole went smoothly</a> given everything election officials were up against between staging this election last minute while at the same time going over the signatures on the petitions needed to put the abortion and marijuana questions on the November ballot. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard for people to understand and fathom what it looks like to have a million signatures dumped into your lap for those two statewide petitions and then have to check those right in the throws of conducting this very large statewide election,&#8221; Ockerman said.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/08/issue-1-voting-machines-ohio-special-election-glitch/70552217007/"> Summit County</a>, new poll workers experienced some difficulties with equipment early in the day but voting was not impacted. Deputy Director Pete Zeigler said no machines malfunctioned, clarifying earlier reports, and said poll workers&#8217; unfamiliarity with new machines was to blame for incidents of ballots not properly feeding into scanners. &#8220;These machines have not malfunctioned; this has only been happening because of poll workers struggling to learn the new equipment.&#8221; Zeigler said, adding that a couple of machines were involved. &#8220;At no point was voting halted. They only swapped out machines as a precaution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Due to the last-minute nature of the special election—it wasn’t until a June state Supreme Court decision that local election officials knew for sure there would be a special election at all —<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/07/new-voting-locations-pitch-in-for-ohios-unexpected-august-election/"> new polling locations had to be found in some counties</a>. In Franklin County alone, 27 new polling sites had to be found. Voters in several counties including<a href="https://www.13abc.com/2023/08/08/perrysburg-polling-location-changes-frustrates-voters/"> Wood County</a> expressed their frustrations over new polling sites. “It confuses people. People that are coming out to vote on their way to work, they go storming in there to the high school, only have a few minutes to do it, find out they’re not voting here, oh I don’t have time for this,” voter Ann Elick said.</p>
<p>Additional voting machines had to be sent out to polling places in<a href="https://www.herald-dispatch.com/elections/additional-voting-machines-deployed-in-lawrence-county-for-ohio-special-election/article_0862a46f-bfb8-5b1c-a25f-80eaa3497f80.html"> Lawrence County</a> on Tuesday to deal with long lines. Randy Lambert, a Republican member of the Lawrence County Board of Elections board of directors, said more voting machines were sent to the three sites open for voting in Lawrence County. “We just did not anticipate a turnout like this,” Lambert said Tuesday afternoon. The board doubled or more than doubled the number of machines available at the schools, and lines were getting smaller. The county had consolidated 84 precincts into three polling places based on turnout predictions from the secretary of state’s office. Catherine Snider,<a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2023/08/08/lines-out-door-ohio-voters-consider-issue-1/"> director</a> of the Lawrence County Board of Elections, says the Secretary of State’s office predicted 8 percent voter turnout, but turnout was actually closer to 20 percent. “Actually it makes me feel good that this is a special election with just one thing on it, and yet this many people are willing to come out and do their civic duty,” voter Brenda Stevenson said as she waited in line.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/high-voter-turnout-forces-stark-co-poll-workers-to-use-backup-ballots-voters-ultimately-able-to-vote">Stark County</a> also faced some issues with higher than projected turnout. Voters told a local news outlet that they experienced long lines and a lack of ballots at polling places. &#8220;This is an election with a terrific level of voter turnout,&#8221; the county&#8217;s board of elections said in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday after the polls had closed. &#8220;We appreciate the patience and cooperation of all voters throughout the day. The greater turnout forced some adjustments to our procedures, including the utilization of additional paper ballots at polling locations. We remain confident that the redundancy we prepared for in the voting systems covered the ability of each voter to cast a ballot.&#8221; Regine Johnson, deputy director of the Stark County Board of Elections, said officials will look into any reports of irregularities and<a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/story/news/local/stark-county/2023/08/09/stark-boe-investigates-following-ballot-shortages-at-polling-locations/70558145007/"> work to resolve issues</a> they find. &#8220;Our staff is taking notes from all the voters that might call in, and we are talking to all of the election day technicians who go out into the field and deal with a number of these problems and to the voting location managers,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Some polling places in<a href="https://www.wtap.com/2023/08/08/polling-places-newport-new-matamoras-without-power/"> Washington County</a> were without power. Voting was not affected, but the county board of elections brought generators to each location.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong><br />
Things got off to an interesting start the Friday before the primary when a Hinds County man<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2023/08/05/hinds-county-man-finds-voting-machines-after-it-fell-off-delivery-truck/"> found a voting machine in the road</a>. He took it home and reported it to authorities. Hinds County Election <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5584" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MS-Welcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MS-Welcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MS-Welcome-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MS-Welcome.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Commissioners Kidada Brown and Yvonne Horton came out to investigate. After taking a careful look at the machine, they determined that the machine did not belong to Hinds County. Brown said they were able to determine that the machine belonged to Copiah County and officials from that county retrieved the machine over the weekend. “We want to have a safe and secure election, and if we have people out delivering our machines, we don’t need any hiccups for Tuesday,” said Brown, who represents District 1. “We need everything in place and delivered correctly. When I got that phone call, I had to stop what I was doing and come right out here to see what was going on.”</p>
<p>Things were a bit less dramatic on Tuesday, although there was some drama when a<a href="https://www.wlox.com/2023/08/08/car-crashes-into-ocean-springs-voting-precinct/"> car crashed into a voting precinct</a> in Ocean Springs. The driver was transported to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries and voting continued.</p>
<p>Ballot scanners at one of<a href="https://www.wjtv.com/news/election/hinds-county-polling-location-experiences-issue/"> Hinds County</a>’s largest polling places were not able to scan ballots. Voters were able to continue voting and ballots were placed into secure bags. There were reports that poll workers were not provided the proper keys to<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2023/08/08/polling-issues-resolved-christ-united-methodist-church-after-voters-were-unable-scan-ballots/"> unlock the ballot scanners</a>. “I think it’s annoying that the machines are functioning this morning, but I’m not too worried about it. They’ll be observed when they feed them into the machine later, so I’m not too worried about it,” said one voter.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/08/see-what-happened-on-primary-election-day-2023-in-mississippi/70546113007/"> late-morning update</a> to the press, Secretary of State Michael Watson’s said there had been a number of other issues that far on election day. Power outages in Washington County caused by inclement weather rendered two machines temporarily unavailable, but power was restored at approximately 10 a.m. There were also delays in polling place openings in DeSoto and Lowndes counties, along with two locations in Hinds County. Precinct 526 in Madison County ran out of Republican ballots, and Precinct 36 in Leflore County ran out of Democratic ballots. Both were later replenished, according to the update.</p>
<p>In what may be a new one for us, one polling place in<a href="https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2023/08/08/voting-reported-to-be-brisk-steady-at-adams-county-polling-precincts/"> Adams County</a> had to be relocated because of the FAA. Adams County has used the Natchez-Adams Airport lobby for many years as a polling location. On Monday, the FAA informed county elections officials that because the airport is a terminal, it could not be used for voting. Voting was moved to the hangar, and voters complained of very close quarters, as well as fumes from fuel and wasp spray needed to battle wasps. “It’s not a great situation,” Election Commissioner Tracy Gaude said.</p>
<p>Turnout varied. A<a href="https://www.enterprise-journal.com/top-stories-local-content-elections/lower-turnout-fewer-problems-reported-pike-primaries"> Pike County</a> election official said there appeared to be few problems — and fewer voters — in Tuesday’s party primaries.  “I can tell the turnout’s low because I have not had that many problems,” Circuit Clerk Roger Graves said Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>And finally, we love hearing stories about<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/08/see-what-happened-on-primary-election-day-2023-in-mississippi/70546113007/"> first-time voters</a> (and their moms)! Qadre Latiker, 18, said he was slightly nervous as he made his way to the polls. A graduate of Northwest Rankin High School, Latiker was voting alongside his mother, Latisha, who, as a present for his birthday and Easter earlier this year, gave him a voter registration sheet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a little nerve-racking because there&#8217;s a lot of names, but I did a little research on who I was voting for,&#8221; Latiker told the Clarion Ledger after voting. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing because it was the first time with my son,&#8221; Latisha said. &#8220;Voting is a lifestyle, it&#8217;s a habit, it&#8217;s who we are. So, voting is never not an option, but doing it with my son for the first time was one of the most amazing experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong><br />
Tuesday’s primary marked the first election since Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a series of bills that <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4932" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Welcome-to-MI-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Welcome-to-MI-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Welcome-to-MI-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Welcome-to-MI.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />implemented<a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/lakeshore/ottawa/august-primary-marks-1st-election-since-prop-2-passed-in-michigan"> Proposal 2</a>, a constitutional amendment passed last November that aimed to expand voting rights. Parts of the law went into effect for the primary, most notably prepaid postage for absentee ballots and more drop boxes.</p>
<p>Under the law, clerks must provide postage on all absentee ballot applications and envelops. It also requires municipalities install one drop box for every 15,000 registered voters.</p>
<p>Justin Roebuck, the Ottawa County clerk, says none of their communities needs to put in more drop boxes and coordination with the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office helped ensure they could meet the prepaid postage rules.</p>
<p>“I would say that there&#8217;s been a lot of preparation taking place already,” said Roebuck. “I think we were able to roll that out pretty smoothly.”</p>
<p>Candidates and poll workers outnumbered voters at several polling locations in<a href="https://www.macombdaily.com/2023/08/08/polls-slow-despite-high-profile-elections-in-warren-and-eastpointe/"> Warren and Eastpointe</a> on Tuesday. One Warren resident said she and her daughter cast ballots at 4 p.m. and were the 25th and 26th voters at the 9th precinct. In Eastpointe, one candidate reported their volunteers had all been sent home from all polling locations due to low voter turnout.</p>
<p>However in<a href="https://www.wemu.org/wemu-news/2023-08-08/despite-just-two-elections-voter-turnout-in-washtenaw-county-fairly-good-on-tuesday"> Washtenaw County</a>, just under 20% of eligible voters cast their ballots which was more than expected. Ed Golembiewski is the Washtenaw County elections director. He was pleased to see the turnout exceed his expectations. According to Golembiewski, about 70% of the votes cast were by absentee ballot.</p>

Hall County Election Commissioner Tracy Overstreet said, they’re gearing up for an election season with many twists and turns. “I think 2024 is going to be the most difficult election we’ve had,” Overstreet said. “I think it’s going to be more difficult than 2020 when we had COVID, I think it’s going to be more difficult than 2022 after redistricting and the census.” Secretary of State Bob Evnen said his office will be “will be putting this word out repeatedly” through press outlets and social media before the May 14, 2024, primary — the first election that will require voter ID — and the Nov. 5, 2024, general election. The good news, Evnen said, is that “97% to 98%” of Nebraskans already have the two main types of photo ID: a state-issued driver’s license or ID card. “I don’t think it’s going to be a large problem, because people have to show their IDs for <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10028" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCDriversLicense-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCDriversLicense-300x183.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCDriversLicense.png 542w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />everything,” Evnen said. “This is nothing they should find out of the usual or extraordinary.” In North Carolina, where following a lengthy court fight, voter photo ID is now required to cast a ballot, the State Board of Elections has been working to implement the new law. The NCSBOE announced last week that<a href="https://www.dailyadvance.com/news/local/county-elections-offices-begin-issuing-free-photo-id-cards-for-voting/article_39b7d227-995c-5eea-8d20-b12326d11ee3.html"> county boards of elections are now able to produce free photo ID cards</a>. “Any voter who does not have an acceptable ID card for voting can now get a free ID from their county board of elections,” said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections in the release. “State Board staff has worked diligently with the county boards of elections over the past couple of months to get the necessary software and hardware in place for ID printing.” Jackie Greene, director of the Perquimans County Board of Elections estimated it shouldn’t take very long for a voter to receive a photo ID card from her office. After their information is inputted, it’s just a matter of having their photo taken and their card printed by the office’s laminating machine. “If everything is in order, they should be able to come in and leave with their card in 10 minutes,” she said.</p>

Hamadeh, the losing GOP candidate, and the Republican National Committee claim Mohave County Superior Court Judge Lee Jantzen acted improperly in limiting the amount of time he had to prepare his legal arguments seeking to overturn his 2022 loss to Democrat Kris Mayes. In new court filings, they say that denied them the ability to find evidence that some people legally entitled to vote did not have their ballots tabulated. They also contend that more time would have enabled them to prove there were a sufficient number of situations where tabulators reported an “undervote’’ in the race for attorney general — essentially, that the voter had skipped the race — but where an examination of the ballots would show people did make a choice. Given that Hamadeh outpolled Mayes among Election Day voters, they say that could more than make up for Hamadeh’s 280-vote deficit.</p>

In a 33-page lawsuit filed in D.C. Superior Court, attorneys for the party’s leadership say the D.C. Board of Elections improperly gave the green light to a proposed ballot initiative that, if approved by voters, would call on the D.C. Council to adopt ranked choice voting and open primaries by 2026. The party is asking a D.C. judge to nullify the board’s ruling, which would effectively kill the ballot initiative. In the lawsuit, Democratic Party attorney Johnny Barnes argues that both proposed changes would violate local law and the constitution. He writes that open primaries would violate the Home Rule Charter’s requirement that the mayor, D.C. Council, and attorney general be elected on a partisan basis, and would violate Democrats’ constitutional rights to freely associate by allowing non-Democrats to influence the outcomes of primary elections. Barnes also says the ballot initiative would unlawfully require the city to spend money implementing ranked choice voting (ballot initiatives can’t force the city to spend any money), and would additionally violate the city’s Human Rights Act because it would discriminate against Black and low-income voters who could be confused by ranked choice voting. And in a non-legal argument, Barnes says in the lawsuit that had ranked choice voting been allowed when the city gained home rule in 1975, Marion Barry may never have become mayor. “Imagine the local history in the District of Columbia, for the past 45 years, had the outcome of elections been determined by open primaries and ranked choice voting!” he writes.</p>

The case involves the ballot titles for a proposed ballot initiative brought forward by Idahoans for Open Primaries. The ballot titles are important because they describe to voters and the public what the initiative is and what it does. There is a short ballot title of 20 words or less and a longer ballot title of 200 words or less. The ballot initiative was in front of the Idaho Supreme Court because Idahoans for Open Primaries and Reclaim Idaho filed a legal challenge to the ballot titles that Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s office assigned to the ballot initiative on June 30. Reclaim Idaho is the same group that was behind the 2018 Medicaid expansion ballot initiative.   The short title from Labrador doesn’t call the ballot initiative an open primary but calls it a nonparty blanket primary. During the hearing, attorney Deborah Ferguson argued Labrador failed at his duty to be an objective and impartial officer in his handling of the ballot titles. Ferguson also argued the term nonparty blanket primary is inaccurate.  “Glaringly absent in that title is any mention that the law would create an open primary system in Idaho,” Ferguson said.  “This is such an important part of the initiative process and the short title especially is the headline by which the public will know it,” Ferguson added.  Idahoans for Open Primaries are asking to have Labrador’s ballot titles thrown out and corrected by the court.</p>

Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in the U.S. District Court for Western District of Michigan. Its plaintiffs included Irving Township Clerk Sharon Olson, the Macomb County Republican Party, former U.S. Taxpayers Party gubernatorial candidate Donna Brandenburg and Election Integrity Fund and Force, a group that trains election observers and backed recounts of last year&#8217;s midterm election. In a statement, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel celebrated Maloney&#8217;s decision. &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased with the Court&#8217;s decision to dismiss yet another baseless case invoking wild and unfounded claims in the 2020 election,&#8221; Nessel said. &#8220;Those responsible for these lawsuits should not be permitted to continually assault our democracy and undermine the electorate’s faith in the accuracy of our elections in craven pursuit of partisan goals in a court of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attorney Stefanie Lambert Junttila is the<a href="https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2023-08-04/third-person-charged-in-michigan-with-vote-machine-tampering"> third person charged</a> by a special prosecutor in the alleged conspiracy to gain illegal access to voting machines. Junttila was charged with four crimes: undue possession of a voting machine, conspiracy to commit undue possession of a voting machine, conspiracy to commit unauthorized access to a computer or a computer system and willfully damaging a voting machine. The charges were authorized by a grand jury and filed in Oakland County by special prosecutor D.J. Hilson, who said the grand jury “was not influenced by politics, bias or prejudice.” “Although our office made no recommendations to the grand jury as to whether an indictment should be issued or not, we support the grand jury’s decision and we will prosecute each of these cases as they have directed in the sole interests of justice,” he said.</p>

The court’s 2-1 decision will restore the right to vote to tens of thousands of Mississippians. The court ruled in the case of Hopkins v. Hosemann that by banning former offenders “from the body politic forever” they will be punished “beyond the term their culpability requires.” The court argued that the ban—Section 241 of Article XII in the Mississippi Constitution—“serves no protective function to society” and is thus a “cruel and unusual punishment.” &#8220;The right to vote is the cornerstone of a functioning democracy,&#8221; said attorney Jon Youngwood in a statement. &#8220;This is a major victory for Mississippians who have completed their sentences and deserve to participate fully in our political process.&#8221; The court ruled that the ban is unconstitutional and instructed the Mississippi Secretary of State against enforcing the provision. Secretary Michael Watson did not immediately respond to ABC News&#8217; request for comment. &#8220;Mississippi denies this precious right to a large class of its citizens, automatically, mechanically, and with no thought given to whether it is proportionate as punishment for an amorphous and partial list of crimes,&#8221; the court stated in the decision.</p>

In a recent decision, Lancaster County District Judge Andrew Jacobsen denied Rick Hill&#8217;s motion to amend his complaint for a third time. The proposed new version bumped up the money damages he sought from $10 billion in his earlier complaint to $44.7 billion and contained rambling allegations of rigged elections, sought to decertify the 2020 and 2022 elections and challenged the passage of the gambling referendum, among other things. Attorney Patrick Guinan, who represented a bulk of the election commissioners, said most of the allegations involve the 2020 election and Hill failed to file notice of a tort claim in the counties first, as required to get in the court&#8217;s front doors. In the spring, Jacobsen dismissed Hill&#8217;s earlier complaint against Nebraska&#8217;s governor, secretary of state, attorney general, speaker of the Legislature, election officials in all 93 counties and Election Systems &amp; Software, which alleged they had allowed &#8220;unconstitutional elections.&#8221; Jacobsen described Hill&#8217;s complaint as a &#8220;rambling preamble of the plaintiff’s political and social commentary.&#8221; &#8220;This lawsuit is meritless. But that does not necessarily mean that it is frivolous,&#8221; Jacobsen wrote. But he warned Hill if he filed another lawsuit with the same issues, he would consider sanctions.</p>

Beadles, a member of the Washoe County Republican Party’s Central Committee, wants his election fraud concerns “put on the table and addressed” by Rodriguez, Brown and Hill – under court supervision. Unless this is done, the lawsuit says, Rodriguez will be “unprepared to run the 2024 presidential primary safely, securely, and accurately as required by law.” Representing himself in the lawsuit, Beadles says that bringing forward legal claims of widespread election fraud opens up attorneys to be targeted. The Washoe County DA’s office<a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/08/robert-beadles-fraud-lawsuit-washoe-county-nevada/70555159007/"> filed a petition</a> that moves Beadles&#8217; lawsuit from state district court to federal court, citing the fact that Beadles claims his constitutional rights were violated. The DA’s officed called Beadles’ statements the “inaccurate rantings of a conspiracy theorist.” In a letter from Deputy District Attorney Lindsay Liddell, Beadles is urged to withdraw his “frivolous” court filing or else face sanctions. “This case is an abuse of the judicial process,” Liddell wrote in a proposed motion for sanctions also emailed to Beadles. “The Beadles’ Complaint is disconnected from the law and from reality. The Complaint and its frivolous and unfounded claims should be dismissed, Beadles should be sanctioned, and Defendants should likewise be awarded attorneys’ fees.”</p>

Atlantic County Board of Elections Chair Lynn Caterson said the recount will take place Aug.18. &#8220;A recount is all paper ballots and all machine ballots,&#8221; Caterson said. After the initial count, Viana Bailey received 179 election day votes, 11 early voting votes, 81 vote-by-mail votes and 26 provisional votes for a total of 297. LaToya Dunston received 84 election day votes, 21 early voting votes, 167 vote-by-mail votes and 28 provisional votes for a total of 300. Bailey sued for a recount June 23, and Dunston sought to have Bailey&#8217;s suit dismissed. Machine recounts will be done by the Superintendent of Elections office, Caterson said, and recounts of paper mail-in and provisional ballots will begin at 5:30 p.m. in the board offices in Mays Landing. Superintendent of Elections Maureen Bugdon said Tuesday the time has yet to be set for the machine recount.</p>

Caloras ruled that Chen failed to demonstrate that the suit’s claims of voter irregularity would be enough to change the results of the June 27 Northern Queens Republican primary. In fact, the judge says it is impossible to prove that those votes would have gone his way.  “Petitioner has not, and cannot, establish that, of the challenged votes, the vast majority would have been in his favor, and any such claim ‘taxes credulity,’” Caloras writes, quoting a prior court case. Chen filed the suit last month after hearing reports from District 20 Republican voters saying that they were told they could not vote in the June 27 primary because absentee ballots had already been requested in their names.  Caloras previously denied a request by Pai’s attorney, John Ciampoli, to dismiss the case; Ciampoli subsequently motioned to reargue the case, which was granted.</p>

A motion filed by  Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s office argues there is no conflict between state and federal election laws, which is a central claim in the federal lawsuit brought by Burleigh County Auditor Mark Splonskowski. The state argues in part that Splonskowski&#8217;s &#8220;true aim in this lawsuit is not adjudication of a true conflict, but the improper overthrow of North Dakota law.&#8221; Splonskowski, who was elected last fall, argues in the lawsuit filed July 5 that he faces “an impossibility” in enforcing election law. The lawsuit filed in collaboration with the Public Interest Legal Foundation argues that federal law assigns one day as Election Day, while the state allows for ballots to be counted up to 13 days after Election Day, creating a scenario in which Splonskowski has to decide which law to follow. The state argues that Splonskowski is wrong, citing a federal opinion in which a judge wrote that voting should not be confused with counting votes. The state also disputes Splonskowski&#8217;s claim that he could potentially face criminal penalties for enforcing the state&#8217;s election law. For example, the state argues that a Burleigh County prosecutor would not attempt to prosecute someone for complying with state Century Code.</p>

The lawsuit filed in federal court by the Tennessee NAACP, The League of Women Voters, and other groups, alleges Nashville’s vote to split into three congressional districts was unconstitutional by diluting the power of Black voters in Nashville. The lawsuit alleges the vote created three predominantly white, rural districts to undermine the city’s voters. Community leaders say they’re going to fight to make sure everyone’s voice is heard. “To ignore and suppress the political voice and the Black community, that’s happening all over the country,” said Damon Hewitt, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “This is a knife fight. You have to duke it out case by case, state by state, map by map.” Gov. Bill Lee, Secretary of State Tre Hargett, and state elections coordinator Mark Goins, among several others are named as defendants in the lawsuit.</p>
