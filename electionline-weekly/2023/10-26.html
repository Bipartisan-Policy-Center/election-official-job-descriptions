							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>MIT Election Lab releases new trove of research</strong></p>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election Data + Science Lab</a> is unveiling a new collection of resources under its <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/mapping-election-science">Mapping Election Administration and Election Science</a> initiative. These resources, which include videos, white papers, and reference collections, <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6793" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png" alt="" width="300" height="51" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />are a culmination of efforts to assess the current state of election administration knowledge and practice. All these resources are available at the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/mapping-election-science">Election Lab website.</a></p>
<p>The need for unbiased empirical research to inform decision-makers cannot be overstated. Yet the field is still relatively new and comparatively small, especially considering the disproportionate impact election administration has on the workings of our democracy. The MIT Election Lab developed this project to build up a robust, useful evidence base for election officials, policymakers, and the wider community.</p>
<p>In collaboration with several teams of academic researchers, we began with the hope of defining areas where the existing evidence about best policies and practices is clear, as well as generating a research agenda for the future. To do so, we commissioned seven white papers from experienced scholars throughout the country. Each white paper covers an area of administration that is critical to the convenience, security, and accuracy of elections in the United States; they map out the state of the field, empirical claims about where consensus on best practices exists, and the remaining critical questions that would close the gap between scientific knowledge and needs in the field.</p>
<p>Today, we are proud to release those seven white papers, along with video summaries from the authors. We are also making the full bibliographies for each topic area available separately, with the intent of kickstarting a comprehensive overview of the existing resources on the subject, from peer-reviewed academic work to practitioner guidance. You can find the portal to explore the research and resources <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/mapping-election-science">here</a>.</p>
<p>This initiative is merely one starting point for an ongoing conversation about election administration in the United States. While those discussions will continue to unspool and evolve, we are glad to bring these white papers and resources to the public. There is plenty of work cut out for all of us in this field; we look forward to working alongside many of you as we continue to chart a research agenda for the coming decade.</p>

The board first learned of the breach after voter data was offered for a sale in an online forum earlier this month. Initially, the board believed the affected data amounted to 600,000 lines, but in a call with its hosting provider on Friday learned that the breached database included a copy of the full voter roll.  It is unclear whether the attacker was able to exfiltrate the full voter roll containing data such as voters’ social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, phone numbers and more. According to the board, DataNet reported that it “could not pinpoint if or when this file may have been accessed or how many, if any, voter records were accessed.” The board said Friday it has hired the cybersecurity firm Mandiant to investigate the incident, pledged to release the results of its investigation of the breach and said it would reach out to all registered voters. “This remains an ongoing and active investigation,” the board said.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4537" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ardoin.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="275" />Stepping Down, Speaking Out</strong>:<a href="https://www.brproud.com/news/louisiana-news/louisiana-secretary-of-state-details-threats-misinformation-that-led-to-not-seeking-reelection/"> Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin</a>, who chose not to seek re-election this year, recently spoke candidly about his decision not to run again and the state of elections in the Bayou State. Ardoin spoke at the Baton Rouge Press Club and was candid about his reasoning behind not wanting to run again being from the stress of facing more misinformation and backlash from fringe groups. “People that act as if they are election experts and they’ve never put on an election. They don’t know the nuances of elections, security, they don’t know the nuances of election policy and procedures, and they don’t know the law, but they assume that they know and they apply what happens in one state to other states,” Ardoin said. He offered a word of advice to the person who will replace him to not let those voices sway the decisions of the office. “Make the decisions that are best for the state and not for any one contingency that is pushing back or pushing for something else,” Ardoin said. He talked about harassment of his staff lowering morale and there has been a drastic drop in interest in being poll workers as people are fearful to be part of the process that has faced heavy criticism. Ardoin said the attacks toward him began to take a toll on his health. “There were door hangers placed on my door and in my entire neighborhood saying inaccurate things about me and my record, almost trying to incite my neighbors,” Ardoin said. Ardoin also<a href="https://www.businessreport.com/politics/outgoing-state-elections-chief-decries-conspiracy-theories-but-still-has-concerns"> pushed back</a> against the Legislature and its micromanagement of the state’s need to purchase new voting equipment. “I think the Voting System Commission [created by the Legislature to choose a new voting system], although a good idea in concept, created the very situation that brought about intimidation, harassment,” Ardoin said.</p>

The winning designs will be printed as “I Voted” stickers and distributed during the 2024 New Hampshire Presidential Primary. Grace, Jacob, and Rilynn will also be invited to the State House to have lunch with Scanlan and Deputy Secretary Erin Hennessey. Twelfth grader Justin Lentz is the winner of this year’s “I Voted” sticker contest in<a href="https://statesville.com/news/local/elections-students-education-government-voting/article_27308414-6dd5-11ee-8e46-1324273346b0.html"> Iredell County, North Carolina</a>. All Iredell County students K-12th grades were eligible to enter, and 80 entries were received. The Board of Elections narrowed down the entries to seven finalists before Lentz was selected the winner. “We are very excited about this, and right now we have 100,000 of these stickers on order, because this will be our official 2024 ‘I voted’ sticker,” Board of Elections Director Susie Jordan said.</p>

E-poll books are designed to replace paper poll lists accessing digital voter registration records on a laptop or tablet and represent a key component of critical election infrastructure. A primary goal of the pilot was to develop a set of testable guidelines, procedures, and program materials that could be utilized to certify the security, accessibility, and usability of these election systems across the country. During pilot program testing, which took place between January and June 2023, two VSTLs, Pro V&amp;V and SLI Compliance, tested e-poll book devices from five commercial manufacturers, and two in-house developers.

The pilot program confirmed that the systems tested are election ready for use in 2024 and would require only minor changes, such as added documentation, to meet the proposed baseline standards. Under the authority of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), the EAC created ESTEP to establish requirements and guidelines specific to election technologies that are not covered under the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). The e-poll book pilot is the first in a series of pilots conducted by the ESTEP program, which will also examine voter registration databases, election night reporting systems, and ballot delivery systems.</p>
<p>“ESTEP has become a vital addition to the EAC’s support and resources to election officials to secure our nation’s elections,” said EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks in a joint statement. “The need for strong security in election supporting technology like e-poll books continues to grow and the threat landscape continues to evolve.  The report and subsequent feedback will help inform the EAC’s next steps in making this pilot a permanent fixture of the EAC’s support to election administrators.”</p>
<p>Throughout the past 15 years, the U.S. has witnessed a steady increase in the use of e-poll books during elections. The EAC recognized the need to establish a uniform set of standards and best practices for e-poll book testing and usage. According to the<a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=hIBdCvGf9F7InT9bL7sDow2BvR2CXg7N9-2B-2FWHWfllWSdO1ilcqelbo7MrawDSBtumXpC2ZLvRYES0LEVbNjp8Mexm-2BfjA1NTz-2BVN5ZLx6HJlkKtusHpzpRTXhb19iP6StlId_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMB2LG-2F9bnhCDlKAbOFk-2FdQ9oUDP9n7riCjPi9vEfSZz8XXKb8DPXQbwbwZKbFxWXJpGLZhNVj0EBTCBIink3nnDQThh3NOa6MFWifKxBW8A0HoRA9hKh-2FBA3DATJCMXXm1UyM0weUSNLIARthOj6Lu58gQxe1u3KrEnauPVX1A2atB7n34ofpP5IQ3q-2F6Qwdcg62fHQ5-2FG6jxsXl8WuknVJF4ZtX2BSc9-2FQx3BUvoGamD-2F3O7Hf5OBQ8l3xQISNTDFjQWKXkeXDK9EAc9AZtmLTUKcpJLmqj49YhuLFiGDiOn3eJobgETCe8e4u5HFvjwwrXGMQNXKl6ob-2F8zliH6uGw-3D-3D"> 2022 Election Administration and Voting Survey</a> (EAVS), 2,271 jurisdictions in 40 states utilized e-poll books during the November 2022 general election. The e-poll book pilot tested commercial systems from Election Systems &amp; Software, Inc. (ES&amp;S), KNOWiNK, Robis Elections Inc., Tenex Software Solutions, and VOTEC Corporation as well as in-house systems from Maricopa County, Arizona Elections Department, and the North Carolina State Board of Elections. The EAC would like to thank all participants and our accredited laboratories for their assistance throughout this process.</p>
<p>In response to the pilot program’s findings, the EAC plans to revise the Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Requirements by incorporating baseline functional requirements based on state and local standards with the goal of implementing a formal program for testing and certifying e-poll books at the federal level. To complement the requirements, the EAC will develop supporting administrative guidelines with our stakeholders. Finally, the EAC will enhance data collection methods during the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) reporting for e-poll books to further improve the nation’s understanding of the use of these critical systems. Upon receiving approval from EAC Commissioners, ESTEP will next move forward with piloting Blank Electronic Ballot Delivery Systems.</p>

They say a stricter law would prevent the distribution of unsolicited applications by people paid by campaigns or third-party groups trying to gain undue influence on voters. Opponents of the bill, the first one filed for next year’s legislative session, point out that it would affect more than paid activists. Friends, neighbors, church members, and volunteers could face prosecution for giving an absentee ballot application to another voter. The bill has exceptions for family members and people who share a household. It allows helping voters who are blind, disabled, or cannot read and write, exceptions mandated by federal law. Voters could also ask for help from employees who work in state and county election offices. But otherwise, a person who orders, requests, or obtains an absentee ballot application for another voter could be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which carries up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $6,000. Alabama law already prohibits mailing in an absentee ballot application for another voter or hand-delivering it to the county absentee election manager. The prohibition is printed in red text on the application, along with criminal penalties. It means that third-party collections of absentee ballots, sometimes called ballot harvesting, is already illegal in Alabama.</p>

Each year, local elections fall into three municipalities: the borough, the City of Fairbanks and the City of North Pole. Traditionally, these three elections are organized and run together by the three governments. This ordinance if passed, would have moved local borough elections from October to November. In even numbered years, this would put them in line with state and national elections, which traditionally see higher turnout. According to Wilson, who sponsored the ordinance, it was intended to increase voter turnout in local races. She used the Matanuska-Susitna borough as an example of this trend. “Mat-Su borough, even with Ranked Choice Voting, chose to stand in two lines, 40.58 percent. You can’t debate that number.” However, critics alleged the ordinance left Fairbanks and North Pole governments, as well as the community, out of the conversation. Assembly members also questioned the amount of money the ordinance would cost to implement, by requiring the hiring of more election workers for a single day and the purchase of more election equipment. The language of the ordinance itself argues that synchronizing local with state and national elections would make voting more convenient. However, in response to the proposed ordinance, the city councils of both Fairbanks and North Pole unanimously passed resolutions keeping their elections in October. Thus, residents of these cities would still continue to see elections in both October and November every other year.</p>

Republicans say the bill might be well-intentioned. But they say it would leave too much room for abuse by groups trying to get in the last word before dropping voters off at polling places. Republican Senator Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) sits on the Senate Elections and Ethics Committee. He said the offer of a ride poses a risk that “such transportation to the polls provides for electioneering and possible intimidation of voters.” He argued the bill would allow Republican- or Democratic-aligned organizations to use rides to make sure they get the last word before voters are dropped off at the polls. But Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), who chairs the elections committee, said Michigan is one of only a few states that doesn’t allow ride-sharing services to offer free or discounted lifts to polling places. Also, he said, no one is looking over people’s shoulders as they decide who gets their vote. Governor Gretchen Whitmer is expected to sign the bill.</p>

Currently, South Carolina lacks a state law that designates a specific date for municipalities to hold their elections. This has resulted in a diverse range of election dates, causing logistical challenges for both election officials and voters. “The old joke is there’s an Election Day every Tuesday in South Carolina,” said Representative Brandon Newton (R-Lancaster). According to Newton, the proposed bill would standardize municipal elections. It passed the House unanimously earlier this year. The legislation would require all local elections to be held on one of three specific days in odd-numbered years. These dates would fall in March, July, or November. Currently, a little less than 70 cities and towns hold their elections in even years. The panel amended the bill to address another significant aspect of the proposed legislation involving closing a local election law loophole.  Right now, if an incumbent municipal official faces a challenge to the election’s outcome, they are required to remain in office until the matter is resolved.</p>

Republicans are also weighing other<a href="https://www.wpr.org/wisconsins-voter-id-law-would-be-enshrined-state-constitution-under-gop-proposal"> changes to the state Constitution that would affect voters</a>, including a ban on noncitizen voting and a ban on the use of private funds for elections. Members of the public weighed in on the three proposed amendments at a public hearing. To be approved, the resolutions would have to pass two consecutive legislative sessions and then be approved by voters. They would not be subject to a Governor&#8217;s veto. The voter ID proposal would render permanent a state law requiring a voter to show photographic proof of identity before casting a ballot. Supporters of ID laws say that they&#8217;re a shield against voter fraud, while opponents say that they serve to discourage voting.</p>

The conservative grassroots organization has challenged a variety of statewide voting practices in court. The complaint questions whether Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes can include rules for such drop boxes in his proposed Elections Procedures Manual. That&#8217;s a document that instructs officials on how to comply with Arizona&#8217;s election statutes, ensuring election practices are consistent statewide. Drop boxes were first permitted statewide by the 2019 Elections Procedures Manual, Fontes said. That version of the rulebook remains in effect today and was approved by former Gov. Doug Ducey and former Attorney General Mark Brnovich, both Republicans. The suit points to a recent case in which the Wisconsin Supreme Court found unstaffed drop boxes weren&#8217;t allowed under state law. It attacks the integrity of Arizona&#8217;s drop boxes, even though Fontes and other election officials maintain that they are safe and secure. Fontes said the drop boxes are permissible, noting state law allows him to prescribe rules-setting procedures on early voting and ballot collection. In a statement, he pledged to &#8220;vigorously fight against any attempt to take away a voter’s right to use a ballot drop box.&#8221;</p>

Clark ordered the attorneys to submit post hearing briefs by next week. &#8220;It&#8217;s appropriate for the help from the court to have post hearing briefs, in lieu of closing arguments,” Clark said. The hearings ended on a subdued note after nearly a week of testimony from various witnesses and video exhibits over allegations of electoral misconduct in the Bridgeport mayoral primary. Now Judge William Clark is expected to make a decision on if a new primary is needed, weeks before the general elections. Democratic challenger John Gomes’ attorney, William Bloss, argued several aspects presented in testimony put the results of a tight primary race, where incumbent Mayor Joe Ganim won by 251 votes with the help of absentee ballots, in question. He cited the videos showing supporters of Ganim’s reelection campaign allegedly putting stacks of ballots inside a drop off box. “There were clearly election violations of the election statutes on the video,” Bloss said. While Bloss said there is ample evidence to doubt the validity of the primary results, John Kannelly, who represents the city’s Democratic Registrar of Voters Patricia Howard said while electoral misconduct may have occurred, none of what Bloss showed in the courtroom meets the threshold to throw out the primary results.</p>

Powell pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with performance of election duties. She had originally been charged with felony racketeering and six other felony conspiracy counts for her alleged role in breaching the voting system in rural Coffee County after the 2020 election. As part of the deal, Powell agreed to testify truthfully in the case and on Wednesday recorded a video statement with prosecutors. She will receive six years’ probation and pay a $6,000 fine. She also agreed to pay $2,700 in restitution to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office to replace election equipment in Coffee County. And Powell wrote a letter of apology to the citizens of Georgia. Chesebro pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing of false documents and will receive five years&#8217; probation and a $5,000 fine, in exchange for agreeing to testify and provide documents and evidence. Ellis is pleading guilty to one count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings, and will receive probation in exchange for her testimony in the case.</p>

A Court of Claims judge last October said Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and others “exceeded their authority.” “Defendants have broad authority to issue binding non-rule instructions on election workers, but not on challengers or other outside observers,” the appellate judges wrote. Specific rules at issue included a ban on cell phones and other electronic devices at absentee vote counting boards. This and other changes came after a tumultuous 2020 election. The Michigan Department of State (MDOS) quickly appealed last year’s ruling, which meant no changes had to be implemented for the 2022 midterm elections. MDOS plans to appeal this latest ruling, spokesperson Angela Benander told MLive. The three-member panel of appellate judges last week unanimously upheld the trial court’s opinion regarding four areas of the challenger manual: Credentialing, who challengers can talk to, “impermissible challenges” and a cell phone ban.</p>

Quinn sentenced people convicted of felonies to probation and declared that they are not allowed to vote because Minnesota&#8217;s &#8220;Restore the Vote&#8221; law is unconstitutional. In his orders, Quinn concluded the Legislature’s passage of the law did not constitute the kind of “affirmative act” he said was needed to properly restore a felon’s civil rights. So he said he now has a duty going forward to “independently evaluate the voting capacity” of felons when they complete probation. Two of the individuals have<a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/ellison-ruling-on-felon-voting-rights/89-f1ad141e-4cb4-425d-9871-e03fdf634f54"> filed for &#8220;writs of prohibition&#8221;</a> at the Minnesota Court of Appeals, claiming the judge exceeded his authority. Ellison&#8217;s office is supporting the writs. &#8220;Judge Quinn &#8230; in the context simply of sentencing people convicted of felonies, ruled the law unconstitutional without prompting, without the question having been raised by either party, and with no notice to the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, or other appropriate authorities,&#8221; Ellison&#8217;s office said in a news release. &#8220;But a sentencing court has no discretion whatsoever over voting rights: only the Legislature decides when the right to vote may be restored, and the court plays no role. Voting rights are not up for debate in a criminal sentencing.&#8221; “Judicial restraint and respect for the separation of powers are essential principles of our justice system. When either of those principles is violated, Minnesotans lose trust in the system — and Judge Quinn has violated both principles,” Attorney General Ellison said in a statement. “I support a writ of prohibition as the best option for quickly keeping Judge Quinn from further violating our justice system and Minnesotans’ trust.”</p>

Silva wrote that the plaintiffs — who include former poll observers from Clark and Washoe counties — failed to demonstrate sufficient evidence that they would personally face a real threat of prosecution under the new law. “Plaintiffs at no point allege that they intend or plan to engage in behavior for the purpose of intimidating or coercing poll workers,” Silva wrote. Silva dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs have an opportunity to bring the case forward again with an amended complaint. Chattah said Tuesday she is planning to file an amended complaint, but declined to comment further. SB406 made it a felony offense to threaten, intimidate or coerce an election worker with the intent to interfere with their performance in carrying out an election or to retaliate against them for performing their duties. Silva also refuted Chattah’s argument that the bill would have a chilling effect on the plaintiffs, who had argued the law would conflict with their ability to observe election operations and that it “may impact” their decision to engage as poll workers or observers in 2024. Silva wrote that the plaintiffs did not “actually allege that even a single one of them definitively will not participate in future elections.”</p>

In a lawsuit filed in December 2020, the Tennessee Conference of the NAACP and five residents denied the right to vote alleged Tennessee officials failed to follow state laws that allow individuals to legally restore their voting rights after serving their sentences and completing parole. Instead, the state implemented inaccessible and opaque processes that impede legal pathways for restoring rights, the lawsuit claimed. Close to settling key claims in the case over the summer attorneys for the state abruptly broke off talks in late July, catching lawyers for the NAACP by surprise, legal filings show. Then, on August 2, lawyers for the Tennessee Attorney General filed motions asking a judge to reject the claims entirely. “The Elections Division, TDOC, and Governor’s office had the opportunity this summer to create accessible, transparent, and uniform procedures to allow the over 470,000 disenfranchised Tennesseans a fair shot at getting their voting rights restored and rejoining their communities as full citizens,” Blair Bowie, an attorney representing the NAACP with the DC-based Campaign Legal Center, said. “Instead, they blew up the voting rights restoration system entirely and imposed effectively permanent disenfranchisement on July 21,” she said.</p>

Now, the<a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/voting/2023/10/20/467349/federal-appeals-court-stays-redistricting-ruling-against-galveston-county/"> U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has put that ruling on pause</a>. The stay buys the county another two weeks but may not change the outcome of the voting rights case. The Republican majority on Galveston County&#8217;s commissioners court adopted a new political map in 2021 that eliminated the one precinct in which Black and Latino voters constituted a majority. Brown ruled that violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial gerrymandering. Brown initially ordered county leaders to come up with a new map that complies with the act by October 20, then granted them a week&#8217;s extension. The 5th Circuit stayed Judge Jeffrey Brown&#8217;s decision until November 10. &#8220;So, it&#8217;s important to emphasize that the stay is actually an administrative stay with an expiration date,&#8221; said Valencia Richardson, a staff attorney for the Campaign Legal Center who represents the plaintiffs. &#8220;It&#8217;s a stay so that the Court of Appeals has time to consider the arguments.&#8221; The stay expires one day before the candidate filing period opens for the March 2024 primary. Democratic Commissioner Stephen Holmes, whose Precinct 3 the county&#8217;s Republican leaders eviscerated under the redistricting plan, is expected to run for reelection next year.</p>

Glenn Youngkin&#8217;s administration failed to turn over public records to<a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/virginia-naacp-sues-youngkin-for-records-behind-denials-of-felons-voting-rights/3449915/"> explain how it decides whether to restore the voting rights of convicted felons</a> who have completed their sentences. Youngkin has come under scrutiny since his administration confirmed earlier this year that it has shifted away from a restoration of rights system used by three of his predecessors that was partly automatic. In July, the NAACP called on the administration to establish clear and publicly available criteria, saying the current system is secretive and could discriminate against people of color. In the lawsuit filed in Richmond Circuit Court, the NAACP said the Youngkin administration turned over about 600 documents. But the lawsuit identified additional documents it believes are not exempt from the Virginia Freedom of Information Act and should be made public. They include an administration transition document that has information about the restoration of the rights process, documents containing information about applicants whose restoration of rights applications were denied, and records showing the numbers of applicants and denials. “Virginians of all stripes deserve to know as much as possible about the rights restoration process, including who is in the room, what information is considered, and the criteria used to make decisions, &#8221; NAACP Virginia State Conference President Robert N. Barnette, Jr. said in a news release. Two federal lawsuits have been filed over Youngkin’s process, which critics have said is confusing and does not have clear standards on when an application should be granted or denied.</p>
<p>A prosecutor in Spotsylvania County<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/spotsylvania-county-candidate-seeks-legal-action-to-stop-misleading-sample-ballots/65-f3dade7c-46ca-44ea-b0a3-4f6d475908e9"> filed a petition for a temporary and permanent injunction</a> against a candidate accused of distributing misleading and confusing sample ballots. Ryan Mehaffey, the unopposed Republican nominee for Spotsylvania County Commonwealth’s Attorney, said Nick Ignacio, a Court Clerk candidate, violated Virginia election laws. Mehaffey, a current deputy commonwealth&#8217;s attorney, wants a judge to prohibit Ignacio from handing out his unauthorized ballots that voters in Spotsylvania County recently described as unethical. “Further violations by Ignacio would not only further affect the ultimate vote county, potentially altering the outcome of these elections, but also would undermine confidence in the electoral process, potentially suppressing votes that otherwise would be cast in an election that voters believe to be free and fair,” the petition read. The petition said Ignacio isn’t nominated or endorsed by the Democratic Committee nor the Republican Committee in Spotsylvania County, “yet Ignacio also appears on Republican versions of FVP sample ballots that also fail to state whether they are authorized by any candidate as required by law.” Mehaffey argued Ignacio is aggressively and persistently disseminating the false information</p>

Warner’s office says Sharp’s previous voter registration had been revoked due to a prior felony conviction. According to West Virginia state law, a person serving a sentence for a felony conviction, including the following probation or parole period, can not legally participate in an election. The Secretary of State’s office, says while Sharp was on parole, he attempted to cast a ballot in Fayette County during the 2022 General Election. Due to the revocation of his voter registration, Sharp’s ballot was challenged and not counted, Warner says. According to Warner’s office, four months after trying to cast a ballot, Sharp attempted to register to vote at a West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles location while he was still on parole for the felony conviction. He was indicted on the charge in May 2023.</p>

The judges found that because electioneering restrictions relate to the First Amendment, free speech and the right to vote without intimidation, restrictions on political speech can face intense scrutiny in law. “We are thus persuaded, as Defendants argue, that the reasonableness of Wyoming’s 300-foot buffer zone is evident from a ‘long history, substantial consensus and &#8230; common sense,’ notwithstanding the absence of well-developed legislative history,” Judge Veronica Rossman wrote in the court’s opinion. The 10th Circuit said U.S. Supreme Court precedent does not require the state to prove why 100 yards is an adequate distance. “Instead, because the state seeks to ‘protect the act of ballot-casting[,] rather than the electoral process in some larger sense,’ it need only demonstrate the reasonableness of its response and its avoidance of significant impingements on constitutionally protected rights,” Rossman wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://protectdem-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_qOrF8-syRYeoiFgZEi-vWw#/registration">The Few Over the Many: What’s driving backsliding in the United States?</a>: The United States is just one of many democracies around the world that have slid backwards in recent decades. Last year, global freedom declined for the 17th consecutive year. But in a way, the United States is also an outlier. Two of the strongest predictors of a democracy’s resilience are longevity and wealth; the United States is among the oldest and richest democracies, yet it is also among the fastest eroding. Koin Protect Democracy for a digital discussion with Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, authors of the new book Tyranny of the Minority (the much-anticipated follow-up to the bestselling How Democracies Die). Together, they attempt to tackle this puzzle: why, even with its long history and economic prosperity, is democracy in the United States so clearly threatened? How is this backsliding connected to specific features in our history, our Constitution, and our electoral system? And what lessons do these questions offer for those seeking to protect and perfect our democracy? <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 2 12pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cato.org/events/free-speech-what-everyone-needs-know">Free Speech: What Everyone Needs to Know</a>: Recent years have produced increasing attacks on the idea of free speech and significant doubts about the wisdom of its continued protection. From confusion about the nature of the First Amendment protection of speech, to misconceptions about the Supreme Court’s rulings on the issue, misinformation on free speech is rampant. World renowned legal scholar and free speech advocate Nadine Strossen’s new book, Free Speech: What Everyone Needs to Know, provides a timely and much needed response this confusion. The Cato Institute’s Sphere Education Initiatives is pleased to host Nadine Strossen in the Hayek Auditorium on November 6th from 1–2 pm EDT for a special book release event. Please join us in person or via online streaming video for this important conversation. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 6 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online and in-person.</p>
<p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/events/defending-democracy-environment/">Defending Democracy</a>: Authoritarian exploitation of the world’s natural resources — with China and Russia at the forefront — is increasingly an issue of national and global security. It is a threat to the resurging alliance of democracies and the effort to roll back authoritarian actors globally. China’s appetite for natural resources to feed its economic growth has undermined democratic institutions and environmental commitments, leaving local communities across the globe exposed to environmental exploitation and degradation with little political recourse given the involvement of their government in opaque and illicit deals. Similarly, Russia’s war against Ukraine has had severe environmental impacts, and its access to natural resources in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East help bypass sanctions, and fund its growing network of state-supported private military groups, like the Wagner Group, to prop up unpopular, exploitative regimes that are its allies. Both China and Russia exploit the environment as an instrument of authoritarian political and economic control, such as in Tibet and in Ukraine’s eastern provinces. Simultaneously, there is growing awareness and unified action among the community of democracies to stem the worldwide rise in authoritarianism, and to demonstrate the ability of democracies to better deliver on the issues that matter to citizens globally, like the environment. Against this backdrop, join NDI and Foreign Policy as we highlight the people and policies that have become “game changers” to strengthen democracy and civic activism, protect the environment and natural resources, and help defenders of democracy counter illiberal influences in their own countries. <strong>When:</strong> Nov. 15, 10 a.m. Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
