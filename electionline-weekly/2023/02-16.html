							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New Report from Nonpartisan National Task Force on Election Crises </strong><br />
<em>Task Force experts advise an array of reforms in advance of 2024</em></p>
<p>Elections experts from the nonpartisan National Task Force on Election Crises recently unveiled their <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9420" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-16-at-11.00.37-AM-300x56.png" alt="" width="300" height="56" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-16-at-11.00.37-AM-300x56.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-16-at-11.00.37-AM-1024x191.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-16-at-11.00.37-AM-768x143.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-16-at-11.00.37-AM.png 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />most recent report: <a href="https://electiontaskforce.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=429655c786b753c6de25953f8&amp;id=f24007aa8f&amp;e=80fe338e21">Lessons from the 2022 General Election: How to Prevent Election Crises, and Emerging Issues for 2023, 2024, and Beyond</a>. The report details that while greater communication, transparency, coordination, and efforts to combat mis- and dis-information generally resulted in a successful 2022 election, threats of election crises still remain and are of serious concern as the 2024 election approaches.</p>
<p>“Two years after the turbulent election of 2020 and its troublesome aftermath that put into question the stability of our elections, the last election has offered us a way forward in reducing the risk of certain election crises in 2024 and beyond,” said Trey Grayson, former Kentucky Secretary of State and former President of the National Association of Secretaries of State. “But while the risk of some of the worst forms of election crisis has fallen, complacency is not an option as serious threats of election crisis remain.”</p>
<p>Based on expert analysis, the Task Force identifies and warns of several categories of challenges and potential crises that must be closely monitored in 2023 and 2024 such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efforts by elected officials to attempt to manipulate the outcome of the 2024 presidential election in battleground states;</li>
<li>“Constitutional sheriffs” and their growing focus on election issues;</li>
<li>The risk of election interference and manipulation through litigation;</li>
<li>The need for states to update their election codes as a result of the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, which updated rules for presidential elections and cut off certain paths for election subversion;</li>
<li>The independent state legislature theory and the implications of the eventual decision, particularly a maximalist ruling;</li>
<li>Ongoing election security risks from foreign governments via cyber attacks, deliberate disinformation, or other disruptions;</li>
<li>And a heightened climate of political violence which increases the risk of multiple forms of crisis, and increases the urgency for violent actors to be held responsible.</li>
</ul>
<p>“While the most feared threats to election administration and vote counting did not materialize in 2022, that doesn’t mean that the elevated risks to our elections have disappeared and we can lower our guard,” said Wendy Weiser, Vice President for Democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. “We need to make commonsense reforms to strengthen our electoral system ahead of 2023 and 2024, giving voters more protection against election subversion, intimidation, and other interference.”</p>
<p>In an effort to prevent multiple election crises in 2024 and beyond, the Task Force outlines recommendations that evidence and review support. Each recommendation focuses on improvements and solutions around four initiatives. Some potential reforms in those categories include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Election administration and security</strong>: Sustain and expand crisis-tested voting options, including early voting and mail-in voting — and ensure sufficient funding for election equipment, supplies, security, personnel retention, and educating voters about election mechanics</li>
<li><strong>Legal reforms</strong>: States should examine election emergency statutes and where appropriate make updates to provide more predictable and depoliticized means of election modification for emergency situations, and where necessary make changes to conform with the Electoral Count Reform Act on this issue and more broadly</li>
<li><strong>News media and social media platforms</strong>: Downgrade or delete rather than label election-related disinformation, and speed up processes for labeling/removing posts</li>
<li><strong>Civil society involvement</strong>: Increase investments in work to prevent political violence, including through projects to research and defuse intense polarization that can lead to violence</li>
</ul>
<p>“As a country, election crises and the threat of political violence directed towards election officials and voters cannot be the new normal,” said Tammy Patrick, Chief Executive Officer for Programs at the Election Center [Ed Note: electionline is a project of the Election Center]. “The recommendations to prevent extremism and acts of violence are a start. Staying vigilant will be necessary for 2024 because something as simple as a tweet of mis-information can set off a chain reaction that leads to an election crisis”</p>

Tony Evers<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WIGOV/bulletins/34805fc"> proposed</a><a href="https://www.wpr.org/gov-tony-evers-propose-changes-wisconsin-election-laws"> several changes to Wisconsin election laws</a>, which his office says will improve voter access and election transparency. The initiatives, which include the creation of a new office focused on election transparency, will be included in the 2023 budget proposal that Evers releases this week. The proposals also include automatic voter registration, changes to voter ID processes, allowing clerks to canvass absentee ballots before Election Day, and speeding up the reimbursement process for smaller communities during a special election or recount. Evers also proposed a $2 million &#8220;Office of Election Transparency and Compliance&#8221; aimed at improving audits of voting equipment and voter rolls. Such a system would &#8220;ensure continued confidence in Wisconsin elections,&#8221; according to a press release from Evers&#8217; office. Debra Cronmiller, the executive director of League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, said in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio that her group recently released a<a href="https://my.lwv.org/wisconsin/article/2021-2022-spring-elections-post-election-report"> report</a> endorsing some of the same ideas proposed by Evers. &#8220;Many of the recommendations from the governor were really very voter-centric, which is wonderful to see,&#8221; Cronmiller told Wisconsin Public Radio.</p>

To honor Lewis’ long voting history, Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough made Lewis her “valentine” this week by bringing her a heart-shaped box of chocolates, a large card, red and pink flowers and a balloon to the woman’s Maywood home. And after early voting expanded to sites in each of Chicago’s 50 wards, Lewis had advice for voters across the county. According to the Chicago Tribune, Lewis prefers to vote by mail these days because it’s sometimes difficult to vote in person. “They should vote if they’re able to vote,” Lewis said. “I think everybody should vote.” Yarbrough noted that some people don’t think voting is important. “If she’s still here having her voice heard, what does that say?” Yarbrough asked. “It makes a difference, it really does. When people aren’t engaged, things can go awry &#8230; If she votes, everybody should vote.” When a reporter asked the 111-year-old to recall the good that’s come from her many years partaking in the democratic deed, she pushed back. “It ain’t too good, but it’s better,” said Lewis, a Black woman who moved from Arkansas to Chicago as a toddler.</p>

Smith, an abolitionist, gave away 40 acres of land to each of the 3,000 people listed in the receipt book. Smith’s receipt book, when tied to other 19th-century records, shows that the fight for Black suffrage didn’t only occur in the 1960s, but was a battle waged in New York more than a century earlier, said Aaron Mair, Adirondack Wilderness Campaign director for the Adirondack Council. “This is a unique piece of African American history, a gem to the nation, but also a crown jewel to New York State,” said Mair, who was the 57th president of the Sierra Club and an advocate for people of color on environmental issues ranging from access to wilderness areas to living free of toxic pollution. The receipt book is proof of how otherwise disenfranchised Black Americans obtained their voting rights. While some moved north into the Adirondacks, which stood as a fortress of protection away from the South, most remained where they lived before receiving the grants, Mair said. “It’s one of the illustrative examples of why they were pushing for suffrage,” Mair said. “The grants made by Gerrit Smith were to meet the requirements for the right to vote.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alabama-Cap.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alabama:</strong> Senate Majority Whip Clyde Chambliss announced that he has<a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2023/02/14/chambliss-files-bills-related-to-election-integrity/"> pre-filed two pieces of legislation</a> related to election integrity: One to prohibit the use of ballot tabulating systems capable of connecting to the internet and another to require the use of only paper ballots when casting votes. Senate bills 9 and 10 both place “existing administrative rules into statute” and would require any changes, if they appear, to be approved by the state legislature, according to Chambliss. “Every voter in every election in this state – municipal, county or state – should leave the polling place with the assurance that every vote is counted fairly and securely,” Chambliss said in a statement on Monday. “These bills do just that.” Over the previous two regular sessions, Chambliss has filed similar bills attempting a straight prohibition of electronic vote counting machines capable of connecting to the internet, with each attempt failing to reach final enactment.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> A Republican bill supported by Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes that would<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/02/09/bipartisan-support-for-bill-to-make-all-arizona-ballots-a-public-record/"> make ballot images a public record</a> cleared its first hurdle, despite concerns from Democrats about privacy issues.  The legislation, which was introduced by Arizona Speaker of the House Ben Toma, would require all 15 Arizona county recorders to send the secretary of state a digital image of every ballot cast in an election. They would also have to give the secretary of state a list of all eligible voters prior to the election and a list of those who voted in the election. The secretary of state would then publish all of that information online. Toma’s<a href="http://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/79154?SessionId=127"> House Bill 2560</a> also has a mirror version in the Arizona Senate, sponsored by Sen. Ken Bennett, R-Prescott, who testified to the House Municipal Elections and Oversight Committee Wednesday on Toma’s behalf.  “I want this bill to earn the support of two-thirds of both caucuses in both the House and the Senate,” Bennett said, stressing during his testimony the bipartisan roots of the bill, which is an idea long promoted by Democratic election activist John Brakey.</p>
<p>The Senate Elections Committee has approved SB 1074 would require<a href="https://www.kold.com/2023/02/14/bill-requiring-all-arizona-election-electronics-be-made-usa-passes-out-committee/"> all voting machines to be manufactured in the United States</a>. The bill would not replace voting machines but make them harder to use in elections. The bill was changed from a bill about election lawsuits to a bill about machines and tabulators. It’s the provision which requires all the components to be made in the United States may be the hardest to achieve and may need some work if the bill is to meet approval.</p>
<p>Every Arizona voter would be<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/02/15/every-arizona-voter-would-be-purged-every-decade-under-gop-proposal/"> purged from the rolls once a decade</a> and have to re-register under a proposal Republicans in the state Senate advanced this week. The measure from Sen. Frank Carroll (R-Sun City),<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/79246?SessionId=127"> Senate Bill 1566</a>, would cancel every voter registration in the Grand Canyon State on April 2 of 2031 and every 10 years after that, forcing all voters to re-register each decade. Jen Marson, executive director of the Arizona Association of Counties, told the Senate Elections Committee on Monday that her organization opposes the bill simply because it violates the National Voter Registration Act, which limits the reasons for which a person can be removed from a state’s voter rolls to a voter’s death, if they move outside of the jurisdiction or if the voter requests to be removed.  That federal law also specifies that a voter must be informed prior to being removed from the voter rolls, not afterward, as is outlined in the proposed law.</p>

On the resolution targeting the non-citizen voting bill, the vote was 260-162, with more than 40 Democrats joining Republicans. The disapproval resolutions would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Joe Biden to take effect. The non-citizen voting bill was passed by the council late last year, with lawmakers arguing that non-citizens, even those who are undocumented, should have a say in who makes the decisions that can impact them. But House Republicans said the bill would empower foreign diplomats and agents from adversary nations like Russia and China to wreak havoc in local elections, and that it would dilute the right to vote currently enjoyed by U.S. citizens. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) who represents a portion of Maryland where a number of towns allow legal permanent residents to vote in local elections, said the issues at stake should involve non-citizens, whether they are documented or not. “When we’re talking about local non-citizen voting, who’s going to vote in school board or town council elections? That should be decided locally. And my colleagues are the ones determined not to make the District of Columbia a state should be the first ones to say if it’s just a local government, let them decide who’s going to vote on matters of garbage collection and who their teachers are going to be,” he said. Raskin also noted that a number of states throughout U.S. history had allowed non-citizens to vote, including Colorado and New York.</p>

The legislation deals with the bureaucratic back end of elections rather than taking on more controversial topics such as voter eligibility challenges, election takeovers or whether to eliminate runoffs. The bill’s supporters say it will increase confidence among conservative election skeptics who doubt that absentee ballots were kept secure during the 2020 presidential election. “It will create a certain level of trust and confidence in the system. As we saw in the elections just last year, I heard very little problems,” said state Rep. Alan Powell, a Republican from Hartwell who sponsored the bill. “Every little part that could give credence to our elections is what’s needed right now.” The committee passed the measure,<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/17"> House Bill 17</a>, along a party-line vote, with Democrats in opposition saying it would create more work and costs for county election officials with little benefit. A similar bill considered last year didn’t pass after election officials called it “security theater.”</p>

Rep. Greg Lanting (R-Twin Falls) is the sponsor. He says it&#8217;s to keep students safe. House Education Committee chairman Julie Yamamoto (R-Caldwell) pointed out her county &#8212; Canyon County &#8212; has had trouble finding enough ADA compliant polling places. so sometimes schools are the only option. If passed, schools would have enough time to adjust their calendars, Lanting said. Lanting, who was once a middle school principal, says their gym was the polling place for the town.  &#8220;Twice a year we just threw the place wide open and everybody in the community came in and we didn&#8217;t ever have any problems but the possibility was always there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Twin Falls County, where I&#8217;m from no longer uses schools. They&#8217;ve been able to find enough other locations &#8211; find fire stations and whatever they may be to hold the election, but not every county, not every area has that ability. Sometimes the school is the only available polling spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretary of State Phil McGrane said his highest budget priority for his office this fiscal year is the development and funding for a<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/10/bill-to-create-full-voter-guide-for-idaho-elections-introduced-by-secretary-of-states-office/"> statewide voter guide</a> to be distributed prior to an election.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/S1078/"> Senate Bill 1078</a> is estimated to cost $750,000 for the design, production and dissemination of the guide, according to the bill’s fiscal note, a cost that would be incurred for primary and general election years. The bill text states that the guide would contain the following information: A complete copy of the title and text of ballot initiatives or referendum measures, with a fiscal impact statement summary, the sponsor’s proposed method of funding for applicable measures, and a copy of arguments for and against each measure submitted.For constitutional amendments, a presentation of the major arguments submitted by the state’s legislative council and the text of the proposed amendment. The names of candidates for state and federal offices. If submitted by candidates, a statement with fewer than 200 words, the campaign’s contact information, and the candidate’s photograph, which cannot be more than four years old. Any additional information relating to elections that is required by law and/or deemed informative by the Idaho secretary of state. The guides would be distributed no later than 30 days before a primary or general election and would be delivered to every household in the state, and copies would be available at local county clerks’ offices, according to the bill text.</p>
<p>A new bill introduced in the House of Representatives would eliminate Idahoans’ ability to sign a<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/13/idaho-house-introduces-bill-to-eliminate-voter-identification-affidavits-in-elections/"> sworn voter identification affidavit</a> to verify their identity to vote at the polls in elections.  Rep. Joe Alfieri, R-Coeur d’Alene, is sponsoring<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0137/"> House Bill 137</a>, which he said he worked on with the support of the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office. Under current Idaho law, voters may sign a voter identification affidavit instead of showing photo identification. Anyone who provides false or inaccurate information on their voter affidavit is guilty of a felony under current state law.  “It’s very rarely used, frankly,” Alfieri told the House State Affairs Committee. After a short discussion, the House State Affairs Committee voted to introduce Alfieri’s bill, which clears the way for it to return to the committee for a full hearing. Alfieri’s new bill isn’t the only  bill that would do away with the voter affidavits. Earlier this session, Rep. Tina Lambert, R-Caldwell, introduced<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0054/"> House Bill 54</a>, which would eliminate student IDs as an acceptable form of identification at the polls and eliminate the voter affidavit. The House State Affairs Committee voted to introduce House Bill 54 on Jan. 30. So far, that bill has not returned to the committee for a full public hearing.</p>
<p>A new bill introduced in the Legislature would move Idaho’s<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/13/new-bill-would-move-idahos-presidential-primary-elections-from-march-to-may/"> presidential primary</a> election back from March to May.

Originally,<a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/house/1334#digest-heading"> House Bill 1334</a> had much tighter restrictions, requiring that Hoosiers applying for an absentee ballot guarantee that they would be unable to vote on Election Day as well as the 28 days beforehand. It also required that applicants include the last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver’s license number or voter ID number.  The bill’s author, committee chair Rep. Timothy Wesco, R-Osceola, proposed an amended version, loosening these restrictions.  Instead of requiring both a driver’s license number and the four digits of one’s Social Security number, the amendment would allow the applicant instead to include just a photocopy of their driver’s license. In addition to the identification, the amended bill would not allow government agencies to send out unsolicited absentee ballot applications, providing that applications could be received only if they were requested. If a non-governmental group wanted to send one out, it would have to mention on the application who it was from.</p>

The House elections committee last week advanced the “Democracy for the People Act” (<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;f=HF0003&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2023">HF3</a>) authored by Rep.

The Senate companion bill (<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF3&amp;b=senate&amp;y=2023&amp;ssn=0">SF3</a>) was also recently advanced by the Elections Committee. The bill includes automatic voter registration; allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote; restores voting rights to people on parole or probation; and seeks to protect voters, election officials and election volunteers from intimidation and harassment. Author Sen. Liz Boldon, DFL-Rochester, said the bill defends, strengthens and modernizes Minnesota voting. “We’ve certainly seen our democracy tested in the last few years,” Boldon said. “Threats and intimidation of voters and election officials has been on the rise across the country.” Secretary of State Steve Simon said during a Senate Elections Committee hearing on the bill that automatic voter registration — in which people are automatically registered to vote when they apply for or renew their driver’s license — would save money and allow the state to add or update up to 450,000 registrations annually. Automatic registration would reduce by 80%-90% the number of people who register on Election Day, Simon said, which would help the polls run more smoothly.</p>

House lawmakers are debating if the state should enhance penalties for election fraud.<a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2023/PDF/history/SB/SB2352.xml"> Senate Bill 2352</a> would codify voting under the name of a deceased person as fraud and carry criminal charges.

Currently, it is a misdemeanor to vote twice in an election. Systems are also in place at voting precincts to prevent someone from voting twice. Democratic lawmakers asked him for evidence of the crime occurring in Mississippi. Another measure,<a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2023/PDF/history/HB/HB1310.xml"> HB 1310</a>, would revise how the state manages voter roles.

The resolution, proposed by Sen.

The idea is proposed in a Senate bill.<a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/23%20Regular/bills/senate/SB0073.pdf"> Senate Bill 73</a> allows independent voters to vote in the major party primary of their choice, whether that’s the Democratic, Republican, or Libertarian ballot. For years, lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to get similar proposals across the finish line. The current bill is on its way to the Senate floor. Last year, state election officials changed the rules to make it easier for independent voters to change their party registration temporarily in order to vote in a party primary. This would eliminate that need.</p>
<p>A bill that would make major<a href="https://www.ksfr.org/2023-legislature/2023-02-14/voting-rights-changes-in-new-mexico-heads-to-house-floor"> changes to voting rules</a> in New Mexico, particularly on tribal lands, received a Do Pass recommendation from the House Judiciary Committee, and now heads to the House Floor. HB 4, known as the<a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/23%20Regular/bills/house/HB0004.html"> Voting Rights Protection Act</a> was approved on a party line 7-4 vote. The bill is similar to one that died on the final day of last year’s session after a filibuster by Republicans ran out the clock. House Speaker Javier Martinez is the bill’s main sponsor. He told the committee the bill includes the Native American Voting Rights Act. Martinesz says it addresses voting inequities in native areas as well as the rest of the state by ensuring precinct boundaries are aligned with tribal nation and pueblo boundaries along with other provisions. “It requires tribal language translation at the polls. It expands and enhances early voting in and near tribal communities. It allows the use of official buildings on tribal lands as mailing addresses for tribal members for the purpose of election mail,” he said. “It allows the appointment of ballot tribal assistance to help tribal members with their absentee ballots and it provides the necessary resources to clerks in counties across the state to comply with all aspects of the Native American Voting Right Act.” The bill also allows felons in New Mexico to automatically be allowed to register to vote after they are no longer incarcerated.  It creates a permanent, voluntary absentee voting list, declares Election Day a school holiday and would require at least two secured voter drop boxes in each county for early voting.</p>
<p>The House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee voted on Feb. 11 not to pass<a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?Chamber=H&amp;LegType=B&amp;LegNo=217&amp;year=23"> House Bill 217</a>, which would have changed New Mexico’s voting law to allow people who are at least<a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/02/15/proposal-to-lower-nm-voting-age-blocked-by-democratic-committee-chair/"> 16-years-old to vote in elections</a>. While other bills that did not make the cut in committees were resurrected, this proposal will not return, according to one of the bill’s sponsors, Rep. Christine Trujillo (D-Albuquerque).  Committee Chair Rep. D. Wonda Johnson (D-Rehoboth) made the deciding vote to stall the legislation, saying young people should come of age before being allowed to vote.  “I voted no because I do agree that at this time, we should grow our children into adulthood and responsibilities, and afford them this right,” Johnson said. “But also at the same time, as a Native American woman, as an auntie, as a sister, I think we should protect our children and let them be afforded and honor that process to go through their coming of age.”</p>

<p>Passing on a 28-to-9 vote the Senate approved legislation would make it<a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/politics-government/new-mexico-senate-approves-bill-to-keep-firearms-out-of-polling-places/"> illegal to carry a firearm</a> near a polling place. Sponsored by Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe), Senate Bill 44 would make it a petty misdemeanor to carry a gun within 100 feet of a polling place on Election Day or during early voting. The law would apply to both loaded and unloaded guns. “Passing this legislation would increase the amount of protection available to our election administrators, poll workers, and voters, and it would work towards eliminating threats of fear and intimidation,” the New Mexico Office of the Secretary of State said in an<a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/23%20Regular/firs/SB0044.PDF"> analysis</a>.

Current law allows ballots to be postmarked on or before Election Day, “and received by the county board of elections not later than three days of the election by 5 p.m.” The legislation provides an exception for any conflict with federal law or when the State Board of Elections extends the closing time of polls for every poll in a county, which would extend the absentee ballot deadline to the same. SB88 further adds a subsection to the law that states: “Each county board of elections and the State Board shall publish on its website and on any materials sent to voters the date by which absentee ballots are available for voting.” County boards would be required to publish the date by which a completed request form must be received, as well. Another added section would task each county board of elections with reporting specific figures in regards to one-stop early voting and absentee ballots. The required reports would include the number of absentee ballots that have been spoiled due to the voter voting in person at a one-stop voting site, and the number of outstanding absentee ballots, for each day of the one-stop early voting period. County boards would also be required to report to the state board specific information “from the day after the day of the election through the day after the receipt deadline for absentee ballots … by 5 p.m. each day,” including the number of absentee ballots, number of outstanding absentee ballots, and number of voted provisional ballots. “The State Board shall publish each report received by a county board of elections pursuant to this section on its website each day,” SB88 reads. “Each list shall be made publicly available and published in a readable and usable format.”</p>
<p>House Bill 44 was introduced into the General Assembly, to<a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/02/city-ncga-hb44-repeal-literacy-test-north-carolina-general-assembly"> repeal the literacy test</a> from the North Carolina Constitution. Section 4 of Article VI of the state constitution requires state voters to be able to read and write any part of the constitution in English, although this is not currently enforced after the passage of federal civil rights legislation. Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenberg), a primary sponsor of the bill, said this is not the first time that this legislation has been introduced. In 1969, this same proposed amendment failed. “I think that the North Carolina that we’re living in today, here in 2023, is worlds different from the North Carolina in 1969, when Henry Frye first introduced this piece of legislation,” he said.  The aim is for this bill to be submitted for North Carolina residents to vote on during the statewide general election on Nov. 5, 2024. Citizens can vote for or against this legislation to decide whether or not the test will be repealed. The bill has bipartisan support, with primary sponsors Brown and Rep. Kelly Alexander (D-Mecklenburg) supporting the bill as Democrats and Rep. Jason Saine (R-Lincoln) and Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry, Wilkes) supporting the bill as Republicans.</p>

The House Political Subdivisions Committee to discuss<a href="https://ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-overview/bo1273.html"> House Bill 1273</a> , which would prohibit statewide the use of ranked-choice voting and approval voting. Fargo is the only city in the state that uses approval voting and has used that method for local elections since 2020. Approval voting allows voters to cast votes for all candidates they approve of in municipal races, such as the mayoral and city commission elections. The person with the most votes wins the seat. Rep. Ben Koppelman , R-West Fargo, introduced HB 1273 and presented it to the committee. “House Bill 1273 was introduced with the intent of honoring the time-tested method of voting in our state,” Koppelman said. He wants to ban ranked-choice and approval voting and use only plurality voting, which Fargo used prior to approval voting. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney appeared virtually to speak in opposition to the bill. “As proposed, bill 1273 would completely void the wishes of the citizens of Fargo by prohibiting approval voting in future elections,” he said. The measure to enact approval voting was created by Fargo citizens and voted into law in 2018 with over 30,000 voters, or 63.5%, in favor. The House<a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2023/02/16/nd-house-advances-bill-ban-ranked-choice-approval-voting/"> approved the bill</a> 75 to 19. It now heads to the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate killed a bill that<a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-senate-rejects-bill-banning-mail-ballots"> would have banned mail-in ballots</a> Senate Bill 2308 to ban mail-in ballots, brought by Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, failed in an 8-38 vote. The Senate State and Local Government Committee had given the bill a unanimous &#8220;do not pass&#8221; recommendation. &#8220;My biggest concern is we have over 30 counties that this is their primary way of voting, and to throw it out as an option is a huge change for those counties and with not a lot of evidence to justify that giant of a change in my mind,&#8221; Committee Chair Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, told her panel Thursday. Magrum cited &#8220;potential mischief&#8221; around mail-in voting in bringing the bill. More than 70,000 North Dakota voters cast ballots by mail in the November 2022 election. That was nearly 30% of all ballots cast.</p>

This is the first bill Gavarone has introduced during the 135th General Assembly, and it follows up her efforts in writing the laws to require Ohioans to show a photo ID to vote and create some of the nation’s most stringent post-election auditing requirements. The Election Integrity Division will be required to investigate allegations of election fraud and voter suppression, allow the public to submit complaints, refer cases to a prosecutor, law enforcement, or another state or federal agency for review, and submit a report to the General Assembly detailing the number of complaints and people referred for investigation. Senate Bill 51 will be referred to a committee for further consideration.</p>

Current Pennsylvania law states that ID is required only when a person is voting for the first time or is using a new precinct. Both this measure and the regulatory approval change are expected to face broad opposition from Democrats in the Legislature. The GOP is using the constitutional amendment, in part, because a similar law had been deemed unconstitutional by the courts.</p>

Enrique Sanchez of Providence is sponsoring a bill that would<a href="https://turnto10.com/politics/undocumented-immigrants-voting-rights-bill-legislation-rhode-island-constitution-cities-towns-ordinances-city-council-mayor-taxes-schools-local-economy-municipal-government"> allow residents of Rhode Island who aren’t citizens</a> of the United States, but who have a license or a Taxpayer Identification Number, to vote in their local city or town. Sanchez said it would include &#8220;ordinances, bonds, city council stuff, and mayor stuff&#8221; to name a few. “We would just like to see more participation on behalf of folks who are, might not have had a say are paying taxes, have kids in the schools, are contributing to the local economy, have been here for years but aren’t able to participate in those decisions happening on municipal governments in their respective communities,” he said. Sanchez said that these people would not be allowed to vote in state and national elections, but would have a say in what happens in the community where they live. Sanchez said he believes non-citizens would be allowed to vote in a local election under the state Constitution without any amendment. His bill has been referred to the House Elections Committee.</p>
<p>A new Rhode Island Senate commission will study the possibilities of<a href="https://www.thenewportbuzz.com/rhode-island-senate-commission-to-study-non-plurality-voting/40111"> non-plurality voting</a> and runoff elections for primaries for the General Assembly members and the state’s five general officers. The resolution creating the commission was sponsored by Sen. Samuel Zurier (D-Dist. 3, Providence), who saw the significance of this issue in his own election to the Senate in 2021.  At that time, he won a five-way primary with 31.2% of the vote, meaning that more than two-thirds of the voters preferred a different candidate.  His experience is not unique, as other primaries (such as the 2022 Democratic primary for governor) and elections (such as the 2010 election for governor) have been won by candidates who received less than 40% of the vote.</p>

State senators voted 28-6 on Monday to approve<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24232"> SB-139</a> and send it to the House of Representatives for further action. The bill’s prime sponsor, Republican Sen. Randy Deibert, said the legislation came from concerned voters in Pennington County. “Numerous” new voters have been registering under the current one-day requirement, he said. Republican Sen. Jim Bolin spoke against the change, saying South Dakota should first know what other states have been doing regarding residency and voter registration. “We’re becoming a more mobile society,” Bolin said.</p>
<p>There’s momentum for creating a<a href="https://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/post-election-audit-bill-has-county-auditors-divided/"> post-election audit</a> in South Dakota.  But the details behind what South Dakota’s post-election audit will look like has caused a rift between some county auditors.<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23961"> Senate Bill 160</a>, which would create a post-election audit following the state canvassing of a primary or general election, cruised through the Senate on Monday 34-0. SB-160’s fate is now in the hands of the House, where there’s another version of a post-election audit in<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24305"> House Bill 1199</a>. SB-160 would require county auditors to conduct a random, manual county of 5% of the voting precincts in a county for two statewide contests. HB-1199 would require 25% of voting precincts using automatic tabulating or 10% of voting precincts not using automatic tabulators. Lincoln County Auditor Sheri Lund said in an interview with KELOLAND News that she is supporting SB-160 because the post-election audit would be for two precincts in Lincoln County instead of eight precincts. Lund said county auditors were hoping to study the topic more with the new secretary of state, but she believes many lawmakers are looking to implement changes this summer rather than 2024 when the change would take place in the middle of primary and general elections.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/senator-says-trio-of-election-bills-harass-county-auditors/"> trio of election-related bills were defeated</a> by the Senate State Affairs Committee this week. The committee sent<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23672"> Senate Bill 123</a>,<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23676"> SB-124</a> and<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24272"> SB-128</a> to the 41st Day, killing all three “election integrity” bills 9-0 brought forward by  Sen. Julie Frye-Mueller.  “This is about harassing local officials,” Sen. Lee Schoenbeck said after bringing a motion to defeat SB-124. “In this case, you have a group of a half a dozen people that clearly have some kind of an obsession or fetish.” Schoenbeck, the Senate President Pro Tempore, aimed his comments at a group who call themselves the South Dakota Canvassing Group. The group played a role in Tripp County’s decision to hand count ballots for the 2022 election.  “This would give them the ability to take their little hobby, their obsession and fetish and give papers to these county auditors all across South Dakota,” Schoenbeck said. “Instead of working on South Dakota, local issues that the auditors are elected to do, they would be stuck trying to help these people with their fetish.”</p>

Phil Scott was against a similar bill during the last legislative session, and NBC5 received the following statement Friday morning on what Scott thinks of the new bill. “The governor is opposed to ranked choice voting.

Under the bill, &#8220;good cause&#8221; includes malfunction of voting system equipment, unfair distribution of election supplies, errors in the tabulation of results, delays in reporting election returns, and discovery of voted ballots after the polls close. The bill also states the county employee could be terminated with or without pay after a majority approval from the county election commission.</p>

Residents would not need to give a reason to seek the waiver, so the bill essentially makes it a hassle to not vote, as opposed to the other way around. The bill would instruct the secretary of state to create a clear and concise form for waivers. It would not require voters to fill out their ballot, just submit it. It also does not include a punishment for those who fail to vote. The Senate State Government &amp; Elections committee advanced the bill along party lines. Republicans argued it&#8217;s an infringement on Washingtonians&#8217; First Amendment rights, which protect them from compelled speech. &#8220;This bill is about disrespect for the voters,&#8221; said Sen. Jon Braun, R &#8211; Centralia. &#8220;We owe them the opportunity to tell us if we are on the right track.&#8221; The bill now heads to the Senate Rules Committee, where it will be scheduled for a floor vote.</p>
<p>Supporters of ranked choice voting say the system could improve Washington state&#8217;s presidential primary elections.<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1592&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false"> A bill</a>  in Olympia would create a<a href="https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2023-02-14/civic-engagement/wa-bill-would-let-voters-rank-preferred-presidential-primary-candidates/a82904-1"> ranked system</a> in which candidates are ranked by a voter&#8217;s preference. Stephanie Houghton, managing director of FairVote Washington, said the measure, which her group supports, would alleviate a problem caused when voters are asked to vote early, including in primaries.  “Unfortunately, if you did that in the 2020 primary, you were punished, possibly, because your vote was cast for someone who then dropped out,&#8221; Houghton said. &#8220;There are no re-dos.&#8221;</p>

Sponsored by the Joint Corporations, Elections &amp; Political Subdivisions Interim Committee, it passed the House on a 33-27-2 vote and was introduced to the Senate on Jan. 19 where it subsequently passed its first two readings. The bill aims to codify the secretary of state’s guidelines regarding election system security. That includes requiring proof that a vendor, or the provider of a voting system(s) meet the specified requirements outlined in the bill, the EAC [U.S. Election Assistance Commission], and the Wyoming Secretary of State’s office, which would issue a certificate indicating the vendor was in good standing with the state. “The County Clerk&#8217;s support [the bill] and would really appreciate the codification of the federal certification for our electronic voting systems,” said Mary Lankford, a representative of the Wyoming County Clerk’s Association. “We feel that the codification of this portion of the rules only strengthens the security of Wyoming&#8217;s election system and our integrity.”</p>
<p>State Sen. Larry Hicks, R-Baggs, has brought back a bill eliminating the practice of<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/02/14/wyoming-senate-resurrects-effort-to-stop-crossover-voting/"> crossover voting</a> after it has previously been defeated in a committee. Hicks brought the motion to withdraw House Bill 103 from the Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee, which on Feb. 9 spiked the bill.  Using Senate Rule 5-5, Hicks was able to bring a floor vote to reassign the bill to a new committee after the Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee had already voted it down. There was a separate vote to approve which committee would receive the bill. HB 103 sets the deadline to change party affiliation to the day prior to the campaign filing deadline opening. Crossover voting has been a major concern for certain conservatives in recent years, many claiming that the practice dilutes Republican Party primaries with input from Independent and Democratic voters. One of the biggest proponents of HB 103 is Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who oversees the state’s elections.</p>

The prosecution did not object.  The defense said it needs more time to examine a trove of new information and data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation related to the case. Peters faces ten state criminal charges but a federal investigation is ongoing.  The trial was originally scheduled to begin March 6 in Grand Junction, before the judge agreed to the delay. The prosecution and defense are expected to meet Feb. 22 to set a new trial date, likely this summer. Peters’ attorney said the new information was “voluminous” and he’s only had a chance to preliminarily review it.  “Not only will defense counsel require a significant amount of time to review the discovery that has been provided, but the defense will also almost certainly need to retain an expert in computer forensics,” stated Harvey A.

McBurney&#8217;s order is a slight compromise, writing that certain parts of the report should be shared with the public while others merit secrecy until further action by prosecutors. &#8220;Having reviewed the final report, the undersigned concludes that the special purpose grand jury did not exceed the scope of its prescribed mission,&#8221; the order reads. &#8220;Indeed, it provided the District Attorney with exactly what she requested: a roster of who should (or should not) be indicted, and for what, in relation to the conduct (and aftermath) of the 2020 general election in Georgia.&#8221;</p>

The GOP&#8217;s suit relies on an assortment of witness statements and affidavits from election observers who claimed to have seen election officials using digitized images of ballots to tally votes rather than the paper ballots as required by state law. Oahu Circuit Court Judge Gary Chang was not convinced by the GOP&#8217;s arguments and dismissed the case, finding Republicans were unable to show sufficient evidence that the elections were somehow compromised or that the party had been injured by the auditing process.</p>

In a decision issued this week, Justice Paul Thissen concluded, “There may be many compelling reasons why society should not permanently prohibit—or perhaps prohibit at all — persons convicted of a felony from voting. But the people of Minnesota made the choice to establish a constitutional baseline that persons convicted of a felony are not entitled or permitted to vote, and the people of Minnesota have not seen fit to amend the constitution to excise the felon voting prohibition.” He also wrote that a corresponding state law passed constitutional muster even if there are “troubling consequences, including the disparate racial impacts, flowing from the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of a felony. The Legislature retains the power to respond to those consequences.” It was a 6-1 decision, with only Justice Natalie Hudson dissenting.</p>

The lawsuit claims the audio and video recordings violate voters’ rights to cast their ballots in secret, are an invasion of privacy and could be considered illegal wiretapping. The county clerk is the county&#8217;s chief election official. In June 2022, the county clerk’s office moved to the Pettis County Courthouse. La Strada and his staff began prepping for the 2022 primary and general elections shortly after and became aware of cameras located inside and outside of the building. The lawsuit claims on June 8, 2022, IT employees told La Strada the cameras did not record audio. It also claims on the same date, that IT and maintenance employees had access to transmissions from the camera. The lawsuit states the county commissioners or any employee in the IT department never requested “permission or consent to record, listen to, or view audio or video transmissions from the cameras.” On Oct. 14, La Strada learned IT employees were allegedly transmitting and recording audio and video, the lawsuit claims. La Strada informed the Pettis County sheriff and prosecuting attorney. Video recordings from the cameras included employees changing clothes and “in states of partial nudity,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.</p>

Otero, a Republican elected as clerk in 2020, was replaced in office last month by a decision of the board of county commissioners. The all-Republican board says Otero went missing from work and abandoned her duties. Linda Jaramillo was appointed in her place to serve as clerk through 2024. Jacob Candelaria, an attorney for Otero, called the misconduct allegations by the State Ethics Commission “outlandish, sexist and politically motivated,” and said that Otero has not abandoned her elected post. “We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations,” he said Friday. Separately, Otero has petitioned the state Supreme Court to reinstate her as county clerk.</p>

But the court also left the door open for the GOP to continue seeking voters’ partial Social Security numbers, and more. The court ruled that the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee had other tools at its disposal to compel the department to comply with its subpoena and thus did not need the court to do so. “The Senate Committee has express constitutional authority to enforce its subpoena,” the opinion read. “It may enforce its subpoena in accordance with the contempt statutes.” In 2021 the committee began subpoenaing documentation such as communications with counties, audit reports and also partial Social Security and driver’s license numbers for voters  from the Department of State. While the department provided some information, it argued that other information the committee was seeking contained sensitive private information about voters, which the state’s constitution prohibited the department from releasing. This prompted the committee to sue the department, seeking to have the courts compel the department to release the records. The court declined to provide that type of “extraordinary remedy” the committee sought because the committee has authority under the state’s constitution to enforce its subpoena. The court specifically mentioned the Senate’s power to hold individuals in contempt. The Commonwealth Court also dismissed the Department of State’s December motion to render the case moot, since the court’s decision addresses the underlying arguments of the case. The Department of State has argued that the subpoena had effectively expired at the end of the last legislative session. The state Department of State has cited 11 errors it claims a judge made in ruling that cast vote records (CVR) from the 2020 general election in Lycoming County are public. The state agency filed the list as<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2023/02/pa-agency-claims-judge-erred-in-making-public-2020-cast-vote-records.html"> part of its appeal</a> to Commonwealth Court of Judge Eric R. Linhardt’s Dec. 16 ruling making the CVRs public in county.</p>

The 20-page lawsuit claims the Harris County Elections Administrator’s Office is withholding documents they believe would shed light on some of the problems that occurred during the 2022 general election, including shortage of paper ballots, malfunctioning voting machines and staffing shortages. Media consultant Wayne Dolcefino said he and Jim McIngvale submitted requests for records from Election Day, including detailed copies of Harris County Elections Administrator Clifford Tatum&#8217;s phone records, emails, and documents detailing maintenance issues with voting machines, but they said they were denied by the elections administrator’s office citing pending lawsuits and a state audit. &#8220;Harris County voters have a right to know right now, right now, what went wrong,&#8221; Dolcefino said. In a statement, the election administrator’s office said: &#8220;Since the lawsuits filed starting in November and more recently on Jan. 6, the elections administrator&#8217;s office has and will continue to follow the law and Texas Election Code. The office has responded with transparency to two audit requests from the state and has released an assessment on the November 2022 election. “The office has readily responded to public information requests not requiring documents subject to the litigation. Any request that involves information involved in litigation has been sent to the attorney general for an opinion, and both the Harris County GOP and Harris County Democratic Party are copied on these requests.</p>
