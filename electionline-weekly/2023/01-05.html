							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>A new year, a new vision</strong><br />
<em>What’s in store for the Election Center (and you!) in 2023</em></p>
<p>Tammy Patrick, CEO for Programs<br />
<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">Election Center</a></p>
<p><b> </b>As we kick off what is sure to be another momentous year in election administration, I wanted to take a moment to share a few thoughts on the changes we are anticipating at <a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">Election Center</a>, the National Association of Election Officials (NAEO).</p>
<p><b><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7370" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-300x93.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-768x239.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center.png 882w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></b><strong>Membership</strong><b><br />
</b>We are starting off the year strong with some of the highest numbers of registered members the organization has ever seen! Hovering around 1550, we strive to demonstrate the continued value of membership and attract new members&#8211;in addition to bringing back members who have let their membership lapse. We are hoping to be able to offer incentives to new members later this year, so stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Gatherings</strong><b><br />
</b>Election Center gatherings have been a staple for the sharing of information and practice among the nation’s election professionals for decades. We are kicking off the year with the Joint Election Liaison Conference (JEOLC) in Washington D.C. January 11-13th where we host robust conversations around policy considerations and legislative efforts at the state and federal level, and hear from partner organizations on their work in the New Year.</p>
<p>February finds us in sunny Pasadena with an interactive workshop on a variety of resources and tools available in communications, design, access, security, planning and logistics, as well as a session on Vote by Mail/Absentee ballot processing (including a session on signature verification and ballot curing).  To top off two days of collaboration and discussion, we will tour the Los Angeles County Registrar and Recorder’s facility — believe me, you don’t want to miss that!</p>
<p>The April Special Workshop is set as the first installment of an annual convening on state training and certification programs. State associations, secretaries of state, and chief election officials tasked with training and certification of election officials and poll workers will have time to discuss curriculums, retention, platforms, facilitation, funding strategies, and so much more.</p>
<p>The national conference is back in Orlando this year at the beautiful Grand Cypress Hotel.  If you have suggestions on content or speakers you would like to see, let us know as we will be drafting the agenda soon.</p>
<p><strong>Committees</strong><b><br />
</b>Election Center will be continuing the Postal and Legislative Committees with the first meeting of the year at JEOLC. We will be opening up leadership positions to active members. Any Election Center member can join a committee, and anyone can throw their hat in the ring to play a key role in our direction in 2023 and beyond. Other working groups and task forces may continue, all are being reevaluated for currency and participation.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Certifications</strong><b><br />
</b>The partnership with Auburn University turns 29 this year, with 1404 graduates to date. We will be offering one of each of the core courses online every month in 2023 and many opportunities to take the courses in person as well. With more than 360 active students in the initial certification program (meaning that they have taken courses, but not completed all the requirements yet) we are exploring ways to help get folks graduated before the 2024 election cycle.  More to come on that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Journal of Election Administration, Research, and Practice</strong><b><br />
</b>The second edition of the Journal will be publishing early this year. Following the stellar initial publication, this year’s content is sure to be of interest to election officials, policy wonks, academics, and election nerds everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>electionline</strong><b><br />
</b>Last, and most definitely not least, we are thrilled for the rebranding and launch of 2023 electionline to its forever home at Election Center!  (If you are still seeing old logos, please clear your cache and/or use a different browser.)  We have more in store for electionline in the future—but know that you can continue to trust it as your number one (and always free) election administration news source.</p>
<p><strong>Full Executive Team February 1, 2023</strong><b><br />
</b>February will see the momentous addition to the Election Center team when I will be joined by Joe Gloria as the CEO for Operations. The staff in Katy is extraordinary and have lots of ideas on how to build upon our strong foundation.  We all have big plans for what the future may hold at Election Center and all of it starts with the members and what they want.  Don’t be shy, we want to hear from you!

To figure out the scope of the ballot paper problem, Tatum said he had to rely on “anecdotal” information his office received directly from calling more than 700 presiding judges and alternate judges because he does not have an adequate tracking system to help him see whether an issue at a polling place was addressed and resolved. In the report, Tatum said they were able to speak with most election judges but many provided confusing answers. Some even declined to speak. &#8220;The EAO staff was unable to gather information from all PJs and AJs because several judges advised EAO staff that they were instructed not to talk with the EAO staff about Election Day operations, including ballot paper due to the District Attorney’s announced criminal investigation, litigation brought by the Harris County Republican Party, and pending election contests,&#8221; the report read. “Although EOA staff was able to speak to most of the PJs and AJs, many of them provided confusing answers and some declined to speak after reportedly being advised not to do so by the Harris County Republican Party.” Interestingly, the report details other issues, including locations opening late and 170 voting centers inside school buildings that were not able to set up according to plan because the school districts were closed the day before to celebrate the<a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/elections/harris-county-november-election-report/285-b93da639-6fe0-4bfd-a72b-5c136a8e73f4"> Astros World Series Parade</a>.</p>

As a result of what were described as undetected &#8220;programming errors,&#8221; during the September primary&#8217;s early voting period some Spanish ballots on new touch-screen voting machines listed candidates from the 2018 election. ES&amp;S will provide a credit for all project management services provided in connection with the 2022 Primary Election.&#8221; The company also agreed to post a message on its website reminding election workers that it&#8217;s a good idea to proofread all ballots and test all tabulation machines before voters head to the polls. &#8220;As the 2022 election year ends, ES&amp;S reflects on ways in which we can continue to deliver on our mission of enhancing the election experience,&#8221; the company said in a statement about the settlement of the Rhode Island ExpressVote issue. &#8220;This includes committing to the customers we support and the voters they serve to review our collective processes, best practices and operating procedures and look for ways we can improve the security and integrity of the democratic process.&#8221;</p>

The Davidson County Election Commission confirmed in the report that more than 3,000 voters were assigned to one or more of the incorrect districts. Hundreds cast wrong ballots before the issue was flagged. The report determined that none of the errors were egregious enough to affect any of the races in which erroneous ballots were cast. Goins’ report says the root cause of the issues was that Nashville election officials made updates to voter files after the city’s IT GIS division had used geocoding, a computerized process to compare voter addresses to new district boundaries. Geocoding can be done multiple times in the process, the report says, and the commission did not verify its changes through a final round of geocoding by the IT GIS division, which a commission staff member declined to have done in March after election officials had made thousands more manual edits.</p>

During the July primary, roughly 600 voters who mailed their ballots forgot to sign them. Of those, 250 people cured their ballots. Currently, voters are sent a letter notifying them that they forgot to sign the oath, said Nikki Charlson, deputy administrator for the Maryland State Board of Elections. A copy of the oath is included, and it can be mailed back, dropped off at their local election board’s office, or scanned and returned via email. Following the successful pilot of a texting program called Text2Cure where voters who needed to cure their ballots were given a unique pin number and could then electronically sign and submit their oath electronically, the state plans to expand that in 2024. The pilot program was offered through the state’s current mail vendor, but Maryland will go through a procurement process next year to choose a vendor to offer a similar program statewide, Charlson said. State Sen. Cheryl Kagan, a Democrat from Montgomery County, is expected to propose a bill in the upcoming General Assembly session that would require such a curing process. “We do transactions like this all the time,” Kagan said of curing via text message. “We need it to be secure, we need to be accurate, but we don’t need to stay in the 20th century when it comes to making sure people can vote.”</p>

The massive budget bill that passed Congress on December 23 will send $75 million in election security grants to states, an amount that falls far short of what many officials had sought as state and local election workers have been targeted with harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election. They also were disappointed that proposals to make such threats a federal crime with more severe penalties fizzled. Various proposals introduced by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Jon Ossoff and Republican Sen. Susan Collins to boost protections did not gain enough support to pass the chamber and were not in the $1.7 trillion government spending bill. Klobuchar said she would continue to seek money for election offices and noted that she and Republican Sen. Roy Blunt had pushed to allow election officials to use previous federal funding for security upgrades. Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat who previously served as California’s secretary of state, called election workers the “backbone of our democracy” and said more must be done to ensure their safety. “In the wake of escalating attacks on our electoral institutions, I’m disappointed that my Republican colleagues did not come to the table this year to protect the thousands of election workers who safeguard our democracy,” he said in a statement.</p>

The new legislation allows voters to cast a ballot in an election if their registration forms are received by the board of elections by the tenth day ahead of an election, as compared to the twenty-five days ahead of an election currently mandated by law. The New York State Constitution stipulates that voters must register to vote at least 10 days prior to an election in which they wish to cast a ballot. However, New York’s current election law unnecessarily extends this minimum deadline, requiring that voter registration forms be submitted in person at least twenty-five days prior to an election or postmarked at least twenty-five days in advance and received by the board of elections by 20 days prior to an election. This shrinks by more than two weeks the amount of time that eligible New Yorkers have to submit their registration forms and make their voices heard in an election. Under the legislation signed by Hochul, this timeline will be addressed and voter registration deadlines will be moved closer to Election Day and into alignment with the standard set by the State Constitution. Voters will be eligible to vote in an election if they register in person by 10 days prior to an election; voters submitting registration forms by mail will be eligible to vote in an election if their forms are postmarked by 15 days prior to the election and received by the board of elections by 10 days prior to an election.</p>

Craig Goldman, R-Fort Worth, filed House Bill 397 to amend the state’s election code and enforce<a href="https://fortworthreport.org/2022/12/24/tarrant-county-lawmaker-files-bill-to-increase-penalty-for-illegal-voting/"> higher penalties for illegal voting activities</a>. Sen. Bryan Hughes, who represents East Texas, filed a companion bill in the Senate. Three other House bills, filed by representatives outside of Tarrant County, also seek to increase penalties for illegal voting — House Bill 39, House Bill 52 and House Bill 222.  The bills follow the rollout of Senate Bill 1 in 2021, a piece of election legislation that placed various restrictions on voting activity in Texas. Among the smaller changes in the bill was lowering the penalty for illegal voting from a second degree felony to a misdemeanor. Shortly after its passage, however, Republican leadership began calling for the penalty to be restored to a felony, resulting in bills like Goldman’s.</p>

The initial contract is for three years and will be funded through contingency funds according to Brazos County Judge Duane Peters. The program will allow voters to text basic questions and receive immediate answers, such as “Where can I go to vote?”, or, “Am I registered?” The program also provides an opt-in service for voters to receive alerts about election information and important deadlines from the county. Hancock said the election office only has eight phone lines and oftentimes during early voting and especially on election day those phones would be constantly busy with voters asking questions. “We have a real problem sometimes with judges and election workers being able to get through on the phone to ask questions when they need help in the polling places,” Hancock said.</p>

Thompson noted that real problems did affect the election, but election workers tried their best and performed their role &#8220;with integrity.&#8221; &#8220;Not perfectly,” Thompson continued, &#8220;as no system on this earth is perfect, but more than sufficient to comply with the law and conduct a valid election.&#8221; His 10-page ruling dismantles Lake’s witnesses and their arguments, denying in each case that they presented compelling evidence. Any request for sanctions in the case need to be made by 8 a.m. Dec. 26, the ruling states.</p>
<p>Additionally, Thompson<a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3789760-judge-denies-hobbs-request-to-sanction-lake-over-arizona-election-claims/"> rejected a request to sanction</a> Lake over her lawsuit challenging her defeat. Maricopa County and Katie Hobbs (D), in her capacities as both governor-elect and secretary of state, had asked the judge to require Lake and her legal team to pay all parties’ attorneys’ fees, arguing the suit was groundless and made in bad faith. In his decision, Thompson reiterated that Lake did not meet the burden of providing clear and convincing evidence of her claims necessary to win the case, but he said her suit did not meet the standard for imposing sanctions. “There is no doubt that each side believes firmly in its position with great conviction,” Thompson ruled on Tuesday. “The fact that Plaintiff failed to meet the burden of clear and convincing evidence required … does not equate to a finding that her claims were, or were not, groundless and presented in bad faith. Any legal decision must be based on the law and facts rather than subjective beliefs or partisan opinions, no matter how strongly held.” Thompson’s ruling, however, does require Lake to reimburse Hobbs $33,040.50 for certain costs incurred during the proceedings in accordance with other state statutes applicable because Lake did not win the case. Those costs include $28,351 in fees for expert witnesses called by Hobbs and $4,689.50 in compensation paid to Hobbs’s representative who attended ballot inspections prior to trial.</p>
<p>In a 67-page filing with the<a href="https://tucson.com/news/election/kari-lake-mark-finchem-double-down-on-fight-vs-voting-machines/article_148e7828-879b-11ed-9811-0b989caae8f0.html"> 9th Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, Kari Lake and Mark Finchem reiterate the claims they made before a trial judge “that electronic voting systems are subject to intrusion and manipulation and cannot be relied upon to secure, correct vote tallies in public elections.’’ Their attorneys cite various reports that others have shown the machines can be hacked and totals altered. But the essence of their plea to the appellate panel is that U.S. District Court Judge John Tuchi never gave them a chance to make their case. He dismissed their claims, saying they were little more than speculation, backed not by evidence of actual problems in Arizona but instead “vague’’ allegations about electronic voting systems generally. Tuchi also said neither Lake, who ran for governor, nor Finchem, who lost for secretary of state, proved they are being harmed by the system, something the judge said is necessary to bring suit in federal court. And in a subsequent ruling, the judge ordered lawyers for the pair to pay Maricopa County’s legal fees. Tuchi said Lake, Finchem and their attorneys filed a “frivolous’’ action against the county. They “baselessly kicked up a cloud of dust’’ and ignored procedures the state has put in place to ensure elections are secure and reliable, the judge said. “It is to make clear that the court will not condone litigants &#8230; furthering false narratives that baselessly undermine public trust at a time of increasing disinformation about, and distrust in, the democratic process,’’ Tuchi wrote. He said the sanctions “send a message to those who might file similarly baseless suits in the future.’’ In the new filing, the lead attorney for Lake and Finchem, Andrew Parker, told the appellate court that Tuchi himself violated rules governing how lawsuits must be handled.</p>
<p>Mohave County Superior Court Judge Lee Jantzen<a href="https://mohavedailynews.com/news/144637/judge-rejects-hamadehs-challenge/"> refused to overturn</a> the results of the election for attorney general and declare Abe Hamadeh the winner. &#8220;The bottom line is, you just haven&#8217;t proven your case,&#8221; Jantzen said And he said any mistakes that may have been made in how ballots were counted &#8220;were not enough to overcome the presumption the court has to have in election cases &#8230; that the election was done correctly.&#8221; &#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough information &#8212; I don&#8217;t think even slight information &#8212; the election was done illegally or incorrectly,&#8221; Jantzen said in ruling from the bench after the half-day trial. The judge acknowledged there were 14 ballots presented — out of about 2,300 reviewed — where there could be some question of whether a vote should have been counted, whether for Hamadeh or Democrat Kris Mayes. These were ballots where the marks on the ballots was less than clear. And that resulted in each having been reviewed by a three-member panel which sought to ascertain the voter&#8217;s intent. But Jantzen said that isn&#8217;t enough for him to rule that those panels, consisting of individuals from both major parties, who checked these ballots by hand, had done something wrong. &#8220;For the most part, these 14 ballots would be voter error, not filling them out the way the instructions say,&#8221; Jantzen said. Hamadeh has<a href="https://www.kgun9.com/news/elections/abe-hamadeh-files-motion-for-new-trial"> filed a motion for a new trial</a>.</p>

Conrad Reynolds, a retired U.S. Army colonel and leader of a group called Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative Inc., filed the lawsuit in Pulaski County against Secretary of State John Thurston, the State Board of Election Commissioners, and Election Systems and Software (ES&amp;S). The lawsuit contends that “the voting machines currently approved by the Secretary of State and the State Board of Election Commissioners fail to comply with state law.” The lawsuit, which was assigned to Judge Tim Fox on the 6th Judicial Circuit, urges the court to rule that the ExpressVote and DS200 voting machines used by the state “do not comply with Arkansas law because the voter cannot independently verify the votes selected by the voter on the ballot prior to being cast by the voter as the ordinary and common voter cannot read bar codes.” According to the lawsuit, voters mark their ballots using ExpressVote, which prints a ballot summary card that includes a bar code at the top “allegedly encoding the voter’s selected candidates and/ or issues.” The summary card is fed into the DS200, which tabulates the votes by reading the bar code. Because “most ordinary and common voters cannot read a bar code,” the lawsuit contends, the state law requiring that the voter be able to verify their vote is not met.</p>

Alexander also ordered that Patton undergo outpatient mental health treatment in hopes of making him well enough so he can be prosecuted.  The judge&#8217;s ruling followed an evaluation by an expert who found that Patton was mentally incompetent. To be considered legally competent to proceed, people accused of crimes must be deemed able to understand proceedings and help in their own defense by being able to communicate with their lawyers. Patton was arrested Nov. 3 and later charged with tampering with voting equipment, which state lawmakers this year made a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. It was formerly a misdemeanor offense with a penalty of up to 364 days in jail.</p>

Lenny Mirra filed a complaint in Essex Superior Court on December 21, 2022 alleging that he believes<a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2022/12/legal-challenge-to-results-of-mass-house-recount-to-focus-on-nine-ballots.html"> nine ballots were improperly counted</a> in his one-loss race and another 14 mail-in votes do not have properly matching signatures. He is asking the judge to either to declare him victorious in his North Shore district or rule that the race ended in a tie and therefore requires a new special election. Mirra’s team alleged that the registrars of voters in Georgetown, Ipswich and Rowley as well as town clerks in Ipswich and Rowley “made several critical errors of law” during the multi-day recount process, which flipped the originally certified result from a 10-vote victory for Mirra to a one-vote victory for Hamilton Democrat Kristin Kassner. Judge Thomas Drechsler<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/12/30/metro/judge-dismisses-gop-incumbents-challenge-one-vote-loss-mass-house-race/"> dismissed</a> the case arguing that any court action would be an “exercise in futility”. Drechsler said acting on the request would be “a waste of judicial and municipal resources.” “For whatever reason, Mirra waited until just before Christmas to file suit, with the swearing-in set to occur on January 4,” Drechsler wrote in his 10-page ruling. “While the court could make a judge available for a trial on the merits on an expedited basis, it would be impossible to complete a trial” by Wednesday. Drechsler also said it’s the Massachusetts House of Representatives, not the court, that at this point has “exclusive jurisdiction over this contested election” under the state Constitution. Mirra’s challenge, he wrote, “ignores the constitutional limit of the court’s power.”</p>

In one case, local law enforcement investigated an individual who was suspected of intercepting polling place Wi-Fi while serving as an election judge during the August primary, Ostrem said. Local law enforcement also investigated a second primary election judge who printed documents from a ballot tabulator that were ultimately considered public information. &#8220;When we&#8217;re charging somebody, do we have probable cause? And in both cases, the answer would probably be ‘yes,’” he said. “But would we also then be able to continue to develop more information and evidence that would get us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt? And the answer was a clear ‘no.’&#8221; Both those judges were not hired to serve during the November election, as was the leader of a local group of election deniers who circulated questionable instructions about taking pictures of balloting material and intercepting polling place Wi-Fi to local election judges.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court ended 2022 without a ruling n case regarding<a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-felon-voting-rights-not-decided-by-supreme-court-as-2022-ends"> ex-felon voting rights</a>, more than a year after hearing arguments in the case. The legal cases center around restoring the right to vote for people convicted of felonies who’ve served their jail sentences, as more than 50,000 Minnesotans with active felony records await the decision. The challenge invokes a constitutional argument that requires felons to complete time in custody, and be on supervised release or on probation before they can vote again. Proponents of the lawsuit want voting eligibility to automatically be restored upon release from incarceration.</p>

The lawsuit seeks relief from every county election official in the state. Hill&#8217;s court filing asks the judge to require local sheriffs to collect the ballots cast in recent elections and conduct a &#8220;forensic audit.&#8221; He demands the state legislature change the law and require the use of hand-counted paper ballots in future elections. Hill, initially sought $1 billion in damages. In a later court filing, he upped his request to $10 billion &#8220;based on the price of Gold and Silver at the start of this suit.&#8221; In response, the Nebraska Attorney General filed a motion asking the lawsuit be dropped, claiming the allegations are &#8220;without any factual basis to support them.&#8221; Douglas and Lancaster County, acting on behalf of their election commissioners, filed similar objections. In a separate filing, the attorney for Election Systems argues Hill has no legal standing to make such demands. The company&#8217;s brief states, &#8220;he has asserted nothing but generalized grievances about government and has not articulated a particular harm he has suffered different than the harm supposedly suffered by the general population.&#8221; The company adds the arguments are similar to those raised and &#8220;uniformly rejected and dismissed&#8221; in other courts around the country.</p>

They responded to a demand for such a proceeding contained in a lawsuit filed in county court by two voters who identify themselves as members of the Lycoming County Patriots organization. The county seeks dismissal of their suit filed Dec. 6 that seeks an order compelling a third-party forensic audit of the 2020 election results in the county. Richard Houser and Catherine Burns claim they showed the county commissioners over the past 14 months evidence of fraud, irregularities and violations of the Election Code. Defendants are the county, its board of elections, Commissioners Scott L. Metzger, Tony R. Mussare and Richard Mirabito and director of elections Forrest K. Lehman. The defendants are accused of failing to adequately investigate their claims of election fraud in a county in which President Trump outpolled Joe Biden, 41,462 to 16,971. Houser and Burns have not cited any authority that entitles them to a forensic audit of election results based upon their own allegations of fraud, county Solicitor J. David Smith points out in the defense response.</p>

He is accused of posting a series of threatening messages on social media sites. According to the criminal complaint, on November 13, 2022, the FBI National Threat Operations Center received information that a user called “FreeSpeechMaster” posted a threatening message on Patriots.win, a social media platform self-described as “the ultimate right-wing news, memes, and discussion aggregator.” The complaint then says on November 14, “FreeSpeechMaster” posted, “Hypothetically, a mass shooting of poll workers and election officials in these highly suspect precincts might be the way to go.” According to the complaint, on November 21, 2022, “FreeSpeechMaster” posted the name, address, phone number, and fax number of an election poll worker and commented, “It would be a shame if someone got to [his] children. There are some crazies out there. This kind of info shouldn’t be readily available on the internet.” On November 23, 2022, the FBI issued an Emergency Disclosure Request to Gab regarding the “FreeSpeechMaster” user account. Gab provided the FBI with the subscriber’s information, namely the IP address and the date the Gab account was created. On November 30, 2023, the FBI submitted a subpoena for subscriber information to Vexus Fiber, the host for the IP address they obtained from Gab. Vexus provided the name address, phone number, and email address of the subscriber, identified as Fred Goltz of Lubbock, Texas; a Canadian citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States. The FBI then cross-referenced other databases confirming the information obtained from Vexus. Goltz’s Texas driver’s license confirmed his physical and mailing address, and a search of law enforcement databases provided information on three vehicles associated with Goltz, a black Jeep Wrangler, a gray GMC Yukon, and a black Chevy Silverado. The special agent carrying out the investigation conducted surveillance on Goltz’s residence and saw all three associated vehicles at his residence. Goltz was arrested on December 20, 2022, and was booked into the Lubbock County Detention Center where he remains pending trial. He is charged with interstate threatening communications and is being held without bond.</p>
