<p><strong>Today’s Election Administration Landscape<br />
</strong><em>Findings from the Reed College Elections &amp; Voting Information Center’s 2023 Survey of Local Election Officials</em></p>
<p>By<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#founder-director-paul-gronke"> Paul Gronke, PhD</a> |<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#research-director-paul-manson"> Paul Manson, PhD</a></p>
<p>As regular<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/"> electionline Weekly</a> readers know, the administration of elections in the United States is a decentralized system with a complex set of diverse institutional arrangements that vary across states and sub-state jurisdictions.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10437" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Graphic-1_EVIC_75_8-300x243.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="243" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Graphic-1_EVIC_75_8-300x243.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Graphic-1_EVIC_75_8.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Nearly 8,000 officials spread across 50 states and the District of Columbia hold many titles. They are selected by many different methods, and have varying degrees of autonomy from their states (and their counties in the instance of villages, cities, etc., who conduct elections in Michigan, Wisconsin, and New England states). And, of course, they operate in very different political, demographic, and geographical environments.</p>
<p>In the face of this diversity, there are common features, predicable challenges, and a shared professional commitment that connects officials from the smallest Midwestern or New England township to densely populated urban and sprawling metropolitan suburban areas.</p>
<p>Since 2018, the <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC)</a> at <a href="https://www.reed.edu/">Reed College</a> has created and continuously evolved its often quoted and highly anticipated annual Survey of Local Election Officials (LEOs). And today, after the dust begins to settle on Election Day 2023 and election officials throughout the country shift focus to the 2024 primaries and presidential election, our team is proud to share our 2023 LEO Survey results and <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/2023_leo_survey_report/">report</a>.</p>
<p>In response to feedback from the elections community, researchers, and others working in the democracy space, we learned that a major challenge faced by almost all offices is summed up by one term: resiliency. In this turbulent time of rapid change, competitive elections, and increased public scrutiny, how have these offices adapted and performed?</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways from the 2023 LEO Survey include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job satisfaction remains high. LEOs say that “integrity”, “service”, and “community” come to mind when they think about what they like about their jobs. When asked what they don’t like about their jobs, “misinformation”, “politics”, and “stress” are at the top of their minds.<img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10438" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2_EVIC_79_Satisfied-300x282.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2_EVIC_79_Satisfied-300x282.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2_EVIC_79_Satisfied.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></li>
<li>Peak elections workload forces most officials to stretch to their limits, or go beyond them. On a percentage basis, the increased workload during “peak” election season is truly extraordinary – from 50% to 535% higher hours worked during elections as compared to the rest of the year. This is dependent on the size of the jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Turnover is twice as high as found in prior LEO surveys. However, loss of institutional knowledge may be tempered by lateral movement. For example, the average LEO in the largest-sized (&gt;100,000) jurisdictional category has been in their current position for only 5 years, but has 16 years of experience in elections. We need to know not just about when LEOs depart, but we need to know about who replaces a LEO when they depart.</li>
<li>Staffing and hiring continue to be a challenge for many election offices. Barriers to hiring include job classifications that have fallen out of sync with the skill sets currently needed to administer elections as well as non-competitive pay. LEOs are divided as to whether the political environment is a barrier.</li>
<li>Misinformation is a concern among most LEOs. LEOs in smaller jurisdictions rely primarily on face-to-face communication to counter misinformation, while LEOs in larger jurisdictions rely on a broad suite of communications channels that includes social media, websites, email, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10439" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EVIC-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="96" />Please visit our <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo_survey_project/">2023 LEO Survey results page</a> on the EVIC website where you will find our <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/2023_leo_survey_report/">report</a> on the high-level survey findings. And for those of you who may be academic researchers or other data geeks (and we mean that in a good way!), you will find the following 2023 resources available to download and comb through, including the <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/codebooks_crosstabs_survey_instruments/">2023 web-based instrument, crosstabs, and codebooks</a>, as well as the codebooks, crosstabs, and questionnaires from our 2018-2022 studies.</p>
<p>The 2023 LEO Survey was conducted during the off-year (although there is no true “off-year” for election officials) by EVIC in collaboration with <a href="https://ssrs.com/">SSRS</a>, our skilled survey administration partner and designer of the infographics used in our 2023 report.</p>
<p>The EVIC LEO Surveys also collect metrics to monitor the environment in which these public servants serve, their attitudes toward their work, and the situations and circumstances in which they find themselves. Since the 2020 election, the EVIC team has examined LEO perception of threats and harassment inside and outside of their workplace and the effects of this situation over time.</p>
<p>The 2023 LEO Survey was generously supported by the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology Election Data and Science Lab (MEDSL)</a> with additional survey communications support from the <a href="https://www.electioninitiative.org/en">Election Trust Initiative</a> to enable us to produce such high-quality infographics.The inaugural LEO Survey of 2018 through the 2022 Survey was funded by our collaborative partner on those efforts – <a href="https://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a> – without whose support this idea would not have become a reality. In addition to our current and past survey funders and their respective team members (way too many to name), we’d like to recognize our external team at <a href="https://ssrs.com/">SSRS</a> and our current internal EVIC team: <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#data-science-consultant-jay-lee">Jay Lee</a> (Reed’ 19), <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#senior-program-advisor-michelle-m-shafer">Michelle Shafer</a>, <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#data-science-research-assistant-simon-ahn">Simon Ahn</a> (Reed ‘24) and <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#program-assistant-abby-durrant">Abby Durant</a> (Reed ‘24), for their extremely valuable contributions to the success of this effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>And last – but most importantly – we thank election officials all over the country in almost every state, for taking the time to thoughtfully respond to our survey and help us in sharing results.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are an academic researcher who would like to work with our data, a leader of a national, regional, or state association of election officials interested in having a presentation on the 2023 LEO Survey at your next meeting, or a member of the media interested in writing about the 2023 Survey, please contact EVIC Senior Program Manager Michelle Shafer via email (<a href="mailto:shaferm@reed.edu">shaferm@reed.edu</a>).</p>

							<h2>New from Bipartisan Policy Center</h2>
														<p><strong>Envisioning a Cohesive Federal Elections Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Grace Gordon, Rachel Orey<br />
The Bipartisan Policy Center</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, the federal government has acted to protect elections from malign foreign actors, standardized voter registration processes, supported the transition to more secure and reliable voting technology, and established the <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />first federal agency solely devoted to election administration. Federal election security grants, though often<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/policies-beyond-the-next-election/"> unpredictable and insufficient</a>, helped fill crucial resource gaps within election offices.</p>
<p>While federal involvement in elections has increased in recent decades—to the benefit of election security and access—there is no unilateral framework for the federal government’s current or future role in U.S. elections. The scope and mission of each agency, commission, committee, and department are<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/visualize-federal-role-elections/"> highly fragmented</a>. The result is that the sum of all the independent and often isolated parts fails to function as a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>Legislators and other federal policymakers face an opportunity to affirm the resilience of U.S. election infrastructure for future generations by determining whether to continue the trend of increased federal involvement, break the trend and decrease federal involvement, or strive to maintain the current level of federal involvement.</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center’s latest report,<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/options-for-u-s-federal-involvement-in-elections/"> Options for U.S. Federal Involvement in Elections</a>, lays out three options for federal involvement in elections and describes the security, accessibility, and trust trade-offs of each option.</p>
<p>The incentive structure of the federal government today emphasizes compliance over innovation, making the creation of proactive, forward-thinking policy a challenge. The ideal role for the federal government in elections is a responsive, collaborative, intentional, and strategic one that centers the needs of state and local election offices.</p>
<p>As federal policymakers consider the best way to support elections in the lead-up and aftermath of the 2024 presidential election, intentionality is key. The goal, regardless of party affiliation, is safe, secure, accessible election infrastructure. While every option for federal involvement comes with trade-offs, a lack of coordination and direction serves no one.</p>

Four of the letters contained fentanyl, the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service reported in a statement to elections officials Nov. 9. “Law enforcement is working diligently to intercept any additional letters before they are delivered,” the statement said. The mailings delayed the counting of ballots in some jurisdictions. The Pierce County auditor’s office in Tacoma, Washington, released images of the letter it received, showing it had been postmarked in Portland, Oregon, and read in part, “End elections now.”  In Seattle, King County Elections Director Julie Wise said that letter appeared to be the same one her office got — and that it was “very similar” to one King County received during the August primary, which also contained fentanyl. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said officials were sending the overdose-reversal drug naloxone to the office as a precaution. “This is domestic terrorism, and it needs to be condemned by anyone that holds elected office and anyone that wants to hold elective office anywhere in America,” said Raffensperger. Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs called the incidents in his state “acts of terrorism to threaten our elections.” White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton said the Biden administration was aware of the investigation: “We are grateful for the election and poll workers who served this week to ensure the security of our democratic processes.” The<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kansas-ap-kan-montana-tennessee-b2447432.html"> Kansas secretary of state&#8217;s office</a> received a letter Tuesday containing what Secretary Scott Schwab called “a suspicious substance.&#8221; Officials evacuated the building for the rest of the day. “With recent events, we take such things as a suspicious substance very serious,” Schwab said in a text to The Associated Press. “Our team is trained if they see something, say something.” Elections officials throughout the country are preparing for suspicious mail. In<a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/utah-considers-narcan-and-gloves-to-protect-election-clerks-from-fentanyl-laced-letters"> Utah</a>, officials are looking at providing Narcan to ballot processing centers and asking county election clerks to wear gloves when opening mail.<a href="https://www.chronicleonline.com/news/local/citrus-supervisor-of-elections-is-ready-for-national-mail-scare/article_541b5289-677b-5925-88ad-c4a47389db10.html"> Citrus County, Florida</a> Supervisor of Elections Maureen Baird said her office is ready for anything.  “We have partnered with county officials to have masks, gloves and Narcan available,” Baird said. “In the past, we have had to take precautions with mail when Anthrax scares were an issue. The idea is to always be proactive. Citrus County is ready and well into the preparations for the 2024 elections,” Baird said.<a href="https://abc-7.com/news/2023/11/14/lee-county-elections-office-instituting-protections-against-suspicious-letters/"> Lee County, Florida</a> Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle instituted some new policies, all in an effort to keep his employees safe while opening mail.

The policy means that Meta will be able to directly profit from political ads that boost false claims about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. While the company will allow political advertisements to claim that past elections, including the 2020 presidential race, were rigged, it will prohibit those that “call into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election.” Meta says the policy allowing 2020 election denialism in political ads was part of an August 2022 announcement about its approach to last year’s midterm elections, when the company said it would prohibit ads targeting users in the United States, Brazil, Israel and Italy that discourage people from voting, call into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election or prematurely claim an election victory. The same month, Meta <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/20/facebook-twitter-2022-midterms/">told The Washington Post</a> that it would not remove posts from political candidates or regular users that claim voter fraud or that the 2020 election was rigged.  Meta’s broader electoral misinformation policy continues to prohibit content that could interfere with people’s ability to participate in voting or the census, such as false claims about the timing of an election, according to the company.</p>

														<p><strong>DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Releases Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence<br />
</strong><em>Roadmap will guide CISA’s efforts to manage the risks and harness the opportunities posed by AI</em></p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released its first<a href="http://www.cisa.gov/ai"> Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a>, adding to the significant DHS and broader whole-of-government effort to ensure the secure development and implementation of artificial intelligence capabilities. DHS plays a critical role in ensuring AI safety and security nationwide.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Last month, President Biden issued an<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/"> Executive Order</a> that directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions. As part of that effort, CISA&#8217;s roadmap outlines five strategic lines of effort for CISA that will drive concrete initiatives and outline CISA’s responsible approach to AI in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>“DHS has a broad leadership role in advancing the responsible use of AI and this cybersecurity roadmap is one important element of our work,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to building a secure and resilient digital ecosystem that promotes innovation and technological progress. In last month’s Executive Order, the President called on DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally and help ensure the safe, secure, and responsible use and development of AI. CISA’s roadmap lays out the steps that the agency will take as part of our Department’s broader efforts to both leverage AI and mitigate its risks to our critical infrastructure and cyber defenses.”</p>
<p>“Artificial Intelligence holds immense promise in enhancing our nation’s cybersecurity, but as the most powerful technology of our lifetimes, it also presents enormous risks,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Our Roadmap for AI, focused at the nexus of AI, cyber defense, and critical infrastructure, sets forth an agency-wide plan to promote the beneficial uses of AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities; ensure AI systems are protected from cyber-based threats; and deter the malicious use of AI capabilities to threaten the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day.”</p>
<p>As the nation’s cyber defense agency and the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA envisions a secure and resilient digital ecosystem for the nation that supports unparalleled innovation and significant enhancement of critical infrastructure services provided to the American public. CISA’s roadmap outlines five lines of effort:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line of Effort 1</strong>: Responsibly use AI to support our mission. CISA will use AI-enabled software tools to strengthen cyber defense and support its critical infrastructure mission. CISA’s adoption of AI will ensure responsible, ethical, and safe use—consistent with the Constitution and all applicable laws and policies, including those addressing federal procurement, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.</li>
<li><strong>Line of Effort 2</strong>: Assess and Assure AI systems. CISA will assess and assist secure by design, AI-based software adoption across a diverse array of stakeholders, including federal civilian government agencies; private sector companies; and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments. Assurance will be established through the development of best practices and guidance for<a href="https://www.nist.gov/trustworthy-and-responsible-ai"> secure and resilient AI development and implementation</a>, including the development of recommendations for red-teaming of generative AI.</li>
<li><strong>Line of Effort 3</strong>: Protect critical infrastructure from malicious use of AI. CISA will assess and recommend mitigation of AI threats facing our nation’s critical infrastructure in partnership with other government agencies and industry partners that develop, test, and evaluate AI tools. As part of this effort, CISA will establish JCDC.AI to catalyze focused collaboration around threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations related to AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Line of Effort 4</strong>: Collaborate and communicate on key AI efforts with the interagency, international partners, and the public. CISA will contribute to DHS-led and interagency efforts, including developing policy approaches for the U.S. government’s overall national strategy on cybersecurity and AI, and supporting a whole-of-DHS approach on AI-based-software policy issues. This also includes coordinating with international partners to advance global AI security best practices and principles.</li>
<li><strong>Line of Effort 5</strong>: Expand AI expertise in our workforce. CISA will continue to educate our workforce on AI software systems and techniques, and the agency will continue to actively recruit interns, fellows, and future employees with AI expertise. CISA will ensure that internal training reflects—and new recruits understand—the legal, ethical, and policy aspects of AI-based software systems in addition to the technical aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p>CISA’s mission sits at the intersection of strengthening cybersecurity and protecting critical infrastructure and therefore plays a key role in advancing the Administration’s goal of ensuring that AI is safe, secure, and resilient. CISA will assess possible cyber-related risks to the use of AI and provide guidance to the critical infrastructure sectors that Americans rely on every hour of every day. Additionally, CISA will work to capitalize on AI’s potential to improve U.S. cyber defenses and develop recommendations for the red-teaming of generative AI.</p>
<p>CISA invites stakeholders, partners, and the public to explore the Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence and learn more about our strategic vision for AI technology and cybersecurity. To access the full Roadmap, visit <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/ai">cisa.gov/AI</a>.</p>

A growing body of evidence shows that citizens with disparate political perspectives share a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with our current system. In response, organizations and philanthropists are pursuing innovations to strengthen American democracy. In our inaugural Democracy Renewal Project grantmaking cycle, Public Agenda seeks to support this movement to renew democracy with evidence on how to achieve full access to electoral participation for all citizens while strengthening trust and confidence in elections. While both of these goals are at the foundation of legitimate and sustainable democracy, they are often pursued separately. In the worst cases, bad faith efforts to persuade members of the public that elections are not trustworthy have laid the groundwork for legislative restrictions on ballot access. While it is essential that pro-democracy actors do not capitulate to these narratives, ideally efforts to build access would not provide momentum for disinformation that may accelerate anti-democratic dynamics. Our goal is to support research that addresses both access and trust. We have timed this grantmaking cycle to enable researchers to take advantage of the 2024 election cycle. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Public Agenda does not support any candidate or party. As a matter of mission, Public Agenda does not seek to advance any specific political ideology or policy agenda. We will fund projects that contribute to the health and strength of a pluralistic democracy. Democracy Renewal Project grants are open to researchers affiliated with public or nonprofit U.S. universities. We expect to award 10 or more grants of up to $50,000. The deadline for proposal submissions is January 17, 2024, 11:59 pm ET.</p>

The bill does not require states to adopt certain mail-in or absentee ballot policies The Vote by Mail Tracking Act was previously introduced in the 117th Congress and was marked up by the House Oversight Committee in November 2022. The bill advanced the committee on a bipartisan basis. The bill has yet to receive any correspondence in the 118th Congress.

The goal is to make it easier for voters to come to next year’s big elections, and the sites would be available for both primary and general elections next year. If it’s approved and signed by the mayor, it would add more early voting spots near downtown and in more rural parts of the county. This comes just months after Duval County’s Supervisor of Elections Office was sued for certain areas having twice as many precincts as others. The first election that these polling sites would be used for would be for the 2024 presidential primary elections on March 16.</p>

Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou, D-East Lansing, is a primary sponsor of one of the bills. “Amending our state law here is common sense — and the right thing to do,” she said in a statement. “Michiganders deserve to live in a democracy where their voices are heard and where they can cast their ballots free from intimidation or threats of violence.” Those with concealed pistol licenses are still permitted to carry their firearm when otherwise permitted by state law. Violations of the law can result in a misdemeanor with up to 90 days imprisonment and a $100 fine.</p>

I asked some questions about it and I think at this point, the court came to the right decision as far as leaving the system the same,” said John Coffee, Potter County Commissioner Precinct Three. “We have a very good system, a very reliable system that works and you can’t justify just throwing that away and going back to paper ballots,” said Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner. Commissioners agreed to keep voting methods the same and believe public education and transparency will help increase confidence in election honesty. “We try to be as transparent as possible while still protecting the secrecy of the ballot. We have poll watchers, we also have state inspectors that come for almost every election on Election Day, they will go to our sites,” said Christy Benge, Potter County elections administrator.</p>

Brandtjen requested unanimous consent to suspend the rules toward the beginning of the session and take up a resolution containing 15 articles of impeachment against Wisconsin Elections Administrator Meagan Wolfe she introduced with four other GOP members of the Assembly in September. Many of the impeachment articles contain accusations that have been debunked or are based on decisions made by the bipartisan panel of commissioners who oversee Wolfe. The motion was out of order, said Speaker Pro Tempore Kevin Petersen, R-Waupaca, who shut down the effort.</p>
<p>A bill that prevents cities and counties from<a href="https://whbl.com/2023/11/09/bill-to-keep-polling-places-open-ahead-of-elections-gets-hearing-in-senate/"> closing too many polling places within a month of an election</a> got its first hearing in a State Senate Committee on Nov. 8. Two Rivers Republican Shae Sortwell said the closure of many polling places in cities, like Green Bay and Milwaukee, during the spring 2020 elections was unacceptable. “They should not have been closing that number of polling locations without some sort of way to make sure people knew it so that people were not disenfranchised so that people are able to exercise their constitutional right to vote,” said Sortwell. Milwaukee Democrat Lena Taylor said the closure of all but five polling locations in Milwaukee suppressed the vote there by 10 percent. “I remember the frustration of the angry residents,” said Taylor. “I’d love for you to hear some of the voicemails that I had.” A companion Assembly bill passed on Nov. 9.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers plans to sign the current version of a bill to<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/09/evers-to-sign-bill-allowing-earlier-processing-of-absentee-ballots/71503204007/"> allow clerks to begin processing absentee ballots early</a>, one of several election measures with support from Democrats and clerks that passed in the Republican-controlled Assembly. Lawmakers from both parties have been working to draft legislation in response to clerks&#8217; suggestions to improve the efficiency of running elections — including allowing them to begin processing absentee ballots a day early. Lawmakers agreed the change would prevent voter confusion and conspiracies that result from large amounts of ballots being processed late and added to totals, sometimes changing which candidate is in the lead. The measure passed the Assembly on a voice vote Thursday, with only a few members objecting. While the current version of the bill still needs to be heard in a Senate committee, Evers will sign the bill if it &#8220;passes in its current form as amended by the committee and without any poison-pill additions,&#8221; the governor&#8217;s spokeswoman, Britt Cudaback, said Nov. 9.</p>

In October 2022 U.S. District Court Judge Myron Thompson rdered the “immediate” release of the data but also said he was “concerned” about the secretary’s motivations for denying the request. “The court is hard-pressed to furnish a reason why he would refrain from sending the records to GBM in digital form except to frustrate the aims of the public-inspection provision by making it more difficult and costly for GBM to access the records to which it is entitled,” Thompson wrote. “Use of these alternative methods would further delay provision of the records GBM seeks.” Afterward, the secretary did offer to provide the records for a total cost of $429.17 for “staff time,” but the organization declined and the state appealed.  The secretary argued the National Voter Registration Act requires his office only to “maintain” certain records and make them available for “public inspection” and “where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost.”  “Nothing in the statute requires the secretary to create or provide electronic records to anyone,” the secretary said in an appellate brief. Representing the secretary, Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Seiss told the appellate panel Monday that Thompson’s decision amounts to a “judicial rewrite” of the voter registration law, because it only speaks to two methods of disclosure: public inspection and photocopying. Additional guidance from the Federal Elections Commission and the Alabama Legislature does little to advance the organization&#8217;s request, he said.  “State law requires the secretary to make the list of active and inactive voters available to the general public, but it doesn&#8217;t require a list of those purged from the voting rolls or those removed due to a disqualifying felony conviction,” he said. “There isn&#8217;t an allegation that the secretary failed to provide public inspection or photocopying here, we&#8217;re talking about a third method that&#8217;s not required under the NVRA.” Although it only provides for public inspection and photocopying, Seiss acknowledged it contains no prohibition against electronic records. The judges seized on another section regarding list maintenance, asking whether the secretary has a duty to disclose purges of convicted felons as part of the “implementation of programs and activities” for maintaining the rolls.  Seiss acknowledged the secretary does and has exercised discretion with whom the felon list is shared, but not with any statutory authority.  “That’s his prerogative,” Seiss said.</p>

The lawsuit filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that Election Day tabulation issues at voting centers throughout Maricopa County disenfranchised enough voters to change the results of some elections, including Hamadeh’s 280-vote loss to Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. An outside investigation led by retired Arizona Supreme Court Justice Ruth McGregor found that the roughly 17,000 ballots were impacted by issues with some printers, which “could not maintain the heat required to consistently print ballots dark enough to be read by the on-site tabulators.” But county election officials said no one was disenfranchised because affected voters were able to place their ballots in a secure box. Those ballots were later counted at the county’s elections headquarters.  Hamadeh’s new lawsuit, filed in conjunction with a group called AZ Voters Rights, claims as many as 20% of potential voters were not able to cast ballots due to the Election Day printer problems. The filing by attorney Ryan Heath includes testimony from four voters who claim they were disenfranchised.  Three of those voters attested that voting centers within a reasonable distance of their homes had extremely long lines due to the printer issues. One of those voters claimed health issues prevented her from waiting in long lines.</p>

She already faces ten state charges, with the case set to go to trial in February. Prosecutors allege that she helped steal the identity of a local man and broke state rules by sneaking an unauthorized observer into a secure update of the voting system software. In the lawsuit, Peters said she was well within her right to take the actions she did, and that she was just complying with her legal obligations to preserve election records.  “Peters lawfully exercised her authority to arrange for a consultant on May 23, 2021, before the upgrade, to make a forensic image of the Mesa County EMS hard drive. A ‘forensic image’ is a bit-by-bit, non-modifiable (read-only) copy of all the digital data stored on a disk drive,” states the complaint.</p>

Vote.org, the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans, the Florida NAACP, and Disability Rights Florida filed a notice last week that was a first step in appealing the Oct. 30 ruling by U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor. As is common, the notice did not detail arguments the groups would make at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The challenge involves a state requirement that paper voter registration applications include what is known as a “wet” signature — a handwritten signature in ink. The groups contend the requirement violates part of the federal Civil Rights Act barring the rejection of voter-registration applications for reasons “immaterial” to determining whether people are qualified to vote. As an example, the groups said paper applications would be rejected if submitted with electronic signatures. “Florida’s wet signature requirement requires state election officials acting ‘under color of law’ to deny Floridians their right to vote based on the ‘omission’ of a handwritten, wet-ink signature on a voter registration application, which is a ‘record or paper’ relating to ‘registration,’” attorneys for the groups wrote in a July court document. “Because whether a voter provides a signature by pen, e-signature or otherwise provides no insight into a voter’s qualifications to register, rejecting applications due to the wet signature requirement violates the materiality provision (of the Civil Rights Act).” But Winsor, in an 18-page decision dismissing the lawsuit, wrote that the plaintiffs’ “entire premise is that a copied, faxed or otherwise non-original signature is equal in stature to an original, wet signature. But we know this not to be so.” The groups filed the lawsuit in March and named as defendants Secretary of State Cord Byrd and county supervisors of elections. The Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Pasco County intervened as defendants to support the wet-signature requirement. In a motion to dismiss the case filed in May, attorneys for Byrd and supervisors said the “original” signature requirement dates to 2005 and that it does not violate the Voting Rights Act. Also, the motion said voters can register to vote with digital signatures through the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.</p>

Police are seeking felony charges of bringing a weapon on school grounds against one individual, a two-time failed Republican candidate for Munster Town Council, for his role in the incident. Misdemeanor charges of intimidation are being sought after a second individual for his part in the altercation. Sgt. Thomas Kuhlenschmidt said the charges are the result of the culmination of video from Eads Elementary School cameras, body camera footage and what he heard while on scene as the shift supervisor. Kuhlenschmidt said the polling place had received two complaints from people coming to the polls about a person outside making comments about people being Marxists or communists if they said they were a Democrat.</p>

If convicted on all counts, she could face more than 200 years in prison. According to the Department of Justice, Kim Taylor failed to translate portions of forms that warned her victims that forging signatures or signing ballots without consent was a crime. They say Kim Taylor convinced members of the Vietnamese community to fill out ballots for their children, and even collected blank ballots and then filled them out casting ballots for her husband, Jeremy Taylor. “She wanted her husband to win by any means necessary,” one prosecutor said. In opening statements, a DOJ lawyer said two witnesses cast ballots only to be told they’d already voted, leading them to question who cast ballots on their behalf. According to the government, that was Kim Taylor. The prosecution also said many of the Vietnamese witnesses will testify they really only wanted to vote for Donald Trump, and they don’t understand the concept of a primary election, giving Kim Taylor an opening to take advantage.</p>

The appeals court panel&#8217;s ruling notes that if the state legislature does not pass a new map by mid-January, the lower court should move ahead to a trial in order to finalize a map in time for the 2024 elections. The panel says the court could give &#8220;limited additional time&#8221; to lawmakers. Any major delays could risk not having a redistricting plan in place by late May, when the state has said it needs a final map to prepare for elections. After the ruling&#8217;s release, Louisiana Gov.-elect Jeff Landry, a Republican, said he plans to call a special session as governor.</p>

An attorney with the Mississippi Center for Justice, who filed the notice of appeal for Mississippi Votes, filed a motion Nov. 13 seeking a voluntary dismissal. The organizations were seeking legal relief for voters who were unable to cast ballots in the Nov. 7 gubernatorial election when several precincts in Hinds County ran out of ballots. Other issues arose subsequently, including running out of toner when attempting to print more ballots. The Mississippi Center for Justice, Mississippi Votes and other voting rights organizations filed a lawsuit hoping to extend voting hours to 9 p.m. for four precincts in the county that were most affected by the ballot shortage. Hinds County appointed a special judge, who wrote in his opinion that the motion was granted in part and dismissed in part, and then he cited Mississippi code word for word, saying the polls would stay open until 7 p.m., but added that anyone in line at 7 p.m. would be eligible to vote until 8 p.m. Mississippi code, however, says voters in line at the time polls close can stay and vote, however long it takes. In a similar lawsuit filed by the Mississippi Democratic Party, another judge ruled all polling places in Hinds County would be allowed to stay open until 8 p.m.</p>

It lists the defendants as the town of Atlantic Beach, Mayor Jake Evans, Josephine Isom, who was his opponent in the race, Councilwoman Jacqueline Gore and the Municipal Election Commission. The lawsuit focuses on an emergency town council meeting that took place on Nov. 10 where leaders voted to dissolve the election commission while in the middle of a recount for the mayoral election. The lawsuit alleges that the emergency meeting was unlawful because it didn’t meet certain requirements. “Here, there was no ‘emergency’ authorizing the Town Council to convene an ‘Emergency Called Meeting’ on Friday, November 10, 2023, because there was no ‘emergencies affecting life, health, safety or the property of the people,’” the lawsuit states. Court documents also show that the town council ignored public notice requirements and no attorney was physically present when the town council went into executive session. Once the decision was made, the lawsuit states that election commission members were not told why they were removed from their positions. “In either event, the true motivation of Defendants Jake Evans, Josephine Isom, and Jacqueline Gore in calling an ‘emergency’ meeting of the Town Council was to disenfranchise the lawful voters of Atlantic Beach because they were disappointed with and disapproved of the results of the November 7, 2023, municipal election,” the lawsuit states. Drew Kurlowski, an associate political science professor at Coastal Carolina University, also pointed out to WMBF News that cities and towns can only remove an individual member from a commission, it can’t remove an entire commission. It’s against state law for a municipality to not have an elections commission unless the county has taken over the election process for the town or city. The Horry County Election Commission tells WMBF News since the county isn’t in charge of the election, it can’t step in, and the South Carolina Election Commission said it can’t either.</p>

Two candidates previously dropped their suits and Peeples then dismissed the remaining 15 suits on Tuesday. One lawsuit remains in which Republican Tami Pierce is challenging the results of the 180th criminal state district court race where incumbent Democrat DaSean Jones won. Harris County Attorney Christian D. Menefee said he was “glad the judge confirmed what we’ve all known for a year now.” “These Republican candidates lost the 2022 election,” Menefee said in a statement. “We at the county have moved on. Voters have moved on. I hope the Harris County Republican Party will move on, too.”</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Galveston County commissioners<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/galveston/article/federal-appeal-court-upheld-full-hearing-18483835.php"> violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act</a> by eliminating the only majority-minority district in its latest redistricting process. The Appellate Court affirmed October&#8217;s ruling finding the county violated the Voting Rights Act, but the judges said previous precedent essentially tied their hands. Three judges on the panel wrote they were interested in revisiting precedent, which allows claims on behalf of a broad coalition. In this case, that means on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters, said Mark Gaber, the Campaign Legal Center’s senior director for redistricting. The legal center was one of the plaintiffs who sued the county after it passed the maps in 2021. The Justice Department, local branch of NAACP and residents of the redrawn district, among others, also sued. The case went to trial in August in Galveston. While upholding Judge Jeffrey Brown&#8217;s ruling in the matter, the circuit court panel called on their fellow judges to vote on whether or not to call a special hearing — in which all 17 of the circuit court judges would meet and consider the case — to revisit precedent on Voting Rights Act cases, Gaber said. Gaber said he wasn’t sure what the full court would decide, but it would be unusual if they did call for a hearing. The 5th Circuit already had a similar hearing, called an en banc hearing, on the same matter in the 1990s, he said. “The whole idea of an en banc hearing is to settle an issue,” Gaber said.</p>
