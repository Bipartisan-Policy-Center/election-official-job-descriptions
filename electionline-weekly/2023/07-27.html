							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New BPC Explainer<br />
</strong><em>The Federal role in U.S. elections visualized</em></p>
<p>By Grace Gordon<br />
Bipartisan Policy Center</p>
<p>Policymakers, election officials, members of the public, and election experts from both sides of the aisle have <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9975" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/total-federal-elections-map1-230x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/total-federal-elections-map1-230x300.png 230w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/total-federal-elections-map1-786x1024.png 786w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/total-federal-elections-map1-768x1001.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/total-federal-elections-map1-1179x1536.png 1179w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/total-federal-elections-map1.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />increasingly called on the federal government to support state and local election administration. As the federal role in elections evolves, election stakeholders must understand the overlap and inter-agency collaboration between federal entities to better use existing resources and advocate for needed improvements.</p>
<p>A new<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/visualize-federal-role-elections/"> Bipartisan Policy Center explainer</a> visualizes the existing, complex network of federal agencies, committees, bureaus, departments, and institutes involved in elections in the United States.</p>
<p>Between March and June 2023, BPC convened three working groups to inform this explainer with representatives from federal agencies, state and local election offices, other nonprofit elections groups, academic researchers, and philanthropic organizations. Participants agreed that improved efficiency and coordination in the federal response to elections would greatly benefit state and local election offices.</p>
<p><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/visualize-federal-role-elections/">This piece</a> breaks down federal entities by branch of government, with independent agencies under the executive branch, where they are historically grouped despite their reliance on Congress for funding and mandates. Some agencies named in the explainer, like the Election Assistance Commission and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, have a statutory mandate to serve election offices across the country. Others, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have been called upon in recent years to provide support in other ways. For example, FEMA started administering grants to election offices in 2023.</p>
<p>The EAC, CISA, and Department of Justice have improved coordination in recent years: EAC’s four advisory boards incorporate members from other government agencies, nonprofits, associations, and election officials; CISA has championed both public and private sector collaborative councils; and DOJ’s task force on elections strives to bridge work between law enforcement, legal authorities, and election officials. This inter-agency collaboration demonstrates the supportive and interactive role of the federal government in elections.</p>
<p>This fall, BPC’s Elections Project will release a report describing different options for federal involvement in future elections, including how federal involvement in elections has historically been decided and the nuances and tradeoffs of different levels of federal involvement guided by the principles of trust, security, and accessibility. By reimagining the federal role in elections, we can begin to optimize increased efficiency and improved coordination.</p>

This luncheon panel was hosted by Dr. Mitchell Brown of Auburn University and was attended by over one hundred academic researchers and practitioners. This article follows the format of the panel, with opening remarks by the speakers and curated question and answer with questions from the audience.</p>
<p>The topic of the panel, the use of philanthropic dollars to support election office operations during the 2020 election cycle, has been extraordinarily controversial. Although philanthropy has played a role in elections in myriad ways over the years from providing funding for activities like voter education, 2020 saw an unprecedented use of philanthropic dollars to support election operations because the local, state, and national funding available to many offices to address the added burden from the pandemic was inadequate. In response, state legislatures around the country began passing legislation to limit or stop the role of philanthropic dollars to support election administration, specifically using the logic that private dollars to support government operations is inappropriate and has implications for unbiased and nonpartisan administration and raises questions about electoral integrity.<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/journal/documents/JEARP-volume02-issue-01-philanthropy-and-election-operations.pdf"> Read more…</a></p>

In addition to the cybersecurity and protective security advisors that are already stationed across the country providing frontline service support to address the full range of cyber and physical threats to critical infrastructure, CISA will now be establishing<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-establishes-regional-election-security-advisors-strengthen-front-line-support-election"> dedicated election security advisor positions in each of the agencies ten regions</a>. In meeting with election officials over the last two years, Easterly said it became clear that optimally supporting them means meeting them where they are. The election security advisors will help build even stronger connective tissue between state and local election officials and the team at CISA. They will work directly for CISA’s Regional Directors and with the agency&#8217;s cybersecurity and protective security advisors to ensure CISA’s capabilities and services are being optimally employed to meet the unique needs of each state or locality. Election security advisors will be experts in the infrastructure, jurisdictional requirements, and operating environments unique to their regions to offer more tailored guidance and support. “As we look to rapidly implement this new capability to support the election community, I’ve asked my senior advisor Cait Conley, who will be leading our election security efforts starting in August, to oversee the recruiting and hiring of our regional election security advisors,” Easterly said. “As we gear up for upcoming elections, including the 2024 presidential election, we will continue to lean forward and do our part to ensure the American people can have confidence in the security and resilience of our democratic process.”</p>

Previously inmates—most there pretrial and therefore eligible to vote under Texas law, had been limited to absentee voting. In 2016 only two people voted absentee from the jail and in 2020 only 34 did so. This May, Dallas County Sheriff Marian Brown tested out a jail polling place for municipal elections. Twenty people voted in person at the new polling place. An additional ten returned an absentee ballot from the jail. While those numbers are still low compared to the population of the jail, they are an improvement, especially for typically low-turnout municipal elections. Brown said that her office would use the spring’s low-profile elections to iron out any logistical issues. “The municipal elections afford us the opportunity to do a trial run to fill these gaps,” she said. During the 2023 legislative season a bill was filed to prohibit polling places in a jail or any other detention facility, but it never advanced. When asked if the jail will continue to host a polling place in future elections, the sheriff’s office told Bolts, “Yes, the plan is to continue having a polling location at the Dallas County Jail for inmates and one outside for the public as we did in May.”</p>

The move comes just three years after the state joined ERIC. According to the secretary of state’s resignation letter, the state’s exit will be effective in three months, in accordance with the program’s bylaws. By then, a law approved by the Texas Legislature this session, authored by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, will have gone into effect. That legislation directs the secretary of state to build its own version of a multistate cross-check program or to find a “private sector provider” with a cost that won’t exceed $100,000. Hughes did not respond to Votebeat’s request for comment. Alicia Pierce, the secretary of state’s spokesperson, said the state could not stay in ERIC because it must now comply with the requirements in the Hughes legislation. Despite the departure, Texas law still requires the state to participate in a multistate data-sharing program to clean its voter rolls, which is what led the state to join ERIC in 2020. When the state stops using ERIC in October, it will be in violation of that requirement unless it finds an acceptable substitute, which won’t be easy.  Pierce told Votebeat the secretary of state’s office is still researching options.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7919" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/StLouisMO-300x202.png" alt="" width="209" height="141" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/StLouisMO-300x202.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/StLouisMO.png 490w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" />St. Louis, Missouri</strong>: Candidates in<a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/st-louis-bill-would-end-2-candidate-nobody-loses-primaries/article_561a58d4-266a-11ee-a821-5b46e368ffa7.html"> two-person races for city offices could skip a primary</a> and run only in the general election under a plan to be submitted Thursday to the Board of Aldermen. “It really does not make sense for the same people to run against each other two months in a row,” one supporter of the change, Aldermanic President Megan Green, said Wednesday. Green was referring to the city’s primary and general elections, held in March and April of odd-numbered years. The bill’s sponsor, Alderman Shameem Clark Hubbard, said the change also could save the city money. Fewer polling places, for example, would be needed in a primary if a ward’s aldermanic race and a citywide race drew no more than two candidates apiece. “It’s a no-brainer,” she said.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3852" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ohio:</strong> Sen. Theresa Gavarone (R-Bowling Green) has introduced<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/sb137"> Senate Bill 137</a> that seeks to stop communities from passing<a href="https://www.ideastream.org/2023-07-25/republican-lawmaker-proposes-stripping-money-from-ohio-communities-that-pass-ranked-choice-voting"> ranked choice voting</a>, which allows voters to rank a number of choices in multiple-candidate races. The bill would withhold payments from the state’s Local Government Fund for any community that passes ranked choice voting, which she said causes delays, confusion and lower turnout. “To go in and rank a number of different candidates, some of whom you&#8217;re not familiar with, you haven&#8217;t had time to research them, who haven&#8217;t been out there doing the work, can cause issues. You get to the ballot and there are eight people,&#8221; Gavarone said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a confusing system.” Supporters of the idea disagree. Republican former state representative Gene Krebs has been working with a group trying to gauge whether Ohioans want ranked choice voting, doing door-to-door surveys and other outreach. He said Gavarone&#8217;s bill solves no problems — and actually does the opposite. “It creates problems because it blocks off a possible avenue to have more intelligent conversations about policy at the local level,&#8221; Krebs said. &#8220;And it also, I think, would hurt the ability of those cities to manage themselves better.”</p>

Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) and Rep.

Under current law, the cost to obtain the state&#8217;s entire set of voter records is $12,500, an amount the two lawmakers said in the memo is out of reach for most citizens. &#8220;This bill is set to level the field for those who would like to see transparency in our voter information. We want to take away barriers that don’t have a solid purpose,&#8221; Binsfield said in a statement. The $12,500 figure is based on a $25 base fee, plus $5 per 1,000 records returned by the request. The state currently has nearly 3.6 million registered voters. Without the $12,500 cap, based on the existing formula, the cost of the entire set of records would be about $18,000. The proposed legislation would apply the $250 limit to electronic records and would allow the Wisconsin Elections Commission to apply an additional fee for producing a physical copy of the list. Under current law, that fee is 25 cents per printed page along with the cost of postage and shipping. State law currently requires the commission to determine the fee to obtain voter records by estimating, in consultation with local election officials, the cost to maintain and reproduce the list at the state and local levels. There is no mechanism under state law to waive the fee.</p>

The bill, signed into law in March 2022, requires already-registered voters to provide proof of citizenship to remain registered to vote in presidential elections or vote in any federal election by mail. The law places the burden on roughly 200,000 voters who never had to show proof of citizenship before, like those who registered using the National Voter Registration Act federal form. The law includes requirements for voters to provide documentation of their birthplace and check a box on their form affirming they&#8217;re citizens in addition to providing other proof of citizenship documents. Failure to do any of those things can result in a canceled registration. Plaintiffs argue requiring voters to prove their citizenship without any notice from the state or opportunity to correct errors before their registration is terminated will disenfranchise voters who may not have access to the required documentation or the time and ability to locate it. They claim the law violates both the First and 14th Amendments, as well as the Civil Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act. According to Courthouse News Service, it’s unclear when Bolton will rule on the competing motions. At the hearing’s conclusion, she set a bench trial date for Nov. 6.</p>
<p>In a brief order issued this week, the Arizona Supreme court<a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/arizona-election-courts/article_ecf96844-2bec-11ee-8f99-df8a9de5224f.html"> rejected Kari Lake’s request</a> to immediately take up her appeal of a lower court ruling that went against her. The justices said there was “no good cause’’ to let her skip the normal process of first taking the case to the Court of Appeals. Lake had pleaded that a quick resolution of her complaints is necessary to resolve her claim of “extraordinary new evidence,’’ much of which a lower court judge found lacking, and also to deal with her allegations of “election maladministration’’ ahead of the 2024 election.</p>

The case was initially moved to federal court at the request of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin. The lawsuit, filed by plaintiffs including Conrad Reynolds, CEO of the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative (AVII), is against John Thurston in his official capacity as Arkansas Secretary of State, the Arkansas State Board of Election Commissioners in its official capacity, and Election Systems and Software, LLC. The lawsuit claims that the ExpressVote electronic voting devices and DS200 electronic tabulators do not comply with state law and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Consequently, voters are unable to independently verify their votes before casting them, the suit alleges.</p>

Lubitz, who lives with his parents, has been diagnosed with chronic obsessive-compulsive disorder, a key factor that led to his lenient sentence, according to court records. Lubitz will face supervised release for three years. He is not allowed to visit polling places, may not contact any victims or possess firearms, and must undergo psychological counseling, according to the terms imposed by U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz. Lubitz was charged with voter intimidation last October after he had threatened election workers who assisted him and other voters at a senior center in Sunrise during the primary election last August. “Should I kill them one by one or should I blow the place up?” a federal indictment accused Lubitz of saying at the polling station, then he “pointed his finger and thumb in a gun-like fashion towards election workers.”</p>

The concession by Giuliani came in court papers filed as part of a defamation lawsuit that the two workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, had brought against him in Federal District Court in Washington in December 2021. The suit accused Giuliani and others of promoting a video that purported to show Freeman and Moss of manipulating ballots while working at the State Farm Arena for the Fulton County Board of Elections. In a two-page declaration, Giuliani acknowledged that he had in fact made the statements about Freeman and Moss that led to the filing of the suit and that the remarks “carry meaning that is defamatory per se.” He also admitted that his statements were “actionable” and “false” and that he no longer disputed the “factual elements of liability” the election workers had raised in their suit.</p>

The settlement includes a confidentiality order aimed at preventing dissemination of voters’ personal information beyond the Illinois Conservative Union.  The Conservative Union and its founder, Carol Davis, a former tea party activist, had filed a federal challenge to the state election board’s limitations that provided complete voter data only to political committees and governmental entities. Under a previous judicial ruling, individual voter data that greatly redacted personal information had been available to the public. Now, after paying an existing fee that had been charged to political and governmental entities, the Conservative Union can acquire a complete list of the state’s 8.1 million registered voters along with age, address, phone number and county and state voter ID number, except for individuals covered by special federal or state confidentiality laws.</p>

Wingate wrote in his order this week that Mississippi cannot enforce the law during this year’s primaries or general election. “The voting polls are expected to extend outstretched hands of welcome and provide unfettered access to conscientious citizens anxious to enjoy ‘participatory democracy,’ whether those citizens be among the vulnerable and the disabled,” Wingate wrote. He wrote that the state law violates the Voting Rights Act, a federal law that says any voter who is blind, disabled or unable to read may receive assistance “by a person of the voter’s choice,” other than the voter’s employer or union.</p>

In May, the library filed a civil suit in district court against Merchant, asking the court to appoint an election monitor, alleging a series of errors from the May 2 school board election they were hoping to avoid. Raph Graybill, attorney for the library board, asked the court to allow the library to pay Lynn Deroche, court appointed election monitor, for her time.  On July 10, the court dismissed the case and ordered all parties to pay their own attorney fees and costs. Graybill said they did not seek attorney fees.</p>

In an<a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/crime-courts/charlottesville-pastor-sues-virginia-to-reclaim-voting-rights/article_e751f0ee-21cb-11ee-9042-e769f7dfb70a.html"> attempt to restore voting rights to people with felony convictions</a>, it argues that part of the commonwealth’s constitution violates a 150-year-old federal law which readmitted Virginia to the U.S. Congress after the Civil War. Article II of Virginia’s constitution says that any person with a felony conviction loses their right to vote unless it’s restored by the governor. Further, Virginia is the only state in the nation that requires a person with a felony conviction to individually petition the governor to restore that right. When the commonwealth was brought back into the Union in 1870 via the Virginia Readmission Act, it was prohibited from amending its constitution to deprive citizens of the right to vote, except for punishment for crimes that were common law felonies at the time. Those crimes were murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, robbery, rape, sodomy, mayhem and larceny. Yet today’s constitution includes a number of crimes that were not considered felonies in 1870. Among them are drug offenses and “uttering”, which is the presentation of a document known to contain forgery. “We’re asking the court to provide relief for everyone who has lost the right to vote for things that were not felonies in 1870,” Vishal Agraharkar an attorney for ACLU Virginia said.</p>
<p>Makya Little, a losing candidate in the 19th District House of Delegates Democratic primary, sued party leaders and state elections officials this week<a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/woodbridge-democrat-files-suit-against-party-elections-officials-alleging-primary-irregularities/article_d1995978-2b48-11ee-950d-a37ca56fa817.html"> alleging that June’s primary election was tainted</a>. She is seeking financial damages from the party and an injunction preventing the state from printing fall election ballots until her case is resolved. Little, joined by three Northern Virginia voters who “felt ignored” by elected officials and the Democratic Party of Virginia, filed the lawsuit in Richmond Circuit Court on behalf of themselves with no attorney. Defendants are the state, the Virginia Department of Elections, chair of the state Board of Elections John O’Bannon and state Democratic Party Chair Susan Swecker.</p>

The suit, filed on behalf of two liberal-leaning organizations and a Dane County man, will likely determine whether high-profile voting decisions from the current ideological makeup of the state Supreme Court ruling will be overturned before the 2024 presidential election. In July 2022, the state Supreme Court in a 4-3 ruling banned voters from using drop boxes to return absentee ballots. In September, a Waukesha County judge banned election clerks to fill in missing address information on absentee ballots. The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks to undo both rules. It also challenges the Election Day deadline to correct errors on absentee ballots. Under current state law, ballots must be corrected by 8 p.m. on the day of an election or the votes will not be counted. &#8220;Absentee voting has long been an important part of Wisconsin elections. As far back as the Civil War, Wisconsinites have been able to exercise the right to vote by casting an absentee ballot; indeed, Wisconsin was one of the few states to uphold absentee voting for Union soldiers fighting in that war,&#8221; the complaint said.</p>
