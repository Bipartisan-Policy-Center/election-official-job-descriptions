							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Talk to the hand</strong><br />
<em>The current state of the push to count ballots by hand</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Probably since the inception of the first voting machine, there have been skeptics.</p>
<p>However, that skepticism — by and large unfounded — reached a fever pitch in 2020 and has manifested itself in a rise in calls from some factors to count ballots by hand.</p>
<p>Elections officials, experts and advocates have all largely<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-nevada-83f8f680cfaf96adce39bcbdd8e4610a"> come out against the idea of hand-counting ballots</a> other than in limited circumstances.</p>
<p>“Machine counting is generally twice as accurate as hand-counting and a much simpler and faster process,” said Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University who has conducted research on hand-counts told the <em>Associated Press.</em></p>
<p>In one study in New Hampshire, he found poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%. The error rate for machine counting runs about 0.5%, Ansolabehere said.</p>
<p>Most recently, Verified Voting released a report,<a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/publication/hand-counts-nov-2023/"> Election Night Hand Counts: Realities and Risks</a>. The report notes that claims that election night hand counts are the only way to confirm election outcomes are being used as a tool to spread disinformation about vote counting systems.</p>
<p>The Brennan Center noted that “hand-count movement is<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/hand-counting-votes-proven-bad-idea"> rooted in conspiracy</a> theories, but it also plays on valid concern that any system of voting, including machine voting, has areas of vulnerability that need safeguarding. To address these valid concerns, it’s essential to maintain voting equipment, keep its software up to date, and have strict security protocols both online and in the physical world.”</p>
<p>Previously The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Task Force on Elections released a<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/press-release/statement-from-bpc-task-force-on-elections-ballot-tabulators-are-essential-to-election-integrity/"> statement</a> outlining how ballot tabulators are essentially to election integrity as well as an<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/how-ballot-tabulators-improve-elections/"> explainer</a> on how ballot tabulators, not hand count, improve elections.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/machine-tabulation-not-hand-counting-should-be-used-count-ballots"> Campaign Legal Center</a> opposes the practice noting that replacing voting machines with hand counts as the main way of counting votes would weaken the electoral system by introducing a greater degree of human error into the process.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://my.lwv.org/wisconsin/ballot-bulletin-hand-counting-ballots-vs-machine-counting-ballots"> Wisconsin</a>, the League of Women Voters launched an educational series highlighting various election security topics including hand counting ballots.</p>
<p><strong>At the state and local level</strong><br />
Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization committed to reporting the nuanced truth about elections and voting at a time of crisis in America has a<a href="https://www.votebeat.org/hand-counting-ballots/"> good compilation</a> about hand counting ballots, especially at the local level.</p>
<p>Most recently, the<a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/11/21/mohave-county-supervisors-hand-counting-ballots-2024-election/"> Mohave County, Arizona</a> board of supervisors rejected a proposal to hand-count ballots after being notified by the state’s Attorney General that the practice would be illegal.</p>
<p>At the state level there have been a handful of bills introduced about hand counting ballots.</p>
<p>The most recent legislation was introduced in Florida. State Representative Berny Jacques (R-Seminole)<a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=78953"> sponsored a bill</a> that would allow<a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/hillsboroughcounty/hand-counting-ballots-florida/67-79f5a731-eb0c-4f42-8219-97e7810a3414"> hand-counting of ballots</a> at election precincts. The proposal would also prevent the Department of State from using voting machines that use hardware or software designed, owned, or licensed by foreign corporations. Under current law, counties must use electronic machines to tabulate votes. Needless to say, local elections officials are skeptical.</p>
<p>“For a large county especially, it&#8217;s absolutely ludicrous,” said Craig Latimer, the supervisor of elections in Hillsborough County where voters cast more than 700,000 ballots in 2020. “Taking the tabulation out and trying to hand count everything, I can&#8217;t even imagine how long it would take you to do that.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in response to a push to hand-count ballots in Shasta County, the<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-limiting-ballot-hand-counting-california-law-county/story?id=103741610"> California</a> General Assembly passed, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed, a bill that only allows the hand-counting of ballots under very narrow circumstances. Under AB 969 hand counts are permitted during regularly scheduled elections in places with under 1,000 registered voters and special elections with fewer than 5,000 voters. It also blocks counties from canceling contracts for voting systems in the future without a transition plan and a finalized agreement for a new state-approved system.</p>
<p>Arkansas enacted<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:AR2023000H1687&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=d2a150d5802cd88526aec1ee56718a6f&amp;mode=current_text"> H 1687</a> which allows counties to choose to hand count paper ballots in place of voting machines. The ballots must still be compatible with machines. Counties that choose to do so are required to front the costs of hand counting. The bill lays out the guidelines.</p>
<p><a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:AZ2023000H2722&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=a7ec1292a12a790afb42ede3472d3f2f&amp;mode=current_text">Arizona</a> (vetoed by the governor),<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:KS2023000S262&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=2ef30814cd71daee9afab93029b802c8&amp;mode=current_text"> Kansas</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:MT2023000S435&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=684090c1329bd691f851fe38a917d77a&amp;mode=current_text"> Montana</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:NE2023000L808&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=66c808e67b1a69a725553238dae4f392&amp;mode=current_text"> Nebraska</a> and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TN2023000S595&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=b280d08e926eb45871c965a7cb5ccf24&amp;mode=current_text"> Tennessee</a> all had hand counting bills introduced but failed.</p>

Under the authority of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), the EAC created ESTEP to establish requirements and guidelines specific to election technologies that are not covered under the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). In February of 2023, ESTEP launched an Electronic Poll Book Pilot Program, which will serve as a model for other certification programs for technologies like election night reporting databases, voter registration portals and databases, and electronic ballot delivery systems. At the EAC’s December 4th virtual meeting, the Commissioners heard a presentation on summary findings from the E-Poll Book Pilot Program and recommendations for next steps for ESTEP. The EAC Commissioners held a vote to adopt the Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program as a permanent EAC program. The motion was unanimously approved. ESTEP has already initiated the next steps for testing and certifying e-poll books on the federal level, which involves revising the Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Requirements to incorporate baseline functional requirements based on state and local standards. In addition, ESTEP has developed supporting administrative guidelines in the Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program Manual, to assist manufacturers and voting system test laboratories with adherence to program expectations. EAC Commissioners will formally vote on these two documents once the period of public comment has concluded on December 14, 2023. ESTEP continues to work closely with the EAC’s research specialists to enhance data collection methods during the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) reporting for e-poll books to further improve the nation’s understanding of the use of these critical systems. Following the e-poll book pilot, ESTEP plans to move forward with piloting blank electronic ballot delivery systems.</p>

The complaint alleges that opponents of ranked-choice voting founded a church called the Ranked Choice Education Association that could have allowed donors to gain tax advantages for their contributions while skirting disclosure requirements. Those requirements apply to any group working to promote the ongoing effort to repeal Alaska’s ranked-choice voting and open primaries through a ballot measure. The Ranked Choice Education Association appeared to engage in “the laundering of contributions” for Alaskans for Honest Elections, the anti-ranked choice voting ballot group, the complaint alleges. The complaint was filed with the Alaska Public Offices Commission, a government watchdog organization responsible for enforcing the state’s campaign-finance laws. In<a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/colorados-county-clerks-ballot-initiative-would-radically-change-elections/"> Colorado</a>, the state’s clerks are expressing concerns about three 2024 ballot measures that would add rank choice voting for certain candidates, require tight deadlines to be met for counting votes and change how candidates can win a spot on the ballot. Initiative 98 would move to an open primary, top-four ranked choice system, require candidates to collect signatures for ballot access and require special elections for vacant legislative seats. Initiative 99 would do all of what I98 would but add Colorado’s presidential contest to the ranked-choice voting election. Initiative 100 would just create an open primary system the same as Initiative 98, with ranked-choice voting for the general election. Carly Koppes, Weld County Clerk and Recorder and a past president of the Colorado County Clerks Association, noted in a statement that county clerks typically stay neutral on issues and candidates that may be on the ballot. “As the professionals tasked with running elections in all 64 counties, we are trusted because we apply election rules fairly and fully and produce safe and accurate results,” said Koppes in a release. “But we could not stay quiet while a potential ballot initiative advances that could upend our existing election system. Colorado has worked hard to put together an election system that serves as a national model for how to hold safe and secure elections while also making sure that every voter who wants to vote can do so. We can’t stand by while someone recklessly attempts to upend that system.”</p>

Some of the issues they’ve cited include,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/01/us/politics/georgia-county-election-deniers-trump.html"> Columbia County, Georgia</a> which has signed up to use a new voter registration information database — EagleAI — which voting rights groups, election security experts and state election officials have warned against. Columbia County is the first known in the country to use the system that has been deemed an alternative to ERIC by election deniers.

The organization is demanding the secretary of state address its concerns, or else it will proceed with a lawsuit. The RNC alleges three Nevada counties — Douglas, Lyon and Storey — have more registered voters than adult citizens over 18, and that five other counties — Carson City, Churchill, Clark, Eureka and Washoe — have “suspiciously high rates” of registered voters.

According to Meta, someone in China created thousands of fake social media accounts designed to appear to be from Americans and used them to spread polarizing political content in an apparent effort to divide the U.S. ahead of next year&#8217;s elections. The network of nearly 4,800 fake accounts was attempting to build an audience when it was identified and eliminated by the tech company, which owns Facebook and Instagram. The accounts sported fake photos, names and locations as a way to appear like everyday American Facebook users weighing in on political issues. Instead of spreading fake content as other networks have done, the accounts were used to reshare posts from X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that were created by politicians, news outlets and others. The interconnected accounts pulled content from both liberal and conservative sources, an indication that its goal was not to support one side or the other but to exaggerate partisan divisions and further inflame polarization. &#8220;These networks still struggle to build audiences, but they&#8217;re a warning,&#8221; said Ben Nimmo, who leads investigations into inauthentic behavior on Meta&#8217;s platforms. &#8220;Foreign threat actors are attempting to reach people across the internet ahead of next year&#8217;s elections, and we need to remain alert.&#8221;</p>

The most contentious of the bunch seek to make sure that noncitizens can’t vote in federal or D.C. elections. The markup came more than four months after the committee<a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/07/14/republicans-conservative-election-bill-heads-to-house-floor/"> advanced</a> the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4563"> American Confidence in Elections Act</a>, a package of roughly 50 bills that has so far not gotten a vote on the floor and has a remote chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate. “I’m optimistic that we’ll still be able to see the floor [on the ACE Act] in the near future. Obviously we lost in time during October, but hopefully as we get ourselves back up and running, that bill will have the opportunity to fight for time House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (R-Wisconsin) said ahead of the markup. “In addition to that, what we’re doing is a series of bills, many of which are components of the ACE Act, in a standalone manner.” On bipartisan votes, the committee advanced legislation to<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4474"> protect election observer access</a> and to<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3229"> protect against the influence of foreign nationals in elections</a>, a legislative<a href="https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/legrec2022.pdf"> recommendation</a> made by the bipartisan Federal Election Commission. The normal partisan cracks emerged on other legislation, including proposals that would allow states to<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4316"> require proof of citizenship to vote by mail</a>, that would override a D.C. law<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4396"> allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections</a>, and that would<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3162"> require the secretary of Homeland Security and the commissioner of Social Security</a> to provide states with information on the citizenship status of prospective voters.</p>
<p>Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts) has unveiled the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/felon-disenfranchisement-legislation-voting-rights-prison-2431448db8be2cc41df7b78c11e30e83"> Inclusive Democracy Act</a>. The legislation would ensure Americans convicted of a felony have the right to cast their ballots in federal elections. The act would guarantee the right to vote in federal elections for all Americans, regardless of criminal conviction, and would require that those with past convictions receive notice that they have the right to vote and would retain the right to vote. In a statement, Pressley said the legislation was necessary due to policies and court rulings that “continue to disenfranchise voters from all walks of life — including by gutting the Voting Rights Act, gerrymandering, cuts to early voting, and more.” The legislation would also require incarcerated people to be educated on their voting rights and offered systems and resources for how to register to vote. The bill also requires means of vote by mail for incarcerated people. States and territories currently determine a citizen’s voting eligibility for all levels of government. The proposed bill would not change states’ ability to expand or restrict access for state or local elections.</p>

The proposal would also prevent the Department of State from using voting machines that use hardware or software designed, owned, or licensed by foreign corporations. Under current law, counties must use electronic machines to tabulate votes. “We want people to get out, vote and have trust that when they cast that ballot, it will be counted according to their wishes,” Jacques said in an interview with the News Service of Florida. Those that run elections here have a different take on hand-counting. “For a large county especially, it&#8217;s absolutely ludicrous,” said Craig Latimer, the supervisor of elections in Hillsborough County,  where voters cast more than 700,000 ballots in 2020. “Taking the tabulation out and trying to hand count everything, I can&#8217;t even imagine how long it would take you to do that,” Latimer added.</p>

Gretchen Whitmer (D)<a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-election-law-young-voters-71e38a065dfbaf30fccee92511c448e7"> signed a series of election bills into law</a> last week. Included was legislation allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register and adding more protections for election officials ahead of a 2024 presidential election. Also included in the package was a bill that will automatically register individuals to vote when they are released from incarceration. Michigan is the first state in the nation to implement such legislation. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson praised the legislation signed in Detroit, saying it was a “great step into the 2024 election cycle where we will be prepared for all the bullies who are going to show up on our doorstep.” The package looks to further protect<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-michigan-local-misinformation-829943ed5dd5fe2e470fd754edf6902c"> election officials</a> by criminalizing acts of intimidation during an election. An individual who intimidates an election official “with the specific intent of interfering with the performance of that election official’s election related duties,” could be punished with a misdemeanor for the first two violations and a felony for the third violation, according to the law.</p>
<p>As acting governor, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson signed into law legislation codifying her office’s practice of allowing registered and qualified voters to<a href="https://michiganadvance.com/blog/as-acting-governor-benson-signs-bill-codifying-online-absentee-ballot-requests/"> apply for an absentee ballot online</a>. The bill amends Michigan Election Law to require the Secretary of State to maintain an online portal allowing those eligible to vote to request an absentee voter ballot. The bill’s sponsor, state Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo), said in the same news release that the bill helps keep a system that allows voters to have more options when interacting with the election process to continue. “I’m grateful for this opportunity to serve as acting governor and sign this important bill to improve Michigan’s election system,”Benson said in a news release. “As Michigan’s Secretary of State, I implemented our state’s online absentee ballot application system in 2020 to provide a convenient, accessible way for Michigan citizens to request their ballot. Now this system is codified into law.”</p>

The proposal released requires Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, a Democrat, to take over election administration duties from the commission by June 30 and bars her from taking any action without the approval of the GOP-controlled legislative committees overseeing election issues. Scott Krug, chairman of the Assembly elections committee, said he would consider holding a hearing on the proposal but had not yet read the legislation closely. &#8220;(It) does make some sense to have an elected representative of the people at the helm,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just a lot of details to get right along the way.&#8221; The proposal, released by<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/11/knodl-who-sought-to-block-2020-result-picked-to-lead-election-panel/70205021007/"> Senate elections committee chairman Dan Knodl</a> and 10 Assembly Republicans, is the latest move by the Republican-controlled Legislature to overhaul election administration ahead of the 2024 presidential election in one of the most narrowly divided battleground states in the country. Britt Cudaback, spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, said the governor will veto &#8220;any attempts by Republicans to continue abusing their power to interfere with or control the outcomes of our elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban the possibility of<a href="https://www.wkow.com/news/gop-lawmakers-introduce-legislation-proposing-a-constitutional-amendment-to-ban-ranked-choice-voting/article_a53b4328-93c6-11ee-8f6c-9fdc5d4803aa.html"> ranked-choice voting</a> in Wisconsin elections, a process that allows voters to rank candidates in order of their preference. The legislation comes in response to a separate bipartisan &#8220;final five&#8221; bill that aims to change how Wisconsinites would cast their ballots. The &#8220;final five&#8221; voting bill would remove the process voters currently use to select from their party&#8217;s list of candidates in a primary and vote for the party&#8217;s leading candidate in the general election. Instead, voters use a single-ballot primary to pick their top candidate overall, and the five candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the primary advance to the general election. The system then uses a ranked-choice system for voters to rank their preferred candidates based on the five candidates running in the general election.</p>
<p>Gov. Tony Evers signed a<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/06/tony-evers-takes-action-on-bills-aimed-at-changing-rules-for-voters/71829452007/"> trio of elections-related bills</a> this week while vetoing others. Evers signed bills that change deadlines for clerks to send out absentee ballots, require clerks to retain video footage of election night proceedings for 22 months if the municipality opts to broadcast proceedings on election night, and force courts to dissolve the campaign committee of a candidate convicted of election crimes and require leftover funds to be returned to donors. The governor also vetoed bills that would have changed rules for those who declare themselves &#8220;indefinitely confined&#8221; and significantly lowered the cost of obtaining an electronic list of every registered voter in Wisconsin. Evers also vetoed a bill that would have required the Wisconsin Elections Commission to verify voters&#8217; citizenship status with state Department of Transportation records and require licenses and identification issued by DOT to non-citizens to indicate the cards cannot be used for voting. &#8220;I object to this bill requiring state-issued identification cards to have a &#8216;recognizable indication&#8217; that could result in certain individuals being treated differently or unfairly in everyday, non-electoral situations this legislation fails to consider or contemplate,&#8221; Evers said in a veto message.</p>

She claims the envelopes contain fraudulent, unverified voter signatures that swung the election to Hobbs.  Those envelopes contain the name, address, phone number and signature of each voter who casted an early ballot. More than two months after the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/kari-lake-makes-final-push-for-access-to-voter-signatures-as-phoenix-trial-winds-down/"> conclusion of a two-day trial</a> over the envelopes, Judge John Hannah agreed with the county recorder and rejected Lake’s request to inspect the envelopes.  “The public release of 1.3 million ballot affidavit envelopes signed by Maricopa County voters would undermine the process of verifying those voters’ ballots in future elections,” Hannah wrote in the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lake-v-richer-ruling.pdf"> order</a>. “It would create a significant risk of widespread voter fraud where none now exists. It would expose voters to harassment and potentially force them to defend the integrity of their own votes. Some number of voters would stop participating entirely, out of fear of identity theft or concern about privacy.” Hannah acknowledged early in his order that the ballot envelopes are indeed public record, and the government should always lean toward disclosure regarding public record. But the public’s right to disclosure can be outweighed by “the interests of confidentiality, privacy or the best interests of the state.” In this case, he wrote, the risk to voter privacy outweighs the public’s right to disclosure.</p>

The ruling sidesteps provisions of the federal Voting Rights Act and Florida’s Fair Districts Amendment that forbid political redistricting plans that diminish minority groups’ ability to elect the representative of their choice. “We can resolve this appeal by answering a simple legal question: In order to demonstrate a legally cognizable claim that an ‘apportionment plan or individual district … diminishes a member of a racial minority’s ability to elect representatives of his or her choice, does a plaintiff first have to establish that he or she is part of a geographically discrete and compact minority community of historically natural existence?” the majority opinion reads. “The trial court found it unnecessary to answer the question, and the plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence to this effect. We, however, say yes,” the opinion continues.</p>

Joseph Bleich ruled this week<a href="https://www.ktalnews.com/news/election/your-local-election-hq/judge-orders-new-election-for-caddo-parish-sheriff/"> the results of the election for Caddo Parish Sheriff are void</a>. In the Nov. 18 runoff election, Henry Whitehorn defeated candidate John Nickelson by a single vote. When the recount occurred, officials confirmed found three additional votes for each candidate and Whitehorn remained one vote ahead of his opponent. Nickelson filed a lawsuit challenging the results and requesting a special election. He said the process was rushed and unlawful votes were cast in the election. Multiple people were found to have voted both by mail and in person. In a brief submitted to the First Judicial District Court, Whitehorn asserted, “The judiciary should not decide elections. Louisiana courts have made it clear that the results of an election are to be disturbed only under extraordinary circumstances where a plaintiff introduces compelling evidence that is sufficient to change the result in the election.” Four judges recused themselves from the case due to their friendships with Nickelson. The Louisiana Supreme Court assigned the case to Justice Bleich. On Dec. 5, he ruled the runoff election results are void and ordered a new runoff election. Whitehorn’s team is likely to appeal the decision.</p>

More than 170 voters submitted ballots with<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/11/21/more-than-1400-voters-in-kalispell-may-have-been-disenfranchised-cascade-county-to-miss-deadline/"> incorrect candidate information</a> in the last election, with a total of 1,413 eligible voters, or 8% of the total eligible voters in Kalispell, impacted. This happened because new ward boundaries were not updated in the election system. One city race in Kalispell was won with a margin of fewer than 100 votes. The filing said the county will be fronting the cost of another election. The filing said, Clerk Debbie Pierson didn’t know of any current challenges to this election in district court and statute permits a year to annul election results. “… Because of the manifest error in the election process for the City of Kalispell, the Election Administrator feels it is her duty to attempt to annul this election and conduct a new one,” the filing read. Pierson said in a statement Friday integrity throughout every step of the election process is paramount. “To this degree, I feel it is essential that the election is redone, and ballots are issued according to current ward boundaries,” Pierson said. “It is vitally important that the public is confident that fair, accurate, and transparent elections are being conducted in Flathead County.” State attorneys<a href="https://www.kpvi.com/news/regional_news/montana-attorneys-argue-against-injunction-asking-judge-to-block-new-voter-requirements/article_ab61bb38-1cec-5431-96ec-50b290a51129.html"> responded</a> to a request for a preliminary injunction that would block new Montana voter registration requirements already in effect by telling a judge the additional requirements only strengthen existing law and saying the plaintiffs in the case took too long to ask for an injunction if they were worried about the law’s effects.</p>

Beadles sued Registrar of Voters Jamie Rodriguez, County Manager Eric Brown and Commission Chair Alexis Hill, claiming they violated his rights by not sufficiently addressing his concerns over voter rolls, signature verification and a belief in widespread fraud, despite two Nevada Secretaries of State finding no evidence. Beadles wants the court to compel the officials to address his grievances and remove them from their positions. In his ruling, Russell called Beadles’ supplemental exhibits “rogue” because he didn’t get the court’s permission to submit them. Beadles is representing himself in the case and told the judge he has not consulted with any attorneys about it.</p>

Geiger issued an order for a hand count of ballots to begin at noon on Dec. 6 and continue weekdays until completed, according to Schwager&#8217;s attorney Scott Salmon. Schwager&#8217;s petition cites an article from<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2023/11/20/can-bergen-county-fix-election-problems-2024-election/71608597007/"> Nov. 20 in The Record</a> describing how &#8220;new voting machines, untrained poll workers and slow system services&#8221; were to blame for a &#8220;chaotic Election Day in Bergen County.&#8221; &#8220;Some municipalities, including Oakland, saw a surge of voters between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., because of a close mayoral race and a ballot question, and needed more paper,&#8221; the article states. Schwager&#8217;s petition says &#8220;errors were made in the counting of the votes from each district within the Borough of Oakland,&#8221; and that &#8220;such errors could have resulted in an error in the overall tabulation resulting in Kulmala being declared the winner of the election.&#8221; Kulmala&#8217;s attorney, fellow Councilman John McCann, said there would be no appeal.</p>

Attorneys for both write-in challenger Ron Belmont and incumbent Republican town supervisor Rich Dionisio agreed this was the right course of action. The judge&#8217;s decision came the day after Belmont&#8217;s attorneys called for the pause over accusations against the county board of elections of &#8220;irregularities observed during the recanvassing process.&#8221; According to court documents, ballots were not counted for Belmont because voters misspelled his name, wrote it in the wrong box or only included his first or last name. &#8220;There is no consistency in that respect and that&#8217;s why we need the court. I do, believe that the court will now come to the rescue of the voters and evaluate all of these ballots with a fresh eye,&#8221; said Jeffrey Binder, attorney for Ron Belmont. Both parties were scheduled to be back in court on, December 6 where the judge will go one-by-one through each contested ballot and rule whether to award it to Belmont or toss it out altogether. Without court intervention, Dec. 2 would have been the deadline for the county board of election to certify races to the state.</p>

Roy Cooper’s power to<a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/judges-block-law-that-strips-governors-power-to-make-elections-board-appointments/"> make appointments to the State Board of Elections</a>. The preliminary injunction temporarily blocks one of Republicans’ attempts to overhaul elections ahead of the 2024 election, in which voters will choose a new governor and help determine which party wins the U.S. presidency. Cooper<a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/nc-gov-cooper-sues-over-a-new-law-that-strips-governors-of-state-elections-board-appointments/"> sued</a> in October over the law,<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/s749"> SB 749</a>, which he vetoed before Republicans overrode him, arguing that it violated the principle of separation of powers. Before the law change, governors appointed all five state board members based on recommendations from the major parties. (The governor’s party held three seats under that model.) SB 749 took that power away from the executive branch, expanding the elections board to eight seats and allowing Democratic and Republican legislators to appoint four members each.</p>

The Republican Party, which intervened in the case, appealed Baxter&#8217;s decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia. The parties who appealed are the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, according to court records. The GOP unsuccessfully argued before Baxter that not counting the disputed ballots would not run afoul of the Materiality Provision of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. In her 77-page opinion, Baxter found that throwing out the mail-in ballots due to dating issues violated the Materiality Provision. &#8220;The provision protects a citizen&#8217;s right to vote by forbidding a state actor from disqualifying a voter because of their failure to provide or error in providing some unnecessary information on a voting application or ballot,&#8221; Baxter wrote.</p>

The board made the referrals to prosecutors during its review of provisional and other ballots while working to certify the Nov. 7 election vote. Elections Director Laura Bruns told the board two people voted twice, first in early voting and then on Election Day. Another voter who was not registered but asked to vote Election Day was given a provisional ballot. She filled out the ballot and then ran the ballot through the ballot scanner instead of returning it to a poll worker for processing. The fourth voter referred was brought to the attention of election officials after she posted a message on social media describing how she had voted in the Troy election instead of Vandalia, where she now lives. Bruns said a poll worker brought a post to the elections’ staff attention. The poll book showed the woman voted on Election Day in Troy, Bruns said.</p>

The 10-page response, written on behalf of the town&#8217;s election commission and all current council members, said the municipal election commission (MEC) disregarded evidence presented for 16 challenged ballots that were submitted by voters whose residency was in question. The response admits Mayor Jake Evans, and Atlantic Beach Town Council, then dissolved the MEC to protect the integrity of the election process but did so &#8220;erroneously.&#8221; However, the response also asks the court to deny David&#8217;s two requests, which are granting emergency relief, and a petition for original jurisdiction for several reasons. The respondents wrote, &#8220;While the council realized its error and has since remedied the error, the circuit court is the proper venue for resolution.&#8221;</p>

AGA James R. Herring moved to drop the charges, writing in the court filing that Sean Mulligan, an assistant registrar in Prince William, had offered a different story about what transpired when he was re-interviewed in the past week. “During the interview yesterday in preparation for trial Mr. Mulligan conveniently and quite surprisingly provided a different version of events from that which he had previously provided to investigators,” Herring wrote in the Friday filing. “As a consequence, the Commonwealth is confronted with significant inconsistent statements made by a key Commonwealth’s witness.” The filing does not detail what Mulligan was going to testify to at trial or how his account had supposedly shifted. According to The Washington Post, Miyares’s office has never offered a full account of the allegations against White, but had accused her at an earlier hearing of altering the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state election reporting system known as VERIS so the vote totals from Prince William County were no longer accurate. White now only faces a single misdemeanor accusing her of willfully neglecting her duty.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/events/how-alaskas-electoral-reform-could-help-heal-divides-in-american-democracy/">Is Alaska the Secret to Saving American Democracy?</a>: American democracy is in crisis. The country has become deeply divided along partisan lines, causing Americans to turn against each other. Compromise has become scarce, while threats of political violence have risen. But there’s hope in an unlikely place: Alaska. In 2022, Alaska completed its first election under its new electoral system, known as “Final Four.” This electoral system consists of a nonpartisan, “top four” open primary, in which any individual regardless of political party affiliation can cast their vote for their preferred candidate in each race. The top four candidates then move on to the general election, where they are voted on via ranked choice voting. This reform provides voters with more choices in the primary election and a greater ability to express their preferences at the general election. Early results indicate this reform can decrease polarization and help incentivize consensus building and more bipartisan governing. Please join the Center for American Progress for a conversation about the impact of Alaska’s electoral reform, featuring three Alaska state legislators from across the political spectrum: state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel (R), state House Minority Leader Calvin Schrage (not affiliated), and state Rep. Genevieve Mina (D). <strong>When:</strong> Dec. 12, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</p>
