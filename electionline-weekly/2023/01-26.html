							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>It’s state Legislature season!<br />
</strong><em>LEOs are their best advocates in statehouses</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>State Legislatures across the country are back in session and there’s<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/us/politics/voting-rights-laws-states.html"> elections-related legislation</a> being introduced in just about every state.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9335" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/JustABill-300x274.png" alt="" width="300" height="274" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/JustABill-300x274.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/JustABill.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />From meetings to panel discussions to encouraging state legislators to get a hands-on look at how elections are run, state and local elections officials use a variety of tools in their advocacy toolkit to inform state legislators about the process.</p>
<p>“I think our legislators are called on to make difficult decisions about election administration, and I say this lovingly, but I think they all think they are election experts because they’ve been elected,” said<a href="https://www.ohiosos.gov/"> Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose</a> who previously served in the Ohio Senate and ushered numerous elections administration-related changes through the Legislatures. “They think they know how this stuff works but in many cases they really don’t.”</p>
<p>Just this week, election clerks in Michigan took a<a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-clerks-we-need-more-money-guidance-implement-early-voting"> pro-active step</a>. In November 2022, voters approved<a href="https://www.house.mi.gov/hfa/PDF/Alpha/Ballot_Proposal_2_of_2022.pdf"> Ballot Proposal 2</a> which will require them to provide nine days of early voting among other things. During a panel discussion hosted by Promote the Vote, advocacy group that got Prop. 2 on the ballot, city and county clerks addressed advocates and legislators, including<a href="https://www.house.mi.gov/Committee/HELEC"> House Elections Committee</a> Chair Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) about what they will need to implement the changes required by Prop. 2.</p>
<p>“I’m going to work with them to make sure that we implement Proposal 2 in all the ways that they said that they need the support,” Tsernoglou told MichiganLive.</p>
<p>Tsernoglou did not have a timeframe for when legislation may pass, “but I’ve already submitted bill requests for some of the things [clerks] talked about, and I plan to move forward quickly.”</p>
<p>After laws, rules and funding are in place, Barb Byrum,<a href="https://clerk.ingham.org/departments_and_officials/county_clerk/"> Ingham County</a> clerk told MichiganLive, local and county clerks can decide how to run their elections.</p>
<p>“Time is not on our side,” she urged. “This legislation needs to go quick.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-6020" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-300x268.png" alt="" width="213" height="190" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-300x268.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-1024x913.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted-768x685.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OHIVoted.png 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" />During his tenure in the Senate, LaRose who sort of became the go-to legislator on elections because of his military experience and advocacy on military and overseas voting, wanted to learn more about what elections officials did. He attempted to serve as a poll worker but when those efforts were thwarted he signed up to be an elections observer and ended up becoming a credentialed elections observer and observed elections in many counties throughout the state.</p>
<p>“It gave me good fodder for floor speeches when I could say, I was there at 1am and this process would go smoother if…” LaRose said.</p>
<p>Those experiences lead LaRose and Ohio local elections officials to create a “Take Your Legislator to Work Day” program where local boards of elections invited state legislators into their offices so they could peek behind the curtain so-to-speak to see how elections are actually administered.</p>
<p>While how the day played out was up to each county board of elections, a template agenda for the day recommended BOEs walk legislators through the absentee voting/ballot processing area, show IT improvements and discuss cybersecurity, demonstrate L&amp;A testing, provide plenty of time for Q&amp;A and emphasize the bipartisan nature of the BOEs.</p>
<p>This year, Ohio is going to try something a little different. Because none of the state legislators is on the ballot in 2023, LaRose is going to make an effort to get as many legislators serving as poll workers as possible. LaRose said in the coming weeks he plans on sending a letter to all members of the Legislature to encourage them to be poll workers. From there he hopes to get some early adopters and then do a full court press to get as many of them on board as possible.</p>
<p>“Other than a small handful them, most legislators don’t know how logic and accuracy testing works, they don’t know how provisional ballots work, they’ve just never experienced it,” LaRose said. “Our goal is that they will come away more knowledgeable and more confident with the security of election.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weberelections.gov/">Weber County, Utah</a> Clerk/Auditor Ricky Hatch has been at the forefront of working effectively with his state’s legislature—in fact, he was so busy in Salt Lake City this week, that didn’t have time to respond to questions we sent him!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9336" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UTPowerPT-300x179.png" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UTPowerPT-300x179.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UTPowerPT-1024x610.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UTPowerPT-768x457.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UTPowerPT-1536x915.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UTPowerPT.png 1756w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />He did send us a link to this<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=197009498163718&amp;ref=sharing"> absolutely fantastic video</a> he created on Facebook about lobbying the Legislature. In the video he talks about how being effective is really about being a good neighbor—not always automatically saying no to every piece of legislation, but working with the Legislature to get the right bills passed.</p>
<p>The County Clerks Association of Utah also has a “Legislation 101” PowerPoint to help explain the lobbying process and how to effectively communicate with legislators. The PowerPoint covers everything from the make-up of the Legislature to the best way to write an effective email to legislators.</p>
<p><strong>Advice from the National Conference of State Legislatures<br />
</strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5304" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png" alt="" width="300" height="127" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL-300x127.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NCSL.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/"> National Conference of State Legislatures</a> (NCSL) actively tracks more than 1,400 issue areas and conducts policy research in those areas including elections. NCSL also tracks elections-related legislation and is a great resource for state and local elections officials to find what’s happening in their state—not always an easy task!—and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Amanda Zoch, PhD, project manager, Elections &amp; Redistricting for NCSL  has some advice for state and local elections officials on how to effectively advocate on their own behalf with state Legislatures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> your state legislature and its legislative process. Understanding the legislative process in your state is critical because it determines the timing and flow of bills through the legislature. Keep in mind, too, that most legislators are generalists with many competing priorities and that some constraints—like term limits—may affect their ability to develop deep policy knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Consider</strong> your role as an advocate for elections, not just an elections administrator. That doesn’t necessarily mean advocating for specific policies or legislation (though it might), but rather using your role to advocate for the importance of the electoral process and the work done by your office.</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong> relationships with key legislators (those in your district, chairs of the elections committees, and legislative champions of election issues). This will take patience and persistence, but even in a hyperpartisan world, your allies may surprise you.</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong> in the legislative process. During session, pay attention to the election committee’s schedule and—if you have comments on a bill—reach out to the relevant committee members before the scheduled hearing. Go to the hearings of bills that will affect election administration and consider testifying in relation to a bill—that could entail explaining how the changes would affect your office. Sometimes that practical, on the ground perspective can be illuminating for policymakers.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate</strong> effectively. Legislators’ attention is limited, so you must be clear and concise when talking about elections. Avoid jargon, including acronyms and other insider knowledge. Have specific, rather than general requests, and be prepared. Especially when advocating for or against legislation, be prepared to explain the problem and the specific solution you’d like to see. Arm yourself with useful anecdotes, data and financial information, and take the time to anticipate legislators’ questions (or objections) and have answers at the ready.</li>
</ul>

Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom has certified an application for a petition that, if successful, would<a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2023/01/23/signature-drive-begins-to-rid-alaska-of-ranked-choice-voting/"> get rid of the state’s ranked choice voting system</a> and non-partisan primary. Sponsor Art Mathias wants to go back to the traditional election, where a candidate from each officially recognized party has a spot on the general election ballot in each race. Alaska voters adopted the new voting system in 2020 and used it for the first time in 2022. Proponents of ranked choice voting and the non-partisan primary say the new system tends to produce consensus candidates as it curbs extremism on the left and right. Fans say it encourages civil discourse and gives candidates an incentive to appeal beyond their base of voters. Mathias’s group, Alaskans for Honest Elections, is now waiting for its petition booklets and then will have a year to collect nearly 27,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot in 2024. The group plans to launch its campaign with an event on Feb. 16. Separately, conservative Republican Kelly Tshibaka announced Monday that she’s launched a different group, Preserve Democracy, to combat ranked choice voting in Alaska and around the country.</p>

Allen said he hoped to pick on two efforts from a year earlier dealing with paper ballots and the connectivity of voting machines. &#8220;There were a couple of bills last year that we ran out of time on, that we didn&#8217;t get to during the last regular session in 2022,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And two of those, State Senator Clyde Chambliss had. And I think we&#8217;ll approach again, and we&#8217;ll get behind. Number one is that we&#8217;ll always have paper ballots in Alabama. We want to put that in the state statute. It&#8217;s in the administrative code now, but we want to make sure we strengthen that and want to make sure we always have paper ballots because it is receipts, basically. And you can go back and check if something looks funny. Always have paper ballots &#8211; that&#8217;s important.&#8221; &#8220;Also, put in the code that machines will never be connected or have the ability to be connected to the internet through Bluetooth or any modems or anything that &#8212; any of the tabulating machines or whatnot that actually take in the ballots,&#8221; Allen continued. &#8220;None of that can be connected or have the capability of being connected to the internet.&#8221; &#8220;So, those two bills, I think, will receive some top priority of attention,&#8221; he added.</p>

The committee voted to pass to the house floor<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78420"> HB2308</a>, a bill that would deem it illegal for the Arizona secretary of state to oversee and confirm the results of an election in which they are a candidate. The bill, presented by Representative Rachel Jones, a Republican from Tucson, states that the secretary of state would instead have to publicly appoint someone to take on those duties. The committee unanimously voted to pass along<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78487"> HB3278</a>, a bill prohibiting the secretary of state, county supervisors, county recorders and all other election officers from associating in any way with political action committees. “This really just brings trust back to the election process,” said bill sponsor Leo Biasiucci, the Republican majority leader and a representative from Lake Havasu City. The committee split along party lines regarding<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78441"> HB2319</a> a bill that would tell judges to &#8220;aggressively&#8221; favor an election-law interpretation that provides greater transparency. Kolodin, the bill’s sponsor, said he hopes the bill will simplify “sloppily written” laws he said are indiscernible to well-practiced attorneys, let alone average citizens.<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/78444"> HB2322</a> states that the signature on a ballot envelope must be compared with the signature in an elector’s registration record. Those guidelines should be the minimum requirement for verification.</p>

Currently, the language prevents county clerks and local election officials or &#8220;other local governing body&#8221; administering an election from accepting any money from private parties or items with a value exceeding $100. The amendment adds that no official or employee from the state may accept money to administer an election either. The House State Affairs Committee unanimously voted to introduce the legislation.</p>

The legislation was amended so that misdemeanor offenses wouldn’t count — only felonies. But Democrats tried to remove the suffrage language altogether, with Republicans defending it. “Once a person has done their time, as with any other offense … whatever the crime may be, after they have served their time, we don’t continue to punish that person,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis. “Ten years is a long time.” Rep. Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson, pushed back: “I don’t know if we can characterize it as victimization. They’re not a victim. They’re an offender.” Both sides agreed that voter fraud cases are very rare and the provision likely won’t be used often. It would only impact crimes committed after June 30.</p>

While voters who are sex offenders must cast absentee ballots if their precinct is located at a school, there currently is no such prohibition in place for polling precinct workers. The State Board of Election Commissioners issued an official recommendation this week to forward a draft bill to the Legislature that would put the ban in place. Lawmakers will convene April 10 for this year’s regular session. Board member Robin Hooter, the clerk of court for Rapides Parish, said parents are often encouraged to bring their children to vote so they can learn about the election process. This is why the prohibition on sex offenders as election commissioners is needed at all polling places, not just schools, she said. An official with the Secretary of State’s office told the board there have been instances where sex offenders have worked as election commissioners, but he did not indicate how many or where they worked.</p>

Matt Pouliot (R-Augusta) has introduced legislation that would require Mainers to show a<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/me/maine/news/2023/01/19/maine-republican-sponsors-bill-to-require-photo-id-to-vote"> photo ID</a> in order to vote. “A lot of the polling I’ve seen has really high levels of public support for the idea of having an ID to vote,” he said. “The idea being like you have to have an ID to get on a plane, why not to vote?” Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said proof of identity and residency is required when Mainers register to vote. Requiring a photo ID on Election Day is an unnecessary extra step, she said. The idea of requiring a photo ID to vote is not new in Maine. A Republican-led committee studied the concept in 2013, ultimately deciding that “the negative aspects of a voter ID law outweigh its potential benefits.” Pouliot said that fraud isn’t an issue in Maine, but said he feels that the extra step of requiring a photo ID to vote will reassure some of those with doubts. “The level of trust there is low,” he said. “I think at the end of the day what I would like to do is submit this bill and say I hope to increase trust in the Democratic process. Whether it’s a red herring argument or not, there can’t be an argument that this isn’t safe because everybody had their ID.” Pouliot’s bill would require the Secretary of State’s Office to set up a process so those who don’t already have a photo ID can get one for free. The bill lists a driver’s license, passport, military identification or permit to carry a concealed handgun as permissible types of ID. However, it excludes IDs issued by colleges and universities. Pouliot said he has another bill to require college students to register to vote where they file their applications for federal financial aid.</p>

The bill would create a permanent absentee voter list. For those voters who sign up, it would eliminate the step of filling out an application to request an absentee ballot and local officials would send the ballots straight to them in the mail. More than 26,000 Minnesota voters are already on a list to routinely receive the paperwork to apply for an absentee ballot ahead of an election. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, an attorney who focuses on election law, said there is often confusion about that list—people think by signing up, they&#8217;ll automatically receive an absentee ballot in the mail, like the bill proposes, but that doesn&#8217;t happen. Some communities with fewer than 400 registered voters conduct elections exclusively by mail, according to the secretary of state&#8217;s office. That means 150,000 Minnesotans already automatically get a ballot sent to them.</p>

The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Brattin, (R-Harrisonville), states that if registered voters do not engage in voter activity for two consecutive calendar years, the local election authority will investigate their qualifications and include them in the next canvass. A canvass could utilize a number of ways to reach voters, including by mail, house-to-house, the U.S. Postal Service or through the National Change of Address database. If the election authorities don’t hear back from the voter and they don’t vote in the next two general elections, which happen every two years, then they would become eligible to be taken off the list of registered voters under the proposed legislation. “We can always make this process better to ensure that the integrity of our vote is protected at all costs. And that’s what this does,” Brattin said. “It’s not disenfranchising voters, even though many will say that it is.”</p>

The Senate State Administration Committee on Wednesday voted 7-3 to send it to the full Senate. The bill was requested by former Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff Mangan, whose term ended at the end of 2022. In a Jan. 16 hearing on the bill, Mangan said his proposal was in response to anecdotal accounts he’s heard over the past two years from Montana’s election workers, some of whom have felt targeted by groups alleging election malfeasance. Regina Plettenberg had testified in support of the bill on behalf of the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders — the group representing county-level administrators of the state’s elections. Herself a Republican Clerk and Recorder in Ravalli County, Plettenberg told the committee that she had to call law enforcement to stop a group of poll watchers — people who are allowed to monitor election processes at the polls — from blocking voters who needed to cast provisional ballots.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are considering a bill that would<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/bill-would-ban-private-grant-funding-of-elections/article_a9b6622f-1eb2-5685-94cb-85b7d59c5b93.html"> ban grant funding</a> and other private money or services from being used by local officials to run elections, a practice that has come under intense scrutiny since the 2020 elections. Senate Bill 117 would ensure that local election offices are not influenced by outside funding, Darin Gaub, chairman of the Lewis and Clark County Republican Central Committee, told lawmakers during a hearing. “This is simply, in essence, a basic ethics bill,” Gaub told the Senate State Administration Committee. “I don’t believe any organization of any kind should be able to donate funds to assist and facilitate the elections … whether they mean to or not, you have the influence of impropriety.” The Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders, representing county election administrators, didn’t take a stance on the bill. But Regina Plettenberg, speaking for the group, did raise the possibility that language prohibiting donations of “personal services” could create issues for the volunteers that help out with local elections. Opposing the bill were the ACLU of Montana and the Blackfeet Tribe, arguing that it could jeopardize the ability of rural, reservation-based Native Americans to access satellite election offices. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade, said it&#8217;s the responsibility of local election offices to request sufficient funds from their county commissioners. The committee didn’t immediately vote on the measure, but it appeared to attract some bipartisan opposition from members of the Legislature’s American Indian Caucus.</p>
<p>During the House State Administration Hearing, a bill was heard that could<a href="https://www.kxlf.com/news/68th-session/proposed-law-could-change-vote-counting-procedures-in-future-montana-elections"> change the way votes are tallied in local, state, and federal elections</a> going forward by requiring all votes to be counted without adjourning, once counting starts and requiring that any official vote count must be open to public observation. Representative Lyn Hellegaard, a Republican from Missoula, sponsored House Bill 196 to bring back a portion of a law (SB 162, Section 13-15-101) that was changed during the 2019 legislative session that allows vote counting to be paused overnight and resume the next day. Dana Corson, Elections Director for the Montana Secretary of State&#8217;s office, spoke in support of the bill, saying if passed he believes it would lead to election results being published faster. However, election officials in Gallatin and Flathead Counties and the legislative chair for the Montana Association of Clerks and Recorders testified in opposition to the bill. Their main concerns regarded staffing shortages, the possibility of working for days at a time, and the inability to start counting ballots early, as provided in SB 162, due to HB 196&#8217;s language. &#8220;Lots of people signed up to the election judges, work at the polls, to help here in the office: opening and sorting ballots, doing all those processes. We had big crews of those people, but when it comes to 2 a.m. in the morning, those same people are not really willing to stay around. And so my, my crew here is at the end of their capabilities, and there just isn&#8217;t those temporary workers to be able to support the processes that we have to do,&#8221; said Eric Semerad, Gallatin County Clerk and Recorder.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2023/bills/sb-153/">Senate Bill 153</a>, sponsored by Sen. Brad Molnar (R-Laurel), would reverse 2021’s House Bill 651, a bill passed in the latter days of the last session that expanded the Legislature and state attorney general’s role in reviewing proposed statutory and constitutional ballot initiatives before they go before voters.  While proponents of HB 651 argued that it placed needed sideboards on the initiative process, Molnar said Monday that the law places unfair — and illegal — obstacles in the path of those who wish to put an issue on the ballot.</p>

Justin Wayne of Omaha, at a press conference sponsored by the Voting Rights Restoration Coalition. About 20,000 Nebraskans cannot vote because they are serving time in prison, are on parole for a felony crime or have not completed the current two-year waiting period to regain their rights to vote, serve on a jury or run for public office. Wayne, who chairs the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, has introduced a measure this year, Legislative Bill 20, that would restore felons’ voting rights as soon as they complete their prison or parole sentence. Felons who have completed their sentences said at Friday’s press conference that the loss of voting rights disproportionately affects communities of color and leaves reformed felons, who now have jobs and own homes, “marginalized.” Also introduced this year was a proposed constitutional amendment, LR 4CA, from Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh. It would do away with the clause that requires convicted felons to lose their voting rights at any time. Only those convicted of treason would lose their right to vote under the proposal, which would require voter approval.</p>

Tribes also want to revise voting laws to make sure tribes<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/bills-would-help-native-americans-in-nevada-2716513/"> automatically get a polling location in their community</a>. If a tribe does not want a polling location, then it can opt out, Melendez said. As the law exists, tribes have to request a polling location, but some clerks are not honoring that request, Teresa Melendez, CEO of Tall Tree Consulting, which helps Nevada tribes connect with legislators said.</p>
<p>Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) is<a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/politics/nevada-gov-lombardo-proposes-election-day-mail-in-voting-deadline-voter-id/"> proposing a change in the state’s election laws</a> to end the counting of mail-in ballots by the close of business on Election Day. “The right to vote is one of the most fundamental rights in American society,” the governor said in his first State of the State Address. “It is not only important that the process itself has integrity but also that the people of Nevada have confidence that the process is free and fair.” Nevada law allows mail-in ballots to be accepted for four days after an election. The change in the law, passed and signed by former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, was a compromise and changed from seven days. The law also required Nevadans to opt-out rather than opt-in to receive a mail-in ballot. “Sending ballots to more than 1.9 million registered voters is inefficient and unnecessary,” he said. “Not to mention, it’s estimated to cost nearly $7 million dollars in this budget and will increase to over $11 million dollars in future budgets.” The governor also proposed a voter identification process. He also called for a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional and legislative districts.</p>

That bill, which would have eliminated “open primaries” and ended New Hampshire’s tradition of unaffiliated voters participating in one party’s primary and then registering as undeclared, was recommended “inexpedient to legislate,” 19-0.

The bill would mandate that students provide a copy of their tuition bill, and requires that public universities and community colleges provide the Secretary of State’s Office a list of students receiving in-state tuition. That bill would require college students to follow different residency rules than other New Hampshire residents; currently all residents may vote as long as they reside in the state as of Election Day and plan to remain residents for the foreseeable future. But students must be residents of the state for 12 continuous months in New Hampshire before they qualify for in-state tuition.</p>

The Assembly State and Local Government Committee last week approved bills that would require the state to pay for postage on applications to receive mail-in ballots and on the ballots themselves. Under the bills, the state would directly pay postage for mail ballot applications, while counties would initially pay for postage on actual ballots and later be reimbursed by the state. Under New Jersey’s current system, there is little uniformity in who bears the cost of mailing ballots across counties. While some counties — Camden, Monmouth, and Essex, among others — already pay for mail-in ballots postage, most counties do not. “Paying for the postage — why would we not do that? To me, it’s all common sense,” said Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden), the chamber’s majority leader and prime sponsor of<a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A4948"> the bill</a> requiring the state to pay postage on vote-by-mail applications.</p>

John Block  has introduced House Bill 110, which would require voters to provide a driver’s license or Motor Vehicles Division-issued<a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/legislature/first-week-of-session-brings-array-of-bills/article_6b9317cc-98ea-11ed-ae6c-6f41676c5ba4.html"> ID to vote in-person</a>, and either one of these or their Social Security number to vote by mail. His bill would require the MVD to provide, free of charge, xerox copies of voter identification cards so voters can mail those in with their ballots. The bill would also waive the $5 fee (for four years) or $10 fee (for 10 years) for registered voters to obtain voter identification cards. In an interview, Block, R-Alamogordo, told the New Mexican he believes HB 110 would “add just one more layer to ensure our elections are trusted and valid — and at the end of the day we know exactly what we did in that voting booth because we proved who we were when we went to vote.” He said New Mexicans need ID “to check into a hotel, to get married, to buy alcohol, to buy a pack of cigarettes” so his bill makes sense. HB 110 has been referred to the House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee. As of Friday, it had not been placed on the committee’s agenda.</p>
<p>A  filibuster killed election legislation at the Roundhouse in the final hours of last year’s session. But with more time this year, Democrats are set to introduce<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2567409/democrats-launch-new-campaign-for-nm-voting-rights-bill.html"> new legislation</a> that would, among other things: Phasing in a system of automatic voter registration, such as during MVD transactions, for citizens who are qualified to vote but aren’t registered. Supporters say it would include an opt-out for those who don’t want to register, similar to what’s used in Colorado; Creation of a permanent absentee voter list. Voters would have the option of opting in to receive ballots by mail before every election rather than having to apply each time; Establishing a Native American Voting Rights Act intended to better coordinate access to the polls on tribal land and allow the use of tribal buildings as a voter-registration address for people without a traditional address; and Automatic restoration of voting rights for inmates exiting prison. Under the current system, they must complete probation or parole before registering to vote again. According to the Albuquerque Journal, the bill doesn’t include some of the ideas that triggered intense opposition in last year’s debate, such as allowing 16-year-olds to vote in school and city elections.</p>

In a one-two punch, the Brooklyn NAACP is seeking to overturn the ban in federal court. The proposal is part of a wave of legislation in Democratic-led states to make voting easier in response to Republican attempts to restrict access to the polls, and attacks by Donald Trump and his supporters on recent election losses.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, there’s little research to support the idea that so-called line-warming bans have much effect on voting, but they make for a stark visual image among Democrats seeking to criticize the Republican bills. New York Senator Zellnor Myrie, the bill’s sponsor, said voters can lose their place in line if they leave to get a “simple glass of water.” “In New York State, despite continued progress on making our elections more accessible, certain polling locations continue to have massive lines,” he said in a statement. “Voting should not be an endurance test and allowing organizations to provide nominal refreshments will help protect their franchise until voting is no longer a burden.”</p>

Senate Bill 2157 would allow people to show a<a href="https://www.kxnet.com/news/state-news/north-dakota-lawmakers-consider-voter-id-requirements/"> valid passport as proof of citizenship</a> at the polls. A spokesperson from North Dakota’s American Civil Liberties Union testified on Thursday after they found some voters had been turned away at a Cass County precinct in 2020. The state department of transportation said it ended up being a computer glitch which was corrected. “As I read the bill, it’s providing more options, but I don’t think it’s taking any away,” Senator Bob Paulson said.  So far, the bill is still being held in committee while more information is gathered.</p>
<p>A bill introduced in the House of Representatives seeks to alter the way votes are tallied and if approved, would<a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/fargo/fargo-mayor-objects-north-dakota-bill-that-would-strike-approval-voting-system"> prohibit rank-choice voting and approval voting systems</a> throughout the state of North Dakota, including Fargo.  Rep.

Andy Fugate announced that he filed a<a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/andy-fugate-oklahoma-election-reform-bills-absentee-ballot-errors-closed-primaries-election-day-party-affiliation-del-city-democrat-2023-legislative-session-politics-voting-house-bill-joint-resolution"> series of bills</a> that he says would improve election laws in Oklahoma. House Bill 1902, a carryover bill from the 2022 Legislative Session, would allow absentee voters to cast provisional ballots to correct absentee ballot errors. Legally cast votes are currently discarded when a voter makes a clerical error on their absentee ballot. Fugate’s bill would allow voters to cast a provisional ballot on election day that would be counted only if their absentee ballot is rejected.  “All voters deserve to have their voices heard at the ballot box. Free and fair elections must include all legally cast votes,&#8221; said Fugate, a Democrat. HB 1916 and HB 1917 are also carryover bills and address issues where Oklahoma voters are not allowed to elect their own representatives. Fugate said although there were 125 open legislative seats in 2022, just 38 of them appeared on the general election ballot. HB 1916 would require single-party races to advance the top two candidates from the primary to the general election. HB 1917 would have unopposed candidates stand for retention just like statewide judicial officers. Fugate also filed HB 1918, a new proposal that would require Oklahoma’s political parties to pay for the cost of closed primary elections. Fugate also filed HJR 1022 to create a state question where voters can decide whether to remove party affiliation from future ballots. Fugate said he&#8217;s proposing that in response to a request from a Libertarian constituent in his district.</p>

Currently certain actions are prohibited by state law, but there are no penalties for violations. There is a statute that says in those cases, violations are deemed to be Class 2 misdemeanors, but it does not apply to election statutes and several other titles. Attorney General Marty Jackley has introduced Senate Bill 47 to<a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/politics/2023-01-19/ag-wants-prosecution-power-in-election-law"> remove election laws from exception</a>. “We are just simply asking for that slight change to allow us to be able to prosecute crimes that the legislature has already said that are crimes, but we just don’t have an enforcement power,” he said. Jackley said some offenses, such as a public official using taxpayer dollars to influence an election or the submission of false absentee ballots in the name of unregistered or deceased people, deserve more than a Class 2 misdemeanor. Senate Bill 47 applies to Title 12, made up of 27 chapters covering issues such as campaign finance requirements, vote counts and recounts, primary elections, voter registration, and duties of the State Board of Elections, county auditors, and the Secretary of State. Sen. David Wheeler voted against the bill. He said he likes the idea of putting teeth in election law, but SB 47 is too broad and could result in criminal charges for workers doing their jobs. The bill now goes to the full Senate.</p>

Then take those ballots and now they count the second-place votes and add them to the prior votes, so in the second round someone may get a majority of votes. At that point in time, they win the election.&#8221; Other ranked-choice voting-related bills filed during the 88th Texas Legislative session include:<a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB1444/id/2650469/Texas-2023-HB1444-Introduced.html"> HB 1444</a>, which proposes enabling military and overseas voters to use RCV so their right to vote is not affected by delays in receiving ballots for runoff elections and<a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB1112/id/2620216/Texas-2023-HB1112-Introduced.html"> HB 1112</a>, which suggests adopting RCV to help sort through multiple candidates in primary elections</p>

The committee recommended for passage House Bill 2038, referring instances of election fraud to the attorney general for prosecution. The bill now heads to the House Judiciary Committee. HB 2038 would allow the Secretary of State’s Office to refer cases of potential election fraud to the Attorney General’s Office if a county prosecuting attorney has declined to prosecute a case after a 60-day review. According to a fiscal note, the bill would cost $285,000 and require the Attorney General to hire two attorneys and a paralegal. According to the state Constitution and state code, the Attorney General has no criminal prosecution powers. State code only allows the Attorney General to assist county prosecutors in criminal matters if a circuit judge or a justice of the state Supreme Court of Appeals deems it necessary. Anne Charnock, an attorney for the committee, said the bill doesn’t address that issue. Donald “Deak” Kersey, general counsel for the Secretary of State’s Office, said the bill was needed to provide assistance to county prosecutors who may wish to prosecute election fraud cases but might not have the resources or manpower necessary.</p>

The bill would have let municipalities run their own &#8220;ranked choice&#8221; elections for nonpartisan local races — like city council and mayoral races. In a ranked choice election, voters rank their top choices for a given seat. If their number one choice doesn&#8217;t win, their vote can count for their second choice candidate. But opponents like Secretary of State Chuck Gray said ranked choice elections are confusing. &#8220;As written, House Bill 49 opens the door to a convoluted, confusing and needlessly expensive voting process which is antithetical to Wyoming&#8217;s uniform procedures for elections while posing immediate logistical and fiscal complications,&#8221; Gray said. Gray also said establishing local ranked choice elections would be expensive because it would involve running the ranked choice nonpartisan municipal election alongside, but on a separate ballot from, the other partisan or federal races. But that expense wouldn&#8217;t be paid by the state. The additional equipment and other expenses involved in running a ranked choice election would have been paid by the communities who decided to use ranked choice. The bill<a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/news/2022-10-17/lawmakers-advance-pilot-program-for-ranked-choice-voting-in-nonpartisan-city-races"> had been endorsed by the Joint Corporations committee in October</a>, but it died Friday, Jan. 20, on a 3-6 vote.</p>
<p>2022 was the first major election — with all five of Wyoming’s executive branch offices on the ballot — that required Wyoming residents to show identification to cast an in-person vote. While several types of identification are currently acceptable, two bills aim to add concealed carry permits to the list. <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0079"> House Bill 79 – Voter I.D.-concealed carry permit</a> and<a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0086"> Senate File 86 – Voter identification-concealed carry permit</a> were drafted independently, according to Rep. Barry Crago (R-Buffalo), who is sponsor of the House version. Without a significant difference between the two bills, Crago said he would be content with either crossing the finish line. Senate File 86 passed third reading in the Senate on Tuesday while House Bill 79 was unanimously approved by the House Agriculture, State and Public Lands, and Water Resources Committee that morning.  Crago’s bill came from a constituent request while Sen. Lynn Hutchings (R-Cheyenne) said she brought SF 86 after election workers wouldn’t let her vote in the primary election using her concealed carry permit. <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0156">House Bill 156</a> would eliminate Medicaid and Medicare insurance cards as acceptable forms of ID to vote.</p>
<p>House Bills 103 and 141 as well as Senate File 163 would<a href="https://wyofile.com/voter-id-requirements-crossover-voting-return-to-legislature/"> prohibit voters from changing party affiliation</a> for the primary election any time after the nomination period opens for candidates — that day falls 96 days ahead of the primary election, per state statute. House Bill 207 would prohibit voters from changing party affiliation anytime during the 14 days ahead of the primary election.</p>
<p>Wyoming’s current voter ID law does not apply to absentee voting.<a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0219"> House Bill 219 – Voter identification-ballot requests</a> would change that by requiring voters to show an ID when applying for an absentee ballot. If applying in writing or over the phone, voters would be required to provide the county clerk with a copy of their ID either by mail, email or “other secure electronic means.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0211">House Bill 211 – Ballot harvesting</a> would specify how an absentee ballot can be delivered to the county clerk. Current state statute allows absentee ballots to be “mailed or delivered to the clerk” but does not provide any other details. The minimal guideline in statute is what drew one Democrat to co-sponsor the bill. The bill would keep the mail-in option but would add requirements to the hand-delivery process. That includes requiring any absentee ballot voter to fill out a form to designate a person if someone other than the voter is returning their ballot. Additionally, such a person could only return two absentee ballots in any one election. That restriction, however, would not apply to immediate family members, which the bill defines as a spouse, parent, sibling, child or other blood relative living in the individual’s household.</p>

Fox argues it was vigorously reporting newsworthy allegations from inherently newsworthy people. The legal teams for Dominion and Fox filed rival motions before Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis earlier this month: in Dominion&#8217;s case to find that Fox had defamed the company ahead of the April trial, in Fox&#8217;s to dismiss all or much of the claims. Those motions contained hundreds of pages of documents cataloguing the findings from the so-called &#8220;discovery&#8221; process. In the joint filing, NPR and The New York Times note they do not know the contents of the materials and therefore do not know whether there are instances in which public disclosure could do either side harm. They therefore ask Judge Davis &#8220;to ensure the parties meet their high burden to justify sealing information which goes to the heart of very public and significant events.&#8221; The documents will help the public determine &#8220;whether Defendants published false statements with actual malice and whether the lawsuit was filed to chill free speech,&#8221; reads the filing by attorney Joseph C.

McBurney said he was considering whether to release the report after hearing arguments from prosecutors, who urged it be kept secret until they decide whether to file any charges, and a coalition of media organizations, which pressed for its release. He said he would further reflect on the parties’ arguments and would reach out with any questions before making a final decision. He also said he anticipated his eventual decision would be appealed. The report is expected to include recommendations for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on possible criminal prosecution. If McBurney decides to disseminate the report, as the special grand jury urged, he must also determine whether any parts of it should be redacted.</p>

Justices sought an accounting for 706 ballots that county elections staff decided were questionable and therefore didn’t count them in the recent General Election. Results of the council’s Wailuku-Waiheʻe-Waikapū residency area race show incumbent Alice Lee had 513 votes over challenger Noelani Ahia. After the Nov. 8 election, Ahia and 30 Maui County voters<a href="https://mauinow.com/2022/11/26/contest-filed-to-void-election-results-of-the-wailuku-council-race/"> filed a complaint</a> to contest the outcome, pointing to “irregularities and mistakes” in the processing of hundreds of deficient mail-in ballots. They want the election invalidated and a new one held. The court will now decide if the existing election will stand or if a new election will be held. Some justices alluded to another scenario: Deficient ballots being cured and counted after the fact.</p>

The lawsuit started as a dispute over public records and grew into a challenge over use of internet modems in voting machines in the county and across the state. Hanks ruled this week that the lawsuit was filed against the wrong county official, and she does not have jurisdiction in the broader challenge. “We are pleased that the court recognized that this lawsuit was completely misguided,” Anne Goering, the attorney representing Rice County in the case, told the Daily News. “It is unfortunate that a great deal of time and public money was spent defending against this frivolous case.” The lawsuit named Denise Anderson, Rice County’s elections director, as the defendant. Hanks’ ruling said Anderson cannot be legally liable in the public records claim. Hanks ruled the lawsuit was not valid, because it should have instead been filed against the county administrator. The suit claimed the county failed to provide all documents requested by Hagen and Benda. Goering countered that the plaintiffs were unwilling to accept the county’s response that the requested documents did not exist.</p>

In the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/winnebago-v-thurston-complaint-usdc-nebraska/"> complaint</a>, filed last week in the U.S. District Court for Nebraska, the tribes allege the Thurston County Board of Supervisors did not provide American Indian voters with proper notice and an opportunity to review a proposed redistricting plan before it was adopted.  The redistricting plan was not provided to the public or the tribes before the Jan. 3, 2022, meeting in which the board voted to adopt it, the complaint says. &#8220;Instead, it was only made available to the public after its adoption.&#8221; Two members of the Omaha Tribe and seven members of the Winnebago tribe also joined the suit as plaintiffs. According to the complaint, white people hold five of seven defendant Board of Supervisor seats, despite comprising about 36% of the county&#8217;s total population and 43% of the voting age population. The<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/thurstoncountynebraska/PST045222#PST045222"> 2020 Census</a> found nearly 60% of Thurston County&#8217;s population was American Indian. The American Indian population in Thurston County is large and geographically compact enough to constitute a majority in at least 4 districts, the complaint says.  Plaintiffs are seeking an order declaring the redistricting plan violates the Voting Rights Act. The defendants are the county, the board, the seven supervisors who make up the board and the Thurston County Clerk.</p>

Until the beginning of this year, a majority of justices on the the North Carolina Supreme Court were Democrats. The court threw out the state&#8217;s voter ID law and decided legislative leaders used unconstitutional gerrymandering when redrawing political maps for congressional districts and General Assembly seats. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for voter ID to be law, as the people of North Carolina have demanded,&#8221; he said. The court&#8217;s Democratic majority, in a 4-3 decision, threw out the state&#8217;s voter ID law on Dec. 16, with just weeks to go before Republicans took over as the majority on the court. Republicans now have a 5-2 majority on the court and could potentially hear the case on voter ID again. The court could also reopen the case on redistricting. &#8220;Holmes was wrongly decided based on a predetermined outcome. We now have a chance to right this wrong and deliver on voter ID, which the voters of this state overwhelmingly support,&#8221; said Sam Hayes, general counsel for the House speaker.</p>

Committee chairman Clay Breece said they&#8217;re seeking to overturn a December 6 court order that denied their request for a manual recount in 30 precincts within Berks County. Breece asserted that the state election code allows for a manual re-count of all ballots cast, including mail-in, absentee and provisional. The committee filed the appeal in Commonwealth Court earlier this month. Breece stated his office received numerous complaints from voters in the November election that voting machines weren&#8217;t functioning properly. The initial petition was filed on behalf of 94 people who alleged voting machines were changing votes cast for Republican candidates to Democrats on the ballot. The county addressed the issue at a November election board meeting and found that the design of voting machine screens could make it possible for a person to accidentally select the wrong candidate. At that meeting, Commissioner Christian Leinbach said he is seeking answers to determine if the screens can be changed for the May 2023 primary. There is no word on when the court will make a decision on the appeal.</p>

The lawsuits allege Paxton’s opinion violates state and federal law, contradicts his own previous direction on the issue and exposes local elections administrators to potential criminal charges. According to The Texas Tribune, For decades, the attorney general’s office advised counties that voted ballots were to be kept secure for 22 months after an election, a time frame mandated by federal law and Texas state election code. But only months before the November 2022 general election, even though neither law had changed, Paxton released an opinion saying the documents could be released to anyone who requested them, almost right after the ballots were counted. Now, counties and election officials across the state are stuck. They can follow Paxton’s new opinion — which is only a written interpretation of the law — and potentially open themselves up to criminal penalties for violating state law, or they can defy the state attorney general and open up themselves to costly lawsuits. That’s why now the counties are asking a judge to step in and settle the question.</p>

The court ruled that the 2018 city charter change does not violate the Vermont Constitution, which does restrict voting in statewide contests to citizens. Montpelier City Council President Jack McCullough told VTDigger that the initiative began when town residents noticed that it was “not fair” that some noncitizen residents who paid taxes and participated in the community “were not allowed to vote on on the local elections and the local issues that affected their lives.” About 11,000 Vermonters are not United States citizens, according to the Census. The charter change required noncitizens to be legal residents of the U.S. in order to be eligible to vote. Montpelier voters supported the change by an almost two-to-one margin in 2018, but the measure has since had a long journey toward implementation. The state Legislature approved the change in 2021, only for Gov. Phil Scott to veto the measure. The Legislature then overturned Scott’s veto that same year. Two Montpelier residents who are citizens and eight citizens who live elsewhere in the state — challenged the law. In April 2022, a Washington County Superior Court judge rejected the plaintiff&#8217;s arguments that noncitizen voting was a violation of the Vermont Constitution. Friday’s Supreme Court decision upholds that ruling. The Supreme Court ruled that the parties had standing to challenge the charter change because eligible voters had an “interest” in ensuring the voter pool was constitutional to “preserve the effectiveness of their vote.” But when it comes to the legality of the charter change itself, the court’s decision said that legal precedent and a close reading of Chapter II, Section 42 of the Vermont Constitution proved that local election qualifications can be different from statewide election qualifications.</p>

The case was brought by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin last fall, weeks before the midterm election. The crux of the lawsuit, and another similar pending case, rests with how much of a witness address needs to be present in order for an absentee ballot to count. The bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission hasn’t said what constitutes a missing address. But it has issued guidance on what constitutes an address, saying it must contain three elements: a street number, street name and municipality. “There’s no definition of missing out there, which means (the election commission) is failing the clerks, it’s failing the people of Wisconsin by not determining what it should mean for purposes of ballot counting,” argued Dan Lenz, an attorney for the League of Women Voters. Trammell said following brief oral arguments this week that she intends to issue a written ruling within a month.</p>
