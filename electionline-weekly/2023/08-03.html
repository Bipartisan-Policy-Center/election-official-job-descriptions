														<p><strong>CSG, The Turnout launch new initiative with Microsoft support</strong><br />
<em>Initiative designed to increase voter confidence</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.csg.org/">The Council of State Governments</a> recently announced a partnership with its longtime collaborator in the election space, <a href="https://turnout.rocks/">The Turnout</a>, to form the Election Technology Initiative (ETI). The ETI will support and develop open-source technologies for election administrators to improve the security and transparency of <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9994" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.40.02-PM-300x204.png" alt="" width="300" height="204" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.40.02-PM-300x204.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.40.02-PM.png 418w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />U.S. and international elections as well as increase voter confidence, accessibility, and participation.</p>
<p>“State election officials are among the heroes of our democracy. They consistently carry out free and fair elections with professionalism and integrity. With the leadership of<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/28/council-of-state-governments-election-technology-initiative-electionguard/"> Microsoft</a>, election officials now have new tools to assure citizens that their vote counts,” said David Adkins, executive director/CEO of The Council of State Governments. “CSG is proud to launch the Election Technology Initiative in partnership with The Turnout to enhance voter confidence in elections.”</p>
<p>The initiative will begin with the transition of <a href="http://www.electionguard.vote/">ElectionGuard</a>, the open-source software program developed by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/democracy-forward?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5">Microsoft’s Democracy Forward Initiative</a>, to the ETI. ElectionGuard provides voting system vendors and election administrators the capability to perform end-to-end verifiable elections and post-election audits. ETI will provide the governance structure of the ElectionGuard codebase and oversee its implementation of <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9995" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.40.52-PM-300x81.png" alt="" width="300" height="81" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.40.52-PM-300x81.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.40.52-PM.png 428w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />end-to-end verifiability. RC Carter will join The Turnout and continue to lead the project. Dr. Josh Benaloh, one of the core and earliest contributors of the cryptographic foundations ElectionGuard is based upon, will continue to serve as principal technical advisor to the project and oversee the ElectionGuard specification, and Microsoft Research will continue to contribute important implementations of the specification and codebase.</p>
<p>“The Turnout is excited to partner with CSG on the Election Technology Initiative to bring additional layers <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6165" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Microsoft-300x70.png" alt="" width="300" height="70" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Microsoft-300x70.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Microsoft.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />of accountability, accessibility, and transparency to elections; building on the foundation that Microsoft set for us,” said Jared Marcotte, president of The Turnout. “We’re also happy to announce that RC Carter will be joining our team of election technology experts. It’s a rare gift to have someone who’s been with a project since its inception, has a clear and specific vision for its growth and development, can liaise and manage the various development teams, and can effortlessly explain a highly technical project to any audience. That’s RC.”</p>
<p>ElectionGuard was announced at Microsoft BUILD in 2018. Its first public election occurred in Fulton, Wisconsin, in February 2020 with VotingWorks. After a partnership with Hart InterCivic announced in July 2021, ElectionGuard was used in the November 2022 General Election in Franklin County, Idaho, in conjunction with Hart, Enhanced Voting, MITRE, and the Center for Civic Design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9996" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.42.36-PM-300x52.png" alt="" width="300" height="52" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.42.36-PM-300x52.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.42.36-PM-1024x177.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.42.36-PM-768x133.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.42.36-PM.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“At Microsoft, we are working with our partners to create technology solutions that can safeguard the electoral process around the world. Four years ago, we launched ElectionGuard as a new open-source contribution to the development of secure, transparent, and accessible voting systems,” said Ginny Badanes, senior director of Microsoft’s Democracy Forward program. “Today, we are transitioning ElectionGuard to the Election Technology Initiative so they can continue this important work. With Microsoft’s ongoing support, CSG and The Turnout are the right team of trusted experts to advance ElectionGuard’s mission of empowering voters to verify that their vote counted.”</p>
<p><strong>What is End-to-end Verifiability?</strong><br />
End-to-end verifiability (e2e-v) uses advanced cryptography and security software to create a public encrypted copy of the tally and of each ballot used in an election. Voters can verify that their ballots were included in the final tally and independent verifiers can be built to confirm the tallies derived by the ballots are correctly counted.</p>
<p>E2e-v is the only mechanism other than paper ballots that allow for software independence, a key requirement of systems certified under the Election Assistance Commission’s Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 standards. It’s also the only technology that can achieve software independence across both paper-and non-paper-based systems, which makes it a critical enabler of additional voting methods and improving accessibility generally. ElectionGuard is currently the only comprehensive end-to-end verifiability system under development in the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>Election Workers’ Perceptions of Election Security in Rural Wisconsin</strong></p>
<p>Melissa A. Kono, associate professor<br />
University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9913" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-230x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-230x300.png 230w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-784x1024.png 784w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-768x1003.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal.png 836w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />Election workers are directly responsible for ensuring elections are conducted fairly and securely, so their abilities to do so are crucial. Election workers play an important role in the election process by verifying voter information, issuing ballots, and counting ballots when the polls close. These “street level bureaucrats” interact with voters and decide who is allowed to vote on Election Day and ultimately whether that vote is counted (Alvarez 2006; Hall, 2009: Suttman-Lea 2019). These crucial duties rest in the hands of dedicated election workers who are essentially infrequent volunteers, and “despite their important role in elections, we know surprisingly little about how recruitment and training of poll workers translates into performance” (Burden and Milyo, 2015).</p>
<p>While the effects election workers have on elections have been examined (Alvarez and Hall, 2006, 2008; Barreto, Marks and Woods, 2004; Suttmann-Lea, 2019), research is lacking on poll workers’ perceptions of election administration, and specifically, their concerns, if any, on election security, which now receives considerable attention. That is, are only the votes of eligible voters being counted on election night, and what, if any, interference is there in the election process?<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/journal/documents/JEARP-volume02-issue01-election-workers'-perceptions-of-election-security-in-rural-wisconsin.pdf"> Read more…</a></p>

They wrote in the 16-page report that the problems didn’t show up in pre-election testing or during early voting, and the manual for the printers gave “conflicting information” about which types of paper the printers could handle. The manufacturer argues that its manual for the printers is clear that you can’t use them to print double-sided on such thick paper, according to two letters the company recently sent to the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office.<a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/local/glenn-county-supervisors-discuss-potentially-eliminating-dominion-voting-machines"> In Glenn County, California</a>, the board of supervisors is discussing eliminating its Dominion voting machines and moving to a hand-count system. In<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/08/01/renewed-call-for-paper-ballots-in-georgia-flares-up-at-crowded-state-election-board-meeting/"> Georgia</a>, several election integrity groups are ratcheting up the pressure on election officials to ditch the electronic voting machines the state purchased in 2019 in favor of paper ballots in time for the 2024 presidential election. County commissioners in<a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/politics/2023/08/01/lucas-county-commissioners-approve-724k-for-new-voting-machines/stories/20230801143"> Lucas County, Ohio</a> recently approved spending $724,000 to purchase new voting equipment.<a href="https://wcyb.com/news/local/how-washington-county-tennessees-new-paper-backed-voting-machines-work"> Washington County, Tennessee</a> showed off new voting machines recently, part of a statewide shift to paper backups to improve election security. The<a href="https://nowhabersham.com/white-county-commissioners-say-no-to-additional-voting-machines/"> White County, Georgia</a> board of commissioners voted to deny a request from Supervisor of Elections and Registration Jody Davis to purchase some additional voting machines for the county. In<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-voting-machines-8223/44714282"> New Hampshire</a> potential replacements for the state’s voting machines were on display this week in Concord. The current machines will stop being supported after 2024, and the state Ballot Law Commission is considering whether to switch to the new machines. It will be up to each city or town to decide whether to use either of the two machines that are eventually chosen. Each municipality will have the option of counting ballots by hand. There are three machines under consideration, all which are paper ballot-based. The<a href="https://www.wxxinews.org/capitol-bureau/2023-08-02/new-york-state-board-of-elections-votes-to-certify-controversial-touch-screen-voting-machines"> New York</a> State Board of Elections certified a new touch-screen voting machine for use in future elections. The Board approved the ExpressVote XL system from ES&amp;S. Opponents, including some leading government reform groups, said the decision is “bad for voters.” They said the machines don’t leave a verified paper trail and are potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks. According to WXXI the board, which is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, discussed the proposal for hours in a debate that at times grew heated. The touch-screen machines could be in place as early as Election Day next year.</p>

The Task Force decided to move ahead with<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/07/28/arizona-elections-recommended-changes-from-task-force/70477881007/"> 20 proposed election-related changes</a>. Most of the proposals received unanimous approval from the 18-member group; only two were rejected. The majority of them aim to expand voting access or to tighten election security. Some of the early ideas would cost money, such as $6 million to pay for upgrades to election equipment and to meet federal certification standards. But other proposals suggest changes to existing practices, such as speeding up vote counting by creating a three-day &#8220;final weekend voting&#8221; period open to all voters that could reduce wait times on Election Day. None of the proposals that advanced are certain to land in a final report, due Nov. 1. Over the next three months, subgroups will continue to debate and refine the ideas. The proposals fell into five categories, ranging from early voting issues to election security to voter registration. The panel addressed the difficulty of attracting poll workers. Proposals ranged from increasing the pay to requiring employers to give unpaid leave to staffers who volunteer to work the polls. Another proposal to stem the loss of election workers would create a fellowship program in elections offices statewide. It would expose young workers to the elections world and act as an entry point into the field. It passed with unanimous support.</p>

A company spokesman told NPR that Facebook&#8217;s rules apply to Threads. So, for example, people can&#8217;t post false claims about voter registration. He also said Meta is looking at additional ways to address misinformation in future updates to the Threads app. The voting rights groups say Threads needs a stand-alone policy.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission received the<a href="https://www.nased.org/news/2023innovatorsaward"> Innovators Award</a> for the agency’s<a href="https://elections.wi.gov/101"> Elections 101</a> video-based election education project in 2022. Wisconsin was selected out of submissions from six states. In late 2021 and early 2022, WEC initiated partnerships with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI), the city of Madison, Dane County, Badger Boys State, the Wisconsin Newspaper Association, the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association, two high schools in the state, Disability Rights Wisconsin, and a local video production company to create a voter education campaign featuring a four-part video series designed to increase public and student knowledge about elections administration and voting in Wisconsin. The videos featured a Wisconsin elections overview; a look at the details of the voting process, such as registering to vote and requesting an absentee ballot; how Wisconsin maintains security and integrity in elections; and what a day at the polling place looks like. Outgoing Maryland elections Administrator Linda Lamone is the recipient of the first-ever<a href="https://www.nased.org/news/lamoneaward"> Elaine Manlove Award for Distinguished Service</a> in recognition of Administrator Lamone’s more than 25 years of service to NASED and to the State of Maryland. The NASED Executive Board has awarded the Distinguished Service Award six times in NASED’s history.  It is presented to a member of the organization or the larger elections community who has made a significant contribution to NASED and its members over an extended period.  In June 2023, the NASED Executive Board voted to rename the award for Elaine Manlove, Delaware’s State Election Commissioner, from 2007 to 2019.</p>

The bill also targets voter challenges placed on overworked local election officials. The Preventing Election Subversion Act legislation would overpower voter registration challenges by &#8220;requiring that any challenges to a voter&#8217;s eligibility to register to vote or cast a ballot, other than those submitted by an election official, must be supported by personal knowledge with respect to each individual challenged.&#8221;</p>

The board had previously directed the county’s election director to draft a plan. After doing just that, he presented it to the board, showing it would cost well over $1 million to implement.  Board chair Travis Lingenfelter said that is money the county does not have. “The first thing that we have to do in Mohave County in good conscience is to balance the budget. You can’t talk about any other spending when you have $18 to $20 million deficit. I mean that’s irresponsible,&#8221; Lingenfelter said.  Deputy County Attorney Ryan Esplin told the board that a hand count would likely invite litigation. The motion to adopt the hand count plan was rejected on a 3-2 vote.</p>

Supporters said they believe the changes will bring clarity to the reporting of election results and restore faith in the elections process that may have been undermined by recent claims of widespread voter fraud nationwide. It won nearly unanimous support in the Legislature. “A clear and open election process is one of the foundations of our democracy,” Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex), prime sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. “This law will further ensure that clarity, eliminate confusion about results, and serve to counteract misinformation that circulates on social media and elsewhere.”  Under <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A5176">the new law</a>, county clerks will be required to post election results online by 11:59 p.m. on the day of primary and general elections and continue to post them daily by 9 p.m. until all the ballots are counted and the election is certified. Murphy said the law will “make sure our elections are conducted in a way that bolsters public confidence in our democracy.”</p>

Davidson sought a change in his office, moving from an elections director to a chief deputy. A motion to move forward with the change was made by Commissioner Tom Sakievich, though neither of the other commissioners seconded the motion. Therefore, the motion failed. To be hired as the elections director, a candidate would have to meet a set of criteria to be eligible for the position. Moving to a chief deputy, meanwhile, would allow Davidson to appoint a person — whether or not they meet the merit system’s listed criteria — for the role.</p>

Trump was the only person charged in this week’s indictment. But prosecutors referenced a half-dozen co-conspirators, including lawyers inside and outside of government who they said had worked with Trump to undo the election results. They also advanced legally dubious schemes to enlist slates of fake electors in battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden to falsely claim that Trump had actually won them. The indictment accuses the defeated president and his allies of trying to “exploit the violence and chaos” by calling lawmakers into the evening on Jan. 6 to delay the certification of Biden’s victory. In between the election and the riot, Trump urged local election officials to undo voting results in their states, pressured Pence to halt the certification of electoral votes and falsely claimed that the election had been stolen — a notion repeatedly rejected by judges. Among those lies, prosecutors say, were claims that more than 10,000 dead voters had voted in Georgia along with tens of thousands of double votes in Nevada. Each claim had been rebutted by courts or state or federal officials, the indictment says. The indictment includes charges of conspiring to defraud the U.S., conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, obstructing an official proceeding and violating a post-Civil War Reconstruction Era civil rights statute that makes it a crime to conspire to violate rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution — in this case, the right to vote.</p>

In a brief filing, his attorney pointed out that appellate-level courts have so far rejected claims by failed GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that there were mistakes made in how the election was run and how counties tabulated the votes that she claims entitle her to be declared the winner over Katie Hobbs or to get a new election ordered. Finchem’s attorney, Daniel McCauley, also noted that Republican Abe Hamadeh has so far failed to convince a trial judge to set aside the 2022 results showing he lost the race for attorney general to Democrat Kris Mayes. Their allegations “more or less mirror Mr. Finchem’s,” McCauley told the Arizona Court of Appeals. McCauley told Capitol Media Services this may not be the end of Finchem’s chances of becoming secretary of state. The key, he said, is the still-pending litigation by Lake. She has raised a variety of legal issues, many of them relating to whether early ballots were counted that shouldn’t have been.</p>

The suit, filed on behalf of the party, is the latest effort by some Colorado Republicans to push back against Proposition 108, which allows unaffiliated voters to participate in parties’ primary elections and help select general election candidates. The suit alleges that the ballot measure “harms (the party) and its members by infringing upon their rights of free speech and association.” A similar suit, filed by a handful of Colorado Republican officials, was dismissed by a federal judge shortly after it was filed in 2022. The same attorney, John Eastman, represented those officials in that case, too. This latest effort comes with the fuller backing of the party as an institution, which is now under the direction of new party chairman Dave Williams. Williams, a former state legislator who lost a primary race against Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn in 2022, has criticized the system established by Prop 108 and said in a radio interview Tuesday that he “certainly want(s) a closed primary.” The suit asks a federal judge to declare Prop 108 unconstitutional and to prevent Griswold’s office from enforcing it.</p>

Kness ruled that five-term U.S. Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro and two prospective 2024 GOP presidential electors lacked standing to sue the State Board of Elections over an Illinois law allowing mail-in ballots to be counted in the 14 days after Election Day as long as they were postmarked or certified on or before that day. Kness explicitly ruled that Illinois’ 2015 law complied with the U.S. Constitution as well as federal election law. “By implementing the statute, Illinois is following the constitutional command that states determine the time, place, and manner of elections,” Kness wrote in a ruling. “In addition, the statute further does not conflict with the federal mandate that Election Day be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November,” the judge wrote “By counting only mail-in ballots postmarked on or before Election Day, the statute does not extend the day for casting votes in a federal election.” “Voting (as an act) and counting votes (as a separate act) are not the same thing, and the statute allows counting alone — not voting — to continue after Election Day,” the judge wrote.</p>

DePerno and Rendon are among nine people in Michigan named thus far by Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office as having been involved in the scheme. Asked whether the broader investigation continues, Hilson replied in an email, “Still more to come unrelated to the individuals currently charged.” In his statement, Hilson said the charges against DePerno and Rendon were authorized by “an independent citizens grand jury,” and that his office did not make any recommendations.</p>

On July 5, Judge Eric R. Linhardt ruled there is no provision in the state Election Code compelling the board of elections through an independent third party to conduct the audit that was requested. The judge further found Houser and Burns did not strictly adhere to the statutory requirements for contesting an election after the results are certified, PennLive reported. Lacking, according to Linhardt, was a petition of at least 100 electors who voted in the election and a verification affidavit signed by at least five of them. A bond must be posted within five days of the petition being filed, which did not occur either, he said. As such, he concluded that the court lacks jurisdiction to issue an order affecting the 2020 election. The appeal notice did not specify how the complainants believe the judge erred in his decision to dismiss the case.</p>

Erin Lunceford, a GOP candidate who lost her bid to become a district court judge in Harris County is suing to throw out the election results and have the court order a do over. Lunceford’s lawyers allege she lost in part because of paper ballot shortages that targeted Republican voting locations. They also argue election officials made mistakes allowing illegal votes to be cast. Her opponent, Democrat Tamika Craft, won the election by 2,743 votes out of more than 1 million cast. Craft’s lawyers and Harris County officials say there’s no evidence that ballot shortages or other problems prevented people from voting or that illegal voting took place. One of Lunceford’s attorneys said the lawsuit details 17 examples of election problems. In addition to the ballot shortage, other problems listed include mistakes in ballot scanning and with reviewing signatures on mail-in ballots. Kevin Haynes, one of Craft’s lawyers, said Lunceford’s attorneys are using a “kitchen sink” approach to make numerous allegations that rely on “wildly speculative evidence.” “Once they have finally at long last put their cards on the table, it is very clear they have no evidence,” Haynes said.</p>

Stewart, who had served as Nottoway’s registrar for 28 years before being removed from her position in the fall of 2021, argued the move by the Nottoway Electoral Board violated her constitutional rights by being based on false allegations of malfeasance. She also claimed the board didn’t give her an adequate chance to defend her actions in office to try to keep her job. Hudson dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, pointing to 11th Amendment immunity restricting the ability of private individuals to sue states in federal courts. “Here, it is clear that local electoral boards are more like an arm of the state than they are like municipalities,” Hudson wrote in the July 28 opinion. “Local electoral boards derive all their power and responsibilities from Virginia statutory law. They are subject to the State Board’s supervision and authority, which includes the power to initiate removal proceedings against local electoral board members. Electoral board members are appointed by state circuit court judges. The party affiliation of board members depends upon the party affiliation of the governor, not the party in power locally.” Even though electoral board members are initially paid with local funds, Hudson noted, their compensation is set by the state and “reimbursed annually from the state treasury.” Hudson dismissed all the claims Stewart brought under federal law on the basis of the immunity provision and said he had no jurisdiction over the remaining claims under state law, leaving nothing left to argue in the case. He reached the same conclusion in an accompanying case brought by Sharon Caldwell, a former assistant registrar and officer of election in Nottoway who was removed around the same time as Stewart.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by state Rep. Janel Brandtjen and Concerned Veterans of Waukesha County, had sought to block the immediate counting of all military absentee ballots cast in the November election until they could be verified with current lists of military voters. Maxwell denied the request at the time and now has dismissed the case. In order to properly file such a lawsuit, Maxwell ruled, the plaintiffs would need to bring a complaint against an &#8220;elections official,&#8221; not the state&#8217;s elections commission. &#8220;The Plaintiffs should not have brought suit against WEC in order to have a successful … claim, rather they should have brought suit against the clerk or other election official that they believe either acted improperly or failed to act properly,&#8221; Maxwell wrote. &#8220;Had there been &#8216;an elections official&#8217; listed as a Defendant, the people of this County and this State might know if the important safeguards of (state law) are being adhered to. That answer will have to wait for another day.&#8221; In his ruling, Maxwell said he agreed that WEC should provide more guidance to local election officials on how to use military ballot lists, but the court does not have the authority to issue such a requirement.</p>
