							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Announcing MIT Election Lab’s new Election Data Analytics Group</strong></p>
<p>Today, based on suggestions made by state and local election staff who conduct data analysis, the MIT Election Data + <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6793" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png" alt="" width="300" height="51" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Science Lab is proudly launching the “Election Data Analytics Group,” a supportive community for data analysts working for federal, state, and local election agencies.</p>
<p>As the number of people providing data analysis to election agencies grows, so does the value of creating a professional community of election administration data analysts. Here at the MIT Election Lab (MEDSL), we are committed to improving scholarship and practice in election science through high-quality data gathering and analysis, and we know election workers are both essential and deeply involved in that work.</p>
<p><strong>What is the group?</strong><br />
This group will be a private community within the professional election administration world to support people who are working with election data. Hosted on a Slack workspace, the group will provide a place for analysts and other election staff who work with data to learn from their peers, help each other grow in their profession, and discuss best practices to apply data to the betterment of democracy in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the group for?</strong><br />
The focus of the group is for those who work for federal, state, and local election agencies who perform data analysis—broadly defined. It is meant to be a platform where election workers can reach out to colleagues in other states and localities to pose issues, ask questions, and share insights into the analytical world of election administration.</p>
<p><strong>How do I join?</strong><br />
If you’re a member of an election office who’s involved in data analysis, there are two easy ways to join us in the Slack group:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may use<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/electiondataa-0kl6519/shared_invite/zt-21owyoo5f-WC_vfqdU2V2DemapZY4rZw"> the invitation at this link</a> to join; you will be prompted to log-in (if you already have a Slack account) or create an account with your name and email.</li>
<li>Or, email our communications director Claire DeSoi at cdesoi@mit.edu to receive an invitation directly to your email.</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to welcoming all of you data-focused officials to the group, and to the many conversations to come!</p>

							<h2>BPC Explainer</h2>
														<p><strong>New BPC Explainer</strong><br />
<em>The Implications of Making Ballot Images and Cast Vote Records Public</em></p>
<p>This week, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project published a new explainer,<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/implications-of-making-ballot-images-and-cast-vote-records-public/"> Implications of Making Ballot Images and Cast Vote Records Public</a>. It provides an overview of ballot images and cast vote records (CVRs) and explores how making these files available online would affect privacy, transparency, and efficiency.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In the wake of the 2020 presidential election, public records requests for elections data have been filed at an unprecedented rate across the country. These requests are critical to journalists’, academics’, and voters’ ability to hold government bodies to account, but election offices are currently unequipped to process the volume of requests being received.</p>
<p>Proactively releasing CVRs and ballot images bolsters transparency and could reduce the volume of public records requests, saving limited resources. Many election jurisdictions already post CVRs or ballot images without issue.</p>
<p>Despite the clear benefits to transparency, making these records public comes with trade-offs: Voters’ privacy might be compromised, and many election offices do not have the resources or technology to undertake this effort. Furthermore, vote buying becomes feasible when ballot secrecy is violated—an extreme, if less likely, potential ramification of making ballot images public.</p>
<p>These issues raise the question: How can under-resourced election offices meet heightened demands for transparency and accountability?</p>
<p>The explainer navigates this intricate terrain. It emphasizes the dual nature of this idea – while transparency is appealing, the risks to voter privacy and voter trust must not be underestimated. Furthermore, any reform must be paired with the resources required to support suchtransparency efforts.</p>
<p>A special thank you to Charles Stewart III, Shiro Kuriwaki, Michael Morse, and Jeffrey Lewis for their contributions to this report.

Their discussions began as Republican-led states have quit ERIC. VPM reports that Ohio Director of Elections Amanda Grandjean wrote to counterparts on March 24 — a week after the state quit ERIC — to see if they’d be interested in discussing “securely sharing voter history and other relevant data for the purposes of identifying and investigating potential cross‐state voter fraud.” After the meeting, Grandjean wrote back noting that the group had settled on two goals: a short-term effort focused on state-to-state data sharing to prevent voter fraud, and a longer-term project “to securely share data and perform [voter] matches in a centralized manner, including those of potential cross‐state voter fraud and other relevant matches for states’ own list maintenance purposes.” Grandjean offered to get the ball rolling on the first effort, sending a<a href="https://vpmmediacorp-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bpaviour_vpm_org/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=056bd6c3260c34db68910d76faf5225df&amp;authkey=AS3mhlesNtEKnAqluLykduw&amp;e=FugfvB"> draft state-to-state agreement</a>. It specifies the goal of the memorandum of understanding as “investigating and preventing voter fraud.” Meeting invitations obtained by VPM News show election officials from a range of states have attended some of the group’s meetings, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming, as well as Washington, D.C. VPM said it’s not clear where the group’s discussions stand.</p>

According to the Oregon Chronicle implementation is on hold though until federal administrators act. The slow progress has spurred Oregon Sens Ron Wyden (D) and Jeff Merkley (D) to send a letter to Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, asking for quick action on waivers for Oregon and other states that plan to automatically register eligible Medicaid recipients to vote.  In Oregon, eligible Oregonians are automatically registered as nonaffiliated voters, then receive mail that allows them to choose a political party or indicate that they don’t want to register to vote.  House Bill 2107 would duplicate that process for Oregon Health Plan enrollees. Colorado passed a similar law in 2019 and has yet to be able to implement it. In their letter to Brooks-LaSure, Wyden and Merkley cited a 2021 executive order from President Joe Biden that calls on all federal agencies to evaluate ways to promote voter registration and voter participation. They asked Brooks-LaSure to tell them by Sept. 20 what her agency is doing to comply with Biden’s executive order, what resources the agency needs to help Oregon and other states seeking federal waivers to automatically register Medicaid recipients to vote and to share a timeline for when those states will receive amendments.</p>

The exercise took place over three days, from August 15 through 17, and included a range of hypothetical scenarios affecting election operations. The annual exercise gives participants the opportunity to share practices around cyber and physical incident planning, preparedness, identification, response, and recovery. Following the exercise, CISA Director Jen Easterly, and the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee issued the following joint statement: “Today’s threat environment is increasingly dynamic and complex, and we continue working closely together. This includes the sharing of information and intelligence through multiple channels, promoting rigorous safeguarding of equipment and systems, ongoing assessments to identify risks and vulnerabilities, and participating in exercises like Tabletop the Vote. Elections are run by thousands of dedicated state and local election officials across the country. It is because of the incredible work of so many that the American people can have confidence in the security of our nation’s elections.” In addition to CISA, federal participants included the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Guard Bureau, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. State and local election officials participated virtually. More than two dozen<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/me/maine/politics/2023/08/18/maine-clerks-train-in-federal-program-to-ensure-election-security-"> municipal clerks from across Maine</a> recently participated in a federal exercise to ensure election security. “Maine’s elections are very well run because we plan and prepare so extensively for them ahead of time,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in a statement. “Election security is a priority for us. With our laws, procedures and trainings in place, Maine voters can be confident that our elections will remain safe, secure, accessible and accurate.” This was the third  year Maine clerks participated in the event.</p>

County supervisors voted 2-1 against extending the time period for a $1 million state grant for the secure ballot paper that expired in May — this means County Recorder David Stevens’ proposed contract with Authentix will not move forward. Supervisors Ann English and Peggy Judd voted no, and Supervisor Tom Crosby voted yes. The “no” vote means that Stevens will only be able to use supplies he had already ordered from Runbeck Election Services, which cost $187,500, to test watermarks on ballots as part of the pilot, and will not be able to hire Authentix and one other company that had applied separately for the work, ProVoteSolutions. An item on Tuesday’s meeting to approve a contract with the two companies was nullified.</p>

While legislators voted 11-10 in favor of the resolution, which would have been sent to Gov. Kathy Hochul urging her to veto bills that passed both the state Senate and state Assembly that would see certain local elections moved to even years. The resolution fell short of a 12-vote majority required for it to pass. Local elections, including county and town races, currently take place in odd years. Hochul’s proposal would see those races moved to even years so they would be contested in the same year as presidential and midterm elections. Proponents of the plan, like Brian Cahill, D-town of Ulster, said it would increase voter turnout for local races. He downplayed concerns that voters would simply always vote across the ballot for candidates in the same party as their picks for president or governor.</p>

As it stands, the primary is to be held April 23. The Jewish holiday of Passover begins the night prior and, per Jewish tradition, observant worshippers are to abstain from work during the first two and last two days. This work includes voting. Both the state House and Senate have legislation in committee that would move the 2024 date up. The bills aim to move the primary to the third Tuesday in April as opposed to the fourth Tuesday. The Senate State Government Committee will be amending the Senate bill to change the date to April 2, Schwank said. Changing the date has bipartisan support, Schwank said. Gov. Josh Shapiro also supports changing it, said his press secretary Manuel Bonder.</p>

Two bills would create or clarify residency requirements to vote or run for the statehouse, another would mandate reporting for certain electioneering communications. One bill would ban private funding for election administration, or what has come to be known as “Zuck bucks,” in reference to billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s election-related charity in 2020. Another would revise some of the Legislature’s most recent work related to political party affiliation. Another bill would help clear up problems when the Legislature banned crossover voting last session. Voters are now prohibited from affiliating with a party during the 96 days immediately preceding the primary election. However, some lawmakers raised concerns about the bill inadvertently restricting someone from registering to vote who had turned 18 during the blackout period. An amendment to prevent that potential mishap failed in the Senate. A measure up for consideration would clarify the issue. It would make an exception for someone who has not registered to vote in Wyoming during the year prior. Those residents would retain the ability to declare a party affiliation for the primary election during the blackout period. At the behest of Secretary of State Chuck Gray, the committee will consider creating a 30-day residency requirement for voters. The measure may face some legal hurdles. In 1972, the Wyoming Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Wyoming Constitution that required one year of residency to vote.</p>

Smartmatic sued Newsmax in November 2021, saying the network should be held accountable for knowingly spreading false claims that the company rigged the election. After the original lawsuit was filed, Smartmatic amended its complaint to add 26 additional statements it said were defamatory, such as statements aired by the network that Smartmatic machines could have been hacked. Newsmax had argued that the statute of limitations had passed and that it was too late to add allegedly defamatory statements to the amended complaint. Davis in his ruling said the additional statements fell within the themes of the original complaint and stemmed from the network&#8217;s coverage of the election, so he allowed them.</p>

In the fillings, Lake and her attorneys are telling Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Jay Adelman that Richer should not even be given a chance to bring evidence into court to show how Lake, her campaign and the Save Arizona Fund, which Lake has used to raise funds, made false statements he said harmed him and his family and results in threats of violence and death for family members. The reason, she said, is that 2006 law requires judges to immediately dismiss lawsuits they determine are “substantially motivated by a desire to deter, retaliate against or prevent the lawful exercise of a constitutional right.” And that, said Lake, makes the question of whether she was telling the truth or not legally irrelevant. Richer filed suit in June arguing that Lake made repeated claims that he intentionally printed ballots with 19-inch images on 20-inch ballots to sabotage the 2022 general election.</p>

DeSantis’ election security office last year has lost her appeal and will go to trial, court documents showed. Michelle Stribling faces two counts related to voting in the 2020 election. Stribling was convicted of second-degree murder in 1993, which made her ineligible to vote. She registered to vote at a church in 2019, believing her rights had been restored by Amendment 4, which gave most convicted felons the right to vote. The amendment made an exception for people convicted of murder and sex crimes. Stribling told investigators she could not read or write very well. Stribling’s attorney initially asked a judge to dismiss her case because the state lacked jurisdiction, which followed a pattern established by some of the other defendants accused in the governor’s round-up. However, the governor signed a new law giving his administration jurisdiction over election crimes cases, which caused a judge to dismiss the attorney’s motion. The attorney appealed the decision to the Sixth District Court of Appeals. In an order dated August 11, a three-judge panel denied that appeal. The judges gave no reasoning for their ruling. “They didn’t say it was denied on facts,” Stribling’s attorney, Roger Weeden said, referring to the order as strange. “They didn’t say it was denied on the law. They didn’t say it was denied on the procedure.”</p>

Boulee<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-temporarily-blocks-parts-of-georgia-voting-law-restrictions/"> issued three rulings</a> last week pertaining to voting law restrictions that the state passed after the 2020 presidential election and were soon challenged by multiple civil rights groups. S.B. 202, also known as the &#8220;Election Integrity Act of 2021,&#8221; was signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp in 2021 and enacted new voting restrictions that spanned from voter ID requirements to curbing the ability of churches and others to hand out food and water to voters waiting in long lines. Boulee on Friday granted two motions for preliminary injunctions, with one blocking the provision of the law that prohibited the distribution of food, drinks or gifts to voters waiting in line within 150 feet of polling precincts.  The Trump-appointed judge was unpersuaded by the state&#8217;s concerns that the ban aimed to protect election efficiency and ruled that it violated the First Amendment and rights to freedom of speech. &#8220;State defendants seem to contend that because multiple messages may be perceived from plaintiffs’ line relief activities, those efforts cannot be considered expressive conduct. This contention is at odds with binding precedent holding that conduct is expressive where a &#8216;reasonable person would interpret [the conduct] as some sort of message,&#8217; not where &#8216;an observer would necessarily infer a specific message.'&#8221; Boulee wrote. Another provision of Georgia&#8217;s voting law requires absentee voters to print their date of birth on the outer envelope of an absentee ballot. But Boulee granted an injunction request, ruling that the requirement is not necessary in validating a voter&#8217;s eligibility. Boulee did, however,<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/church-v-kemp-absentee-drop-boxes-order-usdc-northern-ga.pdf"> turn down</a> a request to block enforcement of two provisions of the law related to how absentee ballots are returned. These provisions required that absentee ballot drop boxes be placed inside, instead of outside, advanced voting locations and limited their hours for access. They also made it a felony for an unauthorized individual to return an absentee ballot for another person. Individuals who are authorized to return an absentee ballot for another person are family members, household members and caregivers.</p>

The law bans anyone from hiring vehicles to get voters to the polls, unless they&#8217;re physically unable to walk. The lawsuit says Michigan is the only state with such a voter transportation ban, and that the law&#8217;s only purpose is voter suppression. Aneesa McMillan is with Priorities USA, a voting rights group that&#8217;s one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. She said in other states, churches can hire buses to help members of their congregations vote, and ride-hailing apps can offer promotions to get people to polls. Not in Michigan. &#8220;Laws like this typically have disparate impacts on marginalized communities, communities of color, communities that may struggle with access to transportation overall. There may be barriers to public transportation,&#8221; she said. Courts have upheld the state&#8217;s law before, including in 2020, when Priorities USA took a similar case to federal court. The current lawsuit names Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel as a defendant. Nessel&#8217;s office said in a statement that it might be easier for plaintiffs to ask the state Legislature to change the law, rather than suing.</p>

Enforcement of the voting ban, which is part of the state&#8217;s constitution, was blocked by in a 2-1 decision by a panel of 5th Circuit judges on Aug. 4. Mississippi attorneys, led by state Attorney General Lynn Fitch, asked the full New Orleans-based court, with 16 active members, to reconsider the case, saying the earlier ruling conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and rulings in other circuit courts. The Aug. 4 ruling held that denying voting rights violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Mississippi lawyers argued that the panel&#8217;s decision would &#8220;inflict profound damage and sow widespread confusion.” The 5th Circuit currently has one vacancy. If it agrees to the state&#8217;s request, the case would likely be heard by the court&#8217;s current contingent of 16 full-time “active” judges. Dennis and King are both on “senior status” with a limited work load.</p>

Prosecutors say Saunders voted twice in Ohio and Florida for the 2020 and 2022 general elections. According to the indictment, in 2020, he voted in person in Ohio and Florida. In 2022, he voted in person in Ohio and by mail in Florida. Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Andrew Santoli ordered sheriff’s deputies to take Saunders straight to county jail after finding the 56-year-old guilty of two counts of illegal voting, a fourth-degree felony. The judge noted that voting records from both states show Saunders also illegally voted twice in the 2014 and 2016 general elections. Prosecutors could not charge him for those votes because the statute of limitations had passed. The trial lasted a single day and featured testimony from three witnesses &#8212; elections officials from Cuyahoga County and Broward County, Florida, and an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations agent who examined the case. Saunders did not take the stand or present any witnesses. Santoli rejected Saunders’ arguments at trial that he accidentally cast two ballots, did not mean to commit a crime, and that he shouldn’t be prosecuted in Ohio for the vote he cast in Florida. Santoli set a sentencing hearing for Aug. 28. Saunders faces any from probation to three years in prison.</p>

Counties are still awaiting details on what the program — which begins with this November’s municipal election — will look like. Along with having the state direct counties to report malfunctions, the settlement agreement requires the department to give the public better opportunities to witness its voting equipment examination process and requires that the three counties using the voting machine, called the ExpressVote XL, upgrade to its latest software. Along with the National Election Defense Coalition, the groups involved in the suit against the Department of State include the Pennsylvania-based Citizens for Better Elections, the election equality nonprofit Free Speech for People, and a cohort of several Pennsylvania voters. The settlement caps a longstanding lawsuit, in which the election groups sued the state after a few counties adopted new voting machines that the groups argued were flawed.</p>
<p>Lycoming County Judge Eric R Linhardt stands by his opinion that two voters are<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/elections/2023/08/judge-again-refuses-forensic-audit-of-2020-presidential-election-in-pa-county.html"> not entitled to a forensic audit</a> of the November 2020 presidential election in the county. Linhardt stated so in an opinion filed Wednesday in response to the issues raised by Richard Houser and Catherine Burns in their appeal of his July 5 decision. The court is satisfied with that opinion and believes it has properly decided the issues in this case, he wrote. In his July ruling, Linhardt pointed out there is no provision in the state Election Code compelling the board of elections through an independent third party to conduct the audit that was requested. He further found Houser and Burns did not strictly adhere to the statutory requirements for contesting an election after the results are certified.</p>

Senate Bill 1750, passed by Republican lawmakers in May, is slated to go into effect Sept. 1, weeks before early voting starts for the November elections in the state’s largest county. The law requires Harris County to transfer all election-related duties from elections administrator Clifford Tatum, who was appointed just before the November 2022 elections, to the county clerk and the county tax assessor-collector. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee filed a lawsuit last month arguing that the law is unconstitutional because it singles out one county. Last week, Travis County District Judge Karin Crump granted a temporary injunction barring the law from taking effect. Crump ruled that the law was unconstitutional. She said it would lead to “inefficiencies, disorganization, confusion, office instability, and increased costs to Harris County.” The Texas Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday clears the way for the law to take effect, putting county clerk Teneshia Hudspeth and tax assessor-collector Ann Harris Bennett in charge of the upcoming elections. The decision also set a date of Nov. 28 for oral arguments on the state’s appeal of the earlier trial court ruling in favor of Harris County. “I am disappointed that the Texas Supreme Court is quietly allowing the Legislature to illegally target Harris County, instead of considering the arguments and timely deciding whether Senate Bill 1750 violates the constitution,” Menefee said. “We first learned of today’s decision from the media, instead of from the court itself.” Shannon Lackey, vice president of the Texas Association of Election Administrators, said having a nonpartisan elections administrator helps ensure elections run smoothly and fairly. She said transferring the election over to elected officials would put an unfair burden on already overworked officials. “I would be very concerned about the quick turnaround to conduct this upcoming election,” Lackey said. “This is a full-time job.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez has ruled that Texas election officials<a href="https://www.tpr.org/news/2023-08-19/federal-judge-in-san-antonio-shoots-down-texas-voter-id-law"> cannot reject mail-in ballots and applications for ID mistakes</a>. Around 40,000 mail-in ballot documents have been tossed out by election officials in Texas after lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 that mandates voters provide a driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number when submitting documentation for mail-in ballots. Rodriguez ruled that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ACLU of Texas has called the rules voter suppression that disproportionately affect voters of color, and called the judge’s decision a win for Texas voters. Rodriguez is expected to issue a final ruling soon, which will also inform the state on how to comply with the ruling.</p>
