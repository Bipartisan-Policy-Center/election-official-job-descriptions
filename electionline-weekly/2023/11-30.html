							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>FVAP Releases 2022 Post-Election Report to Congress</strong></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10478" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FVAP11.30-246x300.png" alt="" width="246" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FVAP11.30-246x300.png 246w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FVAP11.30-838x1024.png 838w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FVAP11.30-768x938.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FVAP11.30.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" />The Federal Voting Assistance Program&#8217;s (FVAP)<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Reports/rtc_20231113_V10_FINAL.pdf"> 2022 Post-Election Report to Congress</a> confirms that the program&#8217;s efforts continue to contribute to voter success among military members stationed away from home, their eligible family members, and U.S. citizens abroad covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).</p>
<p>To prepare this report, FVAP conducts post-election surveys and analyzes state and federal election data to evaluate the experience of military and overseas voters—and the impact that FVAP and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) resources have on their experience. This research provides key indicators about military voters, U.S. citizens living overseas, Voting Assistance Officers, and election officials during the 2022 General Election.</p>
<p>&#8220;The data and feedback from 2022 show that FVAP&#8217;s talented staff developed and successfully implemented valuable resources and voting assistance so UOCAVA citizens could vote absentee from anywhere in the world,&#8221; said FVAP Director J. Scott Wiedmann. &#8220;We look forward to seizing opportunities to further reduce absentee voting challenges for Service members, their families, and overseas citizens as we move into the 2024 election cycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Highlights from the 2022 Report to Congress</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2022 voter registration rate for Active Duty Military (ADM) was 63 percent, a four-point increase from 2018.</li>
<li>The 2022 voter participation rate for ADM was 23 percent, a three-point decrease from 2018.</li>
<li>The 2022 estimated voter participation rate for all overseas citizens was 3.4 percent, which is lower than the estimated voter participation rate for the 2018 General Election (5.6 percent).</li>
</ul>
<p>ADM who received assistance from a DoD resource (e.g., FVAP, Unit Voting Assistance Officers, and Installation Voter Assistance Offices) were significantly more likely to submit an absentee ballot than ADM who did not receive such assistance. This consistent finding across the last six general elections speaks to the importance and effectiveness of efforts by FVAP and the Services to raise awareness of available resources and provide direct assistance.</p>
<p>In 2022, UOCAVA voters requested their ballots slightly later than they did in 2018, and general election ballots were also returned later than they were in the 2018 and 2020 General Elections. Of recent election cycles, 2020 had the earliest ballot return timeframe.</p>
<p>For 2024, FVAP will continue its work to help UOCAVA voters to successfully vote absentee and increase awareness about voting among the UOCAVA population. Pursuant to Executive Order 14019, FVAP will support expanded opportunities to raise awareness on voting resources for all DoD personnel and offer voting assistance materials in alternative languages.</p>

The drama surrounding the election commission all stems from the Nov. 7 mayoral election where John David faced Atlantic Beach Town Councilwoman Josephine Isom. The Thursday following the election, the town’s election commission counted the votes and found David received 65 votes while Isom, received 64 votes and two ballots were cast for write-in candidates. Isom filed a protest of the certification of the mayoral election, stating that several votes were cast by people who do not live in Atlantic Beach. The election commission then reconvened on Friday morning for a recount, but the recount could not move forward because a court reporter was not present in order to transcribe the hearing. The election commission elected to go into recess until 2 p.m. when a court reporter could be secured. But during the recess, the Atlantic Beach Town Council called an emergency meeting at 12:30 p.m., where the town council voted in favor of removing Joe Montgomery, Kenneth McIver and Carolyn Gore from the Municipal Election Commission for the town of Atlantic Beach and dissolving the commission. While McIver and Gore were re-instated on the elections commission during Tuesday’s meeting, the town council voted to remove Joe Montgomery from it. “The town saw that there was evidence of a violation of SC Code 7-13-75, and it showed a conflict of interest of an election commissioner engaging in political activity,” said Atlantic Beach town attorney Joseph Dickey. Meanwhile, a lawsuit filed with the South Carolina Supreme Court by David over the town’s election will move forward. David argued that the decision to dissolve the elections commission in the first place breaks South Carolina laws. According to state law, a municipality must have an elections commission in place unless the county takes over the election process for the city or town. “These people are usurping the votes of Americans. One hundred and thirty-one United States citizens’ votes are not being counted,” David said.  Dickey said the town is focused on filing a response to the lawsuit, seeking to prove that Atlantic Beach maintained a fair election process amid all of the recent drama.</p>

The design has revised language about how to fill out and return a mail-in ballot, more easily identifiable secrecy envelopes on a yellow background, with watermarking to reduce stray marks, and coloring to make it easier to tell the difference between the inner and outer envelopes. The outer envelope will have a pre-filled “20” at the beginning of the year field, so that voters write the current year, not their birth year, and full-page instructions with graphics to show how to place the envelopes before mailing. Counties will have the discretion to use a hole punch in the return envelope to help county election workers see when the inner secrecy envelope — now with yellow coloring and a watermark — is missing – or “naked.” “Governor Shapiro has made it clear that the Commonwealth should help people succeed, not get in their way,” Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said in a statement. “In each election cycle since 2020, when no-excuse mail-in voting was implemented in Pennsylvania, we have seen thousands of mail ballots not be counted because of unintended technical errors voters made when completing their ballot.”  According to the Pennsylvania Department of State, rejected mail ballots only accounted for about 3% of the 597,000 mail ballots cast in this year’s primary election, but that meant thousands of votes were disqualified due to small errors.</p>

This effort continues to highlight election officials as the trusted sources for election information, which is critical in the age of mis-, dis-, and mal-information campaigns. “When voters need accurate election information, my answer is always clear: turn to Chief Election Officials. #TrustedInfo2024 is an excellent tool in democracy’s toolbox, and I would like to praise NASS for continuing this important initiative,” said Scott Schwab, NASS President and Kansas Secretary of State. NASS’s nonpartisan #TrustedInfo2024 effort directs voters to election officials’ websites, social media pages, and other public facing materials for information on each step of the election pro­cess—from registration, voting, to post-election procedures. “The mission of #TrustedInfo2024 is to communicate to the American people that they should al­ways turn to state and local election officials for reliable, timely information,” said Steve Simon, NASS President-Elect and Minnesota Secretary of State. “Rapidly advancing technology using ar­tificial intelligence will likely allow for more convincing false information and increase how fast in­correct information spreads. I encourage voters to do their part by only sharing credible infor­mation from our offices with their communities. And when in doubt, contact us or your local elec­tion administrator.” Since its initial introduction in November 2019 as #TrustedInfo2020, the #TrustedInfo initiative has received acclaim from numerous non-profit, private sector and government organizations.

These grants were directed by the FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act and authorized under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). The EAC is accepting proposals for HAVCP funding from accredited colleges (including community colleges) and universities, nonprofit organizations, and local and state election offices starting November 16 until December 18. Applicants may apply to one of two competitive grant programs: the HAVCP Poll Worker Program and the HAVCP Service Day Mini-Grant Program. Through the HAVCP, funding may be used for programming and events that educate and encourage students enrolled in institutions of higher education to support polling places or offices on Election Day. Eligible activities include the recruitment, training, education, and support of college students serving as nonpartisan poll workers, language assistants, or technical assistants. For the HAVCP Service Day Mini-Grant Program, funding may be used for service day events for the recruitment of college students as poll workers on Help America Vote Day and National Poll Worker Recruitment Day in 2024. Interested organizations may submit one application for either the HAVCP Poll Worker Program or the HAVCP Service Day Program, but not both. The EAC will host several training calls to provide applicants with an overview of the HAVCP programs and application process.

The 2022 elections saw the second highest youth voter turnout for a midterm election in thirty years. More than 960 institutions enrolling 9.7 million students participate in the ALL IN Challenge, which supports colleges and universities in achieving excellence in nonpartisan student voter engagement. “Despite nationwide attempts to undermine democracy through restrictive voting laws, college students made their voices heard during the 2022 midterm elections,” said Jen Domagal-Goldman, Executive Director of the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge. “Each and every one of us has a role to play in promoting nonpartisan student democratic engagement. The individuals we are celebrating today are leading the way on their campuses and in their communities to ensure that every student has the tools and information they need to participate in our democracy and cast their ballot.” Champion award winners included Tahesha Way of New Jersey as the Standout Secretary of State and Eric Fey and Rick Stream of the St. Louis County Board of Elections as the Standout Local Election Officials.</p>

He was just unique.” He was just 19 when he began recording meeting minutes for the Peabody City Council on a typewriter in 1977. He worked his way up to becoming City Clerk in 2005. Even after retiring in 2019, he didn’t stay away from City Hall. Until his death, he worked two days a week in the clerk’s office helping out with city matters and elections, including the Nov. 7 general election just a week before his death. “He loved working with the City Council and having his hand in the elections. He just couldn’t give it up completely,” current City Clerk Allyson Danforth said. “We’re all just heartbroken here at the City Clerk’s office.”</p>

The 2021-2022 version of the legislation<a href="https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/bennet-phillips-celebrate-house-passage-of-their-bill-to-promote-ranked-choice-voting"> passed the U.S. House</a> as an amendment to the Protecting our Democracy Act (PODA). The Voter Choice Act authorizes $40 million in federal grants to support state and local governments that choose to transition to RCV. Grants would support up to 50 percent of the transition cost, including through the purchase of voting equipment and tabulation software, ballot design, educational materials, and voter outreach. “As partisanship continues to harm our democracy and impede progress, we need to make government work for the American people,” said Senator Michael Bennet. “Ranked choice voting gives people more options at the ballot box, increases political competition, eliminates costly runoffs, and rewards candidates who appeal to the broadest swath of voters. Our bill provides vital support for states and local governments that choose to make this important transition.”</p>

After two hours of impassioned public comments and debate quoting everyone from Thomas Jefferson to Yogi Berra, the five supervisors again rejected the proposal in a 3-2 vote, with each supervisor sticking to the position they took in a previous vote in August. Public comments ranged widely. One Kingman resident teared up Monday as she pleaded with Mohave County supervisors to agree to the hand count, asking them to consider how much they valued their freedom. But another Mohave County resident told supervisors that hand-counting ballots would be a silly and expensive act of “pandering to the misinformed conspiracy theorists in your constituency to get yourselves reelected.” The county expects about 100,000 voters in the 2024 general election. The elections director previously estimated it would take 657 days to complete a hand count for that election. Hand-counting all 2024 elections, he said, would cost an additional $1.1 million at a time when the county faces an $18 million deficit. Deputy County Attorney Ryan Esplin told the supervisors Monday that they did not have the authority under state law to hand count all ballots. If they moved forward, he said he would recommend to the county attorney that the office not represent the supervisors in resulting legal matters. That would expose supervisors to personal liability for breaking state law and require them to obtain private counsel.</p>

Under current law, counties must use electronic or what are known as “electromechanical” systems to tabulate votes. The bill, filed a year before the 2024 elections, would allow votes to be counted by hand. The legislation, in part, also would prevent the Florida Department of State from authorizing voting systems that use hardware or software designed, owned or licensed by foreign companies. Republican State Rep. Berney Jacques said he filed the bill in hopes of instilling confidence in the voters about the election process.  &#8220;There are a lot of individuals who believe, in their heart of hearts, and have run different models, that show hand-counting may be a more accurate way of tabulating votes when it’s done at the precinct level and it’s in a controlled setting,&#8221; Jacques said.  &#8220;I actually don’t know any supervisor who wants to do that,&#8221; Palm Beach County Supervisor of Election Wendy Sartory Link<a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/florida-palm-beach-county-bill-votes-tabulation-machines-count-by-hand/45989801"> told WPBF 25 News</a>. &#8220;There are many, many studies out there that show that when you’re doing manual counts and hand counting, it is not as accurate. And so, it’s not just the time that would be lost, but also the accuracy is what we’re concerned about.&#8221; The bill will be considered during the legislative session that will start in January.</p>

Lara received words of support from multiple colleagues, and a hearing on the matter will be scheduled soon so that experts can weigh in.  “Though immigrants, particularly those with legal status, pay taxes and contribute to Boston’s economy, they are not able to participate in the electoral process, in what I believe is a violation of one of our foundational American principles,” Lara said. “By moving this home rule petition forward, Boston can begin the process of making good on our promise to build a city that is for everyone.” Lara argued that disenfranchising taxpayers from the electoral process is not in line with American values. As the process of gaining full citizenship is often lengthy and expensive, immigrants new to Boston are stuck without the ability to vote for the officials in charge of making decisions that affect their day-to-day lives, she said.  In introducing the measure, Lara also highlighted other ways that Boston should grow its electorate, such as giving voting rights to incarcerated people and implementing same-day voting registration.  Lara said she spoke with elected officials from communities across Massachusetts, advocates, lawyers, and other experts in crafting the petition. It was referred to the Committee on Government Operations.</p>

Assemblyman Raj Mukherji, a prime sponsor of the <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A5701/bill-text?f=A9999&amp;n=5701_I1">bill</a>, said New Jersey should join the 20 other states that already allow eligible residents to register to vote at the polls. Mukherji will be joining the state Senate in January after voters gave him a promotion earlier this month. Under current law, residents must register to vote 21 days before an election to participate in that election. Mukherji’s proposal would allow people to register to vote at an early voting site during the early voting period or at their polling place on Election Day, and then vote. They would be required to produce an ID, like a driver’s license, or proof of address, like a utility bill. A previous version of the bill was set to be heard by a Senate committee in March 2022, but the hearing was canceled by Senate leadership. Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) has previously expressed opposition to same-day voter registration.</p>

Kathy Hochul signed legislation to assist New Yorkers<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/bronx/politics/2023/11/17/hochul-signs-ballot-legislation-"> in understanding proposed constitutional amendments and other questions</a> that are put on voters’ ballots in New York state. The legislation states that any proposed amendments or other ballot measures must be explained using language that is “plain and clear,&#8221; allowing voters to fully grasp the practical impact of adopting or rejecting the measure being proposed to them. Hochul touted the move as an effort to ensure a level playing field when New Yorkers head to the polls. “Generations of Americans have fought for the right to vote, and New York is doing our part to ensure access to the ballot box is fair and equitable,&#8221; Hochul said. &#8220;I proudly signed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York into law last year, and am pleased to enact this new legislation which will ensure New Yorkers are informed and protected when they cast their vote on proposed constitutional amendments.” The legislation lies out specifics for the language used when amendments and questions are put up for a vote, stipulating that all ballot language be written at or below an 8th grade reading level, and also must be written in a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; format, so all citizens have a fair opportunity to confidently cast their ballots.</p>

<p>Attorney General Kris Mayes announced that an Arizona grand jury has indicted Cochise County Supervisors Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd for<a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/11/29/arizona-cochise-county-supervisors-indicted-refusing-certify-2022-election/"> conspiracy and interference with an election officer</a>, both felonies. Crosby and Judd, the two Republicans on the three-member board both refused to certify, or canvass, the county’s election by the Nov. 28, 2022 deadline in state law, twice voting against the canvass. The Nov. 27 indictments in Maricopa County Superior Court came after the supervisors were ordered to appear at a state grand jury hearing on Nov. 13, under subpoenas issued by Mayes’ office in October. Judd’s subpoena was first reported by Votebeat. The indictment alleges that on or between Oct. 11, 2022 and Dec. 1, 2022, Judd and Crosby “conspired to delay the canvass of votes cast” and “knowingly interfered with the Arizona Secretary of State’s ability to complete the statewide canvass,” according to a news release from the Attorney General’s Office. “The repeated attempts to undermine our democracy are unacceptable,” Mayes wrote. “I took an oath to uphold the rule of law, and my office will continue to enforce Arizona’s elections laws and support our election officials as they carry out the duties and responsibilities of their offices.”</p>
<p>Secretary of State Adrian Fontes is seeking the legal opinion of Attorney General Kris Mayes on whether Tucson’s ballot measure regarding salary raises for the Mayor and Council is<a href="https://news.azpm.org/p/azpmnews/2023/11/28/218317-az-secretary-of-state-seeks-legal-advice-on-tucsons-city-council-salary-raise/"> subject to a recount under state law</a>. Proposition 413 narrowly passed. “The margin of votes cast was 289 votes; an amount less than ½ of the 1% of the total votes cast for the Proposition,” Fontes wrote to Mayes. According to state law, “a recount of the vote is required when the canvass of returns in a primary or general election shows that the margin between the two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes for a particular office, or between the number of votes cast for and against initiated or referred measures or proposals to amend the Constitution of Arizona, is less than or equal to one-half of one percent of the number of votes cast for both such candidates or on such measures or proposals.”  In his letter to Mayes, Fontes noted that he lacked the authority to provide Tucson’s City Attorney Mike Rankin with a legal opinion, and instead asked Mayes to.</p>

In a ruling that springs from an Arkansas redistricting case, the 8th Circuit ruled that private entities cannot bring lawsuits under a provision of the law, known as Section 2. If it stands, the decision would dramatically weaken what remains of the Voting Rights Act, passed in 1965 to counter racial discrimination in elections. In a 2-1 decision, the judges said the “text and structure” of the voting rights statute shows that Congress did not give private plaintiffs the authority to sue. The appellate panel affirmed a 2022 ruling by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Arkansas that held only the US Justice Department can bring Section 2 lawsuits. That ruling runs counter to decades of legal practice, however.  The vast majority of cases brought under the Voting Rights Act – which prohibits election rules that have the intent or effect of discriminating on the basis of race – are brought by private plaintiffs, with the Justice Department facing strained resources and other considerations that limit the number of such cases it files to, at most, a few each year. The case at hand centers on a challenge originally brought by the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel to Arkansas’ state House map.  The ruling immediately affects the seven states covered by the 8th Circuit: Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. And it comes as the 2024 presidential campaign heats up.</p>
<p>Attorney General Tim Griffin<a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/11/29/arkansas-ag-rejects-proposed-measure-to-conduct-elections-via-hand-marked-paper-ballots/"> rejected two proposed constitutional amendments</a> to remove voting machines from Arkansas’ election process. One proposal would require hand-marked, hand-counted paper ballots, while the other would create absentee ballot procedures.  Griffin cited several reasons for rejecting the proposed popular name and ballot title of both initiatives, including a lengthy popular name, “partisan coloring language” and ambiguities. Conrad Reynolds, chief operating officer of Restore Election Integrity Arkansas, the ballot question committee behind the proposed amendments, said the decision was expected and the proposals will be revised. “We anticipated that and so we’re fully prepared to move forward,” Reynolds said. If Griffin approves the updated submissions, the group must then collect 90,704 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the 2024 ballot.</p>

The lawsuit, filed on Nov. 22, makes real the previous legal warnings of top state officials and civil rights nonprofits that have also argued against the proposed requirements. A City Council majority in October approved placing ballot measures before voters that include asking if they want to implement voter ID and local monitoring of ballot drop boxes and update local flag laws. “Democracy works best the more that people vote,” said Mark Bixby, who is bringing lawsuit. “California has been a leader in making it easy to vote. All of that is really great stuff. The City Council, however, wants to roll back that progress. They want to erect barriers to discourage people from voting.” The lawsuit asks a judge to remove the charter amendment measures from ballots for the March 5 primary election. It argues that having a voter ID law would violate the state constitution and would “discriminate against minorities, senior citizens and voters with disabilities.” Bixby’s lawsuit also asserts that the city was late in posting the charter amendment language for public review. “For unknown reasons, the city posted a ‘corrected’ version of the City Council resolution, stating that there had been a ‘clerical error.’ The city’s action creates a serious doubt about whether the City Council even properly adopted the election resolution.”</p>

Clark’s<a href="https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=26317691"> order</a>, which was filed Nov. 17, came shortly after attorneys representing Bridgeport election officials asked him to extend the time absentee ballot applications would be available. In a nine-page<a href="https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=26315267"> memorandum</a>, attorneys for Registrar of Voters Patricia Howard and Town Clerk Clarence Clemons asked Clark to allow absentee ballot applications to go out starting Dec. 1. If Gomes wins the primary, there will definitely be a second general election.  But attorneys for both Ganim and Gomes have stated previously that they believe if Ganim wins the second primary that he is elected mayor, but the secretary of the state raised the possibility that there would need to be a second general election no matter what happens on Jan. 23.

Stark pleaded guilty in August to one count of threatening use of a telecommunications device. He was sentenced Wednesday in federal court in Georgia. In a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said threats of violence against election officials are “dangerous for our democracy.” “This sentence should serve as warning — illegal threats against the public servants who make our democracy work will be met with the full force of the Justice Department,” Garland said. Stark&#8217;s two-year sentence was at the higher end of the 18-24 months’ imprisonment federal prosecutors recommended in court documents.</p>

The jury spent about five hours deliberating. Prosecutors say Taylor took advantage of other Vietnamese immigrants by illegally filling out election forms and ballots. Her husband, Jeremy Taylor, lost a GOP primary for the U.S. House and won election to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors in 2020. During closing arguments, the prosecution added the case was important because voter fraud jeopardizes the foundation of democracy in the United States and damages the public trust in the electoral process. They added that Kim Taylor has worked on campaigns since 2008 and knew the difference between right and wrong. Kim Phuong Taylor was indicted in January on 26 counts of providing false information in registering and voting, three counts of fraudulent registration and 23 counts of fraudulent voting. She entered a not-guilty plea. Taylor faces up to five years in prison on each count. A sentencing date hasn’t been set.</p>

After the initial vote count, Nickelson lost by one vote. Following a recount where each candidate gained three votes, Nickelson still lost by one vote. According to KQAD, Nickelson’s petition describes a<a href="https://www.redriverradio.org/news/2023-11-29/lawsuit-claims-election-violations-irregularities-in-caddo-sheriffs-race"> litany of issues</a> arising from the Saturday, November 18 runoff election; issues that he contends robbed him of becoming the next sheriff of Caddo Parish, instead of Democrat Henry Whitehorn. “What we discovered, Jeff, was that many ballots, absentee ballots, which the registrar of voters accepted and counted in this election, were either not signed by a voter at all, or were not witnessed at all.” Nickelson says his lawsuit spells out what he calls “a large number of serious irregularities.” One example he cites is that two people voted twice. Another is the number of people who turned out to vote but allegedly were not permitted to do so. “Finally, there is a law directed to prevent vote harvesting,” Nickelson explains, “which says that no witness to an absentee ballot can witness more than one ballot of a non-immediate family member. And we found instances of individuals witnessing many ballots of non-immediate family members. So, all those problems we uncovered in just a very short amount of time.” Nickelson’s lawsuit asks the judge to either declare a winner based on a corrected count of ballots or call for a new election. Some observers may consider an unsigned or unwitnessed absentee ballot as a mere technicality.</p>

Klavans ruled in favor of state elections officials in a<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/11/29/judge-backs-state-elections-boards-rejection-of-hancock-early-voting-site/"> lawsuit over the proposed location of an early voting center</a> in one Washington County town. Earlier this year, the Maryland State Board of Elections rejected a request to locate one of two required centers in the county in Hancock. Plaintiffs in the case, including one Republican Washington County commissioner and the spouse of a Republican Hancock councilmember, alleged the board owed more deference to the proposal made by local elections officials. The plaintiffs also asked the judge to invalidate the vote based on several alleged procedural missteps including violations of the Maryland Open Meetings Act. Klavans rejected those arguments. In granting the board’s request for summary judgment, Klavans said the board was in “substantial compliance” with state election laws and regulations. Klavans added that the state board must consider local preferences but is not bound to “blind deference.” “There has to be a strike zone that the state board can undertake in order to reach its determination as to whether to approve,” Klavans said in his ruling from the bench. “I think in this case, it’s clear from the affidavits and from the other materials supplied here, that the state board undertook a thorough and adequate analysis of the local board’s recommendation and reached a decision not to approve…on that basis.”</p>

The state Republican Party filing notes the issue is spilled milk with the election over, but says the high court should make a ruling to prevent future problems and because the issues are “of great public interest.” It said conflicting court actions on election night caused confusion and run the risk of “sowing public doubt about the reliability of election results.” On Nov. 7, there were numerous reports of Hinds County precincts running out of ballots or not having proper ballots, and voters reportedly waited in long lines or left without casting ballots. The state Democratic Party filed for an emergency order in chancery court to keep Hinds County polls open an extra hour that night. Chancellor Dewayne Thomas granted the order. But in a separate case filed that night by Mississippi Votes, a Jackson nonprofit organization, in Hinds County Circuit Court, the Mississippi Supreme Court appointed a special judge, former Supreme Court Judge Jess Dickinson, to hear the matter. Dickinson issued an order that simply repeated existing state law: that people who were in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m. could vote if they remained in line. In a petition filed this week with the state high court, the Republican Party argued chancery court lacks jurisdiction to be involved in such issues, that it should have been given notice of the Democratic Party’s petition that night, and that there is a lack of evidence that the ballot shortage was widespread or caused problems for many voters. The petition describes the “unknown and possibly surreptitious nature” of the Democratic Party’s filing that night.</p>

The Missoula County Election Integrity Project, a local election-conspiracy group,<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/07/07/trump-backed-gop-group-sues-missoula-county-for-20-election-despite-no-evidence-of-fraud/"> initially filed the lawsuit</a>, but asked to be dismissed as a party to the lawsuit prior to answering discovery. The group claimed vote-count video supported its false theory of ballot-stuffing and a 6% margin of error, contrary to research conducted by the Missoula County Republican Central Committee that found a .09% margin of error in tracking ballots. Plaintiff John Lott, who continued the allegations the local Republicans made, claimed Missoula County failed to preserve “snapshots” of the voter database, violating Montana’s records retention law and federal requirements. But the county said the Secretary of State’s Office manages the voter database and the county follows the office’s guidance on retaining data. Larson said the county had no access to the information Lott was seeking and had no way to provide the information, as it was controlled by the Secretary of State’s office and “any relief requested from the court is more appropriately directed to the Legislature.” Lott is also known for research on guns, although his work has been discredited by officials at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research whose director, Daniel Webster, has publicly stated Lott makes things up.</p>
<p>The Montana Supreme Court<a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2023/11/22/montana-supreme-court-sides-with-backers-of-top-four-primary-ballot-initiative-overrules-attorney-general/"> overturned a decision by Montana Attorney General</a> Austin Knudsen to block from the ballot in 2024 a citizen initiative that would create top-four primary elections in the state.  In a unanimous ruling, Chief Justice Mike McGrath wrote that the attorney general erred in determining that the initiative violated the Montana Constitution’s prohibition on “log-rolling,” or bundling multiple unrelated amendments into a single measure for voters to approve, and ordered Knudsen to refer the initiative to Montana’s top election administrator, the secretary of state. Ballot Initiative 12, as it is now called, would, for most offices, replace Montana’s current system of partisan primary elections with an open primary in which the four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election regardless of party. “Ballot Measure 12’s primary purpose is to constitutionally mandate a top-four primary for specified offices,” Deputy Solicitor General Brent Mead wrote in the legal review of the initiative. But its full text “then adds numerous provisions that are not closely related to the creation of a top-four primary.” Montanans for Election Reform challenged the legal determination in court, arguing that each of the initiative’s components is essential to its overall functioning.  The Montana Supreme Court apparently found that argument persuasive,  The court heavily relied upon its September opinion in<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/montana/supreme-court/2023/op-23-0331.html"> Monforton v. Knudsen</a>, in which it upheld the attorney general’s decision to void a previous ballot initiative on the same grounds he used to invalidate the top-four initiative. McGrath wrote that he concurred with Montanans for Election Reform’s argument that “a reasonable signature cap is essential to ensuring that the Legislature cannot functionally convert a top-four primary into a top-two primary by requiring onerous signature gathering that would serve to bar candidates from the ballot,” and thus that “the signature-gathering limitation is not a separate function but is rather … an integral part of the top-four primary system BI-12 proposes. “We thus disagree with the attorney general that the signature-gathering limitation is not closely related to the remainder of BI-12,” the ruling continues.</p>

HB 892 was signed into law on May 22, 2023 with the stated purpose of preventing people from voting twice in the same election, an action which is already prohibited under Montana and federal law. But HB 892 goes much further than this. HB 892 makes voters and voter registration organizations responsible for ensuring that registration applicants somehow deregister from a previous address. Furthermore, HB 892 could punish voters who do not provide detailed information—even if it is unintentionally omitted—about their previous place of residence when applying to register to vote.  Under HB 892, if a voter trying to register is not able to comply with these requirements, they risk felony prosecution, including penalties of up to 18 months in prison, fines up to $5,000, or both.  “We agree that voters should not vote twice in the same election, but HB 892 goes beyond penalizing double voting to threaten the act of registering to vote itself,” said Nancy Leifer, president of the League of Women Voters of Montana.  “HB 892 weakens democracy in Montana by discouraging voters from registering to vote. It also threatens the critical voter services work the League does for voters across the state. The League is ready to defend the rights of Montana voters and protect their freedom to vote.”</p>

The two groups, along with five individuals, are suing the state Board of Elections, claiming that voters cannot independently and privately verify votes they cast through the machines – a requirement under state law. The state Board of Elections approved the ExpressVote XL machines earlier this year. But since their approval, no local Board of Elections has purchased the machines. The new lawsuit seeks to block localities from buying them and putting them into use in the 2024 elections. “The certification of the ExpressVote XL – an expensive and below standard voting machine – was a major step backwards for New York, and an exceedingly poor decision ahead of the 2024 presidential election year when election security remains a fraught topic,” Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, said in a statement. “Paper ballots marked by the voter – which New York currently uses – are the preferred election security standard.” A key part of their argument, and the basis of the new lawsuit, is that voters can’t adequately verify that their ballot is correct before submitting it. Whereas with a hand-marked paper ballot that a voter can ensure they marked the correct candidate, voters cannot view their ballot with ExpressVote XL. Instead, they can review a ballot summary card based on their electronic touch screen selection, printed based on bar codes associated with candidates in the machine.</p>

The lawsuit filed on Nov. 20 claims Senate Bill 758, which established the new district map lines, “unlawfully deprives Black voters of the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.” In particular, plaintiffs Rodney Pierce and Moses Matthew, claim the bill is in<a href="https://www.cbs17.com/news/north-carolina-news/federal-lawsuit-claims-redrawn-nc-senate-districts-violate-voting-rights-act/"> violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</a> According to the lawsuit, the bill was enacted despite having “ample evidence of racially polarizing voting and a history of discrimination in the ‘Black Belt counties’ of northeastern North Carolina.”  Having such evidence, the plaintiffs said there is an obligation under the Voting Rights Act to analyze it before drawing lines.  The passage of the new maps is also considered in the lawsuit to be the “the most recent episode in North Carolina’s long history of race discrimination generally and race-based vote suppression in particular.” Following the filing of the lawsuit, Pierce and Matthew are seeking an order that would: declare that SB 758 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, prohibit future elections to be conducted under SB 758, and require a remedial plan that includes a minority opportunity district in N.C.’s “Black Belt” counties. The lawsuit names President Pro Tem of the N.C. Senate Phil Berger and N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore as defendants along with the entire N.C. State Board of Elections, including Alan Hirsch, Chairman Alan Hirsch, Secretary Jeff Carmon III, and members Stacy Eggers IV, Kevin Lewis, and Siobhan Millen. The plaintiffs have asked the court to move forward on an expedited timeline, asking for a decision on their request for a preliminary injunction by Friday, Dec. 1. Candidates are scheduled to begin filing to run for office on Dec. 4. Judge James Dever<a href="https://myfox8.com/news/politics/your-local-election-hq/judge-declines-request-to-speed-up-north-carolina-redistricting-case/"> rejected the request to speed up a lawsuit</a> regarding the new election districts Republicans drew for the state Senate, calling that request “meritless.”  Dever is declining to take any action ahead of Dec. 4 when candidates will begin filing to run for office for 2024.  Dever questioned why the plaintiffs waited nearly four weeks after the General Assembly voted on the new districts to file their lawsuit and ask the court to issue a preliminary injunction.</p>

Welte said the redrawn legislative districts violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The ruling came months after a<a href="https://apnews.com/article/spirit-lake-turtle-mountain-north-dakota-redistricting-fb0dce4fa157c4710fa80e1bacfb0c3d"> trial</a> held in June in Fargo. The decision could lead to another surprise special session of the Legislature. In his ruling, Welte said the plan approved by the state Legislature to redraw voting districts in accordance with the latest census data “prevents Native American voters from having an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice” &#8211; a violation of the landmark civil rights law. Welte gave the Republican-controlled Legislature and the secretary of state until Dec. 22 “to adopt a plan to remedy the violation.” The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe alleged the 2021 redistricting map “simultaneously packs Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians members into one house district, and cracks Spirit Lake Tribe members out of any majority Native house district.” The two tribes sought a joint district and unsuccessfully proposed to the Legislature a single legislative district encompassing the two reservations, which are roughly 60 miles (97 kilometers) apart. Following the 8th Circuit’s ruling in Arkansas, North Dakota has<a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-to-appeal-ruling-that-threw-out-2021-redistricting-map"> filed an appeal</a>.</p>

According to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office, Berkowitz was indicted on one count of election fraud. The prosecutor’s office said Berkowitz registered to vote in Ohio on September 15, 2020. On October 20, 2020, Berkowitz signed his Ohio mail-in ballot, the prosecutor’s office said. On September 30, 2020, Berkowitz registered to vote in Arizona and on October 13, 2020, he signed an Arizona mail-in ballot, the prosecutor’s office said. He mailed in his Arizona ballot and dropped his Ohio ballot off at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections office, the prosecutor’s office said. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office Bureau of Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation. Berkowitz’s arraignment is set for Friday, December 8 at the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court.</p>

The date a voter writes on the envelope they return a mail ballot in is “immaterial” to its eligibility, Baxter ruled. Under the materiality provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Baxter said ballots should not be rejected over what is essentially a technicality that isn’t related to the voter’s eligibility. “There are many reasons to date a document,” Baxter wrote, adding, “Dates may also be wholly irrelevant, as in this case. The requirement at issue here is irrelevant in determining when the voter signed their declaration.” The ruling in the complicated and long-running case could still be appealed within 30 days. If it stands, it means counties would no longer be forced to disenfranchise voters for failing to date their mail ballot or using a date previous courts have found to be outside an acceptable time range.</p>
<p>A group of 12 Delaware County residents has<a href="https://www.delcotimes.com/2023/11/18/group-files-suit-against-delaware-county-to-recount-votes-of-nov-7-election/"> asked for a recount of 14 precincts</a> in a move that county officials say is an “effort to undermine democracy” while at least one petitioner has said county officials are acting as tyrants and bullies. The suit was filed on Nov. 15 in Delaware County Court of Common Pleas and seeks to have recounts done in 14 of the 430 precincts in the county, including the approximately 38,500 mail-in ballots processed at the central counting center in Chester. Delaware County Solicitor William F. Martin called the suit “harassment” among other things. “What is the purpose of this?” he asked. “The purpose is harassment. They’re the same baseless complaints about mail-in voting that we’ve been hearing since November of 2020 … There is just the usual parade of conspiracy theories regarding mail-in votes.” “Apparently the only logic to the selection of the precincts is ones where they could find three voters to sign the petition,” Martin said, adding, “This will be a profound waste of county money, a profound waste of county assets, wasting the time of the election staff.”</p>

The League of Women Voters of Tennessee, along with Ashe and Phil Lawson, argue that the new law creates confusion and could discourage voters who do not want to register with a party from exercising their right to vote. This new law, which took effect in May, requires election officials to place a sign at every polling place warning voters that to vote in a party’s primary, they must be a “bona fide member of or affiliated with” or “declare allegiance” to that party or else face criminal prosecution. Additionally, the lawsuit also contends that there is no provision in state law that defines what a “bona fide” party member is, nor how voters would affiliate or “declare allegiance” to a party in order to avoid risk of prosecution.  Tennessee currently has partially open primaries, allowing voters to select which party primary they want to vote in at the polling place. “This new law will have a chilling effect on Tennesseans exercising their right to vote and creates unnecessary confusion for voters,” said Debby Gould, President of the League of Women Voters of Tennessee. “The League of Women Voters will continue to fight to ensure that all voters are empowered at the ballot box and can feel confident in their right to vote.”</p>

The county had hoped to stop the measure Texas Republicans passed this year that abolished the Harris County elections administrator, an appointed position, and returned election duties to two elected officials, the county clerk and the tax assessor-collector. However, Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee called the case “moot” because the county was already forced to comply with the law starting Sept. 1. Though more than half of Texas counties have an appointed elections administrator, the new law applies only to Harris County, which created the office in July 2020. The new state law went into effect shortly before the start of early voting in this year’s November election. Menefee had argued that the law violated the Texas Constitution by targeting just one county. A district judge agreed with Menefee in August, temporarily delaying the measure from going into effect and writing in her order that Harris County should not be forced to implement “an unconstitutional statute” that was designed “to deprive Harris County of a statutory right available to every other county in Texas.”  When the Texas Attorney General’s Office appealed that ruling, the Texas Supreme Court decided the law could go into effect as planned and was scheduled to hear the county’s argument next Tuesday that the law was unconstitutional. The county instead made a motion to dismiss the lawsuit days before that hearing. “The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in August allowed the state to abolish the elections administrator’s office,” Menefee said in a statement. “That mooted the county’s claims. I look forward to continuing to support County Clerk Teneshia Hudspeth in elections moving forward.”</p>

Schimel granted a permanent injunction “which will contain substantially the same terms” as a temporary injunction he granted in October of last year, giving a win to the conservative group that spearheaded the lawsuit against the practice known as “ballot spoiling.” Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections brought its lawsuit in September 2022 on behalf of Waukesha County voter Nancy Kormanik, claiming the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission unlawfully advised municipal clerks and the public in a memo and a press release in August of that year that ballot spoiling was permitted. In his decision, Schimel said Wisconsin laws holding that absentee voting is a privilege, not a right, are unambiguous and contain no language “that would authorize the scheme whereby a clerk spoils the ballot for the elector, at their request, and sends out a new blank ballot for a do-over.” Discussing whether Kormanik had standing to sue as a lone taxpayer, Schimel found that, under binding precedent, Kormanik “has at least a trifling interest in her voting rights,” especially given that the Wisconsin Legislature’s policies have made clear its commitment to guarding against voter fraud. “Why would they do that? Because election fraud cannot be repaired. Once it happens, people are disenfranchised by improperly cast votes. A candidate will get votes improperly, and there is no way to adjust the vote count,” Schimel said. The Legislature concluded the dangers of fraud from absentee voting require strict rules and safeguards, Schimel noted, and if the rules are violated by any ballot cast, that ballot may not be counted. “That is arguably a harsh rule, because it could result in a voter not having their vote counted, and it might not be the fault of the voter that the procedures were not followed. The point: WEC and all election clerks had better get it right, or voters will be disenfranchised. This court had better get it right, too,” Schimel said</p>
<p>Paul Buzzell, 52, of Mequon, who<a href="https://madison.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/ballot-voting-selfie-crime-port-washington-ozaukee/article_23c77326-8d71-11ee-9ffe-07dc2d5b125c.html"> posted a photo of his marked ballot</a> on Facebook during the April 2022 election had felony charges against him dropped this week. Buzzell had faced maximum penalties of 3½ years behind bars and $10,000 in fines. Buzzell, a member of the Mequon-Thiensville School Board, would have also been barred from holding elected office if convicted. Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy dismissed the charges against Buzzell in a hearing, saying a state law prohibiting voters from showing their marked ballots to anyone else is in violation of the constitutional right to freedom of speech. Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol, who brought the charges against Buzzell, promised to continue pursuing the case by asking Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul to review the judge’s decision and decide whether to file an appeal.</p>

Next year’s mayoral election in Burlington, Vermont, will be conducted using ranked-choice voting. And Idaho citizens may be voting in 2024 on a ballot initiative to consider opening its partisan primaries. Various states, counties, and municipalities are enacting systemic election reforms, aiming to improve governance by altering the incentives of candidates running for elected office. These reforms include preferential voting (e.g., ranked-choice voting), open primaries, jungle primaries and runoff elections, proportional representation, and nonpartisan redistricting. Where are these reforms occurring, and what concerns are prompting these changes? Join AEI’s Kevin R. Kosar and a panel of experts for a discussion on how efforts to enact systemic election reforms might shape the future of American politics. <strong>When:</strong> Dec. 4, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>

<p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/events/how-alaskas-electoral-reform-could-help-heal-divides-in-american-democracy/">Is Alaska the Secret to Saving American Democracy?</a>: American democracy is in crisis. The country has become deeply divided along partisan lines, causing Americans to turn against each other. Compromise has become scarce, while threats of political violence have risen. But there’s hope in an unlikely place: Alaska. In 2022, Alaska completed its first election under its new electoral system, known as “Final Four.” This electoral system consists of a nonpartisan, “top four” open primary, in which any individual regardless of political party affiliation can cast their vote for their preferred candidate in each race. The top four candidates then move on to the general election, where they are voted on via ranked choice voting. This reform provides voters with more choices in the primary election and a greater ability to express their preferences at the general election. Early results indicate this reform can decrease polarization and help incentivize consensus building and more bipartisan governing. Please join the Center for American Progress for a conversation about the impact of Alaska’s electoral reform, featuring three Alaska state legislators from across the political spectrum: state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel (R), state House Minority Leader Calvin Schrage (not affiliated), and state Rep. Genevieve Mina (D). <strong>When:</strong> Dec. 12, 2pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</p>
