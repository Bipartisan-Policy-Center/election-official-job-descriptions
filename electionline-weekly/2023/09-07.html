							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Back to school</strong><br />
<em>Talking about civics without going over their heads</em></p>
<p>Kristen Cambell, CEO<br />
Philanthropy for Active Civic Engagement</p>
<p>Philanthropy for Active Civic Engagement (PACE)’s<a href="https://www.pacefunders.org/language-register/"> Civic Language Perceptions Project</a> is a three-year exploration into what Americans think about terms that are commonplace in “professional” civic spaces but perhaps not the everyday word choice of many people– terms like democracy, privilege, and pluralism. When we launched the project, we hoped it would ultimately tell us (and others) whether our neighbors are familiar with these terms and how to use this language without going over people’s heads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10108" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PACE-300x132.png" alt="" width="300" height="132" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PACE-300x132.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PACE.png 568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Why study Americans’ perceptions of civic language? Because studies suggest that an informed vernacular about civic life in America is becoming increasingly rare. Many Americans lack knowledge about even the most basic facts about their government. For example, the latest round of the<a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/political-communication/civics-knowledge-survey/"> Annenberg Public Policy Center’s annual survey</a> found that less than half (47%) of U.S. adults could name all three branches of government, down from 56% in 2021, and fewer Americans could name any of the five rights protected by the First Amendment in 2022 than in 2021.</p>
<p>Coupled with reduced civic knowledge is<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/bigideas/the-need-for-civic-education-in-21st-century-schools/"> decreased engagement in civic behaviors</a>, whether it be participation in community organizations or elections – especially among young Americans. School-based civic educational experiences are inconsistent (or non-existent)<a href="https://civxnow.org/our-work/state-policy/"> in many states</a>, and we also know declines in<a href="https://medium.com/office-of-citizen/how-we-know-journalism-is-good-for-democracy-9125e5c995fb"> media and journalism</a> contributes to a lack of civic knowledge as well. Many are pointing out the stakes of revitalizing civic knowledge and engagement in our country: Without it, we will struggle to<a href="https://civxnow.org/stronger-civics-an-antidote-to-threats-to-democracy/"> defend democracy</a> and<a href="https://theconversation.com/americas-founders-believed-civic-education-and-historical-knowledge-would-prevent-tyranny-and-foster-democracy-162788"> prevent tyranny</a>.</p>
<p>Our study produced thousands of data points (16,000 pages, actually!), and we<a href="https://medium.com/office-of-citizen/a-year-of-civic-language-explorations-28e3b3db5e43"> analyzed it through</a> focus groups, mini-grants, and many other mechanisms. To understand the results even more deeply, we hosted five “Civic Language Solution Sprints” that invited over 50 funders, practitioners, and thought leaders to discuss their experiences around the thorniest civic language perceptions emerging in the study, such as perceptions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young people are negative about “democracy”</li>
<li>Some words are “owned” by certain people or groups</li>
<li>The term “civic” is not landing</li>
<li>Civic terms are favored by historically “dominant” identities</li>
<li>There is a disconnect between professional usage and public perception of civic language</li>
</ul>
<p>These conversations led to many lessons for those of us who are trying to motivate or mobilize everyday people toward strengthening democracy. Here are three our team has been sitting with.</p>
<p><strong>Start with language already in people’s vocabulary</strong><br />
As one participant stated (paraphrased): “We need to get away from civic words that are ‘buzzy’ to words that have application outside the civic field, and to do that, we need to engage the audiences we seek to engage in the language creation process.” Many people shared that an effective strategy toward this is to start with their current understanding of concepts and connect deeper terms to the frameworks they already know. This requires a listening posture and the ability to translate their words and experiences to civic language.</p>
<p>An example of this came from a group that coordinated a youth civic engagement event. After talking with youth leaders, they decided that instead of calling it a “civic engagement event,” they would brand the event as “Do you hear me now?” which more directly connected with young people’s desire to be heard, seen, and valued as active community contributors–all things that civic engagement embodies.</p>
<p><strong>Deconstruct terms and paraphrase quickly<br />
</strong>For better or for worse, one of the ways participants have navigated civic language challenges is to use the term, and then quickly get to explaining what they mean by the term in plain, non-technical language. Here are specific examples that came up throughout our sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>By bridging, we mean putting people who don’t agree with each other in the same room.</li>
<li>By democracy, we mean how you govern your own life and participate in community, not just a form of government.</li>
<li>By pluralism, we mean how we are many people, living and working together.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our fast-pace media environment where time to explain what you mean is not always afforded, taking opportunities to clarify terms is vital, otherwise people may draw their own conclusions about what they think you mean, which can lead to misinterpretation or even disengagement.</p>
<p><strong>Focus less on building shared language and more on building shared experiences<br />
</strong>Many participants across our sessions acknowledged that while we are talking about language challenges, they are a symptom of a larger issue: Americans have fewer shared contexts and experiences through which to engage with other people, especially those who are different from them. As one participant said, “I see this as part of the broader fracturing of the information environment. Different communities are using different information sources, coming to different facts/conclusions, using different language.”</p>
<p>However, there is hope. One helpful piece of advice provided during a sprint is to pair words together that appeal to “opposite” groups. For example, groups might experiment with using democracy (rated more positively by liberals, Democrats, upper class, and urban respondents) and liberty (rated more positively by conservatives, Republicans, working class, and rural respondents) in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>I hope that sharing some of the wisdom that we gathered from civic leaders in the field provides guidance and food-for-thought as you navigate your specific civic language challenges. From here, PACE will continue to explore civic language and Americans’ perceptions and associations of the words that fuel our civic lives.

The study calculated and analyzed turnout rates using two critical denominators — eligible citizens and active registered voters —  for 42 states for which sufficient age-related data was available. Young voters aged 18-34 — overall and by key race and ethnicities — had significantly higher turnout rates in the cohort of 10 Vote at Home states and Washington, D.C., that automatically mailed ballots to all active registered voters in 2020. Using Citizen Voting Age Population (CVAP) and Active Registered Voter (ARV) datasets from a Voter Participation Center study and a significant list vendor (Catalist), the research team first examined overall 18-34 turnout rates. Six of the top 10 states for eligible citizen turnout in 2020 – and eight of the top 15 for active registered voter turnout –were Vote at Home jurisdictions. Only one Vote at Home state (Nevada) was a 2020 battleground state; most others failed to make either list. To further analyze turnout rates of 18-34 year old white, Black, and Latino voters, the nine Vote at Home jurisdictions with available data were compared with four other cohorts. These were the seven 2020 battleground states that didn’t use this approach; ten non-Vote at Home states with Same Day/Election Day (SDR/EDR) registration policies; ten non-Vote at Home states with Automatic Voter Registration (AVR); and the remaining 16 states with none of these policies. Of the 32 possible turnout rate comparisons, using both the CVAP and ARV denominators, Vote at Home states triumphed, in all 32 instances, often by dramatic margins. “Despite billions spent by the major political parties on media ads, voter registration drives, and other Get out the Vote efforts targeting young voters, it was non-battleground, Vote at Home states that dominated the list of Top Turnout states for young voters in 2020,” said Barbara Smith Warner, NVAHI Executive Director. “While SDR/EDR and AVR policies also seem to boost young voter turnout,  their impact appears to be a fraction of the turnout increase that happens when states automatically deliver ballots to all voters, especially young voters,” said Phil Keisling, chief author of the study. Keisling chairs NVAHI’s Board and served as Oregon Secretary of State from 1991-99.</p>

Other counties reporting door-to-door issues include<a href="https://midhudsonnews.com/2023/08/30/board-of-elections-warns-residents-of-scammers/"> Dutchess</a>,<a href="https://www.informnny.com/abc50-now/election-worker-impersonator-trend-present-in-jefferson-lewis-and-st-lawrence-counties/"> Jefferson</a>,<a href="https://www.informnny.com/abc50-now/election-worker-impersonator-trend-present-in-jefferson-lewis-and-st-lawrence-counties/"> Lewis</a> and<a href="https://www.informnny.com/abc50-now/election-worker-impersonator-trend-present-in-jefferson-lewis-and-st-lawrence-counties/"> St. Lawrence</a>. Kathleen McGrath, director of public information at the New York State Board of Elections, told Capital Tonight that none of the voters that were approached committed a crime and had no demographic or political connections, the<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2023/09/01/new-york-state-board-of-elections-warns-of-impersonation-scam"> only thing in common was that they had moved</a>. “We are extremely alarmed by these actions. These individuals are impersonating government officials in an effort to intimidate voters based on inaccurate and misleading information,” said Raymond J. Riley III, co-executive director of the<a href="https://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/state-beware-of-false-elections-officials/article_2a9e3658-476c-11ee-8467-c76cb3305270.html"> State Board of Elections</a>. “We strongly encourage those engaging in these activities to cease immediately.” Criminal impersonation in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor in New York. “The State Board of Elections remains in close communication with the County Boards and law enforcement to monitor this situation,” the release said.</p>

During an event at Capital High School in Charleston, Rico Franquez became the 100,000th student to register to vote since Warner took office in 2017. Elections Divisions Director Brittany Westfall, and County Clerk Vera McCormick joined Warner to talk to students about the importance of civic engagement. The event also celebrated U.S. Sen. Jennings Randolph who worked to pass the 26th Amendment. Randolph was a West Virginia native and represented the state from 1958 to 1985. Warner said that West Virginia has a legacy of getting young people involved in politics. He named Saira Blair the youngest legislator ever elected, and Caleb Hanna as the youngest African American elected to office.  “When people hear about other 18 and19 year olds getting elected to office, they’re like, well, I could do that, too. And that’s the importance of coming out and telling that story and making them feel part of this proud legacy that West Virginia has,” Warner said.</p>

Passed as an “urgency” measure since election season is fast approaching for November local jurisdiction elections, as well as the start of candidate filing for the nationwide Presidential Primary in March, the bill goes back to the Assembly to receive concurrence with Senate amendments. Then it will make its way to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk by Sept. 8 for a final decision. AB 969 previously passed the State Assembly on April 27 by a vote of 62 – 9. It was amended slightly while in the Senate.</p>

The legislation started as a petition. Morrow City Council Member Van Tran and volunteers went door-to-door getting enough signatures to get the petition on the city council&#8217;s table.  City Council members then voted in an August 8 meeting to make the petition a referendum, which would have put the proposed question of &#8220;Should the City of Morrow use bilingual ballots on all future city elections?&#8221;  to a vote on an official ballot in the November 2023 city election. A Clayton County attorney then shut this plan down after they said they would &#8220;instruct the Clayton County Elections superintendent to not all the question&#8221; on the ballot.  Leaders felt they were left no other choice which led them to vote at an August 22 meeting to cancel that referendum and make the proposal an ordinance where it passed unanimously.</p>

Another bill to put in place a primary, but in March, is also being circulated by a north Idaho lawmaker. Because the Legislature seemingly inadvertently eliminated a presidential primary in an attempt to move the election to May, the Idaho Republican Party approved a caucus process if a March primary isn’t reinstated by the Legislature. Leaders in the Idaho Senate are circulating draft legislation to create a presidential primary in May, however parties would still have the option to hold a caucus instead at their own expense. Previously, Idaho’s presidential primary was held in March. Lawmakers introduced legislation this year to move the election to May, estimating that consolidating the election would save the state up to $2.7 million. The bill, HB 138, passed 61-6 in the House and 23-11 in the Senate. However, the way the legislation was written actually eliminated the primary, so a trailer bill was introduced to fix the issue. The trailer passed through the Senate but died in a House committee.</p>

House Speaker Tim Moore later told reporters that the bill needed a few tweaks before it would be ready for a vote, although the details of those pending changes weren&#8217;t clear. At the same time, the delay came as protesters arrived at the legislature to decry the proposed measure. Some groups had announced their intention to disrupt the voting session in protest, and there was an elevated police presence at the legislature when the decision was made to delay the vote. The bill&#8217;s GOP sponsors say Senate Bill 749 is needed to improve people&#8217;s trust in election integrity. But professional election administrators have objected, saying the legislation will create chaos and deadlock if it becomes law — harming people&#8217;s faith in the integrity of elections, rather than improving it. The main change in the now-delayed elections bill would be to end the state&#8217;s rule, in place for all of modern history, that whichever party controls the governor&#8217;s office gets a majority on the State Board of Elections as well as on individual county election boards. Right now, because Cooper is a Democrat, Democrats have a 3-2 advantage on the state and local election boards. The bill currently under consideration would create evenly split boards — with equal numbers of members from both major political parties.</p>

Michele Reynolds (R-Canal Winchester) has introduced legislation that would make some<a href="https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2023-09-06/new-ohio-bill-would-close-primaries-and-change-the-voter-registration-process"> key changes to the current voter registration process</a>. For starters, it would close primaries in Ohio. Right now, a voter can go into a polling place and vote in the party primary they choose on that day. After doing that, they are considered a member of that party until they vote in a different party&#8217;s primary. Voters can also be considered unaffiliated years after they stop voting in primaries. &#8220;It closes our primary system so whoever is registered within 30 days of the election, whatever party they are affiliated with, they are able to vote in that party&#8217;s primary,&#8221; Reynolds said. &#8220;But they are not allowed to vote in that party&#8217;s primary if they are not affiliated with that party.&#8221;  The bill would also allow Ohioans who don&#8217;t want to be affiliated with a political party to declare themselves unaffiliated in real time by simply filling out a form. The bill is new and while<a href="https://ohiosenate.gov/legislation/135/sb147"> SB 147</a> has been introduced, it has not yet been assigned to a committee.</p>

The Senate State Government Committee unanimously approved a bill that would move the primary up from April 23 to March 19, a change that would be effective only for next year’s election. The current primary date conflicts with the Jewish holiday of Passover, and the three other states that had primaries scheduled for the same day have already moved their dates. Some observant Jews would be unable to vote in person on the holiday.  The effort to move the primary has strong bipartisan and bicameral support in Pennsylvania, but the exact date it would be moved to is unclear.</p>

David Cole resigned from his seat after applying to<a href="https://whnt.com/news/alabama-news/alabama-rep-david-cole-tells-court-he-plans-to-plead-guilty-in-voter-fraud-case/"> plead guilty to a voter fraud</a> felony charge. Court records show Cole’s plea agreement calls for him to serve 60 days in the Madison County Jail. The plea agreement says Cole agrees to a three-year prison sentence which is split between the 60-day jail term with the remainder on probation. The plea agreement also says Cole agrees that the 60 days in jail is a “material part” of the plea agreement and the state agrees to not bring any additional charges based on his past conduct known to the state. It also includes Cole’s agreement to resign from office and pay back all money he earned as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives.  The agreement says in 2021 Cole planned to run for the District 10 seat but also knew because of redistricting his residence — which was in District 10 — might end up being in another district.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/court-rejects-alabamas-latest-congressional-map-failing-add/story?id=102931542"> unanimously struck down Alabama&#8217;s recently redrawn congressional map</a>, finding that the GOP-drafted plan did not comply with the Voting Rights Act as it did not create a second district in which Black voters would likely be able to elect their preferred candidate. Court-appointed experts will now draw a new map for the 2024 elections. Alabama is expected to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The state Legislature had passed their latest congressional map in late July, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a month earlier that the previous map violated the civil rights law. But the revised plan only included one majority-Black district, with a second district that had less than 50% Black residents. The federal ruling that originally struck down Alabama&#8217;s map in 2022 ordered the Legislature to draw &#8220;two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.&#8221; In their sharply worded opinion on Tuesday, the federal panel disagreed. &#8220;Law requires the creation of an additional district that affords Black Alabamians, like everyone else, a fair and reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The 2023 Plan plainly fails to do so,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco and U.S. District Judge Terry Moorer wrote. The judges wrote that they were &#8220;deeply troubled&#8221; that Alabama lawmakers enacted a map that disregarded the findings in 2022.</p>

Rissi was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for death threats against Arizona&#8217;s former attorney general and a Maricopa County election official over the 2020 election. Rissi threated to “lynch” an election official. On or about August 2, 2022, Russel left a threatening voicemail on the Arizona secretary of state’s voicemail. He had plead guilty to sending threatening communications to an election officials. “The Justice Department has no tolerance for illegal threats that target those who administer our elections, and it will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute such criminal conduct,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Yavapai County Superior Court Judge John Napper, said state law is “clear and unambiguous” that election officials<a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2023/09/06/arizona-judge-rules-common-practice-of-validating-ballot-signatures-illegal/"> must compare the signatures</a> on the envelopes with the voter’s actual registration record. And that, he said, consists only of the document signed when a person first registered along with subsequent changes for things like altering party affiliation. And what that means, the judge said, is it is illegal for county election officials to instead use other documents to determine if the signature on that ballot envelope is correct and should be accepted. Napper’s conclusion is not the last word. Strictly speaking, he only rejected efforts by Secretary of State Adrian Fontes to have the lawsuit by two groups challenging the process thrown out. Napper has not issued a final order. “We look forward to the issue being litigated,” said Paul Smith-Leonard, spokesman for Fontes. But the judge, in his ruling, made it clear that he is not buying arguments by the secretary of state that the rules in the Elections Procedures Manual allowing the comparison of signatures against other documents – the practice now widely in use – complies with what state law clearly requires.</p>

She is scheduled for an eight-day jury trial in February. “This case needs to go to trial,” said 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barrett after denying requests from Peters’ attorney to push the trial back to accommodate a tight schedule. The charges follow a grand jury indictment filed in 2022 by citizens who had elected Peters as county clerk and recorder.</p>

Bolden granted the motion to dismiss based on the argument of DeFilippo’s lawyer, Francis O’Reilly that there is no federal constitutional right to vote and have one’s vote counted in state or municipal elections and primaries. DeFilippo still faces trial on Sept. 18 on identity theft and fraudulent registration offenses, which carry a maximum of five years in prison.</p>

Bailey alleges that fourteen votes were cast by four voters who don’t live in Atlantic City’s Second Ward, with at least seven of them residing at Dunston’s home address. Other allegations involve controversial former City Council President Craig Callaway, who served as the assistor for 26 voters who told election officials they needed help due to a disability.  Bailey says three voters didn’t complete the required disability certificates, and claims others did not have the disability they claimed. In court filings, Bailey’s attorney, Daniel Antonelli, provided examples of some voters who certified that they needed Callaway’s assistance because they could not read the ballot and were active Facebook users.   He said that 35 disability certificates “contain irregularities that require further examination in order to protect the public interest in the outcome of the election.” And at least four vote-by-mail ballots were not filled out by the voter, Bailey claims.</p>

In Aug. 23 filings, the Campaign Legal Center on behalf of the League moved to intervene in a lawsuit brought by a local election official and a conservative legal organization. The League argued its interests as a voter advocacy organization with multiple members that vote by mail should give it standing to intervene in the case. But state Election Director Erika White and the Secretary of State’s office argue that White’s defense applies to all North Dakota residents as it is focused on protecting state law, which isn’t “limited to certain individuals.” Burleigh County Auditor Mark Splonskowski and the Public Interest Legal Foundation filed the<a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/burleigh-county-auditor-sues-to-ban-north-dakota-from-counting-late-ballots/article_12e0a71e-1ccc-11ee-913c-d31cfeb22faa.html#tracking-source=article-related-bottom"> initial suit</a> in early July against White.

The group claims the legality of mail-in voting has been defined extensively in other courts, with other suits failing to find conflicts between federal and state election laws. The state recognizes the impact of a dismissal will impact White and the League in different ways, but it argues that the defense, which is “focused on protecting a validly enacted state law,” adequately represents the League’s interests.</p>

In June, a federal judge in Richland ordered the parties to begin discussing a settlement in order to avoid an October trial and potential federal intervention, according to court documents. Then two weeks ago U.S. Judge Mary Dimke ruled against the counties in their request to dismiss the lawsuit. And on Tuesday, Benton County agreed to settle the case for $75,000.</p>

Conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed a lawsuit in Sept. 2022 asking a judge to declare the National Mail Voter Registration Application illegal in the state. The lawsuit alleged that the form doesn&#8217;t include places to fill in information such as whether a voter has been convicted of a felony and how long they&#8217;ve lived in their district. The lawsuit goes on to argue that the Wisconsin Elections Commission never authorized the form&#8217;s use and never developed administrative rules governing its use. WEC attorneys argued that the form was approved by an election agency that preceded the commission. Maxwell ruled that the WEC never authorized it and never promulgated any administrative rules governing its use. WEC attorneys couldn&#8217;t produce any credible evidence on when, where or how the form was approved, he added. With that settled, he said, there was no need to determine whether the form complies with Wisconsin law.</p>
