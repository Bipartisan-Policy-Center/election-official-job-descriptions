														<p><strong>Election Trust Initiative launches</strong><br />
<em>Grantmaking organization is partnership of 4 nonprofit foundations</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9615" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-300x68.png" alt="" width="300" height="68" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-300x68.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-1024x232.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-768x174.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-1536x348.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-2048x464.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Philanthropy and nonprofit organizations have played a crucial role in an area that is often overlooked in the election ecosystem: that of research and development.</p>
<p>And now four nonprofit foundations are joining forces as <a href="https://www.electioninitiative.org/">The Election Trust Initiative</a> to provide funding to “strengthen the nonpartisan evidence, organizations, and systems that help local and state officials operate secure, transparent, accurate and convenient elections.”</p>
<p>The Election Initiative Trust is a nonpartisan grant-making subsidiary of<a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/"> The Pew Charitable Trusts</a> with founding partners that include<a href="https://www.klarmanfoundation.org/"> The Klarman Family Foundation</a>, the<a href="https://www.pgpf.org/"> Peter G. Peterson Foundation</a> and the<a href="https://hewlett.org/"> William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>. Each partner has made an initial five-year $25 million commitment.</p>
<p>“The Initiative is a grant-making organization that is a partnership across four nonprofit foundations that have come together around a shared, long-time commitment to strengthen the field that supports election administration in the United States,” explained Ashley Quarcoo, executive director of the Initiative.</p>
<p>Quarcoo noted that the elections field is under a lot of stress right now and has endured unprecedented pressures in recent years. She noted that elections officials have had to move mountains to deliver elections under extraordinary conditions.</p>
<p>“We think that there is an important role philanthropy can play to support nonpartisan organizations that are supporting the elections community in their work,” Quarcoo said.</p>
<p>Given the current environment surrounding<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/prohibiting-private-funding-of-elections"> private funding for elections</a>, Quarcoo stressed that no grants are made to state or local elections offices or officials.</p>
<p>In advance of launching the Initiative, Quarcoo said the foundation partners have been doing a lot of listening to the field, a lot of engagement with officials, policymakers and nonprofits that lead them to learn what are the needs in the field and where the Initiative may add value.</p>
<p>Some of those areas are around strengthening and supporting the workforce, building the research, helping to support the dissemination of best practices and strengthening the peer-to-peer networks to find resources.</p>
<p>Grants are offered by invitation only and so far some of the organizations the Initiative have supported include: The<a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/"> Election Integrity Partnership</a>,<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group</a>,<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/"> MIT’s Election Data and Science Lab</a>,<a href="https://namle.net/"> The National Association for Media Literacy Education</a>,<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/"> The National Conference of State Legislatures</a> and the<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/"> R Street Institute</a>.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever it is important that election professionals are supported. We need to establish steady funding streams for the actual conduct of elections&#8211;but just as important is the support necessary to build out research, to provide tools to increase efficiencies and efficacy, to keep the field current with training and information,” said Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for Programs,<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/index.php"> The Election Center</a>. “This is where philanthropy shines. Until and unless all levels of government decide to fully fund our elections and the professionals doing the job, we will remain reliant on other support. Thankfully, there are organizations and individuals who are stepping forward, stepping up.”</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Electionline.org is a current project of The Election Center and a past project of The Pew Charitable Trusts. Electionline has also received funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.</p>

In the report, McGregor recommended that the county either replace some of its printers or make other changes, such as changing the ballot paper thickness or changing and increasing testing. According to Votebeat, McGregor briefed the supervisors in an executive session just prior to the report’s release. In an initial response to the report, County Supervisors Chairman Clint Hickman said the county should replace its equipment. “We’ll make changes to best serve voters, starting with replacing some equipment,” he wrote in a news release. McGregor found that it was the factors combined for the first time — the county switching from 80 to 100-pound paper between the 2020 and 2022 elections, and then switching from 19 to 20 inch ballots between the 2022 primary and general elections — that caused the problems on Election Day. McGregor also found that the county’s testing was not robust enough to catch the problem, which didn’t show up during early voting because the county doesn’t tabulate ballots on-site during early voting.</p>

The county board of supervisors voted unanimously to allow the clerk’s office to move forward with negotiations and an agreement with Hart InterCivic for new equipment and services. Even though the county will move to hand counting, state and federal law and the secretary of state have indicated all counties must have some equipment to scan and serialize each ballot and equipment to print ballots. &#8220;This is essentially inventing a new way of counting ballots kind of from the ground up,” Shasta County Clerk Cathy Darling Allen said. “We have a lot of help. The secretary of state is working very diligently on draft regulations which will go through the regulatory process.&#8221; Three different vote-counting machines were tested during last month’s local elections in<a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/ballot-machines-election-new-hampshire-50534951"> New Hampshire</a> and all handled the complicated town meeting ballots just fine, according to reports from election workers. More tests are set during May elections as the state decides how to replace its aging AccuVote machines.<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2023/04/10/bergen-county-to-spend-15m-on-new-voting-machines-by-june-election/70084554007/"> Bergen County, New Jersey</a> will borrow $15 million to replace its 30-year-old voting machines in time for the June 6 primary election. The Bergen County Board of County Commissioners approved a bond ordinance that will pay for 1,200 ballot marking devices and 650 tabulators from Dominion. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/voting-equipment-and-check-in-upgrade-funded-in-georgia-budget/3S3HNXRGDFCFJJZYYKTF5SCHOY/">Georgia</a> legislators approved half the money needed to replace heavy voting equipment across the state, along with additional funding for a quicker voter check-in process and election investigators. The most expensive elections purchase in the state budget was $2 million for new power supply devices that connect to voting machines in precincts across the state. The<a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2023/04/12/electoral-board-votes-approve-upgraded-voting-machines-ahead-november-election/"> Richmond, Virginia</a> electoral board recently supported the purchase of new equipment which General Registrar Keith Balmer likened to upgrading your PlayStation. “What that means is that this machine is faster. It means that it will process the ballots faster and that we will be able to report our results faster, so that’s going to be very exciting,” Balmer said.</p>

NBC News has an in-depth look at what happened in<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/buckingham-county-virginia-election-staff-quits-baseless-voter-fraud-rcna76435"> Buckingham County, Virginia</a> that left the elections office without any staff, the electoral board with only two current members and residents on both sides of the aisle expressing frustrations with the county’s ability to conduct upcoming elections. Ongoing concerns about the staffing of the elections office in<a href="https://www.montanarightnow.com/great-falls/election-protection-committee-formed-in-cascade-co-after-concerns-raised-regarding-clerk-and-recorder/article_f5a89e4e-d97e-11ed-83fd-9f3edfc5d64b.html"> Cascade County, Montana</a> has concerned citizens forming an Election Protection Committee. &#8220;We&#8217;re a citizen group that is devoted to monitoring the continued actions of Sandra Merchant. At this point I think we know it&#8217;s a dire threat to our democracy,” Jasmine Taylor, a member of the Election Protection Committee said. And changes to elections laws have forced<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/michele-bissonnette-wareham-town-clerk-resigns-mail-in-ballots-early-voting/"> Wareham, Massachusetts</a> Town Clerk Michele Bissonnette to step down. Bissonnette told the local CBS affiliate that she doesn’t have enough funding or staff to effectively execute the new VOTES Act. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved this job as town clerk, and lately, because of the changes and with the unfunded mandates they&#8217;re making, I don&#8217;t enjoy this job anymore, and when your elevator reaches your top floor, get off,&#8221; said Bissonnette.</p>

These estimates are based on voter file data aggregated by Catalist, as opposed to our earlier, exit-poll based estimates from immediately after the 2022 election. Our key data and findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Youth Turnout: 23% &#8211; That&#8217;s lower than in the historic 2018 cycle (28%) which broke records for turnout, but much higher than in 2014, when only 13% of youth voted.</li>
<li>Top Turnout States: Michigan had the highest youth turnout in the country (37%), with Minnesota, Maine, Oregon, and Colorado also above 30%.</li>
<li>Lowest Turnout States: Oklahoma, Alabama, Indiana, West Virginia, and Tennessee all had youth turnout at or below 15%.</li>
<li>Election Policies Matter: Many of the states with the highest youth turnout have policies like automatic and same-day registration that make it easier for young people to register and vote. Many of the states with lower turnout do not have these policies in place or have restrictions like voter ID laws.</li>
<li>Four States Surpassed 2018: Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, and Arkansas were the only states to have a higher youth turnout in 2022 than in 2018. In those first three states, Democrats won competitive statewide races for governor and/or U.S. Senate.</li>
<li>Upward Trend Since 2014: All but one state for which we have data (Louisiana) had higher youth turnout in 2022 than in 2014, suggesting a broad trend of increased youth voting over the past decade.</li>

She was 101. According to the Naples News, the retired Sarasota school principal’s secretary started working the polls for Lee County Elections in 2002. “There was a need for it, and I was available,” she told The News-Press in April 2022. “It’s something that I enjoy doing.” From that point on, Craig worked every single election at the Lee County Elections Office in Fort Myers — or wherever else they needed her — even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. She usually served as a precinct deputy greeting people at the door outside the polling room, but she also checked voter registration and helped people with voting machines. “I’ve done everything,” Craig said last year. “I really have.” In an emailed statement, Lee County election supervisor Tommy Doyle said he and his staff were saddened to hear about Craig’s death. “She was our county’s and the state’s oldest poll worker at 101,” Doyle said. “Vera brought positive energy and a joyful disposition to every election. She will be greatly missed by all of us at Lee Elections.” Doyle said he emailed every elections supervisor in the state to confirm Craig&#8217;s unique status in Florida. He couldn&#8217;t find any poll worker who was 100 — Craig&#8217;s age at the time — or older. “They said they had voters that were 100,” he said, “but no poll workers.” Craig last worked an election in August 2022 for the Lee County primaries, according to Gaby Aguirre, a communications specialist for the Lee County Elections Office.</p>

The bills include<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/summary/H.HB2415_040523_TRANSMITTED.pdf"> HB2415</a> would have removed voters from the Active Early Voting List if they fail to cast a ballot for a single election cycle, cutting the timeframe in half. Hobbs also vetoed<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/summary/S.2322ELEC.pdf"> HB2322</a>, which sought to regulate signature verification for early ballots, and<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/summary/S.1074ELEC_ASPASSEDBYCOW.pdf"> SB1074</a>, which addressed tabulation equipment. Majority Republicans passed two of the vetoed election bills with party-line votes, but the signature verification bill picked up 16 Democratic votes in the House.</p>
<p>Hobbs also vetoed a bill that would have banned<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/04/12/hobbs-vetoes-bills-to-bar-ranked-choice-voting-criminalize-immigrant-aid-groups/"> ranked choice voting</a>.<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/79045?SessionId=127"> House Bill 2552</a> sought to outlaw ranked-choice voting in Arizona, despite the fact that it isn’t used anywhere in the Grand Canyon State. The measure was a priority for the legislature’s far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus, whose members oppose an effort by voter organizations to put the voting style on the 2024 ballot.  Critics accused lawmakers of attempting to preserve the current highly partisan voting environment they succeed in by tying the hands of Arizonans who might, in the future, seek to experiment with different voting methods.  In her veto letter, Hobbs pointed out that ranked-choice is used successfully in other states, and called the bill an unnecessary effort, given that it doesn’t yet exist in Arizona.  But the voting method may yet be banned in Arizona: Republican lawmakers have already approved legislation amending the state constitution to bar any attempt to implement ranked-choice voting anywhere in the state, even at the local level. Voters will decide the measure’s fate in 2024.</p>

One provision of the bill would work to improve voter access on tribal lands by expanding the state’s automatic voter registration system to include lists provided by tribal councils. It would be the first program of its type in the country. Right now, eligible voters are automatically registered to vote when they interact with the DMV. Additionally, there would be more places to vote in person on tribal lands, both before and on Election Day. “We have, I would say, one of the best election systems in the country. It’s proven to be very accessible. It’s proven to be very secure. But obviously we can always make improvements, and so just about every year I introduce a bill to make those small improvements,” Senate President Steve Fenberg, a Boulder Democrat, told reporters. In the 2022 general election, there were 688 active voters living on Southern Ute tribal land in La Plata County and 1,162 active voters living on Ute Mountain Ute tribal land in Montezuma County, according to the secretary of state’s office. The bill also aims to increase access for other potentially underrepresented voters by increasing the number of drop boxes and voting centers on college campuses.</p>

Indiana House members voted 64-30 along party lines in favor of the bill previously endorsed by the Senate. The vote sends the<a href="https://beta.iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/house/1334/details"> bill</a> to Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb for his consideration. The bill which would require Indiana voters submitting a paper application for a mail ballot to include a photocopy of a government-issued identification card or at least two ID numbers, such as their 10-digit driver’s license or the last four digits of their Social Security number. The changes would take effect July 1 and be required for mail-in ballots cast in this fall’s city and town elections around the state. Democratic Rep. Tonya Pfaff of Terre Haute said she believed it was “unnecessary to make it more difficult” for older voters and those in the military to cast ballots by mail. “It won’t make elections safer and only serves to hamper democracy,” Pfaff said.</p>

Andrews said it would provide more accountability for people in those positions of power. Maine is the only state whose Legislature elects its attorney general and treasurer, and only one of three states that elect the secretary of state in the same way. Emily Cook is the communications director for Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and said the secretary of state&#8217;s office is not taking a position on this bill. &#8220;If the Legislature chooses to make that change, our elections division stands ready to run an election. We&#8217;re pretty good at that,&#8221; Cook said.</p>

The bill included several amendments added in the House of Delegates. One amendment approved Monday clarifies that those exempted from the wear and carry permit law includes security guards, correctional officers and employees of an armored car company.</p>

The provision is part of a large elections bill, the Democracy for the People Act, (<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=HF3&amp;b=house&amp;y=2023&amp;ssn=0">HF3/</a><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF3&amp;b=senate&amp;y=2023&amp;ssn=0">SF3</a>), moving through the Legislature to strengthen and protect voting rights. The bill enacts automatic voter registration; allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote and protects voters, election officials and volunteers from intimidation and harassment. But the provision that James V. F. Dickey has in his sights would make it a gross misdemeanor — punishable by up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine — to intentionally spread false information within 60 days of an election about the “time, place or manner of holding an election,” restrictions on voter eligibility and threats to physical safety associated with voting. “I can almost guarantee that there will be a challenge to it,” said Dickey, senior trial and appellate counsel at the Upper Midwest Law Center, a conservative public interest law firm. “There’s been a lot of talk about why it’s not a good idea from a constitutional perspective.” Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, a national voting rights attorney and chief author of the bill, said the provision would protect voters from intimidation, harassment and anything that would hinder them from voting.</p>

It would also include election workers in a law that currently prohibits election officials from tampering with voting materials or looking at voters’ ballots. Over the past two years, local election workers in Montana have reported a spike in harassment and threats that mirrored an uptick in similar activities reported elsewhere in the country. The previous Commissioner of Political Practices, Jeff Mangan, had pushed for the legislation after his office received calls from local election officials reporting incidents of harassment after the 2020 election. The bill passed 57-43, with Democrats and less than half the GOP representatives in support. It needs to withstand a final vote in the House before transmitting to the governor’s desk for his approval.</p>

Instead, it allows any witness to verify a voter’s identity. That means caregivers, significant others, volunteers or even friends could help you to vote by viewing your ID and giving their signature. The Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee will be meeting within the next few weeks to settle the language of the bill. Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, a member of the committee, said she’s encouraged by the other senators’ willingness to accept criticism about earlier proposals. She said they’re working on creating a final version of the bill that is more acceptable to everyone to increase the chances of getting it passed.</p>

Exceptions under the proposed legislation include law enforcement officers while exercising their official duties and a private security guard hired by the owner of the property where the election site is located. The bill also aims to clarify provisions of a bill passed during the 2021 legislative session. Assembly Bill 286 bans the sale and possession of firearms that lack serial numbers, and the current bill would revise the definition of “unfinished frame or receiver” referenced in the law. Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Henderson, and other groups raised concerns about whether voting locations would become targets for those wishing to perpetrate violence because the locations would be gun free zones. Other groups raised concerns about those who may accidentally enter a polling place located in a public place, like a grocery store, while in possession of a firearm. Jauregui said an amendment to the bill is currently in the works which would mandate signage for polling places to prevent individuals from accidentally walking into polling places with a firearm.</p>

In addition, the bill would also expand the election employees allowed to request their personal records, as well as their families be kept confidential through the Department of Motor Vehicles.

House Election Laws Committee Chairman Ross Berry, R-Merrimack, proposed Tuesday to graft this proposal onto a Senate-passed bill (SB 70) to create a voter information portal that would permit citizens online to more easily register to vote, update their information or request absentee ballots. The state Senate earlier killed separate legislation (SB 73) to permit the use of Help America Vote Act (HAVA) money for voting machines while Berry&#8217;s House committee decided to retain its own legislation on the topic (HB 447) until early in 2024. Berry said he was hoping his gambit could permit both these ideas to become a reality. Senate Election Laws and Municipal Affairs Committee Chairman James Gray, R-Rochester, said the Senate remains dead-set against using HAVA grants so communities could replace their AccuVote machines, the only technology allowed for cities and towns that don&#8217;t have paper balloting.</p>

The legislation sponsored by Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, would prohibit ranked-choice and approval voting systems throughout North Dakota. An amendment to the bill to grandfather Fargo&#8217;s approval voting system failed in the House. Approval voting allows voters to select as many candidates for an office as they like. The Senate passed the bill in a 33-13 vote last week, while the House approved the legislation with a 74-19 vote in February. Both margins clear the two-thirds majority threshold that lawmakers would need to replicate to override Burgum&#8217;s veto. “Home rule authority applies only to local elections,” he wrote, adding legislators were demonstrating a lack of respect for local control. The House<a href="https://www.kvrr.com/2023/04/10/north-dakota-house-overrides-veto-of-bill-to-ban-approval-voting-now-goes-to-senate/"> voted to override</a> the governor’s veto.

SB 166 would make it a Class C felony with a sentence of up to five years behind bars, a fine of $125,000 or both. Election workers in Oregon, including those in Lane County, signed their support of the bill, saying in a written statement, &#8220;Election workers across the country have increasingly been subjected to harassment and other hostile behavior&#8230; the Oregon Association of County Clerks supports the goals and objectives of the Secretary of State with regard to election worker safety and ballot security.&#8221; SB 166 was introduced on the House Floor for a first reading on April 6.</p>

Scott Conklin (D-Centre County) announced the reintroduction of his ballot<a href="https://www.abc27.com/local-news/state-rep-introduces-bill-on-ballot-pre-canvassing/"> pre-canvassing legislation</a>,<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2023&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0847"> House Bill 847</a>, which would allow ballots to be pre-canvassed up to seven days before elections. Current Pennsylvania law dictates that absentee and mail-in ballots cannot be pre-canvassed until 7 a.m. on Election Day. “With more and more people voting by mail-in ballot, tabulating ballots and releasing election results is taking county boards of elections much longer,” Conklin said. “In House State Government Committee hearings we heard from numerous experts, including county election officials from both parties, who testified that our state should allow counties to pre-canvass mail and absentee ballots much earlier than the morning of the election.” There has been bipartisan support for the legislation across the Commonwealth. House Bill 847 also plans to increase election security before Election Day, increase transparency for viewing the pre-canvass and actual canvass of ballots, and notify anyone with minor defects to ballots so they can be corrected before Election Day.</p>

Davis said during a pretrial hearing that Fox News would have to pay for any last-minute additional depositions that Dominion would need to do before the case is set to head to trial next week. Dominion did not immediately make clear if any such depositions were needed. &#8220;If there is a deposition that needs to be done, it will be done,&#8221; Judge Eric Davis said. &#8220;Fox will do everything it needs to make the person available, and it will be at the cost of Fox.&#8221; The  judge said he would &#8220;most likely&#8221; appoint a special master to &#8220;do an investigation&#8221; into whether representations by Fox made to the court as part of the case were &#8220;untrue or negligent&#8221; &#8212; including a certification it had made in December that it had essentially completed its discovery process in accordance with the case. The special master was already involved in the case to oversee the discovery process, but the new investigation will determine &#8220;what sanctions could be implemented&#8221; against Fox, the judge said &#8212; a significant development on the eve of trial. &#8220;This is very serious,&#8221; Davis said of the issue.</p>

Turner was indicted earlier this year on charges of voting more than once, which is a misdemeanor, and harvesting ballots, a felony. Fourth Judicial Circuit Judge Marvin Wiggins dismissed charges on April 6 following a request by state prosecutors, court records show. The charges were initially brought by former District Attorney Michael Jackson, who lost his reelection bid to Turner’s cousin. Turner was accused of “stuffing” ballot boxes at a Perry County polling place in the May 2022 Democratic primary. He was also accused of mailing a large number of absentee ballots in November’s general election. Turner’s parents were unsuccessfully prosecuted for voter fraud by then-U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions in the 1985. He was first appointed to the commission in 2000 to serve the remainder of his father’s fourth term of office after his death. He has since won multiple re-elections.</p>

Last year, Republican county supervisors Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd initially refused to certify the canvass of the countywide election results, jeopardizing the state certification process and risking the votes of thousands. To defend their refusal, the two cited bogus allegations that the county’s electronic tabulators weren’t properly certified. Both the secretary of state and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans, which joined the lawsuit against Crosby and Judd, filed to request reimbursement of their attorneys fees and court costs. McGinley approved part of that request. Secretary of State Adrian Fontes was awarded $13,143, despite petitioning for more than $17,000. The Alliance, which originally filed for more than $34,000 was awarded just over $23,000.  McGinley rejected arguments from Crosby and Judd that election lawsuits shouldn’t be subject to attorney fee repayments, and that taxpayers should bear the brunt of the cost, calling their arguments “unavailing.”</p>
<p>The Attorney General filed a<a href="https://news.azpm.org/p/news-articles/2023/4/6/215513-ag-asks-for-injunction-in-cochise-elections-case/"> motion for a preliminary injunction</a> on the agreement the Cochise County Board of Supervisors approved with their County Recorder in February to make the recorder the interim elections director. The filed motion by Arizona’s head attorney claims that the board’s agreement with its county recorder “has no statutory basis and threatens the right of Cochise County residents to have their elections conducted lawfully and transparently.” “The State has brought this action to prevent and redress those harms,” the motion read. “But the Court cannot un-ring the bell for the County’s voters once Defendants begin implementing the Agreement and exercising (or abdicating) authority thereunder in connection with the upcoming special election … the State respectfully asks the Court to preliminarily enjoin Defendants from implementing the Agreement.” The special election is set to occur on May 16. If granted, the injunction would prevent the board from implementing the agreement to make the Recorder the interim elections director until a final resolution is reached in court.</p>

Peters was sentenced to 120 hours of public service for recording a separate court proceeding on an iPad. The judge also sentenced her to four months of home detention with electronic monitoring and ordered her to pay $786.35 in restitution. Her attorney, Harvey Steinberg, said Monday that he planned to appeal the entire case. When officers tried to take possession of that iPad at a shop in Grand Junction, she refused to hand it over.</p>
<p>A jury convicted 52-year-old Kirk Wertz of<a href="https://coloradosun.com/2023/04/12/jena-griswold-threat-conviction/"> retaliating against an elected official</a> for threatening Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold in a phone call to the Democrat’s office.  Wertz told Colorado State Patrol troopers investigating the threat that he called the Elections Division of the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office on June 30, two days after the 2022 primary, and told a worker to “tell the secretary that the angel of death is coming for her in the name of Jesus Christ.”  District Court Judge Darryl Shockley will sentence Wertz on Monday. Retaliation against an elected official is a Class 6 felony, punishable by up to four years in prison and/or a fine of $100,000. Wertz has been held in the Denver Downtown Detention Center since July 6 on a $2,000 bond, jail records show. At one point, a mental health stay was instituted in the case and later lifted, court records indicate.</p>

The initiative would replace Central Maine Power and Versant with a &#8220;consumer-owned&#8221; power company, Pine Tree Power. In the ruling, the state Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling stated the wording was not &#8220;understandable to a reasonable voter reading the question for the first time.&#8221; When reached for comment, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows&#8217; office said they were still reviewing the decision, but &#8220;respect the court&#8217;s direction.&#8221;</p>

Assignment Judge Stuart Minkowitz set an April 28 hearing date today to decide if Andrew Agliata can be on the ballot as a candidate for county clerk in the GOP primary.  Nominating petitions filed by Agliata and his running mate, county commissioner candidate Robert Snyder, were rejected because of issues related to their circulators. Minkowitz set a briefing schedule that ends on April 24, four days before the April 28th hearing. County clerks are required to commence the mailing of vote-by-mail ballots on April 22. The sluggishness of Minkowitz’s schedule stands in sharp contrast to the efficiencies of state administrative law judges who heard legislative petition challenges this year within one business day and then made quick rulings. “I am appealing the decision made by the Morris County Clerk’s office in regards to three objections made against my petition to run for Morris County Clerk on the grounds that the decision was not impartial,” Agliata said in his court filing. Citing the delays, this week Agliata<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/local/candidate-drops-court-challenge-says-judges-delay-doomed-his-campaign/"> dropped his bid</a> for the clerk’s position.</p>

This case arises from whether certain redistricting changes violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Welte ruled that defendant Michael Howe, the secretary of state in North Dakota, failed to prove his argument under existing case law. The state constitution requires that district boundaries be redrawn after the census. After the government released its 2020 census, a special session of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly was convened to start the redistricting process. It passed House Bill 1504, and it was signed by Governor Doug Burgum on Nov. 11, 2021. Welte based much of his ruling on Thornburg v. Gingles, the United States Supreme Court case. It identified three preconditions, also known as the Gingles factors, that must be initially satisfied to proceed with a Section 2 voter dilution claim.</p>

Glenn Youngkin to decide<a href="https://apnews.com/article/glenn-youngkin-voting-rights-restoration-lawsuit-virginia-1a872daa518baef1c7d59a632da64d73"> which felons can get their voting rights back</a> is unconstitutional and could lead to decisions based on an applicant’s political affiliations or views, a lawsuit filed Thursday argued. Youngkin’s administration recently confirmed it had shifted away from an at least partly automatic rights restoration system used by his predecessors. The current process conditions the right to vote “on the exercise of unfettered official discretion and arbitrary decision-making,” in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the lawsuit argued.  “Officials with absolute authority to selectively enfranchise U.S. citizens with felony convictions may grant or deny voting rights restoration applications for pretextual reasons or no reason, while secretly basing their decision on information — or informed speculation — on the applicant’s political affiliations or views,” says the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Richmond.  The lawsuit was filed by the Washington-based Fair Elections Center on behalf of Gregory Williams, a convicted felon who has completed his sentence and has a restoration application pending, and Nolef Turns, a Richmond-based nonprofit that advocates for people with felony convictions.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2023/04/18/2023-eac-standards-board-annual-meeting">U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board Annual Meeting</a>: This meeting is in-person and open to the public. This meeting is to conduct an annual review the VVSG 2.0 Requirements and  implementation, review the status of the EAC’s e-poll book pilot program, discuss ongoing EAC programs, and address election official security and mental health concerns. This meeting will include a question and answer discussion between board members and EAC staff. Board members will also review FACA Board membership guidelines and policies with EAC Acting General Counsel and receive a general update about the EAC programing. The Board will also elect nine members to the Executive Board Committee. Background: On February 10, 2021 the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) announced the adoption of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0, the fifth iteration of national level voting system standards. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1. HAVA designates a 110-member Standards Board to assist EAC in carrying out its mandates under the law. The board consists of 55 state election officials selected by their respective chief state election official, and 55 local election officials selected through a process supervised by the chief state election official. <strong>When:</strong> April 18-19. <strong>Where:</strong> Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/disinformation-nation-how-partisan-politicians-distort-history">Disinformation Nation: How Partisan Politicians Distort History</a>: Misinformation is on the rise. From cable news to social media, we’re very aware that what we’re hearing or reading could be wrong. And it seems our skepticism of the right’s version of current events should extend to our history as well. A new book,<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/20454/9781541601390"> Myth America: Historians Take On the Biggest Legends and Lies About Our Past</a>, dispels many of the myths being pushed about our country’s past. In a collection of 20 essays from top historians, edited by Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer, this important text shows how those on the right have used revisionist history to fan the flames of politicization and unravel the seams of democracy.  Join us for a live virtual conversation on Thursday, April 20, at 6 p.m. ET with historians featured in the book, Yale University law and political science professor Akhil Reed Amar, Emory University African American Studies professor Carol Anderson, and Northwestern University associate professor Kathleen Belew, as well as editors and Princeton professors Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> April 20 at 6 pm Eastern.</p>
