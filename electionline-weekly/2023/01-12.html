														<p><strong>New Report on Enhancing Security and Integrity Through Rethinking Election Funding</strong></p>
<p>By: Ryan Williamson<br />
<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/">R Street Institute</a></p>
<p>A recent<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Enhancing-Security-and-Integrity-Through-Rethinking-Election-Funding.pdf"> report</a> published by the R Street Institute highlights the need for improved election funding and offers suggestions on <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9219" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Funding-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Funding-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Funding-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Funding.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />how to address funding shortfalls while improving election security and integrity. Though the 2022 midterm<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/20/halifax-foreign-allies-midterm-results-democracy-00069624"> elections</a> were secure and largely incident-free, many threats remain, especially as presidential elections draw<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/01/turnout-in-u-s-has-soared-in-recent-elections-but-by-some-measures-still-trails-that-of-many-other-countries/"> more</a> attention and voters. Therefore, it is not too early to begin supporting efforts to ensure safe and secure elections in 2024 through better funding.</p>
<p>Elections cost<a href="https://esra.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1556/2020/11/mohr.pdf"> billions</a> of dollars, and the price will only increase in future cycles. Unfortunately, elections in many jurisdictions are<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-local-election-officials"> insufficiently</a> funded, but there is general approval for the federal government to increase its support for elections. Around<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/17/election-officials-want-more-funds-combat-midterm-election-cyber-threats/"> three in four</a> election administrators of all political leanings would like to see more support from the federal government. And<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/NICD-June-27-Elections-Program-p47.pdf"> more than three in five</a> people support the federal government providing $500 million per year in election funds. This would represent a marked improvement over recent history, in which the federal government has appropriated funds amounting to<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-05/TheCostofConductingElections-2022.pdf"> less than one-tenth</a> of the cost of elections since 2018.</p>
<p>While it is important that Congress<a href="https://www.commoncause.org/press-release/75-million-election-funding-in-omnibus-for-states-a-down-payment-but-much-more-is-needed/"> provided</a> for some election security grants in the recent omnibus legislation, this irregular, unpredictable approach to funding is not ideal. Election offices around the country would benefit more from a reliable stream of funds that allows them to plan and budget according to their specific jurisdictional needs. And by providing funding well in advance of elections, offices would not have to give as much weight to the expediency of solutions and could instead give even greater consideration to cost and effectiveness. Regular funding also has the benefit of reducing the need for emergency spending when new, unforeseen issues such as a pandemic arise.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9220" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/R-St-300x198.png" alt="" width="300" height="198" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/R-St-300x198.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/R-St.png 382w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />With these things in mind, the report offers the following recommendations. First, state and federal governments should prioritize election funding. Too often elections are not a priority and offices are left making tough decisions about how to make ends meet, such has hiring fewer staff or relying on outdated technology, both of which present potential security concerns.</p>
<p>Second, states should adopt reforms that make spending more efficient and effective. For example, the recent runoff election in Georgia<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/us-senate-runoff-could-cost-georgia-taxpayers-tens-of-millions/K35XR72FQZFPFJMML7R6BV2EQY/"> cost</a> taxpayers over $10 million, which is money that could have been invested elsewhere if the state instead employed instant runoffs with ranked choice voting.</p>
<p>Third, the federal government should appropriate funds with as few strings attached as possible and conduct robust oversight and auditing. Being overly prescriptive in how funds can be spent can create confusion and slow down the procurement process for offices, as was the<a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/gao-eac-can-decide-on-state-funding-for-election-officials-security/"> case</a> recently when officials were unsure if they could spend security grant funds on physical security resources. Also, each jurisdiction has unique needs, and providing flexibility allows jurisdictions to find solutions that are best for them and their voters.</p>
<p>Finally, regardless of where the resources come from, the report suggests that “funds should be appropriated in predetermined amounts, at regular intervals and well in advance of Election Day to ensure that localities can plan and budget.” This allows jurisdictions to be proactive instead of reactive in addition to the benefits of regular funding discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Taken together, creating a better funding model for elections that involves all levels of government is an important step in resolving the various issues that jurisdictions face. This will then increase the security and integrity of elections, which represent the bedrock of our democracy.</p>

Among the elections officials and workers honored were Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss as well as Al Schmidt, former city commissioner with the Philadelphia County board of elections. &#8220;For the first time in my presidency, I&#8217;m bestowing the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of our nation&#8217;s highest civilian honors. It recognizes, &#8216;citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country, or their fellow citizens,&#8217; &#8221; Biden said during the ceremony at the White House. Biden’s full remarks from the event can be<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/01/06/remarks-by-president-biden-at-presentation-of-the-presidential-citizens-medal/"> read here</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s not exaggeration to say America owes you, owes you all — I really mean this — a debt, a debt of gratitude,&#8221; Biden said, &#8220;one we can never fully repay unless we live up to what you did.&#8221;</p>

The total delivered through the U.S. mail between Sept. 6 and Dec. 6 includes the Georgia runoff election for the U.S. Senate. The figure only includes ballots that used correct electronic identifiers and not those USPS diverted or handled outside normal processes to accelerate delivery. Between Sept. 6 and Dec. 6, the Postal Service delivered more than 54.4 million ballots to and from election officials to voters through the U.S. Mail to support elections across the country.</p>
<p>Of these ballots:</p>
<ul>
<li>98.96 percent of ballots sent by voters to election officials were delivered within three days</li>
<li>99.82 percent of ballots sent by voters to election officials were delivered within five days</li>
<li>99.93 percent of ballots sent by voters to election officials were delivered within seven days</li>
<li>Less than two days average to deliver completed ballots from voters to election officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>“These results speak for themselves. The Postal Service has performed at a very high level as it has done since the late 1800s. The entire team &#8211; from the Postmaster General, to the senior leadership team, to the 655,000 men and women of the Postal Service &#8211; is dedicated to ensuring excellence when it comes to delivering our nations’ election mail for the American people. And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve operational effectiveness of this critical service in future elections,” said Amber McReynolds, Chair of the USPS Board of Governors Election Mail Committee.</p>

According to IRG, this is not a total state-to-state comparison of election laws, instead, “We’re taking a different approach, but we’re also including their scores in our report to help show you how our initial state tiering compares. Most importantly, we’ll paint a legislatively-backed picture in our analysis to explain the why behind our differences with these scores.” Per the report: We consulted with our in-house experts, fellows, and advisory board to come up with something new in our annual Election Policy Progress Reports. These state-specific progress reports evaluate each state’s progress within its tier rather than compared against every single state. A state’s grade is based on its own unique existing election law landscape and, primarily, any legislative improvements it made or any setbacks it experienced in expanding voter access and improving election administration over the past two years. We chose a two-year review cycle to be able to consider the most recent state legislative changes while also allowing us to evaluate progress made by states that meet only biennially. According to the review, nine states got As and three got Fs.

McGregor didn&#8217;t waste any time getting started. She spent several hours last week at the county&#8217;s election center, Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson said. When complete, McGregor&#8217;s probe will produce a written report detailing what went wrong. It will be independent of an internal review already conducted by county staff, Gilbertson said. Moseley said, &#8220;The intention was always to have trust but verify and to have an outside group of eyeballs come in and take a look at this.&#8221;</p>

Three Republicans are set to introduce bills to repeal Alaska’s new<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2023/01/10/alaska-lawmakers-pre-file-bills-to-repeal-ranked-choice-voting/"> ranked-choice voting</a> and open primary election system, which were narrowly approved by voters in 2020 through Ballot Measure 2. Republican Reps. Sarah Vance and George Rauscher have legislation ready in the House of Representatives to repeal those changes; Wasilla Republican Sen. Mike Shower is set to introduce the same legislation in the state Senate. According to the Anchorage Daily News, while the House remains unorganized, an effort to repeal ranked-choice voting could face an uphill battle in the 20-seat Alaska Senate. Incoming Senate President Gary Stevens, a Kodiak Republican who heads the 17-member bipartisan majority coalition, said that it was his preference to keep the new election system. “I think that it worked fine,” he said. “And I think that we should give it a chance to see if it works in the future.”</p>

A bill isn&#8217;t yet filed with the Legislature, but in a news release, the secretary of state&#8217;s office said the measure would standardize the recount timeline across Iowa&#8217;s 99 counties, bolster recount boards in larger counties, and require more uniform methods for recounting, reconciling and reporting ballots. The legislation would increase the size of recount boards, depending on a county&#8217;s population. Currently, when a candidate requests a recount, three candidate-picked people make up the board that tallies the ballots.  Under the proposed legislation, recount boards in counties with a population of 15,000-49,000 would grow to five members. Counties with a population of more than 50,000 would conduct recounts with seven-member boards.  Another change under the bill would make just two of the recount board members candidate-picked. The remainder of the board members would be election poll workers selected by the chief judge of the judicial district, balanced by party. Another change would require all counties to hold an official canvass of elections on a certain day with a goal of making the recount timeline uniform for each county.</p>

He plans to propose legislation that would determine standards for criminal election activities, firm up ballot privacy measures and better define voter intimidation.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-9223" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RockvilleMD-300x291.png" alt="" width="220" height="213" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RockvilleMD-300x291.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RockvilleMD-768x746.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RockvilleMD.png 904w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" />Rockville, Maryland</strong>: Rockville could become the latest jurisdiction in Maryland to<a href="https://dcist.com/story/23/01/09/md-voting-age-16/"> lower the voting age to 16</a>. The move, which would apply to municipal elections, was recommended by a commission assembled to review the city’s charter. The commission noted numerous advantages to expanding the right to vote to 16-and-17-year-olds, including advancing equity and increasing voter turnout. The commission was unable to identify any negatives, unanimously recommending the change. Letting younger people vote would have a “trickle up effect,” the commission argued, as teenagers who vote are likely to influence other members of their family to do so as well. In addition, allowing people to vote at a younger age will build civic engagement and help residents form voting habits, driving higher voter turnout over the long term, the commission wrote. Plus, allowing younger people to vote would “better represent the changing demographics of Rockville residents,” according to the commission. The commission also urged city officials to allow non-citizens to vote, noting that at least 16 percent of Rockville residents are not U.S. citizens, but still make a “significant contribution to the local economy, education system, and our society as a whole.” The report lists 11 other jurisdictions in Montgomery County and Prince George’s County that allow residents to vote regardless or citizenship status.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3833" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Minnesota:</strong> Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon (DFL) announced his<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/01/09/minnesota-secretary-of-state-priorities/"> legislative priorities</a>, including automatic voter registration, protections for election workers and restoring the right to vote for anyone convicted of a felony offense and still on probation or parole.  “I will work with anyone of any political affiliation, from any background, from any part of our state to protect and strengthen and defend the freedom to vote,” said Simon, a Democrat recently elected to his third term. If enacted, automatic voter registration would likely start with registration when obtaining a driver’s license, but Simon said they hope to expand automatic registration to other interactions between the public and government, such as obtaining hunting and fishing licenses. The Office of Secretary of State estimates that automatic voter registration would add or update 450,000 voter registrations each year. Restoring voting rights to people once convicted of a felony would restore access to the polls for 66,000 Minnesotans. Simon is also calling for civil and criminal penalties for anyone who intimidates an election official or “intentionally interferes with the working of an election.” Simon’s other priorities are pre-registration to vote for 16- and 17-year-olds; making it easier for local governments to get reimbursement for presidential nominee primary costs; and removing restrictions from federal funding for election security — Simon said the funds were “held hostage” by the Minnesota state Senate in 2018.  Several bills related to Simon’s priorities have already been introduced by DFL lawmakers. Bills to allow pre-registration for 16- and 17 year-olds and to restore formerly incarcerated people’s right to vote get their first hearing this week.</p>
<p>With a chorus of assenting “ayes,” Minnesota legislators took their first step to <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/right-to-vote-for-people-on-parole-or-probation-clears-first-hurdle-in-minnesota-house/">restoring voting rights for anyone convicted of a felony offense</a> and still on probation or parole.  “Restore people, restore communities. That’s what this is about,” said chief author of<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;f=HF0028&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2023"> the bill</a> Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope. The voting rights restoration bill is one of a suite of measures Democrats are pushing on election issues early in the legislative session, newly empowered by full control of the Legislature. Even as Republican states around the country have sought to make it more difficult to vote by shortening early voting periods and eliminating ballot drop boxes, Minnesota Democrats this year are already pushing automatic registration to make voting easier. If enacted, the voting rights restoration bill would allow 66,000 more Minnesotans to vote. Current Minnesota law allows formerly incarcerated people to vote after finishing every part of their sentence, including probation, parole or any form of supervised release. Minnesota has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country but some of the longest probationary periods of any state.</p>

Justin Wayne of Omaha again introduced<a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=50027"> Legislative Bill 20</a> to<a href="https://www.3newsnow.com/news/political/omaha-senator-again-pushes-to-restore-nebraska-felons-voting-rights-earlier-than-current-waiting-period"> restore convicted felons&#8217; right to vote</a> as soon as their term is up. Currently, there&#8217;s a two-year waiting period. Wayne argues it&#8217;s about more than the right to vote. &#8220;Study after study shows that when people come out of prison and they&#8217;re engaged in their community, they&#8217;re less likely to re-offend,&#8221; Wayne said. He said that drives down the re-offender rate, &#8220;which is one of the big things we have to do to not only solve our (prison) overcrowding problem, but also just get people right re-engaged in our community.&#8221; Wayne&#8217;s bill passed the legislature before. In 2017, then-Gov. Pete Ricketts didn&#8217;t sign the bill and an attempt to override the veto failed. A related bill introduced at the start of the new legislative session would seek an amendment to the state constitution through the approval of voters. Under the legislation re-introduced by State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, felons in Nebraska would never lose the ability to vote.</p>
<p>Bills introduced in the Legislature<a href="https://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/article/Bills-seek-Nebraska-voter-ID-would-nix-most-17708706.php"> address a voter ID requirement passed in November</a> by voters, but also add measures that critics say are designed to make it harder to vote. Two bills introduced by state Sen. Steve Erdman, of Bayard, go beyond simply requiring government-issued photo identification to be presented to vote. While the measures would make primary and general election days state holidays and would cancel some fees to acquire IDs, they also would largely eliminate voting by mail for all except those who could show an inability to go to the polls, such as registered military members, nursing home residents and those away at college. One of his bills would also require all ballots to be counted on Election Day.</p>

Michael Moffett, said the bill is intended to prevent voters of one party from interfering with another party’s primary by temporarily switching parties on primary election day. But critics argued the bill would disenfranchise residents who don’t want to be a member of a specific party but still want to vote in favor or against candidates in the primary.</p>

Lawmakers also want to allow for absentee ballot drop-off box locations and allow for people to provide snacks and non-alcoholic beverages to voters waiting in line.  Another bill would make voter suppression in New York a criminal offense. Separately, lawmakers in the state Senate are backing an effort to restructure the New York City Board of Elections, a move that has not gained traction beyond that chamber in recent years.</p>

Mike DeWine (R)<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2023/01/ohio-voters-will-need-photo-id-for-in-person-voting-under-bill-signed-by-gov-mike-dewine.html"> signed a bill that will require</a> Ohio voters to show a photo ID when voting in person, either early or on Election Day. House Bill 458 replaces current law, which gives voters the option of presenting alternate forms of ID, like a current utility bill, bank statement or paycheck with their current address. The bill includes a provision requiring the state BMV to issue free state ID cards to those who request them. The new law also includes a slew of other measures, including largely ending special elections in August, specifying that county boards of election can offer only a single drop box for completed absentee ballots, and eliminating the day of early, in-person voting the day before Election Day. In addition, it changes the deadline to apply for an absentee ballot to seven days before Election Day, compared to the current deadline of three days. It also cuts the grace period for late-arriving absentees from 10 days under current law to four days, as long as the ballots are postmarked before Election Day.</p>

Warren Hamilton (R-McCurtain County) plans to introduce the legislation that would<a href="https://ktul.com/news/local/oklahoma-senator-proposes-bill-to-increase-pay-for-election-poll-workers"> increase pay for election poll workers</a>. “Poll workers are instrumental in ensuring integrity in Oklahoma’s elections and are absolutely essential to the process,” Hamilton said. “But this last election cycle, many counties faced worker shortages. I believe increasing the compensation for these jobs would definitely help address this issue.” Poll workers across the state are currently paid $110 per day, and judges and clerks are paid $100 per day. Hamilton’s proposed legislation would increase compensation to $200 a day. “These volunteers spend long days at polling places as they arrive well before the polls open and are still working after they close,” Hamilton said. “A pay increase would not only help attract the workers our counties need, but it’s also a way we can show our appreciation to these individuals who work so hard to ensure an efficient and secure voting process in each of our precincts.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB90&amp;Session=2300">Senate Bill 90</a> by Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, would require the State Election Board to accept<a href="https://oklahomawatch.org/2023/01/09/lawmaker-proposes-end-of-year-deadline-for-oklahoma-online-voter-registration/"> voter registration applications online</a> no later than Dec. 31. While the Legislature authorized state election officials to create the system in 2015, technical problems cross-referencing information from voters’ state-issued identification with the Department of Public Safety has delayed the project for years.</p>

The committee voted 8-3 nearly on party lines to send the proposals, which cannot be vetoed by the governor, to the full chamber for consideration. If approved, voter identification would be required to participate in every election, as opposed to someone’s first time voting at a precinct, and mandate that the state auditor general’s office administer post-election audits. Citing existing law that mandates post-election audits, Democrats said that the proposed changes were unnecessary and argued that stricter voter identification requirements would disenfranchise voters, specifically people of color, seniors, and people with disabilities.</p>

His first priority for the session is to encourage legislation that would ban crossover voting. Gray also called for legislation that bans what he called “ZuckBucks,” or “private financing of government election offices.” Gray also called for legislation that would increase “security and clarification in Wyoming’s voter identification requirements.” (There are a couple bills, one in the House and one in the Senate, that concern voter-I.D.s. Both would allow Wyomingites to use their concealed carry permit as identification at the polls.) He also wants to promote legislation that bans “ballot harvesting,” the practice of having someone beside the voter return that voter’s absentee ballot.</p>
<p>During the legislative session beginning this week, legislators will have a chance to consider<a href="https://www.codyenterprise.com/news/local/article_a5d67a0e-9058-11ed-8d29-db6b83a18b5e.html"> House Bill 47</a>, sponsored by the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee. In October, Kai Schon, then the state elections director, told the Corporations Committee the state has been requiring the federal certification of voting machines for years, and the bill would simply codify the process into law as another way to ensure the security of public elections and build public trust in the process. “This doesn’t really establish anything new — it just protects that process by codifying it,” Schon said. The bill requires proof that an electronic voting system has been certified by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, meets the voluntary voting system guidelines and complies with certifications of good standing before being utilized in an election. The draft bill comes amid recent questioning of the accuracy of electronic voting systems throughout the state, and especially in Park County.</p>
<p>Wyoming elections may be subjected to<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/01/11/chuck-gray-lobbies-committee-for-hand-count-audits-of-ballots-in-wyoming/"> hand-count ballot audits</a> after the Legislature’s House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee killed a bill that would have prevented ballot inspections. With the rejection of<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0006"> House Bill 6</a>, the possibility of hand-count ballot audits in Wyoming elections remains alive, as newly sworn-in Secretary of State Chuck Gray has said he wants more scrutiny of Wyoming elections. HB 6, which would have clarified that ballots cannot be requested for inspection under the Public Records Act, was rejected by the committee on a 6-3 vote. It also was specific that any ballots, election records or images of ballots would be kept confidential.</p>

The charges were by Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and District Attorney Michael Jackson. Jackson said Turner is accused of running multiple ballots through a voting machine during the May 2022 Democratic primary election. He is also accused of breaking state law as regards using absentee ballots, Jackson said. Turner was seen with a “stack” of absentee ballot material at the post office, he said. “He was stuffing the machine with the ballots that he had already filled out for the folks he was supporting. He did that for a good little while, and he had some folks distracting the poll watchers,” Jackson said.</p>

U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky made that conclusion as he<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-lawsuits-arkansas-race-and-ethnicity-legislature-ca0598f824b2753a002729c75149f187"> dismissed the lawsuit</a> by two groups challenging Arkansas’ new state House districts. “For over 40 years, dozens of federal courts have heard hundreds of Section 2 claims brought by federal plaintiffs,” Sophia Lin Lakin, co-director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, told the three-judge panel during a 44 minute hearing. “In that time, not one court denied the plaintiffs their day in court because of a lack of private action.” An attorney for the state said the 1965 law never explicitly allows for private citizens to sue to enforce Section 2, and noted that Congress has never added such language over the years. “I would say that Congress has left this as an open issue,” Solicitor General Nicholas Bronni said. Jonathan Backer, an attorney with the Justice Department, told the panel that voting rights have traditionally been viewed as private rights.</p>

The costs include nearly $193,000 for trial and deposition transcripts and over $38,000 for copies of thousands of exhibits the state used in the four-year case that started after Democrat Stacey Abrams’ loss to Republican Brian Kemp in the 2018 race for governor. “This is a win for taxpayers and voters who knew all along that Stacey Abrams’ voter suppression claims were false. It has never been easier to vote and harder to cheat in the state of Georgia,” Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. “This is a start, but I think Stacey Abrams should pay back the millions of taxpayer dollars the state was forced to spend to disprove her false claims.” Overall, the cost to taxpayers in defending the lawsuit in federal court was nearly $6 million, according to the attorney general’s office. But only $231,000 of that amount was recovered from the plaintiffs through the court’s order. Attorney fees to defend state’s laws won’t be repaid.</p>
<p>The state of Georgia is asking a federal judge to rule in its favor in a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-seeks-to-end-lawsuit-over-election-security-vulnerabilities/B7HHOVB63JHUPFC6RTSRTQ2DKA/"> long-running lawsuit</a> alleging that the state’s voting system is inherently insecure. Motions for summary judgment filed Monday said there’s no evidence that voting computers have been hacked or that votes have been counted inaccurately. In addition, election officials have said audits and recounts checked election results. The state’s court filings come as the lawsuit over Georgia’s voting system, which combines touchscreens and printed-out ballots, could finally go to a trial this year, more than five years after the case started. “Ultimately, there is no burden on the right to vote using the state’s chosen voting system by the mere existence of vulnerabilities — because every voting system has vulnerabilities,” wrote attorneys for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the State Election Board. “The numerous audits and hand counts of Georgia elections verify the accuracy of Georgia’s voting equipment.” An attorney for the plaintiffs, David Cross, said there’s substantial evidence of flaws in Georgia’s voting system.</p>

Jennifer Williams won the runoff for Trenton’s North Ward, held on December 13 after a series of snafus, with 427 votes to her opponent Algernon Ward’s 426. The election was not certified until December 30, so although Ward immediately filed for a recount, the proceedings could not begin before Williams took office on January 1. Anklowitz ruled in favor of a recount, a decision which was not opposed by either Williams or Deputy Attorney General Levi Klinger-Christiansen, who was present on behalf of the county Superintendent of Elections and Board of Elections. Klinger-Christiansen did, however, argue that the recount should be done by machine rather than by hand, since Board of Elections workers are already overburdened with a separate January 24 council runoff. But Anklowitz rejected this line of argument, saying that only a hand recount could provide the certainty needed in such a close race. “For the Board to do a machine recount, and then be attacked for not having sufficient integrity where parties are going to come back to challenge the election – well, that wouldn’t really solve very much,” Anklowitz said.</p>

In entering his plea in U.S. District Court in Albany, Schofield admitted to requesting the bogus ballots through a state website in his role as the Republican election commissioner in Rensselaer County, federal prosecutors said in a news release. Schofield’s guilty plea is part of a broader federal inquiry into potential ballot fraud across Rensselaer County. He or someone working for him sought the ballots from May to October 2021, during elections for county executive, clerk and legislature and municipal races in the cities of Rensselaer and Troy, according to the indictment charging him in the case.</p>

Mike DeWine signed the bill into law, Ohio’s new<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/01/10/ohios-photo-voter-id-law-already-facing-legal-challenge/"> photo voter ID law</a> saw its first court challenge. The Elias Law group<a href="https://us-west-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=democracydocket.com&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVtb2NyYWN5ZG9ja2V0LmNvbS9uZXdzLWFsZXJ0cy9vaGlvLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbnMtc3VlLW92ZXItc3RhdGVzLW5ldy12b3Rlci1zdXBwcmVzc2lvbi1sYXcv&amp;i=NjI1ZDlkMjhhYTAyYTQxMjVjMjFiOTc0&amp;t=U2VlYm9jUHJsenNKQTMwTDA2eXhlZHdIMG95RFlKZnA0WW1DblVMMTVQTT0=&amp;h=59c6679f48b640d8affd3235df88dec1&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVatV_79WLKAxdadpg6kFPPtbCkwQDHqgdsglxTL9G7PtA"> filed suit</a> on a behalf of a handful of Ohio interest groups. Elias attorneys filed its suit on behalf of the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, the Ohio Federation of Teachers, the Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans, and the Union Veterans Council. In a statement, Elias attorney Abha Khanna called Ohio’s new law “a sweeping attack on Ohioans’ fundamental right to vote.” Although requiring voters to present a photo ID when voting is the most recognizable change, the law makes other important changes, too. The timeline to “cure” deficiencies for provisional ballots is now shorter. The deadline for absentee ballots to arrive after an election is tighter as well. “This bill makes it substantially harder for Ohioans to vote in person and by mail, and makes it harder to correct simple mistakes that prevent ballots from being counted,” Khanna said. “By their own admission, (Secretary of State Frank LaRose) and Governor DeWine have no justification for this harsh crackdown on voting rights.”</p>

This week, a lawyer for the Allegheny County Elections Bureau told a three-judge Commonwealth Court panel that ballots were ready to be printed, machines have been tested and most of the polling places and elections workers have been lined up. Some voters have begun to get notices they should expect to receive mail-in ballots soon. “The vendors have not begun to mail them” but that has to happen next week to comport with the Feb. 7 election date, Allegheny County attorney Lisa Michel said near the end of two hours of argument in the case. Justin Weber, the attorney representing acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman, told the judges the state&#8217;s election machinery is already in gear. “There is great deference to the election process when it&#8217;s put in motion, as it was on Dec. 7,” when McClinton set the elections, Weber told the judges.</p>
