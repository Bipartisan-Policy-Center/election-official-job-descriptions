<p>Whether you’re looking for a gift for an elections person in your life, your staff, that one constituent who seems to spend a lot of time in your office/DMs or just yourself, here are some suggestions.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10552" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/constitution-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Pocket Constitution</strong>: Knowledge is power and what better way to make sure people are informed than with a<a href="https://www.nationalarchivesstore.org/products/mini-constitution-leather-com-111762?variant=32066268823634&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=shopping&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA7OqrBhD9ARIsAK3UXh3odpCA8TisdDeiWWNi0uAHqiBRm0xDRKPCqvIqejh2vcglhYGnkPMaAk0MEALw_wcB"> pocket-sized U.S. Constitution</a>. And fortunately, the National Archives Store has one that comes in red, blue or black. From the site: A wonderful pocket-sized treasure, this high-quality leather bound book holds our nation’s most important documents. Making a special gift, it contains the complete United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights and every constitutional amendment. Also included are an array of documents that reveal the ideas and differing views of the Founding Fathers along with The Declaration of Independence, The Virginia Bill of Rights, Massachusetts Bill of Rights, Articles of Confederation, and Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. You can also get less fancy versions<a href="https://www.constitutionfacts.com/us-pocket-constitution/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA7OqrBhD9ARIsAK3UXh3SQf70QkEST7MbyklqyikgyrOwega7KacQ2e1xZYv1kHEIShOoIA0aAjnyEALw_wcB"> in bulk</a> should you want to put them on the counter at your office, just sayin’.</p>

These<a href="https://cottonbureau.com/p/CJK8PR/shirt/pro-democracy?fbclid=IwAR1a7el2mNHzbOr05xGiBBKiIz8fu0RznJvCBwrx7NK0J7hYjA28eqUVPOw_aem_ASCvYY8Ei8VMF0T3itn9TNHK9sltL2L8GXixGdKb3I_o9aCb60nSFeTs1ulj0FO3kMA#/18510688/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-black-tri-blend-s"> pro-democracy shirts</a>, which come in a variety of colors, are a great way to let folks know where you stand.</p>
<p><strong>Put a ring on it:</strong> We love voting so much we wanted to put a ring on it so a couple of <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6824" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VoteRing-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />years ago our incredibly talented friend Lori created a<a href="https://www.lovelorimichelle.com/"> VOTE ring</a> for us. The ring isn’t on her site any longer but she’s still making them so just reach out to her and she will be more than happy to make one for you in sterling silver or gold.</p>
<p><strong>You can put an earring (or pin) on it too!</strong>: If you’ve been around The Election <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-10553" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/voteearrings-218x300.png" alt="" width="120" height="165" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/voteearrings-218x300.png 218w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/voteearrings-742x1024.png 742w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/voteearrings-768x1059.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/voteearrings.png 944w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />Center’s Tammy Patrick any time in recent memory you’ve probably noticed the VOTE earrings that she wears.

<p><strong>Run or walk, just vote</strong>: Elections officials spend a lot of time on their feet and these<a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1259468015/vote-pattern-womens-slip-on-canvas-shoes?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=vote+shoes&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-1&amp;frs=1&amp;organic_search_click=1"> VOTE shoes</a> sure do look comfy and are stylish as well.

(Sorry gents, but we could only find ladies voting shoes, make of that what you will.)</p>
<p><strong>For the future voters</strong>: Getting future voters educated and engaged long before their 18th birthday is important.<a href="https://www.pbs.org/parents/thrive/9-picture-books-about-voting-and-elections"> PBS</a> and<a href="https://www.readbrightly.com/picture-books-about-elections-voting/"> Brightly</a> both have lists of 10 recommended children’s books about voting and democracy.

The<a href="https://theelectricgf.com/2023/12/12/county-commission-votes-to-strip-election-duties-from-clerk-and-recorders-office/"> vote comes after of errors</a> in recent county-run elections, at least two related lawsuits filed, and a federal election looming in 2024. Merchant will continue overseeing other Clerk and Recorder duties, like surveying, and the commission will hire an elections administrator. “I brought this forward because I believe it was the right thing to do,” Commissioner Joe Briggs said at the meeting. “I do not do this lightly.” The resolution, brought by Briggs, cited the lawsuits against the county “for irregularities and technical errors in the elections she has thus far conducted” and the expense of litigation the county is incurring as well as the potential cost of rerunning one or more elections. Merchant was elected by less than 40 votes in Nov. 2022, beating out 16-year incumbent Rina Moore. Since Merchange took office in January, two jurisdictions sued the county for her handling of their May elections and the Great Falls Public School District<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/09/26/great-falls-public-schools-wants-elections-to-be-handled-by-county-commissions-office/"> requested the county</a> assume elections duties in September, citing a lack of communication from Merchant. The resolution vote Tuesday came after a problematic canvass for the November municipal results. The resolution would also require commissioners on the ballot on a given election year to abstain from oversight of election duties.</p>

According to Votebeat, Virginia paid $29,000 in September to regain access to just a sliver of the data they used to obtain via ERIC. Alabama and Missouri officials took months to come up with new plans for cleaning voter rolls, landing on plans that are less rigorous than ERIC. And a new system<a href="https://documented.net/media/georgia-state-board-of-elections-email-showing-eagle-ai-under-consideration-to-replace-eric-in-texas"> some states</a> are considering to help with voter roll cleanup had its server attacked and temporarily brought down, according to documents obtained by left-leaning watchdog group American Oversight and exclusively shared with Votebeat. The nine Republican states that have left since 2022 can’t replicate this type of system, and are instead taking a piecemeal approach that leaves them contending with a series of challenges, the documents show. Shane Hamlin, the executive director of ERIC, told Votebeat that its founding states worked for more than two years to build ERIC and “ensure what we do and how we do it complies with state and federal laws,” he said in a statement. “We also made sure data privacy and security were built into our processes and practices from the beginning.” The documents provided to Votebeat show that, in many cases, states that left ERIC didn’t have a long-term plan to replace it. At least some also lacked short-term plans for keeping voter rolls up-to-date in the meantime.</p>

Across five rounds of surveys, hostility towards local officials remains high, disproportionally targeting women and minority officials, and affecting local officials across the political spectrum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Increasing harassment for local officials, consistently high baseline across remaining categories: In the last three months, the rate of harassment of local officials has measurably increased. Incidence of insults, threats, and attacks have remained high.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Threats and attacks cut across party lines: While Democratic officials are more likely to report experiencing insults and harassment, the most serious events—threats of physical violence and actual physical attacks—are experienced at similar rates across parties.</li>

The 8-4 vote taken Dec. 13 was described as a largely “symbolic gesture” by Councilor Gabriela Coletta who stated that conversations with her constituents drove her to vote ‘yes’ on the measure, despite the serious legal ramifications that could arise from non-citizens mistakenly voting in state or federal elections. “After checking with members of my community, to them a ‘yes’ vote would show solidarity with those who are here legally, pay taxes and are members of, not just East Boston, but Boston as a whole,” said Coletta, who represents East Boston. “I do intend to vote ‘yes’ for them and for them only.” Coletta, in a lengthy prepared statement read prior to the vote, directed the councilors to “be real” about what their ‘yes’ vote meant. The mayor “may or may not” sign the home rule petition that passed through the Council, following a list of legal concerns cited by the city’s Election Department in prior Council hearings, she said, and, if the measure is sent to Beacon Hill, it could be one of the majority of city petitions that die in the state Legislature.</p>

One bill aimed at adding more protection to voting machines would require the secretary of state to examine and recertify voting machines annually and when there are<a href="https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2023/12/08/new-jersey-bill-seeks-to-correct-flaws-in-state-voting-machines/"> modifications to the software on the machines</a>. It would require a test and checklist to confirm that the machines are working right and can record and tally all the votes cast. Another bill, known as the “New Voter Empowerment Act,” would allow registered<a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/southbrunswick/zwicker-bill-allow-some-17-year-olds-vote-primaries-advances"> voters who are 17</a> for the primary but will turn 18 before the general election to vote in the primary. A third bill would change the deadline for unaffiliated voters to declare a party to participate in a primary election. It would allow mail-in voters to submit a political party affiliation declaration form to the municipal clerk or the county commissioner of registration by 3 p.m. the day before the primary election, and to request the mail-in ballot by that deadline from the county clerk. Those voting in person can declare a party affiliation at a polling place on the day of a primary election. All three bills cleared committee in the state Senate, but only the New Voter Empowerment Act has made progress in the lower chamber. It passed the Assembly in May and if approved by the state Senate before the end of the session would make its way to the governor’s desk. The other two bills have not yet been heard in committee in the Assembly.</p>

The tribes argue some members have to drive hours to vote and that the U.S. mail is unreliable in rural parts of the state.  &#8220;We want to make sure that this option that communities have been using for years remains an option. Especially given the real challenges that reservation residents face when it comes to having their voice heard,&#8221; said Allison Neswood, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund. Neswood says removing drop boxes would disproportionately affect Native American voters in Arizona.</p>

That decision came out of a redistricting lawsuit filed by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel, which challenged Arkansas&#8217; state House map.  The groups argued that the legislative redistricting plan approved by Republican politicians violates Section 2 by diluting the collective voting power of Black people in Arkansas, where 16.5% of the state&#8217;s population is Black.</p>

The suit states that recent court rulings that limit those eligible to vote by mail in Delaware do not guarantee prisoners who are eligible to vote the ability to actually cast a ballot. It seeks to force the state to remedy the law and provide in-person voting machines in its prisons. “This disenfranchisement falls particularly hard along lines of race and class, as low-income people and people of color are more likely to be incarcerated while awaiting trial,&#8221; wrote Andrew Bernstein, Cozen Voting Rights Fellow at the Delaware American Civil Liberties Union, in a news release. &#8220;We’re suing to make sure everyone who is eligible to vote has the opportunity to do so.” The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a New York-based nonprofit coalition of attorneys, prisoners and prisoner rights advocates that provide legal and informational support to those incarcerated and count dozens in Delaware prisons as members and leaders. It names Gov. John Carney, Election Commissioner Anthony Albence and Correction Commissioner Terra Taylor as defendants.</p>

The lawsuit attempts to invalidate a part of Georgia’s voting law that set a deadline to request absentee ballots 11 days before election day. Previously, voters could apply for absentee ballots until the Friday before an election. Under an amendment to the Voting Rights Act passed in 1970, voters who will be absent from their home jurisdictions on election day are entitled to cast absentee ballots in federal elections if they apply for ballots at least seven days ahead of time. “Georgia’s new absentee ballot deadline violates the Voting Rights Act by drastically reducing the period in which Georgians can apply for an absentee ballot,” said Uzoma Nkwonta, an attorney for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 927. “So many Georgia voters, including the IATSE members we represent, often have to travel around and outside Georgia on short notice. These voters may not know that they will need to vote absentee until shortly before election day.” Defenders of Georgia’s election law say the earlier deadline protects voters from receiving absentee ballots too late to be mailed out, returned and counted.</p>

During a hearing Dec. 11, an attorney for the group Babe Vote and the League of Women Voters of Idaho argued that the laws do heavily restrict this right, especially for young people and older voters or others who don’t have a current Idaho driver’s license. “This case is unquestionably about the right to vote,” attorney Matthew Gordon told the justices. Lawyers for Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said that the Legislature is entitled to regulate voting and registration to ensure safe elections. The case centers on HB 124 and HB 340, both of which were passed this year. HB 124 removed student ID cards as an acceptable form of voter identification at the polls. HB 340 created a list of valid ways to show proof of residency, added requirements for voter IDs when registering to vote, and required the Idaho Transportation Department to provide free identification cards for those who needed them for voting. Babe Vote and the League of Women voters challenged the laws, saying they made registering new voters difficult and confusing and that it disenfranchised student voters. Ada County District Court Judge Samuel Hoaglund in October dismissed the case with prejudice, ruling that the laws don’t violate the right to vote because they didn’t “unduly burden voters.”  Gordon argued Monday that the district court should have allowed discovery — which is a pretrial process of obtaining and sharing evidence and information — so that the plaintiffs could demonstrate how the laws negatively impacted the right to vote. Josh Turner, interim solicitor general in the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, argued on behalf of McGrane that the Legislature allowed student IDs for voter identification in 2010 and it is thus under its purview to amend the law. He said concerns over inconsistency in how student IDs are issued led to the laws, both of which are part of the state “reasonably regulating” voting, he said.</p>

U.S. District Judge John Kness in July dismissed the lawsuit, which was brought by five-term U.S. Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro and two prospective 2024 GOP presidential electors. Kness ruled the three plaintiffs lacked standing to sue the State Board of Elections over the law, which allows mail-in ballots to be counted in the 14 days after Election Day as long as they were postmarked or certified on or before that day. But Kness went even further, ruling that Illinois’ 2015 law complied with the U.S. Constitution as well as federal election law and does “not conflict with the federal mandate that Election Day be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.” Briefs in support of upholding the Illinois law were filed by the Democratic Party of Illinois, the civil rights division of the U.S. Department of Justice and 18 states that have similar laws for counting ballots post-Election Day. The state Democratic Party said the consequences of a successful appeal would be “widespread and severe.”</p>

According to court records, Judge Richard L. Young threw out the case on jurisdictional grounds on Nov. 21. It named multiple Warrick County officials as defendants, including Clerk Patricia Perry and several members of the election board and county commissioners. In a news release, Commissioner President Terry Phillipe seemingly tied the suit to unfounded theories about lack of election integrity that have taken hold with segments of the population since the 2020 presidential election. “Though we recognize that certain current events, misinformation and disinformation have generated concern about the safety and validity of elections, we hope this decision by the federal court instills confidence that elections in Warrick County are fair and accurate,” he said. Two Chandler, Indiana residents filed the suit in September 2022. In the initial complaint filed in the Southern District of Indiana, the plaintiffs claimed officials had misled voters and put the integrity of the election at jeopardy by not using paper ballots and failing to “provide transparency regarding the voting systems” used by the county. They claimed the vendor Warrick County users for voting machines, MicroVote, was unlawfully certified because Pro V&amp;V, a testing laboratory that scrutinizes MicroVote, lacked &#8220;legal accreditation.&#8221;</p>

In a 3-2 ruling, the Second Circuit Court of Appeal in Shreveport, Louisiana, said Tuesday the Republican candidate for sheriff in Caddo Parish, John Nickelson, had shown two people illegally voted twice in the Nov. 18 election and four others voted though they were ineligible to cast ballots. The majority, additionally, found no error in the lower court judge’s determination that Nickelson could not have known about the problematic votes before election day. “Considering the one-vote margin between the candidates, the invalidation of these six votes is alone sufficient to make it legally impossible to determine the result of the election,” Judge Jeff Robinson wrote for the majority.</p>

The tribe sued the county this year, alleging that the seven county supervisor districts drawn up by the county violated the federal Voting Rights Act by effectively denying Native Americans, who make up a majority of the voting-age population in Thurston County, a majority of the seats on the board. Rossiter, in an order issued Dec, 13, said he could not approve the out-of-court settlement until he heard from the parties’ attorneys about whether the deal was impacted by a recent ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In that ruling, the Appeals Court ruled that Congress did not give “private plaintiffs” the ability to sue to enforce voting rights. The Thurston County lawsuit was filed by the two tribes, as well as nine members of the Winnebago and Omaha tribal councils. Rossiter asked attorneys for the tribes and Thurston County to weigh in on the “continued viability” of their settlement and to file supplemental briefs before Dec. 27. The judge wrote that he would decide whether a hearing or phone conference would be necessary after reviewing the briefs.</p>

The lawsuit, filed Dec.4 in Carson City District Court, argues the ballot initiative is unconstitutional because its description of effect (a 200-word summary of the measure included on signature forms) does not reflect all of the question’s implications and would expend taxpayer funds as it does not have an identified funding source. Challenging the description of effect is a common tactic in Nevada to persuade judges to reject proposed ballot questions. The suit was filed by a group of Nevada and Washington, D.C.-based attorneys, who are well known for representing Democratic Party causes, on behalf of Jennifer Fleischmann, the development director for Make the Road Nevada, an immigrant advocacy group.</p>

The panel had failed to make a second attempt in 2022 after it deadlocked along party lines, effectively punting the task to the state legislature and then the courts.<a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2023/Dec23/90opn23-Decision.pdf"> The decision</a> ordered the Independent Redistricting Commission to submit a new map by Feb. 28, saying it was plainly given that duty by the 2014 amendment to the state constitution that created the panel, known as the IRC. &#8220;The Constitution demands that process, not districts drawn by courts,&#8221; Chief Judge Rowan Wilson wrote for the majority. &#8220;Nevertheless, the IRC failed to discharge its constitutional duty. That dereliction is undisputed.&#8221; The ruling forces the state&#8217;s 10-member commission to reconvene and try again to draft a congressional map. The ultimate decision on new lines, though, lies with the Democratic-led legislature, which can craft its own map if either the commission again fails to agree or if it produces a map but lawmakers reject their proposals.</p>

The U.S. District Court for North Dakota denied the State’s request Dec. 12 to stay its order requiring the state to produce the map for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Indian Reservations by Dec. 22.

The United States Court of Appeals issued a stay of the court order Dec. 13. A clerk will assign the case to a merits panel and set a briefing schedule. The court emphasized it was not weighing in on the likelihood of winning on appeal. The stay of the previous court order does not constitute a ruling on the certification of any election, the court said. A federal court had ruled Nov. 21 that mail-in ballots submitted without a handwritten date or with the incorrect date on the return envelope must be counted, according to a news release from the ACLU of Pennsylvania. Not counting those ballots would be a violation of the Civil Rights Act, the court had ruled.</p>

Plaintiffs are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene swiftly to ensure the county uses a map that complies with the Voting Rights Act. Late on Dec. 7, 5th Circuit issued a stay on the new map until May, when it plans to rehear the lawsuit challenging Galveston County&#8217;s 2021 redistricting plan. A district court recently imposed the map on Galveston, having earlier ruled Galveston&#8217;s 2021 redistricting plan violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bans racial gerrymandering. The U.S. Supreme Court<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/12/politics/supreme-court-galveston-texas-voting-rights-act/index.html"> declined to intervene</a> in the case on Dec. 12.</p>
<p>State District Judge David Rogers ruled that 10<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/article/voting-lawsuit-upends-election-results-loving-18540046.php"> Loving County voters</a> did not have enough connection to the area to legally vote there. As a result, two local November 2022 elections must be redone because the number of ineligible voters exceeded the winner’s margin of victory. The ruling came after a September trial in which three losing candidates challenged their results by claiming that voters who lived outside Loving County — estimated population, 65 —  had improperly tipped the election in favor of powerful legacy families. Rogers concluded that the contest for justice of the peace, which resulted in a 39-39 tie before being decided by two votes in a reelection, will have to be repeated, as will a county commissioner’s race decided by six votes. The county/district clerk, who won by 12 votes, can keep her job.</p>

Reilly Marchant was not convinced by activists that a database used by Governor Glenn Youngkin to<a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2023-12-12/judge-sides-with-youngkin-in-voting-rights-restoration-foia-dispute"> determine eligibility for felon rights restoration</a> should be made public. Marchant ruled from the bench that the database was within the governor’s working papers and therefore exempt from state Freedom of Information laws. Virginia is the only state in the country that gives the governor the sole authority to restore someone&#8217;s voting rights after they’ve been convicted of a felony. Youngkin has come under fire for restoring the voting rights of fewer former felons than his Democratic predecessors. And while lawyers for the NAACP, including former Virginia Delegate Jay Jones, argued some of the database’s information was shared with other agencies making it subject to FOIA. Jones grilled Youngkin&#8217;s General Counsel Richard Cullen about what other agencies had access to the data.  The judge pointed to the personal nature of the rights restoration applicant’s information on the database, including social security numbers, and its use in deciding who gets their rights restored all make it fall under the working papers definition. &#8220;This information is well within the governor&#8217;s deliberative process,&#8221; the judge said, suggesting, among flaws in the NAACP&#8217;s claim, that the applicants never expected their information to be shared with the public.</p>

Under the settlement, the county will pay $75,000 in legal costs and provide staff training about signature verification. The League of United Latin American Citizens, the Latino Community Fund and Central Washington residents Jesse Reyes, Cinthia Álvarez Lucatero and Daniel Reynoso filed the lawsuit in federal court in 2021. Benton and Chelan County officials, who were also named in the lawsuit, reached a settlement in October. The lawsuit focused on the process for verifying signatures on mail-in ballots, an important step in Washington, where elections are primarily conducted through U.S. mail and drop boxes. The groups alleged that the three counties’ signature verification process for voted ballots resulted in racial discrimination, said a statement from the UCLA Voting Rights Project, which who helped represent the plaintiffs. Yakima County said it follows state law; it did not admit liability or responsibility for any damages.  “Yakima County denies that our election procedures for the application of the signature verification law were incorrect in any way,” Yakima County Auditor Charles Ross, who oversees the election process, said in an email. Under the settlement, Yakima County’s election staff must receive signature verification training and must retake that training every two years. Election staff also must take cultural competency training every two years. Yakima County already meets some of the terms laid out, according to the settlement. The county already has Spanish language information and includes information about fixing signatures on the ballot but will improve access to instructions in Spanish and add language about how voters can track their ballot online. Yakima County must also add language to the signature update form encouraging citizens to vote and fix any issues with their ballot. The signature update form is provided in Spanish and in English in Yakima County and is sent to voters when there is a signature mismatch.</p>

<p><a href="https://publicrightsproject.applytojob.com/apply/7i5pRgnQwC/Temporary-Staff-Attorney">Temporary Elections Staff Attorney</a>, Public Rights Project— Public Rights Project (PRP) is a public interest legal nonprofit, headquartered in Oakland, with a remote team based throughout the United States. Our mission is to close the gap between the promise of our laws and the lived reality of our most vulnerable communities. Since 2017, we have been working at the intersection of community organizing and state and local government enforcement to build a scalable, equitable community-based enforcement model to protect civil rights and advance economic justice. In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, PRP is launching its Elections Hub to stand with progressive state and local governments, especially local elections officials, as they fight to protect the voting rights of their residents and secure safe and fair elections. PRP is building a rapid response litigation hub to support up to 200 election officials across 12 or more states. The goal of the hub is to provide training, technical assistance, and legal backup to election administrators to enable them to respond to election threats quickly and effectively. Public Rights Project seeks to hire a Temporary Staff Attorney to join the new Elections Hub. The Temporary Staff Attorney will staff PRP’s in-house efforts to represent and advise state, local, and tribal governments and elected officials in support of election administration and the expansion of voting rights.  Although this position does not incorporate formal supervisory responsibilities, the Temporary Staff Attorney will sometimes lead case teams and may review the work of other attorneys, alongside more independent work or work as a contributor to other case teams. This position reports to the Senior Staff Attorney and 2024 Election Hub Program  Manager. This position will also work closely with the Chief Programs Officer and the Legal Director. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://publicrightsproject.applytojob.com/apply/7i5pRgnQwC/Temporary-Staff-Attorney"> click here</a>.</p>
