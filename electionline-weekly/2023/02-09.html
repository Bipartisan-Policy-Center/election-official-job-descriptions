							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The Debrief</strong><br />
<em>Inaugural conference allows local election officials to come together and share challenges and solutions</em></p>
<p>As part of its work to build a strong community of leaders in<a href="https://www.electionexcellence.org/"> the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence</a>, the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) held an in-person conference in early February – The Debrief – where local election officials could come together, debrief about the common challenges they faced during the 2022 election, and share solutions.</p>
<p>The three-day conference included a series of bipartisan panel discussions on resilient and sustainable election funding, communications that can build public confidence in elections, and a panel discussion on the evolving landscape of safety, security and the trustworthiness of elections. Breakout sessions allowed participants to collaborate with each other and drill down even deeper on specific topics.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9396" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief2-300x198.png" alt="" width="300" height="198" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief2-300x198.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief2-768x506.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief2.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“What I learned from this conference is that we need more opportunities for election officials to come together in community to share their common challenges and ideas with each other, especially as we chart a path forward through a trying time for democracy,” said Tiana Epps-Johnson, executive director of the Center for Tech and Civic Life. “I saw election officials learn from each other, make connections, celebrate their hard work, and leave with new energy. We need more of these kinds of moments for professional development in the field.”</p>
<p>The conference included a diverse group of local election officials from rural, suburban and urban communities across the country, representing as few as 3,000 voters to more than 1 million voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9397" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief3-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief3-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief3-768x511.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief3.png 916w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Other events at the conference included a screening of the film “<a href="https://www.notimetofailfilm.com/">No Time to Fail</a>,” a documentary that gives voice to the experiences of election workers during a critical time in our country’s relationship with election management. Director/Producer Margo Guernsey held a talkback after the screening to share what she learned from shadowing election workers in Rhode Island during the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Brianna Lennon, county clerk in Boone County, Missouri and Eric Fey, director of elections in St. Louis County, Missouri, broke some history with the first-ever live recording of their “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/high-turnout-wide-margins/id1546061812">High Turnout, Wide Margins</a>” podcast in <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9398" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief4-300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief4-300x199.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief4-768x510.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Debrief4.png 906w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />front of an audience of election officials. Podcast guests included Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, and Pam Anderson, the 2022 Republican nominee for Secretary of State in Colorado.</p>
<p>The U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence is a nonpartisan collaborative that is bringing together election officials, designers, technologists, and other experts to envision, support, and celebrate excellence in U.S. election administration. The collaborative is led by the Center for Tech and Civic Life with its partners the Center for Civic Design, Center for Secure and Modern Elections, the Elections Group, Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (the d.school) at Stanford University, Prototyping Systems Lab, and U.S. Digital Response.</p>

Parts of New Orleans will vote on Feb. 18 to fill a vacant House seat. Feb. 18 falls<a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/additional-officers-to-work-special-election-ensure-voters-can-get-to-polls-despite-parades/42780797"> smack dab in the middle of this year’s Mardi Gras</a> celebrations and that’s got local elections officials working extra time. Darren Lombard, a clerk of criminal court, told WDSU that his office has secured 24 sheriff&#8217;s deputies to staff polling locations near parade routes in an effort to help voters find parking. &#8220;(The polling locations) are not on the route, but they&#8217;re close and that causes major issues with parking,&#8221; Lombard said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re working around that with the help of the sheriff and we should be okay.&#8221; He also confirmed his office will have enough workers to staff each polling site and tabulate the results. &#8220;There is historical precedent for elections during the Carnival season and voters are reminded of the week long opportunity to early vote at numerous locations throughout New Orleans,” Lombard said.</p>

According to Fulton review panelist Steven Day, a Gwinnett County election board member, the state election board, the secretary of state’s office, and the Georgia Association of Voter Registration Election Officials should consider a new periodic performance review that provides metrics about best ways to manage voting. This is preferable to waiting until a county has problems and trying to intervene in a potentially hostile situation, he said. “It is better to be a partner than an adversary, better to improve systems before dysfunction rather than trying to fix them after the fact,” Day said. He noted that any review process, however, needs more support from state lawmakers who control the budget of the Secretary of State’s office and the statewide board, and can determine which rules that local elections offices must follow. “The idea that you would expect a $500,000 consultancy from three guys volunteering your time is not is not reasonable,” he said. “They have got to act like it’s not the redheaded stepchild, but it’s something that should be valued,” Day said. “If you value elections then fully fund the staff there and give them the power they need to do the job.” William Duffey Jr., chairman of the State Election Board, said state and local election officials can collaborate on a new statewide review system, but resources are not sufficient to accomplish those goals. “We have to have the courage to say, ‘If you want uniformity and integrity in these processes, you have to give us the resources necessary to create a system by which we could regularize and make uniform the processes that you expect of all these 159 counties,’” Duffey said.</p>

Harrison Township Clerk Adam Wit, who also is the president of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks, said his organization  hopes to get guidance soon from the state. “That’s pretty much all we’ve been talking about,” said Wit. “What’s it going to look like in the [Upper Peninsula]? What’s it going to look like in metro Detroit? You gotta make sure you design a system that accommodates everybody.” Currently, it costs city, township, village, and county clerks $100 million annually to run elections, about $20,000 per precinct. It will run about $30 million to $45 million more to implement the new voting laws, Benson told lawmakers. State Rep. Ann Bollin, (R- Livingston County) and a member of the state House Appropriations Committee, said she wants a further breakdown of the money needed to pay for the changes mandated by Proposal 2 before she determines whether Benson’s request is enough to appropriately implement them, which she said should be the Legislature’s number one priority.</p>

It calls for ambitious collective action and investment – from the field and philanthropy – in advancing a transformation to a new emergent system. The Roadmap represents nearly a year of design, input, and engagement from over 60 local news leaders and supporters from communities across the country. Additionally, this week, the launch of Civic News Company was announced. <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/2/7/23587855/civic-news-company-chalkbeat-votebeat">Civic News Company</a> will serve as the parent company for Chalkbeat and Votebeat and possibly future beat. “Civic News Company’s mission is to help people understand how America works, so we can all make it work better. We do this by producing both Votebeat and Chalkbeat, world-class journalism for, and in partnership with, the communities who need it most. In the future, we may introduce new ‘beats’  covering additional topics that are critical to making this country work better for everyone who lives in it,” said Elizabeth Green, CEO and founder of Civic News Company. Green said the name Civic News Company was chosen because education and elections are pillars of civic life. “Civic also means local, and we believe that the American story is best told locally: in communities, with communities, and for communities,” Green said.</p>

She was 73. Misniec served in a variety of rolls in the county government including in the planning and zoning department and as the county recorder. Following her stint as recorder she ran for county clerk and served two terms until her retirement in 2018. As clerk, Misniec spearheaded the implementation of early voting in Johnson County. She also was instrumental in implementing a voter center plan for Johnson County before the 2012 presidential election — the first change to the county’s voting process in over 150 years. This was a campaign promise of hers. She told the Daily Journal in 2010 it would make elections more efficient and save taxpayers money. After the change was approved by the county’s election board, Misiniec was excited for the changes to be put in place. “I’m real excited about it, but I want it to be done right. The worst thing we can do is do this poorly and be disorganized and make voters disgruntled,” she told the Daily Journal in 2011. “She always had a smile on her face. She was strong, determined,” said Trena McLaughlin, current county clerk and a friend of Misiniec’s for over 20 years. “Whenever she set her mind to getting something accomplished, she did it.” McLaughlin said officials had a job to get done, but Misiniec made it fun with a smile. “We had a laugh every day, no matter what the day was,” she said. “No matter what issues we had, we always had a laugh and I’ll always remember that.”</p>

This legislation amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by inserting a new section titled “Prohibiting Registration of Individuals Not Providing Proof of United States Citizenship.” The intent of the proposed legislation is that only U.S. citizens should participating in voting in U.S. elections. According to Fallon, Democrats are seeking to allow people who are not U.S. citizens to vote in U.S. elections. “In order to protect this sacred right, I have introduced The Voice of the Electorate (VOTE) Act, which takes the necessary steps to ensure that American citizens alone decide the future of our nation.”</p>

It would require Maricopa County alone to select four voting precincts, select 100 ballots from each of those precincts and then recount every race on each of those ballots, by hand and by machine. Then the bill requires the county to compare the difference in the count and see which was more accurate. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer supports the bill, even though this kind of test was not on the long list of election changes he suggested. Richer sees this as a put up or shut up moment for those that doubt the accuracy and reliability of vote counting machines, sometimes referred to as tabulators. Richer thinks the “man vs. machine” contest will prove a couple of things: that vote counting machines are highly accurate and free of bias, but also fast. Not only is the bill a test of accuracy, but it’s also written to gauge how long a hand count of ballots would take. The plan is to time how long it takes to hand count those 400 ballots and then do the math to figure out how long it would take to count all the ballots cast in the November 2022 election. The result — likely weeks, not days — would expose the folly of those who are demanding hand counts of ballots. Many of those same people also demand to have results on election night.</p>
<p>The Senate Elections Committee has passed a bill that would require early voters to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1838226/senate-committee-passes-bill-require-id-when-dropping-early-ballots-polling"> present an ID when they drop off their ballots at a polling location</a>. Those who cast a vote without providing ID could be charged with a felony. While Republican Sen. Jake Hoffman (Queen Creek) says it’s an incremental approach to accountability, Democrat Priya Sundareshan (Tucson) disagreed, saying it stems from conspiracy theories. “This one is the idea that there are mules dropping off ballots that are unattached from registered voters to mess with our elections,” Sundareshan said Other opponents say the bill is unnecessary, as signature verification is required to ensure early voters’ identity. The bill now goes to the Senate Rules Committee.</p>

The proposed bill would require employers to provide eight hours of paid leave to employees who are registered voters so that they can submit their vote during primary elections, primary runoff elections, and general elections. Under the bill, an employer would be unable to make an employee use their sick leave, vacation time, or hold any penalties against them for being absent because they went to vote. If an employer were to not comply with the bill then they could be subject to a fine of anywhere from $25 to $250. The bill states that early voting would be made available to any qualified voter who applies to a county clerk&#8217;s designated early voting location within the 30 days prior to a preferential primary or general election.  This would be Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. during the first fifteen days of early voting and then 8:00 a.m. &#8211; 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday for the other remaining days of early voting.  Weekend hours would be 10:00 a.m. &#8211; 4:00 p.m.  On the Monday before the election, hours would be 8:00 a.m. &#8211; 7:00 p.m.  During any state or county holidays, early voting would not be available.</p>

Council, sending the measures to the full House for a vote later this week. At the same time, the White House said that it opposes the two resolutions — but did not explicitly say it would veto them. Speaking during an hour-long debate in the House Rules Committee, Republicans said the<a href="https://dcist.com/story/23/02/07/house-committee-disapproves-two-dc-bills-home-rule/"> bill to allow non-citizens to vote</a> — which includes undocumented immigrants — would dilute the value of the right to vote and allow agents from foreign embassies to sow “chaos and disorder” by voting in local elections. “Voting is a core tenet of what it means to be a citizen of this great country. And this so-called voting rights law actually dilutes the rights of the American citizens and devalues what citizenship actually means,” said Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-New York). “The bottom line is allowing non-citizens here legally or illegally to vote in our domestic elections is a violation of our sovereignty and the sovereign rights of Americans.” On the voting bill, Democrats noted that non-citizens in various states had gained the right to vote at points throughout American history, and that currently some jurisdictions (including some towns in the Maryland suburbs) allow non-citizens to participate in local elections.</p>

The bill would give<a href="https://www.wkrg.com/state-regional/florida/florida-special-session-bill-would-give-state-prosecutors-more-power-to-investigate-election-crimes/"> more power to the statewide prosecutor</a> in cases involving election cimes. According to the proposed legislation, “three cases have been dismissed on the grounds that OSP lacked jurisdiction to prosecute such cases because the act of making a false affirmation on a voter registration form and voting while ineligible occurred in a single county, not in multiple judicial circuits or connected with an organized criminal conspiracy affecting two or more judicial circuits.” In the three dismissed cases, “each court found that the act of transferring the voter registration information and voted ballot to another judicial circuit were ministerial activities performed by the government, not by one of the defendants, and the act of transferring such registration and ballot to another judicial circuit were not part of the criminal act with which the defendants were charged. Thus, there was neither a “related transaction” nor a criminal conspiracy, as required [by law].” The bill being looked at in the special session would give the statewide prosecutor the ability to act when election crimes are occurring, have occurred, or have been committed in two or more judicial circuits. The crimes are defined as “any attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit any of the crimes specifically enumerated.” This includes running for state or federal office, petitioning for ballot initiatives, as well as voting on either item in an election. To prevent this option for dismissal, HB 3B amends state statutes to make it so the statewide prosecutor has “jurisdiction by deleting the current statutory requirement that such a crime be connected with an organized criminal conspiracy that affects two or more judicial circuits, and simply requires the crime to have affected two or more judicial circuits.” The Senate has approved its verion of the legislation<a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/2023/02/08/florida-senate-passes-bill-clarifying-election-crimes-prosecution/"> SB4B</a> 27-12 along party lines.</p>

The bipartisan proposal wouldn’t end runoffs in statewide elections in Georgia, the only state in the nation that requires runoffs after both primary and general elections in which no candidate wins a majority. “This is a starting point as a test if cities want to do it,” said state Rep. Joseph Gullett, a Republican from Dallas who introduced<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/63905"> House Bill 200</a> on Wednesday. “If they’re successful at it, we’ll have an idea what this could look like in the state of Georgia. If it’s a terrible process, we’ll know that, too.” About 58% of Georgia voters supported eliminating runoffs after general elections, making the candidate who receives the most votes the winner, according to a poll last month by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Several cities have proposed ranked-choice voting for municipal elections, including Atlanta and Woodstock, Gullett said.</p>

Rep. Joe Alfieri, R-Coeur d’Alene, pitched the bill, saying the recent popularity of absentee ballots is detrimental to the voting process and opens the door to fraud. He did not cite any examples of voter fraud in Idaho. “What it does it does is it cheapens the voting process and makes it the equivalent of nothing more than filling out a warranty card for the latest microwave or television that you bought,” Alfieri said in committee. “Additionally, the cleaning of voter rolls has become a real problem.” Should it pass, the only people eligible for an absentee ballot would be people in active service in the military, people with an illness, disability or hospitalization, an elector unable to be at the polls due to work or attending a university, or an elector out of the county on Election Day due to a religious mission. The bill does not offer an exemption for people on extended vacations. To apply for an absentee ballot, the elector would check a box regarding what qualifies them for the ballot. It is already a misdemeanor crime to provide false information to a government clerk, so individuals could be punished if they falsely apply for an absentee ballot. Early voting would still be allowed in Idaho counties, which generally is available 14 to 30 days before Election Day, depending on the county.</p>

Voter ID has become a partisan issue in Maine, which is one of just 13 states that do not require individuals to show some form of identification before entering the ballot box. And with Democrats controlling of both chambers of the Legislature, this latest push for a voter ID requirement in Maine faces an uphill climb. Pouliot’s bill would require the state to issue a photo ID for free to any eligible voter who does not have one. But his bill was staunchly opposed by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows as well as the ACLU of Maine, Disability Rights Maine, the Maine Women’s Lobby, the Maine Transgender Network, Maine Conservation Voters and the League of Women Voters of Maine.  “We should all be very proud that Maine ranks consistently at the very top of the list in voter participation in the nation,” Bellows said. “Proponents of this bill have argued that we are an outlier and urged us to adopt practices in other states. I would urge caution in adopting any measures that would create barriers to the right to vote and drag Maine’s voter participation and public confidence in elections down to the levels of apathy and voter participation that other states suffer . . . all voters should have the freedom to vote equally and any bills that infringes on that freedom should be regarded with the strictest scrutiny with regards to need and the public’s interest.” The committee will hold a work session on the bill on a future date.</p>

The bill heads to the state Senate for a vote.  More than 50,000 Minnesotans would be able to vote if the bill (<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=house&amp;f=HF0028&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2023">HF28</a>) is signed into law. Current Minnesota law allows formerly incarcerated people to vote after finishing every part of their sentence, including probation, parole or any form of supervised release. Minnesota has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country but some of the longest probationary periods of any state.  Republicans attempted to pass an amendment that would prevent people on parole or probation for murder or sex crime convictions from voting, calling themselves victim’s rights advocates. Chief author Rep. Frazier said restricting “one-off” situations was not in the spirit of the bill. Several victims’ rights groups — including the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault — are in support of restoring the right to vote for anyone on probation or parole. The bill passed 71-59.</p>
<p>Employers in Minnesota are currently required to allow their workers<a href="https://patch.com/minnesota/minneapolis/bill-would-give-minnesotans-time-work-absentee-voting"> paid time off to vote</a> on Election Day. But a bill authored by state Sen. Bobby Joe Champion would extend those protections for eligible voters who want to cast an in-person absentee ballot. &#8220;Every employee who is eligible to vote in an election has the right to be absent from work for the time necessary to appear at the employee&#8217;s polling place, cast a ballot, and return to work,&#8221;<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?session=ls93&amp;version=latest&amp;number=SF0516&amp;session_number=0&amp;session_year=2023"> the bill states.</a> &#8220;An employer or other person may not directly or indirectly refuse, abridge, or interfere with this right or any other election right of an employee.&#8221; The bill was introduced on Jan. 23 and was referred to the Senate Elections Committee. It has not yet been scheduled for a hearing.</p>
<p>Legislators are considering a bill that would allow<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/02/08/voter-signup-bill-causes-partisan-split-in-mn-legislature"> 16-year-olds to pre-register</a> and would update voter registration for U.S. citizens when they get a new Minnesota driver’s license or complete other government forms with a new name or address. People could opt out of the automatic registration. The House Elections Finance and Policy Committee approved the bill on an 8-5 party-line vote Wednesday. A companion bill made it through the Senate elections committee earlier this week, also with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Debate over both bills also encompassed proposed changes to campaign finance disclosure by outside groups. Secretary of State Steve Simon, a DFLer, told the committee the slate of proposed changes would reduce registrations at polling places, although that same-day registration option would remain.</p>

Reynolds has in previous years filed bills to restore the right to vote to veterans who had been convicted of felonies. Those bills were never considered in committee. But before the full House on Wednesday, Reynolds was successful in amending a bill he and other House Democrats would normally oppose to restore voting rights to members of the military. After Reynolds’ amendment, House Bill 1310 passed on an 86-31 vote. The bill needed a two-thirds (or at least 78 yeas) vote to pass under guidelines of the Mississippi Constitution. The constitution requires a two-thirds vote of both the House and Senate to restore voting rights to those convicted of felonies. The bill now goes to the Senate unless the House Republican leadership attempts to call the bill back up to try to remove the Reynolds amendment.</p>

Under the resolution proposed by Rep. Mike Henderson, R-Bonne Terre, that threshold would increase to 60%.  “I believe that the Missouri Constitution is a living document, but not an ever-expanding document. And right now it has become an ever expanding document with over 60 additions since 1945,” Henderson said.  If the resolution is also passed by the Senate, it would go on the ballot and must be approved by voters by a simple majority to go into effect.  House members discussed the resolution for hours on the floor before giving it first round approval along party lines 106-50. On Thursday the House gave it final approval with little debate, voting 108-50 to send it to the Senate.  The legislation does not address signature requirements, which is another avenue that Republicans are considering in order to change the process. The legislation would apply to constitutional amendments brought both by the initiative petition process and those from the legislature.</p>

David Bedey, R-Hamilton, proposes sending notices to absentee voters every four years, which they must fill out and return in order to keep receiving absentee ballots. If they don’t return it in 60 days, they would be removed from the absentee list and sent a follow-up notice telling them so. Bedey said his bill would ensure that absentee voter lists would be maintained more frequently. It would also prohibit inactive voters from being sent absentee ballots. Besides Bedey, no one else testified in support of his bill. It was opposed by the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders, the Montana Federation of Public Employees and the Montana AFL-CIO. Eric Bryson, a lobbyist for the clerks and recorders, said election officials objected to the bill in part due to the added cost it would place on counties and their taxpayers. The bill&#8217;s fiscal note estimates the cost of mailing those notices out would cost between $570,000 and $1.1 million, depending on how many follow-up notices need to be mailed out.</p>

Election materials, like voted ballots, unvoted ballots, unused ballots and other records gathered during an election are allowed to be disposed of under state law. Eric Semerad, Gallatin County clerk and recorder, said during the meeting that the standard retention period for a presidential election is 22 months, which expired in September. Gallatin County Commissioner Zach Brown said that the commission had no legal basis to deny the request. He added that he viewed Semerad’s request as a routine government function outlined in state law. About a half dozen people urged the commission to deny Semerad’s request, with many saying that citizen-led investigations into alleged voter fraud were still ongoing and the records were needed in those investigations. The election materials approved for disposal by the county commission are meant to stay sealed, unless for an audit or court order, according to state law. Semerad said that the one year period to file a lawsuit to contest the election had also passed. “There’s really no way to access these records legally,” Semerad said. “To be able to be accessed they would have to be unsealed by a district court judge and the path has already been passed for that.”</p>

Republican Assem. Gregory Hafen II, of Pahrump, introduced the legislation. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo said in his State of the State Address last month that he would support such a measure. “Signature verification is a time-intensive and cumbersome process,” the governor said in his Jan. 23 speech. “We require people to have a valid form of identification to get on a plane, to operate a motor vehicle or to purchase alcohol or cigarettes, but not to cast a vote in an election. That is illogical.” The bill would require a Nevada voter to show a form of proof of identity when voting, including a driver’s license or other federally acceptable identification documents. Voters who do not have driver’s licenses would be able to obtain an identification card from the Department of Motor Vehicles free of charge. Voters who vote by mail would have to either put the last four digits of their Social Security Number or driver’s license number on their ballot, along with their signature, the bill proposes.</p>

The audits would need to be conducted at specific towns and city wards across the state, selected at random, the bill states. They would be carried out in public by people appointed and trained by the secretary of state. For each machine, at least 5 percent of the ballots scanned must be examined, the bill adds. The choices on the ballots must be compared to the results recorded in the machines, and any differences must be documented. Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor, said the bill was an important extension of the mandatory audits last year. The issue has garnered bipartisan support; 82 percent of Granite Staters polled by the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights said they support post-election auditing in some form, testified McKenzie St. Germain, the group’s campaign director.</p>

The two most notable bills both regarded<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/senate-committee-clears-set-of-election-reform-bills-including-prepaid-postage-for-mail-ballots/"> postage on mail-in ballots</a>: one to require mail-in ballot applications to come with prepaid postage, and another to do the same for the ballot envelopes themselves. Some counties have already implemented prepaid postage for their elections, but the policy is not uniform across the state. “Fundamentally, there should be no cost associated with casting a ballot, whether a voter chooses to vote in-person or by mail,” Philip Hensley of the League of Women Voters said in support of the bills. “Any financial barrier to voting violates that basic fundamental principle.” Both bills previously cleared an Assembly committee last month, also unanimously, so they should be set to pass the full legislature sometime soon. The Senate committee also cleared two other bills regarding elections; one would require counties to provide mail-in ballot applications for future elections at polling places on Election Day, while the other moves various election deadlines to smooth out some issues caused by previous legislation. A third bill to standardize emergency and provisional ballots was held for now.</p>

The legislation, House Bill 4, cleared its first House committee on a party-line vote over the objection of Republicans who questioned the propriety of registering people automatically and asking later if they’d like to opt out. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat who served as an expert witness on the bill, said the proposal includes safeguards to ensure only qualified electors are registered automatically. The Motor Vehicle Division is linked to an electronic database with citizenship information, for example, and the legislation will strengthen the accuracy of the voter rolls by also updating addresses during MVD transactions, Toulouse Oliver said. Newly registered voters will be told they’ve been added to the voter rolls and that they’ll get a postcard in the mail allowing them to decline the registration. The automated procedures would go into effect in mid-2025. The state Taxation and Revenue Department estimated it would cost about $718,000 to carry out the automated registration. In addition to automatic registration, the bill includes a Native American Voting Rights Act intended to protect access to the polls in tribal areas, the restoration of voting rights for felons when they exit incarceration and a permanent absentee voter list. The proposal also would make Election Day a school holiday for general and regular local elections. Many schools serve as polling sites. The bill passed the House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee on a 6-3 vote. Approval from a second committee would send it to the House floor.</p>

Other statewide primaries are generally held in May but in 1996, the Ohio Legislature changed the<a href="https://www.ideastream.org/2023-02-02/bipartisan-bill-would-move-ohios-presidential-primary-from-march-to-may"> presidential primary</a> to March.  A Democratic state lawmaker said that&#8217;s caused confusion and problems, and he wants to change that presidential primary back to May. Rep. Dan Troy (D-Willowick) said the March presidential primary needs to go. Sometimes, he said turnout is down due to poor weather conditions. Other times, he said the presidential primary day falls on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. He said the fact that the primary for presidential years has earlier filing deadlines causes confusion for candidates and local boards of elections.  When Ohio&#8217;s primary was moved to March, supporters of that change said it would give Ohioans more of a say in who becomes nominees in the presidential primaries. But Troy said it hasn&#8217;t worked out that way. “Ohio’s influence on that process in my opinion has proven to be dubious at best and it’s time to return to a normal and consistent election schedule,&#8221; Troy said. Troy said moving the presidential primary to May will have another benefit — a shorter political season. With the March primary, he said candidates start running for office right after the November election in the preceding year. He said moving the presidential primary to May would shorten the election season and potentially allow more time for governing and less time for partisan politics. Troy has support from eight co-sponsors including one Republican — Rep. Bill Seitz (R-Cincinnati). Troy said he hasn&#8217;t personally gone to fellow lawmakers to talk to them about signing onto the legislation so he thinks more legislators might actually support it.  The plan has support from the Ohio Association of Election Officials, a bipartisan group that represents those who oversee elections in Ohio. Sherry Poland, the group&#8217;s president, applauded Troy for introducing the bill.</p>

Warren Hamilton, “I am so appreciative of those who take their time and carry out this important patriotic and civic duty. I hope increasing their compensation will help retain the poll workers we have and encourage more Oklahomans to participate.” SB 290 has been referred to the Appropriations Committee for further consideration.</p>

The legislation would uniformly ban their use, other than in a county auditor’s office, and make other changes to bring more consistency to state election laws. “Easy to vote, hard to cheat” was how the legislation’s prime sponsor, Republican Rep. Kirk Chaffee, summarized the package. Under the latest version, county auditors would be prohibited from mailing absentee ballots after the Monday prior to election day. And the state Board of Elections would be required to develop absentee-voting rules for nursing facilities, assisted living centers and hospitals that would apply for both primary and general elections.</p>

Sen. Janice Bowling (R-Tullahoma) sponsored the<a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=HB1099&amp;GA=113"> senate counterpart bill.</a> Under the Tennessee Early Voting Act of 1994, the state allows voters a period of 15 days to vote early in person before the election. This was done to encourage greater voter turnout by ensuring people with busy work schedules or other life circumstances had more flexibility to cast a ballot without being strictly limited to just Election Day. Davis&#8217; bill includes a provision that would delete pieces of language from an existing state law that guides how absentee applications and ballots are conducted in nursing home settings. The bill would exclude homes for the aged or similar licensed institutions &#8220;providing relatively permanent domiciliary care&#8221; from the listed definition of places that receive assistance from the county election commission.

Sponsored by Rep. Katy Hall (R-South Ogden), the will would repeal a pilot program, passed by the Legislature in 2018, that allows cities to use<a href="https://kjzz.com/news/politics/utah-house-committee-ranked-choice-voting-katy-hall-legislature-elections-vote-bill-171-government-operations"> ranked-choice voting</a> for their elections. In municipal elections in 2021, 19 cities opted to use ranked-choice voting, said Ryan Cowley, Utah elections director. Hall he had heard from officials and voters who were frustrated with it. She claimed there have been problems with the process, including implementation, getting results quickly, and some ballots getting thrown out. “Whether they’re founded or not,” Hall said, “election confidence is down right now, so this felt like the right thing to do.” But opponents at the committee hearing pushed back against her plan. Jeff Silvestrini, mayor of Millcreek and president of the Utah League of Cities and Towns, said cities enjoy having the choice to use this alternative voting method. “Ranked-choice voting offers municipalities the opportunity to conduct elections at lower cost,” Silvestrini said, “and that’s been our experience in Millcreek.” Another opponent of House Bill 171 testified that cities have realized “significant” cost savings by holding just one ranked-choice election rather than multiple elections.</p>
<p>The House voted unanimously to approve<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0269.html"> HB269</a>, a bill that would require the Office of the Legislative Auditor General to conduct a<a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2023/2/4/23585164/election-audit-utah-legislature-results"> biennial audit of elections</a> in even-numbered years.  The bill now goes to the Senate for consideration. Schultz’s bill would allow an auditor to be “present at the place where counting is conducted, regardless of whether the count is complete.” It also allows the auditor to unseal ballots and examine them for a certain amount of time after the end of an election.  More specifically, the bill states “if the audit uncovers evidence that raises a substantial doubt regarding the accuracy of the results of an election, the auditor may examine the ballots until” either the end of the calendar year in which the election was held or, if the election was contested, when the contest is resolved or “at any time via a subpoena or other legal process.”  The bill was widely supported, by both Republicans and Democrats in the House. It was also supported by state and local elections officials when it was considered in and endorsed by the House Government Operations Committee earlier.</p>
<p>A bill that would<a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50575007/bill-would-make-tampering-with-utah-ballot-drop-boxes-a-felony-offense"> increase criminal penalties</a> for tampering with ballot drop boxes cleared a House committee, although its sponsor said he is unaware of widespread drop box tampering.<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0347.html"> HB347</a>, sponsored by Rep. Michael Petersen, R-North Logan, would increase the penalty for drop box tampering from a class A misdemeanor to a third-degree felony, which is punishable with up to five years imprisonment and a fine up to $5,000. &#8220;While it&#8217;s not been reported yet in Utah, there are numerous sightings around the nation where ballot drop boxes have been set on fire or shot or had the ballots stolen from them,&#8221; Petersen told the House Government Operations Committee on Wednesday. &#8220;And so, this bill just increases the penalty to maybe help make sure folks don&#8217;t want to engage in those kinds of things here in Utah.&#8221; Although he wasn&#8217;t opposed to the idea of the bill, Rep. Norman Thurston, R-Provo, questioned whether the Utah Legislature&#8217;s approach to criminal penalties is arbitrary. Thurston ultimately voted against the bill, along with Democratic Reps. Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, and Sahara Hayes, D-Millcreek. HB347 received a 7-3 favorable recommendation from the committee and will head to the full House for consideration.</p>

Senate Bill 218 would create a presidential preference primary election that would be held on the second Tuesday of February. Senate Bill 152 would move the state primary election from May to August. Oliverio said Candidates would file in June rather than January, shortening the campaign season. That move could encourage more qualified candidates to file, run, and serve. But it will also give lawmakers more time to “work” as opposed to campaigning and raising money. Though not included in either measure, Oliverio is one of many who favors aligning municipal elections with the state. Alignment would allow communities to share resources, poll workers, and lower the cost to taxpayers.</p>

Shae Sortwell of Two Rivers and Sen. Duey Stroebel of the Town of Cedarburg in a memo to colleagues called the proposal &#8220;a common sense bill to ensure justice is entirely served and full accountability is given to those that still owe a debt to society, notably to their victims.&#8221; Under current Wisconsin law, a person convicted of treason, felony crimes, or bribery may not vote unless the person&#8217;s right to vote is restored through a pardon or through the completion of a prison sentence, parole, extended supervision, or probation. The proposal from Sortwell and Stroebel would add the requirements of paying all fines, costs, fees, surcharges, restitution and community service to that threshold.</p>

House Bill 115, sponsored by freshman lawmaker and University of Wyoming law professor Kenneth Chestek, D-Laramie, failed to make it out of committee by Friday’s deadline. The bill would have transferred elections administration duties from the secretary of state to the Wyoming state canvassing board, which reviews vote totals in elections and either certifies them or calls for a recount. An additional member would have been appointed to the board — which is made up of the governor, the secretary of state, the state auditor and the state treasurer — to keep the body nonpartisan. If the majority of the state canvassing board members are from the same political party, then the House and Senate floor leaders would have jointly appointed a member from the largest political party outside of the one that the majority of members are affiliated with. Otherwise, the governor would have appointed the additional member. The bill was similar to legislation that Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, R-Cheyenne, proposed back in August.</p>

Nathan Hart, 49, was arrested in August as part of a sweep announced by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. It was the first such move since DeSantis had established a unit to investigate voter fraud after the 2020 election despite little evidence that widespread fraud at the ballot had been occurring in Florida. Hart had voted in the 2020 election despite a previous felony conviction in relation to a charge of lewd or lascivious molestation, which made him ineligible to vote. Hart was charged with two third-degree felonies, which carry a penalty of up to five years in prison, in the voter fraud case. On Tuesday a jury found him guilty of false affirmation, but not guilty of voting as an unqualified elector. The judge set the sentencing date for Feb. 27. Prosecutors are asking for five years’ probation, while the defense wants time served.</p>

Johnson County officials say their identities were not stolen as the result of a widely-reported case involving the Konnech election software last fall. Instead the employees appear to have been victims of a 2015 breach involving a misplaced or lost list of personal information in the county corrections department. Becher, was sentenced on two unrelated criminal cases before U.S. District Judge Greg Kays in the federal court for the Western District of Missouri. The bigger charge was for a $10 million conspiracy to distribute about 1,000 kilograms of meth. Becher will serve 20 years in federal prison without parole for that. In the second case, Becher pleaded guilty to a scheme to use Johnson County employees’ identities to commit credit card fraud.</p>

That could change the outcome of a school board race in Ocean Township, where Steve Clayton unseated incumbent Jeff Weinstein by 20 votes and was sworn in last month; unofficial tallies now put Weinstein ahead by just one vote. Election officials said that the recount will be held on February 8. Bauman relied on a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that election laws should be interpreted liberally as a reason for recounting and rechecking voting machines in Ocean Township, Belmar, Fair Haven, and Tinton Falls even though the deadline had passed. “The public interest in (the) finality of counting votes and election outcomes, in this instance, has not been shown to be strong enough to warrant strict enforcement of the provisions of (the statutes) … where, as here, the counting error appears to have been derived from a unique confluence of mechanical and human error, and no one on this record opposes the prayers for relief,” Bauman wrote in his ruling. He said concerns by election officials that they had “reason to believe that an error was made in counting the votes” were persuasive and was helped by some candidates in the election speaking up in court and asking for the recount. Bauman also said that the deputy attorney general, Dominic Giova, assuaged his concerns that the investigation into ES&amp;S launched last month by Attorney General Matt Platkin might be compromised by the recount.</p>

According to The Associated Press, the issues will return to the court for oral arguments in mid-March. The two Democratic justices lamented the orders and said they stood against more than 200 years of court history in which rehearings have been exceedingly rare. They said it appeared it was happening simply because the court&#8217;s partisan makeup had changed. Two new Republican justices took office in early January after winning November elections for seats held by Democrats. “The legal issues are the same; the evidence is the same; and the controlling law is the same,” Associate Justice Anita Earls wrote in the dissent of the order agreeing to rehear the redistricting case. “The only thing that has changed is the political composition of the Court.” The rehearings ultimately could lead to new opinions that reinstate the photo ID mandate. The court&#8217;s rehearing orders mentioned little about the topics to be reconsidered. Rather, the court said a case can be reheard “if the petitioner makes a satisfactory showing that the opinion may be erroneous.&#8221; The legislators&#8217; petition or arguments met the requirements, the orders said.</p>

Under the terms of the agreement, David Barber, 72, and Henryetta Barber, 68, will not be charged with interference with the conduct of an election. In return, they must each pay a $50 fine, do 25 hours of community service, cease being poll workers and not violate any laws for six months. “If they complete that, no charges will be filed against them, and if they fail, we are back to square one,” said Erik Grayless, first assistant district attorney for Tulsa County. The Barbers were working at a shared polling place for Precincts 77 and 377 in City Council District 5 on Nov. 8 when incumbent Councilor Mykey Arthrell faced challenger Grant Miller in a runoff election. Early that morning, Miller received calls from voters who said they had not been handed a City Council ballot. Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado said at a press conference on election day that poll workers were not handing out City Council ballots to Republicans but were providing them to Democrats and independents, and it handed the case over to the District Attorney’s Office for possible charges. City Council elections are nonpartisan.</p>

The ruling follows an order the court issued last fall instructing counties to set aside all undated and wrongly dated ballots for last November’s midterm. It did not issue opinions explaining the decision at the time or providing guidance to counties going forward. The question of how to handle dates on mail ballots — state law requires voters to handwrite a date on the outer envelope — had been one of the most hotly contested legal and political fights in recent elections. In a tense status quo before last fall’s order, some counties had accepted undated ballots or ballots with any date, such as voters’ birth dates, saying it was unfair to disqualify ballots from legal voters simply because they had made a mistake. Writing for the court Justice David Wecht said the dating requirement spelled out in state law is clear: For a mail ballot to count, it must be dated with the date the voter filled it out. As for how a county should determine that the date on the ballot is the correct one, Wecht, a Democrat, wrote that that question “falls beyond our purview.” Individual county boards of elections, he said, “retain authority to evaluate the ballots that they receive in future elections.” That means it’s likely that counties will adopt different policies on which ballots to count or reject going forward. All six Supreme Court justices agreed that undated ballots should be rejected under state law, but two — Justices Christine Donohue and Debra Todd, both Democrats — split from the others on the question of incorrectly dated ballots. In a separate opinion, they said the ballot-dating requirement isn’t as clear as Wecht’s majority opinion makes it out to be. “In my view,” Donohue wrote, “a mail-in or absentee ballot received on or before election or primary day should be counted if it is signed and bears any date affixed by the elector.”</p>
<p>Brian Paul Vollman II, 25 of Lycoming County was<a href="https://www.northcentralpa.com/news/crime/man-charged-for-voting-twice-in-november-general-election/article_aae1ee5a-a4dc-11ed-b174-27cc6f5b9db6.html"> charged for voting twice</a> during the November 2022 election. Vollman voted on Nov. 8 at the Clinton Township polling location and then again at the Muncy Creek Township location. Poll discovered the error when Vollman’s father came to vote at the Clinton Township. Vollman had signed the polling book in the space for his father’s name, according to the affidavit written by county detective Joseph W. Hope. Vollman’s father called him and asked if he signed the book in his name. When Vollman admitted to signing his father’s name, Vollman Sr. yelled at him and told him he was not registered to vote in Clinton Township. When Forest Lehman, director of Lycoming County Voter Services, interviewed Vollman he told him he voted at the Muncy Creek Township location but denied voting in Clinton Township. A family member told Lehman that Vollman had voted in Clinton Township signing under his father’s name and then voted again at Muncy Township. Vollman was charged with a felony of repeat voting at elections. District Judge William C. Solomon set bail at $15,000 unsecured. A preliminary hearing at the Muncy magisterial office is set for Feb. 17.</p>
