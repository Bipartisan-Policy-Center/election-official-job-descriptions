							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>CIS to launch program that will change the landscape of non-voting technology</strong></p>
<p>By Marci Andino, Senior Director<br />
<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac">Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC)</a></p>
<p>Non-voting election technology is constantly evolving in response to changes in election law and a continually shifting security landscape. Without an efficient process that can keep up with these incremental changes, election jurisdictions expose both themselves and their election data to unnecessary risks. To address this challenge, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has developed a community-driven, cost-effective solution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5640" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png" alt="" width="300" height="77" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-768x197.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo.png 820w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />CIS piloted the Rapid Architecture Based Election Technology Verification (RABET-V) program to help election offices better understand the security, reliability, and risks associated with the technology used for non-voting systems like electronic pollbooks and voter registration systems. RABET-V directly addresses and decreases the risks associated with election technology and helps reduce costs for technology providers by offering a consistent approach to verifying the security of non-voting technology.</p>
<p>To determine the viability and effectiveness of RABET-V, CIS conducted a pilot in 2020 and tested five products, including two different electronic pollbooks and one state-developed voter registration system. All four vendors that participated in the pilot reported RABET-V created a roadmap to increase their overall security posture and organizational maturity.  Jamie Remes, Product Manager at VR Systems, notes, “The centralized and modular approach to ensuring security in election software updates demonstrated in the RABET-V pilot will make it significantly more efficient and cost-effective for election technology vendors to deploy the latest and most secure versions of software. Preserving the integrity of our nation’s elections infrastructure is critically important to VR Systems. RABET-V can play an important role in maintaining a high standard of security across the country.”</p>
<p><strong>Advantages over traditional testing</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10300" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EIISAC-300x95.png" alt="" width="300" height="95" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EIISAC-300x95.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EIISAC.png 654w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There are key differences between a traditional testing approach and RABET-V’s approach. RABET-V evaluates products based on the organization and the environment in which they are developed, whereas traditional testing approaches evaluate products in isolation. This means that, as opposed to only evaluating the product, RABET-V also evaluates the technology providers themselves, analyzing the strength of the company and whether the company has consistent policies and procedures.</p>
<p>RABET-V not only saves time and money, but also provides more transparency during and after the procurement process by offering election officials an independent verification process for non-voting systems. RABET-V assigns a score to the technology, making information more readily available to decision makers. With no lengthy, burdensome testing required for each incremental change, RABET-V encourages technology providers to improve their products.</p>
<p>Ways to implement and utilize RABET-V at the state or local level:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask your non-voting system technology providers if they have gone through the RABET-V assessment process.</li>
<li>Request or require non-voting system technology providers deliver a RABET-V report during the procurement process.</li>
<li>Use RABET-V as part of a larger state certification process. RABET-V can be adapted to existing certification processes, or in the case where a state or local jurisdiction does not have a certification process, implementing RABET-V represents a leap forward in providing transparency and accountability for non-voting system technology providers.</li>
<li>If you have specific questions, reach out to the RABET-V team directly at rabetv@cisecurity.org.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How it works</strong><br />
RABET-V is structured around three assessment modules, all of which are carried out by a certified assessor:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Organizational Assessment evaluates the proficiency of a technology provider in their product development practices. Its primary aim is to gauge the organization&#8217;s capability in developing technology products using modern software development best practices.</li>
<li>The Architecture Assessment evaluates the product&#8217;s structural components at both system and software levels. Its objective is to create a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks and their mitigations by scrutinizing the design foundation of the product.</li>
<li>Product Verification validates the overall security of the product through robust penetration (pen) testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>RABET-V offers numerous advantages for both technology providers and election officials alike. Technology providers receive enhanced feedback and a clear pathway for identifying organizational and product risk during the development process. RABET-V can also be an invaluable resource for election officials. The standardized verification process of RABET-V provides reliable and ongoing reporting of updates, allowing for better and quicker decision making on what non-voting technology to invest in, effectively managing risk over the life of the contract. This is in stark contrast to traditional testing which only provides an assessment of a product at the point of procurement.</p>
<p>The novel approach of RABET-V ensures that both technology providers and election officials benefit from a streamlined verification process, creating an environment that incentivizes continual growth in security posture and organizational maturity.</p>

English, Spanish, and Navajo (Diné) language videos were all recorded to expand the reach of this effort across New Mexico’s diverse communities.  “New Mexico’s county clerks and election administrators are the best in the nation – they work with diligence and integrity every day to make sure our democracy functions with fairness and efficiency,” said Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. “It’s important voters understand that these election professionals are your neighbors, friends, and community members and that New Mexicans know that your vote counts.” As early voting for local elections begins this week, the videos will be used in an ongoing voter education campaign this year and throughout the 2024 election cycle with the goals of humanizing election administrators and educating voters about election administration. The  project was coordinated by New Mexico First with the support of The Carter Center. The partners in this project included the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office, New Mexico League of Women Voters, New Mexico PBS, the New Mexico Local News Fund, Election Reformers Network and Elliott Marketing.</p>

Miyares (R)<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/11/miyares-virginia-voter-fliers/"> ordered a voter outreach group to stop distributing literature</a> that he says gives recipients the false impression that, if they don’t vote, they’ll lose certain federal benefits. The flyers began showing up last week and said, in part: &#8220;According to government records, one or more residents at this address has failed to vote in recent elections. Failure to vote may result in a loss of Social Security Income, Medicare eligibility, unemployment benefits, child tax credits, child custody rights, and concealed carry permits…” &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure how many voters received this, but we got several voters who contacted us and said they had gotten a flyer with some misinformation on it. The flyer talked about if they don&#8217;t go vote, that some of their rights &#8212; including things like Social Security or their ability to own a gun &#8212; would be taken away from them. That&#8217;s simply not true,&#8221; Prince William County Director of Elections Eric Olsen<a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/flyer-voting-scam-bristow-virginia-voter-assistance-prince-william-county-threats-misinformation-virginia-residents-scared-social-security-medicare-eligibility-benifits-eric-olsen-candidates-democrats-republicans"> said</a>. The Washington-based nonprofit organization behind the outreach campaign, Look Ahead America, said the message to about 30,000 recipients in mostly rural, blue-collar areas of the state was that they need to make their voices heard or risk policy decisions that could result in such outcomes. Miyares and local election officials in counties where the literature showed up say some recipients felt they were being intimidated and threatened by the group. A cease-and-desist letter sent by Miyares’s office warns Look Ahead America of criminal penalties if it continues to distribute the literature.</p>

The<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/artificial-intelligence-and-election-security"> first article in the series</a> covers AI and security for election offices and vendors. A table summarizing the article’s recommendations is<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-counter-ai-threats-election-security"> here</a>. Over the next few months, they will cover AI and other topics, including election administration, voter suppression, election disinformation, political ads, and the public comment process. In other AI news, The Washington Post had an article this week about<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/07/amazon-alexa-news-2020-election-misinformation/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNjk2NzM3NjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNjk4MTE5OTk5LCJpYXQiOjE2OTY3Mzc2MDAsImp0aSI6IjA3ZGUyNDk4LWVmOGEtNGM0OC05YmFjLWYyNmZlNjY5MzJlMSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjMvMTAvMDcvYW1hem9uLWFsZXhhLW5ld3MtMjAyMC1lbGVjdGlvbi1taXNpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi8ifQ.4rOFvHX38Gue9dF5NYg1I_doVReFbxoy-zRP0wM3UZ8"> Amazon’s Alexa</a> declaring that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. According to the Post, asked about fraud in the race the popular voice assistant said it was “stolen by a massive amount of election fraud,” citing Rumble, a video-streaming service favored by conservatives. “These responses were errors that were delivered a small number of times, and quickly fixed when brought to our attention,” Amazon spokeswoman Lauren Raemhild said in a statement. “We continually audit and improve the systems we have in place for detecting and blocking inaccurate content.” Raemhild said that during elections, Alexa works with “credible sources” like Reuters, Ballotpedia and RealClearPolitics to provide real-time information. After The Washington Post contacted Amazon for comment, Alexa’s responses changed. Last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) and Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-New York)<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/u-s-lawmakers-question-meta-and-x-over-ai-generated-political-deepfakes-ahead-of-2024-election"> sent a letter</a> to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and X CEO Linda Yaccarino expressing “serious concerns” about the emergence of AI-generated political ads on their platforms and asking each to explain any rules they’re crafting to curb the harms to free and fair elections. “They are two of the largest platforms and voters deserve to know what guardrails are being put in place,” said Klobuchar. “We are simply asking them, ‘Can’t you do this? Why aren’t you doing this?’ It’s clearly technologically possible.”</p>

Gavin Newsom has vetoed legislation that would have required dozens of his state&#8217;s largest cities, counties and educational districts to use<a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/california-governor-vetoes-bill-voting-districts-redistricting/45489058"> independent commissions to draw voting districts</a>, dealing a setback to “redistricting reform” advocates. “We’re frustrated, confused and deeply disappointed,” Jonathan Mehta Stein, executive director of voting rights group California Common Cause, said Monday. He added: “We were hopeful that this was an opportunity for California to show the rest of the nation what it looks like to put gerrymandering behind us.” Newsom vetoed a pair bills Saturday that would have taken away redistricting power from elected officials in Los Angeles and dozens of other jurisdictions and instead given the responsibility to independent commissions of local residents.  In a statement, the Democratic governor said he supported the “goal of ensuring community control over the redistricting process” but was concerned a mandate to create independent commissions could end up costing the state tens of millions of dollars. It marked the second time in four years that he has vetoed legislation requiring independent redistricting commissions for some local governments. Had Newsom signed the measure, California could have become the first state to mandate redistricting commissions for local jurisdictions over certain sizes, said Dan Vicuna, national director of redistricting and representation for Common Cause.</p>

Prior to the vote, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber sent a<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/9-28-23%20HUNTINGTON%20BEACH%20VOTER%20ID%20BALLOT%20MEASURE_LETTER.pdf"> letter</a> to the city council warning them that the proposed amendment would conflict with state law. &#8220;If the city moves forward and places it on the ballot, we stand ready to take appropriate action to ensure that voters’ rights are protected, and state election laws are enforced,&#8221; the letter read, adding that voter ID laws &#8220;only serve to suppress voter participation without providing any discernible local benefit.&#8221; If passed, the charter amendment would, starting in 2026, take the authority of running local elections away from Orange County, and hand it over to the city — along with the costs of running the election.</p>

Roy Cooper&#8217;s (D) vetoes</a>. In a series of votes, the narrow GOP supermajorities in the House and Senate overturned five Cooper vetoes, two of which address elections and voting. One would eliminate the governor&#8217;s power to appoint the State Board of Elections and give it to legislative leaders, while the other would end a three-day grace period to receive and count absentee ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The new elections and voting laws — years in the making after previous Cooper&#8217;s vetoes or lawsuits blocked legislation with similar provisions — advanced this year thanks to Republican seat gains in 2022 elections and an April party switch by a House Democrat to the Republican Party.</p>

In a contentious session that included singing, yelling, and arguments over the events of Jan. 6, the state House passed a bill along party lines that would move the date of the 2024 presidential primary from April 23 to April 2.  A second bill to move the primary to March 19 — previously approved by the state Senate — failed with a wide margin of bipartisan opposition. By the time of the vote, that bill had morphed into an omnibus election reform package. State Senate leaders have yet to publicly comment on whether they will bring the April 2 proposal up for a vote. The chamber had opted for March 19 as the date for the primary when it passed a bill last month. The current date of the 2024 primary, April 23, conflicts with the Jewish holiday of Passover and places the swing state late in the primary cycle. While the effort to move the primary has received bipartisan, bicameral, and gubernatorial support, counties, school boards, and a legislative advisory board are concerned it will strain local election offices, especially if lawmakers drag the decision out.</p>

David Cole (R-Huntsville)<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2023/10/11/former-alabama-representative-sentenced-after-pleading-guilty-voter-fraud/"> has been sentenced</a> to pay nearly $53,000 in restitution and serve a three-year split sentence. Cole will serve 60 days in Madison County Jail, followed by three years on probation after pleading guilty to voter fraud during the 2022 primary election. Cole pleaded guilty to voting at an unauthorized polling place back in November 2022. Cole was charged with fraud-voting at multiple or unauthorized locations, a Class C felony, and booked into the Madison County Jail where he was later released on a $2,500 bond. According to court documents, Cole “did knowingly vote in the November 8, 2022, general election at a polling police where he had not been authorized to vote, to wit: within the boundaries of Alabama House District 10&#8230;” According to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey’s office, the District 10 seat will remain vacant until a future special election can be scheduled. That date is unknown at this time.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Cochise County Superior Court David Thorn<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2023/10/10/judge-in-cochise-county-dismisses-election-lawsuit-related-to-jail-tax/71124938007/"> dismissed a lawsuit</a> that wanted a May special election for the creation of a tax district to be declared “null and void,” according to court documents. The tax district measure, which will help fund a new jail with a half-cent tax for 25 years, passed with 52% of the vote. The voters who tried to contest the election in court alleged the county&#8217;s elections board had no authority to organize the election because the board was appointed in 2022 and not 2023. Therefore, they argued, the votes cast were &#8220;illegal.&#8221; Thorn failed to find any misconduct by the board, or that any of the votes were illegal. “There is no reasonable inference &#8230; by which one could draw the conclusion that the votes cast in the 2023 Cochise County Jail Tax Election were ‘illegal,’” Thorn said in his decision. Thorn said illegal votes include votes cast by voters who are ineligible to vote, not registered to vote, those who vote in a partisan election when they are in a different political party, and fraudulent votes. He also noted that an election challenge to the process of an election must occur before the election. “The way an election is conducted must be challenged before the election occurs and not after,” Thorn said in his ruling.</p>

Many people who have been voters in Idaho for decades will find the new registration requirements difficult to complete.” According to Shaber, the new law burdens students, people who may have moved, people who don’t have homes and people with disabilities. The organizations say further that because many Idaho counties do not keep records on what types of IDs are used to vote, the statement of purpose on the law banning student IDs is “untrue and misleading.” House Bill 124 removed student IDs as an acceptable form of voter ID. Babe Vote and the League of Women Voters in Idaho said the law would make it more difficult for students who were 18 but still in school to vote. Hoagland ruled that was not the case and dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5223" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maine-Flag-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maine-Flag-300x211.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maine-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Maine:</strong> A panel of judges in the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments last week in a case that could determine<a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2023-10-05/federal-judges-weigh-whether-maine-voter-list-can-be-published-by-conservative-voter-fraud-group"> whether a conservative group can publish identifying information about Maine voters</a>. October 7’s arguments stemmed from a 2019 lawsuit brought by the Public Interest Legal Foundation against the Maine Secretary of State&#8217;s Office which refused to provide its voter registration list to a group devoted to proving the existence of rampant voter fraud. At the time, the state only provided its voter registration list to candidates and political parties. But in 2021, Gov. Janet Mills signed a law that allowed other organizations to obtain the lists so long as voter identifying information isn&#8217;t published. The foundation argues those privacy protections run afoul of federal law and impede its efforts to compare voting lists across multiple states. Assistant attorney general Jonathan Bolton, who is defending the Secretary of State, told the panel that the 2021 law allows the foundation to review Maine&#8217;s methods of culling and verifying the accuracy of its voter rolls. &#8220;Does it have a federal right — not just to evaluate and criticize maintenance practices, which we agree that it does &#8212; but to include in its published reports, individual voter names, their resident addresses, their party affiliations, the elections they voted in?&#8221; Bolton said. The U.S. Justice Department argued that Maine is required to disclose the voting lists, but it also urged the federal appeals court to let Maine&#8217;s law court review the 2021 law&#8217;s privacy protections.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5224" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />North Carolina:</strong> Within minutes of passing into law this week<a href="https://www.wral.com/story/voting-rights-groups-sue-over-new-nc-elections-law-seeking-to-block-changes-for-2024/21090474/">, a controversial and wide-ranging change to elections laws led to North Carolina being sued at least twice</a>. A prominent Democratic attorney sued North Carolina on behalf of multiple voting rights groups Tuesday. So did national Democratic Party, along with its state chapter. Both lawsuits were filed in federal court. The legislation, Senate Bill 747, became law after Republican lawmakers voted to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper&#8217;s veto of the bill. The override passed with every Republican in favor, and every Democrat opposed. It contains numerous changes to elections laws, particularly focused on loosening the rules governing partisan poll observers and tightening the rules for mail-in voting. The new law will encourage voter intimidation, the Democratic National Committee said in its lawsuit, due to the newly loosened rules for poll observers. The lawsuit also challenges numerous other parts of the bill, including a provision to eliminate the three-day grace period for mail-in ballots which the lawsuit says is completely necessary. Republicans have said it&#8217;s important for voters&#8217; trust in the process to have all mail-in ballots counted by election night — a key complaint of Trump&#8217;s in 2020 — but the lawsuit claims that&#8217;s disingenuous because at the same time, the law also allows more time for mail-in ballots to be challenged: Drawing out the process, rather than speeding it up. The lawsuit by Democratic attorney Marc Elias, on behalf of groups including Voto Latino and Down Home North Carolina, claims the new elections law will unfairly cancel people&#8217;s ability to vote without them ever being notified or given a chance to defend themselves. The lawsuit also claims that targeting same-day registration is part of a trend for Republican lawmakers, noting that many of the people who could be most affected are Black, Hispanic and/or college students — all groups that vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Republicans tried getting rid of same-day registration altogether as part of a wide-ranging 2013 law with numerous election law changes, which was struck down in federal court for intentional racial discrimination.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5226" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Tennessee:</strong> In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Tennessee over a law that<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/sixth-circuit-upholds-tennessee-ban-on-the-sharing-of-absentee-ballot-forms/"> makes it a felony for non-election officials to share absentee ballot forms</a> with another person. The ruling agreed with the lower court that the Tennessee law does not violate free speech rights by restricting who can hand out absentee ballot applications. U.S. Circuit Judge Eric Murphy, a Donald Trump appointee, authored the majority’s opinion finding that the act of distributing the forms only qualifies as conduct and not speech. Tennessee has criminalized the improper distribution of absentee ballot forms since 1979, and in 2002 responded to some confusion surrounding the rule by adding a separate ban on the distribution of the forms by non-election officials. The<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tennessee-absentee-ballot-sharing-lawsuit-20220.pdf"> original lawsuit</a> was filed in 2020 and claimed that the rule violated free speech rights and was outdated because the forms are now freely available online through the website of Tennessee’s Secretary of State.  The plaintiffs — which include civil rights groups such as the Tennessee State Conference of the NAACP and the Equity Alliance — sought to engage in voter outreach by handing out absentee ballot applications. U.S. District Judge Eli J. Richardson dismissed the suit in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5228" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-300x229.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Virginia:</strong> A lawsuit against Governor Glenn Youngkin over the<a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2023-10-06/virginia-lawsuit-over-voting-rights-restoration-clears-early-hurdle"> felon voting rights</a> restoration process can continue. Lawyers for George Hawkins, Jr., a former felon and Richmond native, argued in court Friday that the state’s felon voting rights restoration process under the Republican governor had become so opaque it violates his First Amendment rights. Hawkins was convicted of attempted murder at the age of 17. He got out of prison a few months ago after serving 15 years. He tried to get his right to vote restored, but was denied. In Virginia the governor has the sole authority to restore a felon’s right to vote, but specifics on that restoration process are undefined. Republican Governor Bob McDonnell was one of the first governors to simplify the process, and his Democratic successors continued that tradition. But restoration slowed under the Youngkin administration, and October 6, U.S. District Judge John Adrian Gibney Jr. in the Eastern District of Virginia found Hawkins&#8217; denial gave him grounds to pursue his claims. An order on the state&#8217;s effort to dismiss the constitutional claims is expected in the coming days.</p>
