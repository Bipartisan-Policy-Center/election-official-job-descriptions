														<p><strong>New Report on Automatic Voter Registration</strong><br />
<em>AVR leads to significant increase in GA’s voter reg rate and list accuracy</em></p>
<p>A new<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/georgia-automatic-voter-registration/"> report</a> from the<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/"> Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</a> (CEIR) finds that the implementation of automatic voter registration (AVR) in Georgia resulted in a remarkable 20 percentage point increase in the state’s active voter registration rate. The <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6180" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-300x282.png" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020-300x282.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GAIVoted2020.png 566w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />report highlights the success of Georgia’s approach, which has not only improved access to the vote but also enhanced the integrity of the electoral process. CEIR will host a webinar to discuss the report on Wednesday, June 21 at 12:00 pm ET. Register<a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4216862331586/WN_M50DZRLVR0ua5itantE_Bg"> here</a> to join.</p>
<p>Georgia implemented AVR in September 2016 as part of a broader effort to make its registration process more efficient, convenient, and modern. CEIR&#8217;s analysis reveals that in the first four years after implementation, Georgia&#8217;s active voter registration rate increased from 78 percent to 98 percent. Georgia operates AVR through the state&#8217;s Department of Driver Services (DDS).</p>
<p>DDS has become a major source of voter registrations in the state, consistently registering new voters and updating existing registrations at a higher rate than other registration sources. As a result, nearly 97 percent of all registered voters have both a driver’s license and Social Security number associated with their records, providing officials with more details to verify voter transactions.</p>
<p>“Georgia has been particularly successful in integrating its motor vehicles and voter databases, so that when anyone updates their driver’s license information, their voter record is also automatically updated,” said David Becker, CEIR’s Executive Director.  “And by ensuring that nearly all voter records have a driver&#8217;s license number, the state has also made verifying mail ballots more secure and easier to verify for both voters and election officials.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9826" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Another key finding of the report is the improved accuracy and representativeness of Georgia’s voter rolls. As the registration rate increased, the composition of registered voters began to more closely mirror the state’s population in terms of both age and gender. Furthermore, CEIR found a substantial reduction in inactive records, which constituted an average of 14 percent of the voter list in the 16 years before implementation. This inactivity rate dropped to just 5 percent four years after its implementation, indicating a more accurate and current voter list..</p>
<p>“Georgia shows us that states can approach election issues in a way that both increases access to the vote and the integrity of the process,” said Becker. “While other states have made great strides in implementing AVR in their own way, Georgia is notable for its bipartisan approach, which can be a model for others to follow.”</p>
<p>Join CEIR for the<a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4216862331586/WN_M50DZRLVR0ua5itantE_Bg"> webinar</a> discussion on the report on Wednesday, June 21 at 12:00 pm ET. David Becker will be joined by Ryan Germany, who served as General Counsel for the Georgia Secretary of State when the new policy was implemented. They will review the report findings, discuss lessons learned during the implementation process, and how the policy can serve as a model for other states. You can register to join the webinar<a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4216862331586/WN_M50DZRLVR0ua5itantE_Bg"> here</a>.</p>

<em>Ideas for combating mistrust and polarization in US Elections</em></p>

Many Americans harbor mistaken beliefs about the outcome of the 2020 elections and the way elections are run, and foreign and domestic bad actors are all too happy to take advantage of that. This problem is exacerbated by widespread polarization, which is threatening to paralyze citizens and public officials from finding ways to address these issues. It’s time for some new ideas.</p>

<p>Pulling lessons from six countries, including Canada, Sweden, and South Korea, Rachael Dean Wilson, Kevin Johnson, and David Levine recommend several solutions the US can implement to ensure free and fair elections. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incentivizing accountability through ranked choice voting</li>
<li>Increasing trust through impartial election administration</li>
<li>Providing good information through pre- and debunking</li>
</ul>
<p>“Virulent polarization and the trust-destroying propagation of election related mis- and disinformation remain acute threats to American democracy,” said report author Rachael Dean Wilson, managing director of ASD at GMF. “Successfully tackling these threats hinges on whether we deploy the best ideas to combat them. No country, including the US has a monopoly on good ideas, and we should consider how strategies that helped improve trust in other democracies could be applied in the United States to bolster confidence.”</p>
<p>“Freedom is a universal human aspiration, and so too is a well-functioning democracy on which freedom depends,” said report author Kevin Johnson, executive director of ERN. “Let’s leverage the best ideas available to make our democracy function as well as it possibly can.”</p>

Many of them, with the support of<a href="https://issueone.org/projects/facesofdemocracy/"> Issue One</a>, recently met with Congressional leaders in Washington, DC. “People don’t realize the mental health situation,” Tonya Wichman, the director of the Defiance County, Ohio Board of Elections said. “We’ve lost a lot of election officials throughout the country. They’re calling it the ‘Great Resignation.’ People are broken and exhausted.” The $400 million that election administrators are requesting from Congress would go towards security measures including training to stop or deal with doxxing, privacy services and home security and federal protections against threats. Currently, election operations are funded at the city and county level, making the funding inconsistent and the task of upping security that much harder. “I want to make sure that every one of my voters has the chance to make their voice heard,” says Boone County, Mo. Clerk Brianna Lennon. “And that means that we can’t have interference from people that don’t have that in mind. I hope that all levels of government with funding sources that come into elections recognize the importance of investing in our elections. Now.”</p>

In 2022 Ohio lawmakers approved a bill that<a href="https://www.wvxu.org/2023-06-14/larose-ohio-law-banning-august-elections-doesnt-apply-state-lawmakers"> banned most special elections</a> but Secretary of State Frank LaRose and others successfully sued to bring the constitutional questions to a vote.  Now, local elections officials are scrambling to pull together a special election. In<a href="https://medina-gazette.com/news/355489/medina-county-board-of-elections-gives-update-on-august-election/"> Medina County</a>, the board of elections passed a motion to reduce the number of poll workers staffed for the August election.<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2023/06/cuyahoga-county-bracing-for-costly-august-election-with-high-voter-turnout-state-assures-will-reimburse.html"> Cuyahoga County</a>’s Board of Elections Director Anthony Perlatti estimated it will cost the county’s 970 precincts around $3,250 each to print ballots, pay postage for mail-in ballots and provide extra staffing, especially considering it will be county residents’ first time using the new voting machines. But those costs might also increase if voter turnout is greater than expected – as he thinks it will be. He worries that the $15 million currently proposed in the Senate budget won’t be enough to cover the bill. And though state law requires Ohio to pick up the tab for elections called “solely for the purpose of” a statewide ballot issue, “what we don’t have is a real answer on how that’s going to happen,” he told county council’s Budget and Finance. Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) has said the Senate would not be opposed to<a href="https://woub.org/2023/06/09/ohio-senate-leader-says-elections-officials-will-have-enough-money-to-conduct-august-8-election/"> appropriating more funding</a> if necessary. In addition to concerns about costs, getting enough poll workers is also a concern for an August election.  <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/2023-06-12/ohio-officials-worry-poll-workers-august-election">Hamilton County</a> Board of Elections Deputy Director Alex Linser says they need nearly 2,500 people to run an election. &#8220;I think if you ask elections officials anyway they&#8217;ll tell you the number one challenge is recruiting poll workers, but it&#8217;s especially hard when you have to do it on short notice and when you&#8217;re doing it over the summer,&#8221; Linser says. &#8220;When we do it in August, people have conflicts; a lot of our usual suspects are on summer vacation and traveling, so we really need people to step up and try it for the first time.&#8221; Meanwhile in Utah, while the Legislature still needs to act formally, local elections officials are beginning the process not only prepare for a special election, but to<a href="https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2023-06-08/here-are-utahs-new-2023-election-dates-that-clerks-are-scrambling-to-make-happen"> move previously-scheduled elections</a> to other dates because of the special election. Marki Rowley, the Millard County clerk, said the new schedule poses a few hurdles, especially because both election days are sandwiched between two holidays. The staff usually gets Black Friday off, but not this year. “It&#8217;s going to take a lot of holiday freedom away from our offices just because of the dates that they&#8217;re so close [to],” she said. “Just asking that of our people and asking that of our poll workers – it&#8217;s a lot. I&#8217;m hoping that we don&#8217;t lose people.” Weber County Clerk/Auditor Ricky Hatch said this<a href="https://www.standard.net/news/government/2023/jun/09/weber-county-officials-discuss-impact-of-election-day-changes/"> unprecedented change will bring new challenges</a>. “This shouldn’t impact the county’s workload, although with election day being two days before Thanksgiving, election officials will have a hurried, lean or possibly even a takeout Thanksgiving dinner this year,” he said. “There will likely be some additional cost, as the county will need to provide holiday overtime pay for personnel working elections on Labor Day and possibly Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday. Results on primary election day may represent a lower number of total ballots cast, since the (U.S. Postal Service) will not be delivering mail on Labor Day. Updated releases of results after the general election day may be delayed due to the Thanksgiving holiday.”</p>

Ketola is a motivational speaker, para-athlete, semi-professional soccer coach and professional graphic designer.  “Bryan’s design says a lot about our community and our democracy,” said Mary Hall, Thurston County Auditor. “’I Voted’ stickers are important symbols of civic participation and democracy in action. I encourage voters to wear them proudly. These small, colorful badges carry significant meaning, as they represent an individual’s engagement and contribution to the democratic process.”  The Auditor’s Office solicited “I Voted” sticker designs from Thurston County residents. Thirty-seven artists submitted at least one design.   The winning design will be available in every ballot packet sent to Thurston County voters during the primary and general elections. Second and third place designs will be available at Voting Centers during the elections.</p>

Katie Hobbs’ veto stamp.  The House voted 31-29 along party lines to approve<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/79567?SessionId=127"> House Bill 2722</a>, which would allow any county in the state to perform a hand-count of ballots in an election, in place of an electronic count. The Senate approved the bill 16-12, also along party lines, on May 15. The bill next goes to Hobbs. “Attempting to bring this irresponsible, inaccurate, unreliable and utterly broken election system to Arizona amounts to nothing short of an attack on our democracy and on fair, impartial and accurate elections,” Rep. Oscar De Los Santos, (D-Laveen) said.</p>
<p>Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) has<a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1849036/hobbs-vetoes-3-bills-relating-elections-matters"> vetoed several more elections-related bills</a> from the 2023 legislative session.<a href="https://mcusercontent.com/44a5186aac69c13c570fca36a/files/3d8014ff-e92d-4476-79c9-c9472a89a1a9/SB1213_.pdf"> One bill</a> would have required approval of that manual from not just the Arizona governor and attorney general, but also the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. In a veto letter, Hobbs said the bill was an attempt by the Legislature to meddle with elections.<a href="https://mcusercontent.com/44a5186aac69c13c570fca36a/files/1cb1c9c7-da9b-5a65-cc02-3c3876b07173/SB1597_.pdf"> Another bill </a>would have directed Maricopa and Pima counties to have on-site tabulation for early voters in at least one polling location per district. Hobbs said that on-site tabulation creates logistical and cost challenges that the bill did not resolve.<a href="https://mcusercontent.com/44a5186aac69c13c570fca36a/files/ddb6e51a-2aaf-f3e1-c498-72cc06a1775a/SB1264_.pdf"> The final vetoed measure</a> would have barred election officials from being a member of a political action committee, outside of those for their own candidacy.</p>

Ned Lamont<a href="https://www.courant.com/2023/06/13/its-official-new-ct-voting-rights-signed-into-law-heres-what-they-do/"> signed into law</a> a bill to protect historically disenfranchised communities from discrimination at the ballot box, including key protections once considered a stronghold of the 1965 Voting Rights Act before it was gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority. The legislation, labeled the<a href="https://www.housedems.ct.gov/node/24574"> John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of Connecticut,</a> was signed as part of the state’s $51 billion biennium budget. It was folded into the budget because its implementation includes more than $3 million in state funding over the next two fiscal years. With the governor’s signature, Connecticut joins five other states — California, Oregon, Washington, Virginia and New York — that have made the state-level voting rights act law. Passage of the bill, which starts going into effect on July 1 and will be fully enacted by the start of next year, comes as the state has opted to implement two weeks of early voting starting next year following overwhelming support from residents during the 2022 midterm election. Mirroring key protections in the federal Voting Rights Act, the new state law requires municipalities with a record of voter discrimination to receive “preclearance” from either the secretary of the state or a superior court before implementing changes to election-related policies. The law also prevents municipalities from taking actions that would interfere with the right to vote of any protected class member, defined as a class of citizens who are members of a race, color or language minority group. It also requires municipalities to provide language-related assistance to voters if their population comprises a certain percentage of people who speak English “less than very well.” It would allow superior courts to “order appropriate remedies” if and when it finds that a municipality violated the law. Residents can also sue against acts of intimidation, deception or obstruction that interfere with their right to vote. Additionally, the bill mandates the creation of a publicly accessible database under the secretary of the state’s office, in partnership with the University of Connecticut or a Connecticut State University System member, providing elections and demographics information.</p>

House Bill 201 would make the possession of a firearm in a school and recreation zone a felony. The bill would make possession of a gun on these properties a felony offense. However law enforcement officers, constables, and other select officials would be exempt from this rule. Those with a concealed carry permit would also be exempt from this rule, but only if their gun was in their weapon remains in their vehicle inside a locked container or locked gun rack. House Bill 202 would firearms at in person polling locations, with the exception of law enforcement officers or other select personnel such as security guards. Both bills not head to the senate for further consideration.</p>

Before, poll workers were only paid $10 an hour. Local leaders petitioned the board for a per diem of only $100, but Commissioner Cheryl Musgrave made a motion to increase the compensation. County Democrats Chair Cheryl Schultz says that the pay increase will ensure that the county gets the help it needs ahead of the presidential election next year. ”Last November these people spent fourteen hours opening ballots and were only compensated $90, so it’s getting much more difficult to get people to come and do this again,” said Schultz.</p>

What that looks like to voters will depend on where in the state they live.  The House and Senate both passed legislation this week that lays out how it will work, leaving it to municipal and county governments to decide the exact number of early voting days and the number of polling places. Early voting is the centerpiece of a series of landmark changes to elections that legislators are putting into place after the passage of ballot Proposal 2 last November. A package of eight bills Democrats introduced last week is now moving through the full House and Senate. In the past, Michigan voters could vote early only through an absentee ballot, including an option to request and fill out an absentee ballot during an in-person visit to a local clerk’s office, but the ballots were then set aside to be counted on Election Day. Under the early voting bill, polling places will be open at least eight hours a day, over a minimum of nine consecutive days, and voters will cast their ballot into a tabulator to be counted on site, just as they do on Election Day.</p>
<p>A new bill proposed in the Senate would allow<a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/proposed-bill-would-allow-early-processing-tabulating-of-absentee-ballots-in-michigan"> early processing and tabulating of absentee ballots</a>. Senate Bill 387, introduced by State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D &#8211; Southfield), aims to address an issue that has affected clerks throughout the state ever since a proposal passed in 2018 to allow no-excuse absentee voting.  Under the bill, cities or townships with a population of at least 5,000 people, or a board of county election commissioners, can begin processing and tabulating absentee ballots on any of the eight days before election day. It would be allowed between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. starting the second Monday before election day and ending on the Monday the day before election day. To be able to participate, the city or township clerk would have to submit a written notice to the Michigan Secretary of State no later than 28 days before election day, and then the Secretary of State will publish a list of those cities and townships on their website.</p>

The proposal would permit communities to ask for a share of the state&#8217;s $12.8 million surplus of federal Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants New Hampshire has received over the past two decades to improve voting access. Without debate, the House attached the proposal to a Senate-passed bill (SB 70) to create a voter information portal on the website of Secretary of State David Scanlan&#8217;s office. The new portal would allow citizens to register online to vote more easily, to update their voter information or to request absentee ballots. The legislation heads back to the state Senate and it&#8217;s likely this issue will go to a conference committee of House and Senate negotiators to try and work out their differences. The state Senate had earlier killed separate legislation (SB 73) to permit the use of HAVA money for voting machines while the House Election Laws Committee had decided to retain its own legislation on the topic (HB 447) until early in 2024.</p>

The first bill, S-3519/S-3593, changes certain General Election deadlines. The bill would reframe various deadlines related to elections to be relative to the deadline for filing petitions as they would have been prior to 2022, when changes were made via legislative action to deadlines concerning filing petitions and candidate certification, the deadline for ballot drawing, and the deadline by which clerks must provide materials to printers. A second bill, S-3594, requires periodic reporting of election results on the night of primary and general elections and up until the time of a final tally thereafter. Among other features, the bill stipulates that by 11 p.m., on the day of the election, and by 9 p.m., of every day after, until all eligible ballots have been counted and the election certified, that each county clerk, in consultation with the county board of elections of that county, must list on the county clerk’s Internet site an unofficial report detailing the number and types of ballots that have been received.</p>

The<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/s7394"> &#8220;New York Early Mail Voter Act&#8221;</a> would bring New York as close as possible to universal, no-excuse absentee voting (or its equivalent) without amending the state constitution by allowing all voters to mail-in a ballot during the nine days of early voting that prefaces every primary and general election, beginning in 2024. Because mailed ballots would be accepted through election day, the bill would essentially open a parallel vote-by-mail system to New York&#8217;s existing absentee ballot system, which would also remain on the books. The latest version of the 41-page bill was introduced in the last week of the legislative session and quickly passed by the State Senate&#8217;s Democratic majority. On June 9, the last full day of the legislative session, the bill had gained momentum in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, having moved from the Ways And Means Committee to the Rules Committee, before passing on the floor late in the evening. Governor Kathy Hochul has not said whether or not she will sign it. In a Saturday email, a spokesperson for the governor said she will review the bill.</p>
<p>Legislation awaiting the governor’s signature or veto would change how<a href="https://www.post-journal.com/news/top-stories/2023/06/bill-would-limit-courts-for-election-law-cases/"> elections-related court cases</a> are heard. If A.5874/S.350 is signed into law, judges in small counties won’t hear most election laws. Instead those challenges will be heard in one of four state Supreme Courts located in New York County, Albany County, Westchester County and Erie County. The Assembly approved the bill by an 82-62 vote, with some Democrats joining Republicans in opposition. The state Senate approved the legislation on Jan. 9.</p>

Senate leader Phil Berger and other top Republicans held a press conference, telling reporters the changes are needed to improve voters&#8217; confidence in elections. Their plan, Senate Bill 749, is highly similar to other GOP-backed changes to overhaul the elections board in recent years. The others have all failed — either ruled unconstitutional in court, or shot down at the ballot box by voters. Republican lawmakers say they want to try again, for the sake of election integrity. “It’s incontrovertible that we’re living in a time of severe partisan polarization, and that affects voters’ perception of election fairness,” Sen. Paul Newton, R-Cabarrus, said. “When you have an elections board that’s controlled by one party, roughly half of the voters are going to question and doubt the fairness of the elections — and, in some cases, the outcome.” Democrats have controlled the board since 2017, due to a state law that says whichever party holds the governor&#8217;s office also gets three of the five seats on the state elections board. The Republican-led legislature tried changing the election board&#8217;s makeup as soon as Cooper was elected governor, to use a system similar to the one they&#8217;re proposing again now. The board would increase to eight members if this bill becomes law, with four picked by Democratic lawmakers and four picked by Republican lawmakers. That same idea was ruled unconstitutional five years ago. County-level elections boards ar set up similarly to the state board. This bill would also change those county boards to have an equal number of seats, split between the two parties.</p>

Senate Bill 375 specifies that primary elections will occur on the third Tuesday of June instead of the last Tuesday of June. Additionally, it moves the starting date of the candidate filing period from the second Wednesday in April to the first Wednesday. This ensures election officials have sufficient time during the 45-day window between the last primary election and the runoff to meet the federal and state deadlines to get absentee ballots to servicemen and women deployed overseas. Senate Bill 376 clarifies that if someone signs on behalf of a physically incapacitated voter on an absentee ballot affidavit, the assistant must sign the voter’s name. There is another section on the affidavit for the assistant to sign his or her personal name. Confusion over current law wording resulted in what should have been valid ballots being discarded because they could not be traced back to the registered voter. This will go into effect Nov. 1, 2023. Senate Bill 377 which will also become effective Nov. 1, will require the cancellation of voter registration of anyone excused from jury duty for not being a U.S. citizen. County court clerks will prepare a list each month of these individuals and submit it to their county election board secretary, who will cancel the registrations and report them to the district attorney and the U.S. attorney for that county.</p>

Chris Stewart’s unexpected resignation, which is set to take effect on Sept. 15. With a looming vacancy, lawmakers will vote on a<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2023S2/bills/static/HB2001.html"> revised bill</a> related to the<a href="https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2023-06-14/2023-utah-special-session-special-elections"> upcoming statewide municipal and special elections</a>. Gov. Spencer Cox called the special legislative session to push back the municipal election days, originally scheduled for Aug. 15 and Nov. 7. Without legislative intervention, the soonest Utah’s 2nd Congressional District seat could be filled would have been next March. The legislation on the table outlines new election days, when mail-in ballots need to be postmarked and the deadline to switch voter party affiliation ahead of the primary. But the changes only apply to this election cycle. Once the clock strikes May 1, 2024, the statute disappears and Utah returns to its traditional election system. Two-thirds of the Legislature must vote for the bill in order for it to take effect.</p>

Rossi, a Democrat, lost the machine vote in the Nov. 2, 2021 election, but won by 29 votes when absentee ballots were counted. Her margin expanded to 32 votes after an automatic recount. Republican challenger Barry Lee Cohen challenged the absentee ballot count in Superior Court, but lost there when Judge Robin Wilson decided West Haven “failed to strictly comply” with all provisions of the law governing casting and counting of absentee ballots, but the failure wasn’t great enough to turn the outcome in Cohen’s favor. The state Supreme Court agreed in a 34-page plurality decision by Justices Andrew McDonald that sorted out aspects of absentee ballot regulation running from who has authority to collect ballots from drop boxes to the sorts of affidavits required to validate the votes. McDonald was joined by Justices Joan Alexander and Christine Keller. Two concurring opinions disagreed with the plurality opinion that state law authorizes the municipal clerk and his ‘‘designees’’ to retrieve absentee ballots from secure drop boxes. In one concurrence, Justice Gregory D’Auria and Chief Justice Richard Robinson assert that the law authorizes only the clerk, and in certain circumstances, appointed assistant clerks, to collect ballots. In the second, Justice Steven Ecker agreed with the plurality, but only after consideration of a 2021 amendment to the law.</p>
<p>Joyce Fratello of Greenwich has<a href="https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/greenwich-woman-fined-4k-absentee-vote-18141919.php"> agreed to pay the state $4,000</a> after she admitted she mailed in a Connecticut absentee ballot that she had signed with her daughter’s name during the 2020 election while her daughter voted in another state. Fratello applied for an absentee ballot using her daughter’s information ahead of the 2020 election without her daughter&#8217;s permission or knowledge, according to a Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission investigation. The daughter was living in Florida at the time and registered to vote there. Fratello received the absentee ballot addressed to her daughter, filled out the ballot, signed her daughter’s name and mailed it off in Connecticut, according to SEEC. In Florida, the daughter also cast a ballot during the 2020 election. The double vote was caught thanks to the Electronic Registration Information Center</p>

Robinson was sentenced to 36 months in prison after willfully voting in the 2020 election while not qualified to do so due to his status as a felony sex offender. Robinson’s public defender previously asked for a maximum of 30 months; however, the state attorney proposed 36 months to close the case. The defendant agreed to take the deal.</p>
<p>Eugene Florence, 33, of Moore Haven will serve 16 months in prison after he was found guilty of<a href="https://news.wgcu.org/election/2023-06-09/ex-fort-myers-man-gets-prison-in-swfl-voter-registration-case"> fraudulent voter registration activities</a>. Florence was employed by an organization called “Hard Knocks,” a company that claims to mobilize voters to get people to register to vote. Florence worked for the organization in 2021, knowingly submitted voter registrations of individuals who did not swear to the oath or contents.  Florence, who has a significant arrest and conviction record in Southwest Florida, was sentenced by Lee County Judge Edward J Volz Jr. to 16 months in prison which will be served concurrent to a five-year prison sentence for other charges. Several “Hard Knocks” employees submitted voter registrations that drew the attention of the Lee and Charlotte County Supervisors of Elections. The State Attorney’s Office investigation determined fraudulent voter registration applications were submitted. Three others have also been arrested as a result of this investigation.</p>

One report detailed vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to change votes. The other determined that the risk of someone committing such acts is remote. A<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-voting-touchscreens-vulnerable-cybersecurity-agency-finds/AFNISYMQLFEBHJPCBDTW6VUWUA/"> federal assessment</a> found no evidence that the vulnerabilities had ever been exploited. And despite claims by former President Donald Trump, numerous investigations and recounts determined his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden was not tainted by fraud. The reports were released as part of an ongoing lawsuit that seeks to force Georgia to drop its Dominion Voting Systems hardware and software in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. The first report was produced by Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Totenberg gave Halderman access to Georgia voting equipment and passwords. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a defendant in the lawsuit, has rejected the report’s conclusions. He’s said Halderman was able to find vulnerabilities only because he had unique access to the voting system, and security procedures would thwart an attack in the real world. Dominion Voting Systems hired the MITRE National Election Security Lab, an organization that analyzes election equipment and evaluated the risk of vulnerabilities, to assess the Halderman report. Totenberg sealed both reports out of concern they could be used to hack Georgia’s system during an election. But she unsealed them after critics and supporters of the system asked for them to be made public. Halderman’s report has been redacted to prohibit the release of sensitive information.</p>

In addition to Karamo, those responsible for covering the amount include Daniel Hartman — who currently serves as in-house counsel for the Michigan GOP, according to a recent interview with a conservative publication — along with Alexandria Taylor, who recently filed to run as a Republican for Michigan&#8217;s open U.S. Senate seat.

The ruling represents a setback for a coalition of groups who have sought to annul six laws passed this year by the Legislature via the rarely-used referendum process. The court challenge against the secretary of state was filed in April by Ramona Goolsby of Rio Rancho, who is involved with a coalition of groups seeking to get the targeted laws on the November 2024 ballot for a repeal vote. In her petition, she argued Toulouse Oliver overstepped her authority by ruling the abortion law is exempt from referendum, saying only the Legislature can determine whether laws or necessary for the public peace and welfare. But Noel rejected that argument in his ruling by granting a motion filed by the Secretary of State’s Office to dismiss the court challenge. “It is very disappointing that New Mexicans are being misled about the referendum petition process by certain groups and individuals,” Toulouse Oliver said in a Thursday statement. “But I’m pleased to see the court clarify this matter today with their ruling in favor of our position that the laws currently being targeted for referendum are, in fact, exempted from the referendum process.” “This is a win for the rule of law and for all New Mexicans,” she added.</p>

A trial began Monday in Fargo in the federal lawsuit brought last year by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe, who allege the redistricting done in 2021 by the Republican-led Legislature violates the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 civil rights law. Their complaint alleges the reapportionment “packs” Turtle Mountain tribal members into one House district and leaves Spirit Lake out of a majority-Native district. A federal judge last year denied the state&#8217;s request to dismiss the case on the grounds that the tribes lack standing to sue. The bench trial in Fargo is estimated to last five days. A judge will decide the verdict.</p>

Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose immediately reconvened the Ohio Ballot Board for Tuesday afternoon. The high court ruled unanimously that the ballot board was wrong to describe the measure as increasing the standards to qualify “any” constitutional amendment for the ballot. That&#8217;s because it imposes its steep new signature-gathering requirements only on citizen-initiated amendments, not on amendments advanced by the Ohio General Assembly. If passed, it would up the number of Ohio counties where ballot campaigns must gather names from 44 to all 88. The ballot language also misdescribes the percentage of electors required in each county to qualify a citizen-led issue for the ballot. It&#8217;s 5% of those who voted in the last gubernatorial election, not 5% of all voters in that county. In a separate opinion, Justice Jennifer Brunner also argued that the measure places “onerous” new requirements on citizen-led ballot initiatives that should be more clearly spelled out.</p>

The fact that they didn&#8217;t make the information public was partly at least partly as a request of our office so that information doesn&#8217;t get leaked so the partial information isn&#8217;t released, which could adversely affect the investigation,&#8221; said D.A. Sam Sanguedolce. Sanguedolce&#8217;s report shows 16 polling sites in Luzerne County ran out of ballot paper during the general election last year, leading voters to use emergency or provisional ballots. One concern was that this paper shortage was targeted at Republican and or Conservative polling sites, something Sanguedolce says is not true. &#8220;That was factually inaccurate and quickly put to bed as we learned that those reports were coming in pretty much from every election ward in Luzerne County,&#8221; he explained. No criminal charges will be filed against county or election workers.</p>

Additionally, Bramwell Mayor Lou Stoker has agreed not to “interfere with the municipal election.” Wills’ order was released after several petitioners filed a petition to remove a poll clerk that was appointed, they said, in “direct violation of West Virginia Code.” According to the petition, at a special meeting on May 27 the governing body of Bramwell appointed two registered Democrats as poll clerks, one of whom is not a resident of Bramwell. Poll clerks must represent at least two political parties, even in non-partisan elections. Wills granted an amended temporary order for the declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, overturning the appointment of a poll clerk and directing the Town Recorder to appoint a Republican from available trained poll workers pursuant to state Code. The order also directed Stoker not to interfere with the municipal election.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_I4pr0BiKR3a9TJmVjcrO5Q#/registration">Accelerating Excellence: Florida’s Certified Election Professional Program</a>: Join The Elections Group for a conversation with two Florida Supervisors of Elections – Marion County Supervisor of Elections Wesley Wilcox and Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley – and Florida Supervisors of Elections (FSE) Consultant Anne Schroeder to discuss the development, implementation and sustainability of the state’s certification program for election officials, the Florida Certified Election Professional Program (FCEP). The state’s certification program was a grass-roots development led by election officials across the state. A few notable elections prompted a soul-searching review by Florida Supervisors of Elections, the elected officials responsible for administering local elections in the state. This led to the development of a strategic plan and the creation of a formal certification program. Focus groups and surveys convinced the statewide association of election officials to develop a comprehensive 30-class certification program. While the FCEP program remains optional for Florida election officials, the program has an extensive waitlist and has received national recognition. Immediately following the conversation, we will provide highlights from our implementation guide. When: June 22, 12pm Eastern. Where: Online.</p>
