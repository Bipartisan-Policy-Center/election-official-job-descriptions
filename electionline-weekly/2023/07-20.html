							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Software collaborative launched</strong><br />
<em>Collaborative designed for election offices to share resources, best practices, and technology</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/">U.S. Digital Response (USDR)</a> today announced the launch of the Election Software Collaborative, a new partnership created to help election offices access low-cost, secure, and user-friendly software that relieves administrative burden. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5970" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR-300x105.png" alt="" width="300" height="105" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR-300x105.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Through the Collaborative, election offices will also gain access to a community of election offices across the country to share and learn best practices.</p>
<p>The Collaborative’s Election Administration Platform simplifies critical tasks like<a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/projects/poll-worker-management"> election worker management</a>, tracking campaign finance records, organizing candidate information, running an election help desk, and monitoring voting wait times. New features and products are built continuously based on Collaborative member requests, and new members can be onboarded to the Platform in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>“I was in search of a poll worker management program for many years, but all of the products I reviewed were “one size fits all” databases &#8211; making it very difficult to customize to both Arizona and Mohave County needs,” shared Allen P. Tempert, Elections Director of Mohave County, AZ. “Fortunately, I learned about U.S. Digital Response. I was told that a platform would be customized to meet Mohave County&#8217;s needs using the newest technology available, and the product would remain customizable for as long as I chose to use it. Wow! Flexibility at its best. That’s the advantage of working with a collaborative such as USDR, where they draw from experts from all over the country to bring each customer a personalized product and experience. I’m extremely pleased that I joined the USDR collaborative.”</p>
<p>USDR is a nonpartisan nonprofit and the Election Software Collaborative’s facilitator and technical implementation partner. Since 2020, USDR has partnered with more than 50 local and state election offices<a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/program-areas/election-management"> to build software to make voting accessible and efficient.</a> Along the way, they have learned about the unprecedented challenges facing election officials today, from<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/document_library/files/2020_EAVS_Report_Final_508c.pdf"> record-high turnouts</a>, implementing new voting methods, to addressing security risks &#8211; all in an environment of unstable funding. The Election Administration Platform, built using established digital tools like Airtable, Twilio, and SendGrid, gives election offices more customization over features and control over managing data.</p>
<p>“The mission of the Election Software Collaborative is to ensure every election office across the country has modern tools available to run efficient and trustworthy elections,” said Hillary Hartley, Chief Executive Officer of USDR. “We are honored to be a trusted partner helping election officials spend less time on repetitive tasks, enabling them to make progress on critical priorities.”</p>
<p>Dozens of election offices across the country have contributed to the creation, and use, of the system since 2020. Leading up to the official launch of the Collaborative, a diverse group of election offices, including Mohave County, AZ, Chaffee County, CO, Delaware County, PA, and Erie County, PA, have already joined the collaborative. Election offices interested in the Election Software Collaborative and Election Administration Platform can visit<a href="https://usdr.link/request-help"> https://usdr.link/request-help</a> to request more information or a demo. Membership in the Collaborative starts at $2,500 per year, with higher fees for larger jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Derek Tisler, Ruby Edlin, and Daniel I. Weiner,<br />
The Brennan Center for Justice</p>
<p>Although election officials have successfully managed recent election cycles amidst significant challenges, they have faced a relentless onslaught of attacks fueled by false perceptions about their work. As part of a multifaceted response to these attacks, election officials should elevate the ethical principles that guide their work to safeguard democracy. This can be achieved through the adoption of an expanded code of ethics that seeks to foster professional identity, express shared values, and promote accountability. A profession&#8217;s code of ethics establishes a foundation for expected behavior, enabling officials to navigate complex challenges while aligning with their values. Equally important, a code of ethics communicates shared values to the public, enhancing credibility and facilitating explanation of difficult decisions. For this effort to have success, election officials themselves must drive the effort, with the Election Center playing a pivotal role in leading and supporting this vital work. Read the full paper <a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/journal/documents/JEARP-volume02-issue-01-how-a-renewed-code-of-ethics-can-strengthen-the-election-administration-profession.pdf">here</a>.</p>

Although media reports of voter experiences with ranked choice were generally positive, the board cited voter confusion in its decision not to move forward in November. However, several board members said they still want to pursue ranked-choice voting in future elections. “While I know we’ve heard some people ask that we commit to it now and for every election thereafter, I don’t think that’s the proper thing to do at this point,” said Board Chair Christian Dorsey. From an election administration standpoint, Arlington’s experiment with ranked-choice voting is widely seen as a success, with no major glitches or technological problems. “It went as well as we could have expected it to go,” Arlington Registrar Gretchen Reinemeyer told the Virginia Mercury. Meanwhile, across the Potomac in the<a href="https://dcist.com/story/23/07/18/dc-democrats-fight-ranked-choice-voting-open-primaries/"> District of Columbia</a>, this week the DC Board of Elections heard from proponents of a ballot measure that if approved by the voters, would implement open primaries and ranked choice voting. While many witnesses spoke for/against the concept of ranked choice voting, the board is tasked with deciding whether the proposal is eligible to be placed on the ballot for next year’s election. The elections board does not weigh in on the merits of proposed ballot initiatives, but it is required to assess whether or not they would violate existing restrictions on what residents can place on the ballot. Initiatives can’t violate the U.S. Constitution, enshrine discrimination in law, or force the D.C. Council to appropriate funds. If it gives the initiative the go-ahead, proponents will then have to collect signatures from 5% of registered voters in the city within a six-month period to get it on the ballot. But even if it is approved, opponents can still challenge the decision in court. City officials in<a href="https://www.salemnews.com/news/salem-leaders-exploring-rank-choice-voting-switch/article_ff03ad96-21b6-11ee-b79e-2f3ca6dbf808.html"> Salem, Massachusetts</a> are exploring the idea of ranked choice voting. During a meeting on the topic recently, much of the discussion was couched in a historical context with some noting the present election system in the city was established in 1836.<a href="https://www.winonapost.com/news/winona-county-debates-ranked-choice-voting/article_404671c4-1d09-11ee-9105-8724b16e7ab7.html"> Winona County, Wisconsin</a> is also considering making the switch to ranked choice. In<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2023/07/08/ranked-choice-voting-pa-legislation-rabb/stories/202307070086"> Pennsylvania</a>, Rep. Christopher Rabb, D-Philadelphia, has recently introduced several pieces of election-related legislation — one of which would institute ranked choice voting at the municipal level. In<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2023/07/05/complaint-alleges-opponents-of-alaskas-ranked-choice-voting-formed-church-to-skirt-disclosure-laws/"> Alaska</a>, which successfully rolled out ranked choice voting in 2022 after a voter-approved ballot measure, the group that championed Alaska’s ranked-choice voting reform filed a complaint against several individuals and entities that are leading an effort to repeal Alaska’s new election laws, alleging that they violated multiple campaign finance rules and obscured the source of their funding in the process. The complaint alleges that opponents of ranked-choice voting founded a church called the Ranked Choice Education Association that could have allowed donors to gain tax advantages for their contributions while skirting disclosure requirements.</p>

Your design will be printed on tens of thousands of stickers to be distributed this November. I hope that we were able to inspire young people to be more civically engaged with elections and the political process. It’s great to see so many people engaging with this contest by voting for their favorite design.” Voters<a href="https://www.canyoncourier.com/stories/jeffcos-new-i-voted-sticker-a-reminder-to-prepare-for-election-season,442125"> in Jefferson County, Colorado</a> will be treated to a new “I Voted” sticker this election cycle as well. The sticker reflects the county’s sunsets over the foothills and features “I Voted” in both English and in Spanish. “The &#8216;I Voted&#8217; sticker has always been a symbol of hope and excitement about using our voice to effect political change,&#8221; Jeffco Clerk and Recorder Amanda Gonzalez said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to have some Jeffco-specific flair in this year&#8217;s sticker and to feature both English and Spanish text, which is more inclusive — just like Jeffco aims to be.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: On a party-line vote, the U.S. Committee on House Administration passed a bill that would enact strict new voting laws for states, such as requiring copies of IDs for voting by mail, and set penalties for states that allow voting by noncitizens in local elections. The 224-page bill, <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/67fba463240fdd948eb636b35/files/4ae53739-96ba-8156-0c1c-a9dad2fb39cd/ACE_Act_Bill_Text.pdf">H.R. 4563</a>, was approved 8-4, and contains provisions similar to those passed in many Republican-led states since the 2020 election. While the overhaul has a chance of passage in the Republican-controlled House, it’s likely to die in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority. During the markup, Democrats unsuccessfully offered more than a dozen amendments that would lengthen early voting to two weeks, expand access to voting by mail and require reporting of digital ads to the Federal Election Commission, among other election-related measures. The bill also requires that every two years, states send the federal Election Assistance Commission a report that lists inactive voters and registered voters who voted in at least one of the prior two consecutive general elections. The bill would also bar states from using federal funds to partner with a nongovernmental organization in voter registration drives or voter mobilization, “including registering voters or providing any person with voter registration materials, absentee or vote-by-mail ballot applications, voting instructions, or candidate-related information, on the property or website of the agency.” Under the bill, states that allow noncitizens to participate in local elections would need to have a separate voter roll for noncitizens who are registered and there would be a 30% reduction in federal payments to any state or local jurisdictions that permit voting by noncitizens. Those states would also be barred from receiving any federal funding to implement certain election administration activities. The bill would also require a district court to notify the chief election official of the state and the state attorney general if an individual is turned away from serving on a jury because they are not a citizen.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats said they<a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/07/18/national-bill-on-voting-standards-pushed-anew-by-democrats-in-congress/"> plan to introduce</a> a bill again to set national voting standards in response to state legislatures passing strict voting laws. The bill, known in a previous Congress as the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2747?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Freedom+to+Vote+Act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=2&amp;r=1"> Freedom to Vote Act,</a> would establish national standards for early voting, mail-in ballots and protection of poll workers and volunteers from harassment. It provides funds for states to purchase updated voter machines and cybersecurity updates, among other initiatives. The bill also would require super political action committees to disclose their donors and tackles gerrymandering by establishing criteria for nonpartisan congressional redistricting.</p>

Municipal elections traditionally take place the first Tuesday of October, while state and national elections take place the first Tuesday in November. Kenai Assembly Member Richard Derkevorkian introduced a resolution that represents a first step toward changing that: an advisory vote. “It would be placed on the ballot, and would ask the public if they’re interested in moving the regular municipal elections to align with the state election,” Derkevorkian explained. “This advisory vote takes no action. If it were to pass, the hope would be that the assembly would abide by the public’s wishes.” The goal, he said, would be to change the election dates by 2024. And he said the point of the advisory vote is to gauge interest before diving into the labor-intensive process of changing the election date.</p>

Because of its status as a district, D.C. has one House member who has no voting status in Congress, similar to Puerto Rico and four other U.S. territories. The bill would set voting laws for D.C., overriding any laws passed by the Council. For example, the bill would require voter IDs for someone to vote in D.C., which is currently not a requirement in D.C. elections, and would prohibit the city from using ranked choice voting. The bill also includes mandatory audits and requires the District to conduct an audit within 30 days after each election. The bill also would repeal an amendment passed by the D.C. Council in 2022 to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.  “Yesterday’s markup demonstrated the Republican commitment to meddling in local D.C. affairs and making voting as difficult as possible for D.C. residents,” said Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC’s nonvoting member of Congress. “It is ironic that Republicans in Congress, who do not represent D.C., are abusing their undemocratic power over D.C. in an attempt to make voting more difficult in a jurisdiction that is already denied voting representation in Congress. While I will work to defeat their bill, the markup was the latest form of the wide-ranging anti-home rule attacks D.C. continues to suffer at the hands of Republicans in Congress.”</p>

Les Farnum, R-Sulphur, failed 69-30. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, who was the biggest cheerleader for the Farnum bill, expressed his disappointment in the outcome. “I am disappointed that the legislature was not able to override the governor’s misguided and highly partisan veto of HB 646,” Ardoin said in a press release. “ …I call upon the next Secretary of State to pursue this legislation under a pro-election integrity governor next year.”</p>

Gretchen Whitmer signed a<a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-election-whitmer-absentee-ballots-570b982818cdca1b96dfa8b526559cd1"> bipartisan package of bills</a> into law to expand voter rights by allowing early voting and early tabulation of absentee ballots across Michigan. The legislation, which resulted from the voter-approved<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-presidential-michigan-constitutions-55ea9372f36e7ddba03381d54e333120"> Proposal 2,</a> establishes a website for voters to track when their ballots are received and counted, and requires at least nine days of early voting before each statewide and federal election. Voters can also now fix clerical errors on their ballots and use U.S. passports, tribal photo ID cards, military ID cards or student ID cards to identify themselves when they show up to cast ballots. Proposal 2 asked whether Michigan should expand opportunities to vote, including through absentee and early voting. The measure requires state-funded absentee ballot drop boxes, as well as postage for absentee ballots and applications, and allows voters to join a permanent list to receive absentee ballots for every election. Under the new law, each municipality in Michigan is required to have at least one secure drop box for absentee ballots or at least one drop box for every 15,000 registered voters in municipalities with more than that many registered voters. “This was a thoughtful, bipartisan effort and I’m grateful to the leaders in both chambers for getting this done,” said Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s secretary of state. “We are ready to work with Michigan’s clerks to implement these new laws in time for next year’s elections.”</p>

The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee voted 4-1 in favor of the package from the state Board of Elections. The rules will take effect 20 days after they are filed with the South Dakota Secretary of State office.</p>

The measure, written by Rep. Scott Allen, R-Waukesha, and Sen. Romaine Quinn, R-Cameron, would require absentee ballots that are mailed to voters to &#8220;contain a watermark that identifies the ballot as an official absentee ballot.&#8221; “To help curb public distrust in absentee ballots, it is certainly worth the additional cost to make our absentee ballots secure and restore trust in our election process,&#8221; Allen said. Diane Coenen, the clerk for the City of Oconomowoc and the chairwoman of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association, said the organization does not support the bill. &#8220;We do not see a problem that needs to be fixed, nor do we see anything substantive that a watermark will fix,&#8221; Coenen said. &#8220;The legislation, to us, is really addressing what we see as mistrust in some peoples&#8217; minds.&#8221;</p>

In his order, Jantzen said he has been working on a “minute entry,” a type of court order, and hoped to have it done prior to Friday afternoon. “But a weekend fire in the court’s home and some emergencies added to my calendar have prevented completion of that minute entry,” the judge wrote. The order comes more than six months after Jantzen threw out Hamadeh’s original challenge of the election results. “The bottom line is, you just haven’t proven your case,” the judge said in December in ruling from the bench after a half-day trial. “There isn’t enough information — I don’t think even slight information — the election was done illegally or incorrectly.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Tuchi<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/attorney-in-kari-lake-voting-machine-lawsuit-hit-with-sanctions-from-judge/"> imposed sanctions</a> on attorney Alan Dershowitz for his role in Kari Lake’s 2022 lawsuit aiming to ban the use of electronic voting machines in Arizona. Despite playing what Dershowitz described as an extremely limited role in Lake’s suit against the Arizona secretary of state and supervisors of both Maricopa and Pima counties, Tuchi ordered him to pay $12,220 in attorney’s fees to the Maricopa County defendants for breaking Rule 11, a federal law that holds attorneys accountable for making false or misleading allegations. Dershowitz said he intended only to give legal advice to Lake’s team, not to represent her. “In any event, Mr. Dershowitz’s subjective intent is not controlling at this stage,” Tuchi wrote in his Friday morning order. “As the court previously noted, compliance with Rule 11 is largely measured by an objective standard.”</p>
<p>According to Courthouse News Service, U.S. District Judge Dominic Lanza appeared likely to side against the voting rights advocates asking him to order the Arizona Legislature to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-balks-at-voting-advocates-bid-to-release-privileged-arizona-legislature-records/"> release nearly 200 internal communications documents</a> the governing body claims are protected by legislative privilege.  Mi Familia Vota and other voting rights advocacy groups subpoenaed the documents as part of a voting rights lawsuit aimed at stopping Arizona’s secretary of state from enforcing two 2021 election laws the plaintiffs say will disproportionately affect people of color. Attorneys for the groups argued in a Monday morning hearing that turning over the documents is likely to prove an intention of racial discrimination by the legislative body. But Lanza did not seem inclined to change his mind from the tentative ruling he issued on July 7, preemptively denying plaintiffs’ motion to release the documents. Lanza wrote in his<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/familia-vota-v-fontes-tentative-ruling.pdf"> tentative order</a> that while the subject matter is important and the documents plaintiffs seek are at the heart of it, compelling the Legislature to release the documents might “chill legislative debate and earnest discussion within governmental walls.” And because it already received thousands of other documents in cooperating with the subpoena, plaintiffs should have enough evidence to go off without the extra 196 documents, he said.</p>

It also cites a backlog in advisory opinions from the Department of State and a lack of proper information provided to former felons by the Department of Corrections and the Commission on Offender Review. The lawsuit names Gov Ron DeSantis as a defendant, along with Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, state corrections secretary Ricky Dixon, all supervisors of election and all county clerks and others. Along with the coalition, four individuals are also suing. They argue that they fear voting because of the disorganized rollout of Amendment 4, incorrect information they have been given by county clerks and the arrests pursued by the election crime office created by DeSantis.</p>

Acting promptly to address Trump’s motion filed late last week, the state’s highest court said the former president’s legal team had failed to present “extraordinary circumstances” that warranted its intervention. As for Willis, Trump “has not presented in his original petition either the facts or the law” necessary to warrant her disqualification, the court said in an unsigned five-page order. Trump’s lawyers asked the state Supreme Court to put a halt to the grand jury proceedings and let their motion be heard. It also sought to prevent Willis from using any evidence obtained by the special grand jury, which heard testimony from almost 75 witnesses. The state Supreme Court said the normal course of action would be for Trump’s legal team to file a petition first before a Fulton Superior Court judge, whose decision could then be appealed. Trump, the order said, cannot turn to the state’s highest court to try and “circumvent the ordinary channels for obtaining the relief he seeks without making some showing that he is being prevented fair access to those ordinary channels.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Steve Jones has<a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-redistricting-lawsuit-voting-rights-act-8e785443695a4774db1d42035452139b"> refused to dismiss</a> lawsuits alleging Georgia’s congressional and legislative districts illegally discriminate against Black voters. Jones ruled that he could only decide disputes over the facts of the cases and the credibility of the witnesses after a full trial, which he set for September. “Additionally, given the gravity and importance of the right to an equal vote for all American citizens, the court will engage in a thorough and sifting review of the evidence that the parties will present in this case at a trial,” Jones wrote. The orders apply to three cases, one challenging the lines of Georgia’s 14 congressional districts and two challenging the lines of the 56 state Senate and 180 state House districts. All three lawsuits allege that the maps violate the federal voting rights act by weakening the growing electoral strength of Black voters.</p>

Savage said remarks from Trump and his attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and two Delaware County Republican poll watchers made him a target for hatred, ridicule, and physical threats. Erdos based his ruling an October 2022 letter Trump, who was no longer president, sent to the U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s letter included his Delco allegations in a litany of debunked election fraud claims. The judge said he will rule soon on Trump’s claim of immunity in two other instances — his phone-in testimony during a state Senate committee hearing in Gettysburg three weeks after the 2020 election and a tweet from Trump two days later. Trump mentioned the Delco claims in both.</p>
