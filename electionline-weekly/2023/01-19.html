														<p><strong>U.S. Election Assistance Commission Clearinghouse Awards</strong><br />
<em>Call for 2022 “Clearies” submissions is now open!</em></p>
<p>This week, the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) opened the call for submissions for its seventh annual national<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-national-clearinghouse-awards-information"> Clearinghouse Awards</a>. Also known as the “Clearies,” the awards program celebrates the hard work of election offices across the <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="154" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EAC-logo_final.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" />country. Submissions will be judged on innovation, sustainability, outreach, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and the generation of positive results. Entries must be received by Tuesday, February 28, 2023. The 2022 Clearies honorees will be announced in spring 2023.</p>
<p>The Clearies are a great way for election jurisdictions to highlight best practices and be recognized for innovations. It can also be an opportunity to share ideas to help improve the elections process by other jurisdictions emulating best practices in award-winning processes,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks. “The EAC encourages all jurisdictions to apply regardless of size or budget. There are thousands of small jurisdictions that have been doing phenomenal work serving their communities and I hope they, along with state and large local jurisdictions, submit entries for the Clearies so we can highlight and learn from them as well.”</p>

For this year’s effort, EAC Commissioners would like to call upon election officials to consider entering any deserving program, no matter the size of the jurisdiction or the project’s scope.  Submission guidelines are available at<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/eac-national-clearinghouse-awards-information"> eac.gov/clearies</a>. All entries and supporting materials should be uploaded through the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/form/2022-clearie-submission-form"> EAC’s online submission form</a>.</p>

We recognize the commitment needed to address vital security concerns, growing accessibility needs, and more. The Clearies encourage innovations in election administration to meet these needs while publicizing the achievements of election offices and building on the positive results of past competitions.”</p>
<p>From a 2022 pilot effort to an initiative running for years, the Clearies seek to recognize excellence in all forms. Any program used <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9245" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2021ClearieMD-300x153.png" alt="" width="300" height="153" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2021ClearieMD-300x153.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2021ClearieMD-1024x523.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2021ClearieMD-768x392.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2021ClearieMD.png 1414w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />in an election can be submitted for consideration. To highlight their crucial contributions, the EAC is also expanding the state association program category to include local offices.</p>

Lycoming County employees spent nearly three days hand-counting more than 59,000 ballots after a year’s worth of pressure from local elections skeptics resulted in the county commissioners voting along party lines to recount the 2020 presidential and state auditor general’s race. According to Votebeat, the recount was completed more quickly than expected. After counting from 8:30 a.m. to roughly 5 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday, the ballots remaining Wednesday were counted in less than two hours, an overall average pace of 55.5 ballots per minute. Lycoming’s original results, tabulated by machines, showed 59,397 votes cast in the presidential contest, with 41,462 going to former President Donald Trump and 16,971 going to President Joe Biden. The hand recount resulted in a total of 59,374 votes in the presidential race, with Trump receiving 7 fewer votes and Biden receiving 15 fewer votes compared with the original tally. Lycoming County Elections Director Forrest Lehman said the county is still reviewing the hand count and plans to have a more expansive version of the report explaining the small changes later this month. “I think the<a href="https://www.sungazette.com/news/top-news/2023/01/lehman-2020-recount-proves-voting-system-works/"> results speak for themselves</a>,” said Lehman. “People attacked the voting system. They claimed the voting system was off by thousands of votes. We did a hand count that proved that was patently not the case,” he said. “The county already had four years of evidence in the form of pre-election testing and post-election audits to prove, to support, the argument that our voting system is accurate. In addition to that, we had evidence from two statewide recounts to support the argument that the voting system was accurate. Now, we have the results of a hand count of an entire presidential election to prove that the voting system is accurate,” he said.</p>

The letter to ERIC said that Alabama would immediately cease transmitting data. &#8220;Providing the private information of Alabama citizens, including underage minors, to an out of state organization is troubling to me and to people that I heard from as I traveled the state for the last 20 months,&#8221; Allen said. Former Secretary of State John Merrill criticized Allen&#8217;s intent to withdraw. He said then that ERIC provides information that Alabama couldn&#8217;t otherwise access — such as other states&#8217; voter registration and motorist driver&#8217;s license records — and has been a crucial tool for maintaining voting rolls.</p>

The review of election operations in Fulton arose from a provision in Georgia’s 2021<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/how-georgias-new-voting-law-works/GF6PLR44PNESPKR5FXCBE7VEOY/"> voting law</a> that allowed troubled local election boards to be replaced following an investigation. After a year and a half, the inquiry cited many changes in training, processes and procedures that corrected issues observed during elections in 2020. “We did not see any indications of fraud, dishonesty, or intentional malfeasance in the 2020 election results in Fulton County, but we did see how a lack of careful planning and precision in ensuring that processes were strictly followed led to errors and to an overall environment that appeared unorganized,” the report states. Fulton Elections Board Chairwoman Cathy Woolard said the report was fair and provided recommendations for continued improvement.</p>

Copeland Hanzas acknowledges Jim Condos’s hard work to protect and preserve the integrity, transparency, and accessibility of our elections. She wants to build on that effort and move to a new phase of engagement with Vermonters of all ages. “We need to recognize that sometimes people don’t vote because they don’t know how to vote, or they don’t know the candidates, or they are skeptical about whether their vote will make a difference,” said Copeland Hanzas. “That’s why the next phase of defending our democracy needs to be in education, awareness, and engagement.” The new coordinator will work with the secretary and her team to create a civics curriculum for our schoolteachers, will engage with Vermonters on civics in their communities, and will build a voter guide for the 2024 General Election. “Civics is more than the dry, boring three branches of government. Civics is also about being able to affect change, solve problems and make life better for all of us,” said Copeland Hanzas. “Individuals can only do so much on their own. Working together through civic participation allows us to accomplish more than any one person can do themselves.”</p>

She was 72. Fox was first hired by the town in July 1990 after earning her certification as Elections Administrator from Briarwood College. She served up until this past November, after not being endorsed by Newington Democrats and running unsuccessfully as a petitioning candidate.  Over her 32-year tenure with the town, Fox managed eight presidential elections, nine gubernatorial state elections, 16 municipal elections and several stand-alone referendums. She advised the town through three mandatory redistricting cycles, including the most recent this past spring. As a member of the CT Registrar of Voters Association she served as the Hartford County Chairman until 2012. Fox was credited with designing an Emergency Contingency Plan for Elections in 2013 ahead of SuperStorm Sandy. This same plan was revised to address the impacts of covid-19 during the 2020 election cycle. Fox also led the town through the Nov. 2006 election, when Newington served as one of 25 pilot towns testing the use of Optical Scan Voting Machines, which remain in use today. Fox was recently  honored by town officials posthumously. Deputy Mayor Gail Budrejko recalled how Fox had used the words honesty, integrity and experience while campaigning this past election season.  “These were not just campaign slogans, they described her tenure as Registrar of Voters over 32 years,” Budrejko said. “To her family that’s here tonight or may be watching, I offer my sincere condolences; she will be missed. She left quite a legacy and you should be proud.”</p>

Liz Harris (R-Chandler) has introduced<a href="https://kdminer.com/news/2023/jan/17/new-gop-state-rep-wants-outlaw-early-votes-mail-vo/"> several elections-related bills</a> including legislation that would outlaw vote by mail. Under HB 2229, anyone who wants to vote must do so by going to the polls. The legislation says  the only exception would be those who are physically unable or those in the military who are overseas. Additionally, Harris is also sponsoring HB 2232. It not only would preclude early voting – even in person – but also require that all ballots be counted by hand. And her HB 2233 seeks to expand the grounds on which anyone could sue to overturn election results and give them and their allies the power to inspect each and every ballot. Current law permits the review of only a random sample.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer has<a href="https://elections.maricopa.gov/asset/jcr:2587d93a-a545-49e1-b941-a1dc19e3089c/Arizona%20Election%20Law%20Reform%20Proposals_Recorder%20Richer.pdf"> proposed 12 laws to reform state election processes</a>. The proposals range from closing early voting days sooner, reforming campaign finance laws, and making the county recorder a nonpartisan position.</p>

Jacque Martin, Cleburne county’s district 7 Justice of the Peace said if paper ballots are what it’s going to take to make people feel more secure that their vote is being counted, “then that’s why I voted yes.” The Secretary of the State’s office says “Secretary Thurston believes that the modern, state-of-the-art voting machines and tabulators we use in Arkansas are accurate and secure. They add that every county has their own right to make this decision for themselves and when it comes to Cleburne County doing so “our staff will continue to support and assist them, as we do every other county, in conducting fair and secure elections.”</p>

Keith Denning (D-Wilton) has introduced legislation to bring ranked choice voting to the Nutmeg State. Denning said his decision to propose legislation in favor of ranked choice voting was, in part, driven by conversations he had with voters while campaigning. Ranked choice voting, he said, would encourage more residents to run for office. Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, a former secretary of the state, has endorsed the idea. However, Stephanie Thomas, the newly elected secretary of the state, said during a debate that it’s not the right time for ranked choice voting. There are some barriers to the idea, some of them technical. The state’s outdated polling machines cannot handle ranked choice and would need to be replaced.  “We ought to at least consider to have the ability to do rank choice voting when we go out and purchase the new equipment,” Denning said. “This kind of puts it on the table for everybody to look at and decide how and if. Let&#8217;s say the bill passes, and we put it on the ballot. Then Stephanie Thomas, or whoever is the secretary of state, can think about how they want to do it before the next election.&#8221;</p>

Council that would allow non-citizens — including undocumented immigrants — to vote in local elections starting in 2024. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Rep. James Comer (R-Kentucky) said Thursday that they will introduce a resolution to disapprove the bill, employing a mechanism that Congress has to weigh in on or toss out any bill passed by the council. “Allowing illegal immigrants to vote is an insult to every voter in America,” said Cotton in a statement. The moves comes the same week that Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) introduced a separate measure that would do much the same. That follows a similar bill he pushed last year, when Republicans were in the minority. The council<a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/10/04/dc-council-non-citizens-mail-voting/"> passed the bill in mid-October</a>, after years of similar measures gaining no traction among lawmakers. Proponents say that non-citizens pay taxes and are impacted by local decisions, and should thus have a right to weigh in on who represents them at the local level. “The law they are seeking to disapprove allows for local residents to vote in local elections on matters that affect them directly, and does not apply to federal elections. I am in favor of giving people representation in the matters that affect them,” she added. All legislation in the District of Columbia must sit for 30-days of Congressional review before becoming law.</p>

On Tuesday, the House State Affairs Committee voted to send<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0001/"> House Bill 1</a> to the floor of the Idaho House with a recommendation it passes. Rep. Julianne Young, R-Blackfoot, sponsored House Bill 1, which would require that ballots subject to an election audit would be counted by hand, not machines.  Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane testified in support of the bill during a public hearing in the committee. McGrane said the bill would simply write the current practices that were issued by directive of previous Secretary of State Lawerence Denney into state law.  Young’s bill amends an existing section of Idaho law that requires audits to take place following any primary or general election, including presidential primary elections. Young’s bill adds new language to the existing law by specifying, “The postelection audit shall include, at a minimum, a hand recount of the ballots subject to the audit and a comparison to the results reported by the county for any precincts, days, batches, legislative districts and tabulation machines selected for audit.”</p>

Daniel Didech (D-Buffalo Grove) has introduced legislation to encourage college students to serve in that role in exchange for academic credit. Didech said the measure could lead more young people to become involved in the democratic process. &#8220;Strong democracies rely on the participation of their citizens, and that includes young people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This bill will not only help to ensure that we have enough trained and qualified election judges, but it will also provide a valuable experiential learning opportunity for college students to gain hands-on experience in the electoral process.&#8221; If passed, the bill would allow Illinois universities and community colleges to create their own policies for awarding academic credit. While receiving academic rewards, though, students would not receive monetary compensation for their service. If it is signed into law this year, student election judges would earn academic credit beginning with the 2024 primary election.</p>

The resolution states that it would save the county a “significant amount of money.” The duties would instead be given to the county’s circuit court clerk. Several people, including members of the local League of Women Voters, spoke against immediately passing the measure at the commissioners’ meeting, raising questions about fairness and public trust.  <a href="http://www.sjcindiana.com/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_01172023-1585">As stated in the resolution</a>, the duties would be divided among clerk’s office employees while ensuring that 50% of them be affiliated with the Republican party and 50% with the Democratic party. According to the South Bend Tribune, here’s where many of the speakers at the meeting raised an issue: If there’s an odd number of employees, the clerk would be allowed to fill the remaining slot by choosing any employee regardless of political affiliation.    Among several other questions she had, Elizabeth Bennion, with the League of Women Voters, asked why the office couldn’t simply keep an even number of employees in these roles? By having the clerk choose someone when there’s an odd number of staff, she said, that could compromise public trust.</p>

What could Galvin hope to achieve in his eighth term that he has not in the seven before now? “Civic education,” he answered. “One of the things we’re seeing is that there’s [a] need for better civic education, especially in high schools, of what the significance of elections are. I mean, I think the root cause of some of the election denialism and some of the other hostility that’s out there is people don’t really understand what government is supposed to do.” Galvin also said recent recounts “highlight the need for continued close review of current regulations, training, policies and practices of elections in the Commonwealth.” “We certainly take administrative action to say, ‘This is what you’ve got to do.’ But you also have to remember we have 351 cities and towns, different-sized clerks’ offices, different levels of experience,” Galvin said when asked about the committee’s findings. “We do send people out there all the time. We try to help them and see what we can do, but you’re always going to be challenged when you have thousands of people participating as workers in an election every general election. You have to make sure that they understand what they’re doing and encourage them to do it correctly.”</p>

Democratic lawmakers — who now control the state House and Senate — will address election and voting security by: Reintroducing legislation to ban and increase the penalty for threatening, harassing or doxxing election workers or pressuring them to act illegally; Introducing bills to ban deceptive practices in elections, such as lying to voters when seeking their petition signatures and knowingly spreading misinformation about elections and citizens’ ability to vote; and Boosting funding for township, city and county clerks to run elections.</p>

Champion’s &#8220;Restore the Vote&#8221; bill would reinstate the voting rights of felons once released from prison and on probation, giving voting rights to, he estimates, north of 50,000 disenfranchised Minnesotans. The bill has support from Minnesota’s Attorney General and Secretary of State. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Steve Simon claimed voting rights make felons less likely to re-offend.</p>

Mississippi had an initiative process for decades, but the state Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the process was invalid because it required an equal number of signatures from five congressional districts and the state had dropped to four districts after the 2000 Census. Early voting — Multiple bills would allow people to cast ballots before Election Day. Mississippi currently allows early voting for people who will be out of town on Election Day and for those who have a disability or are 65 or older. Voting rights restoration — House Bill 342, by Democratic Rep. Jeffery Harness of Fayette, would automatically restore voting rights to any person who has completed a sentence for conviction on a disenfranchising crime. The current process for restoration of voting rights is for a person to seek permission of legislators and the governor, and only a few people have received this permission in recent years.</p>

The proposals emerged from an unofficial working group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers and others, including the offices of the Secretary of State and Commissioner of Political Practices, who began meeting after the 2021 session. The penalty for tampering with the machines would be set at up to 10 years in prison and up to $50,000. The bill would specifically require all machines used to count ballots be “certified by the manufacturer to be free of any unauthorized modems or other external communication devices.” That lack of connectivity has long been required by the Secretary of State’s office for machines used in the state, but the requirement is not currently in law. Under current law, the state’s post-election audit only applies to federal primary and general elections. HB 172 would allow counties to conduct their own audits of local elections as well. The idea emerged in part from Ravalli County, where a vocal group of residents have been pushing county officials to eliminate the use of tabulators.</p>

Julie Slama of Dunbar. Among changes called for under Legislative Bill 535 is a requirement that those requesting early mail-in ballots must send election officials proof of valid state-issued photo ID or “a photocopy of any other valid photographic identification issued to the voter.” The bill calls for Election Day voters to show valid photo ID at polling sites. It provides for a couple of alternatives, including an option for voters with a religious objection to being photographed. It eliminates a fee for a state identification that’s issued for voting purposes. Civic Nebraska objected to two voter ID bills introduced last week by State Sen.

Michael Moffett, said the bill is intended to prevent voters of one party from interfering with another party’s primary by temporarily switching parties on primary election day. “The purpose of the closed primary is to ensure the integrity of the primary, and that the people who vote in the primary are truly members of the party,” the Loudon Republican said.  But critics argued the bill would disenfranchise residents who don’t want to be a member of a specific party but still want to vote in favor or against candidates in the primary.</p>

The board voted unanimously to approve a capital project and $2,163,000 in funding for new voting machines for the Oneida County Board of Elections.   “The voting machines are approximately 15 years old and had a lot of breakdowns during the last election which caused the results to be reported extremely late,” Oneida County Executive Anthony J. Picente Jr. said in a letter to Gerald Fiorini, chairman of the board of legislators. “The Commissioners and I have deemed the current voting machines will not be able to handle next year’s election.” The most recent election took place Nov. 8 2022, and during election night, Oneida County’s results reporting stalled at around 9 p.m., with few updates coming from the Board of Elections until late at night. The day after the election, the commissioners said that the computerized systems used to gather the results had not performed the way that they were supposed to, and that they would figure out what had happened.</p>

State Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, one of the lawmakers sponsoring the new bill,<a href="https://www.ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/documents/23-0315-01000.pdf"> Senate Bill 2157</a> , said the legislation would amend and expand current law to make it clear voters must provide proof of citizenship before being allowed to vote. Lee&#8217;s bill would make an unexpired U.S. passport a valid form of identification showing that someone is an eligible voter as well as a citizen. The bill spells out other satisfactory proof-of-citizenship documentation as well, including: a driver&#8217;s license or nondriver&#8217;s identification issued by the Department of Transportation that indicates a cardholder is a citizen; a legible copy of the voter&#8217;s birth certificate that verifies citizenship; or naturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization.</p>
<p>District 30 Rep. Mike Nathe- (R) have introduced legislation that would provide monetary penalties for<a href="https://www.kxnet.com/news/local-news/addressing-voter-fraud-h-b-1230-could-add-on-monetary-stiffer-penalties/"> fraudulent signatures on ballot petitions</a>. One penalty would be when a member of a sponsoring committee willfully submits an invalid petition, they would face no less than a $1,000 fine. The other penalty involves the measure committee itself. If they were to willfully submit an invalid petition, that committee would face a fine of no less than $10,000 and not be able to practice business in North Dakota for five years. “What I’m trying to do is hold people accountable to whatever measure they support to make sure the initiated measure process is done legally and above board,” Nathe said. But, there are concerns about the bill’s current language, including whether the whole committee is liable or just one person, what it would take for legal action, as well as a better definition of what it means to “conduct business.”</p>

While the Legislature authorized state election officials to create the system in 2015, technical problems cross-referencing information from voters’ state-issued identification with the Department of Public Safety has delayed the project for years. n July, State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said the agency was hopeful to fully launch the system ahead of the Nov. 8 general election but added that technical issues outside of the agency’s control could cause further delays. Kirt said she’s concerned the project will be set aside without a required completion date. Launching at the end of the year would allow the state to issues ahead of the 2024 presidential primary and general election, she said.</p>

Some precincts already share polling places, but they can’t share personnel. Each precinct must have a full complement of at least three officers — an inspector, a judge and a clerk. SB 266 would allow two or more precincts with no more than 7,500 registered voters combined to share not only polling places but workers. In other words, two precincts at the same location might need only five poll workers instead of six, with one of the five — probably the inspector — going back and forth as needed.</p>

Such a change would combine those elections for judges and county officials with the usual slate of elections for state and federal offices. Lamberth said his constitutional amendment resolution isn’t designed to elect more Republicans. Legislation also could be filed this session requiring local government candidates to run partisan races, and a bill is already filed requiring closed primaries. “I would hope more Republicans, Democrats and independents would vote. We want more folks voting period. Higher turnout, higher participation always leads to … better elected officials across the board,” Lamberth said after the House adjourned last week. “The more people that vote, the better the folks that are elected are going to reflect the will of the people.”</p>

Keith Bell (R-Forney), would allow the attorney general to appoint a county or district attorney from an adjacent county as special prosecutor in a case involving an election crime. The bill would also require local prosecutors to notify the Attorney General’s Office of an open investigation related to election law violations, instead of the Secretary of State’s office. House Bill<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TX2023000H125&amp;cuiq=cebcefa4-252a-5dcb-aeb1-7fc87d570de0&amp;client_md=50f95856f2788d633d3252362e358dc3&amp;mode=current_text"> 125</a> filed by Rep.

In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in Texas v. Zena Stephens that Paxton<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/28/attorney-general-ken-paxton-voter-fraud/"> does not have unilateral authority</a> to prosecute election crimes. Instead, the Texas Constitution grants that authority to local prosecutors such as county and district attorneys. The two pieces of legislation – both filed by North Texas Republican lawmakers — are “a direct reaction” and a “workaround” to that court ruling, experts say.</p>

The move to 14 days would be an important savings for local governments, said Del. Phil Scott, R-Spotsylvania, who sponsored the measure. Democrats on the House Privileges and Elections subcommittee said the bills would reverse their efforts in 2020 and 2021, when they had majorities in both the House and state Senate, to make voting easier. The subcommittee’s Democrats pressed for data about how many people voted between 45 and 14 days before Election Day, but sponsors said they didn’t have any.</p>

He got some pushback on the bill to abolish drop boxes when he presented the idea to a subcommittee this week. Delegate David Reid is a Democrat from Loudoun County. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking in anecdotal examples, a large amount of the population does not trust our elections,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;Can you quantify that?&#8221; McGuire responded that it&#8217;s clearly evident in the media, and that he hears about it from voters on the campaign trail. &#8220;You have no information, no quantifiable information to support this,” asked Reid. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve spoken with registrars across the Commonwealth, and these registrars said they are expensive, and they are not used that much,&#8221; McGuire replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the numbers with me today.&#8221; Those numbers were not needed in a Republican-controlled panel that passed his bill on a party-line vote. If it gets through the House, it’ll likely face a more difficult time in a Senate controlled by Democrats.</p>

Require each county auditor’s office to designate a jail voting coordinator as well as each jail to designate an employee as its jail voting coordinator. County auditors would be required to create a jail voting plan in coordination with the jail voting coordinator and the Office of the Secretary of State for every jail in the county. Jails would also be required to allow election officials to enter the jail at least 30 days in advance of each primary and general election to provide voter registration outreach and education to those incarcerated.

After lengthy discussion in the House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee, representatives passed House Bill 5, “Voter registry list-voter ID and absentee ballots,” without much discussion in Committee of the Whole on Friday morning. “What (HB 5) is going to do is amend the definition of the registry list to include the voter identification numbers and absentee ballot requests and returns,” Rep. Pepper Ottman, R-Riverton, said. “It is just to make those available and codify that into statute.” The bill will allow unique identifying numbers for elections and information relating to absentee ballot requests and returns to become public on request. The House adopted a committee-approved amendment that does two things. According to Rep. Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, the amendment includes clarifying language that changes “absentee ballot requests and returns” in the bill to “absentee ballot status.” That change was made at the request of Wyoming county clerks, Olsen said. The second part of the amendment pertained to information included on voter registry lists. “There is a list of data and information that is discoverable on a public records request for that registry list,” Olsen said. “What we are adding to the list is registration status, so knowing when an individual first registered to vote.” After a brief explanation of the bill and its amendments, debate was halted when the question was called. HB 5 then passed on a voice vote. During the committee meeting, Secretary of State Chuck Gray spoke in favor of HB 5.</p>

An additional member would be appointed to the board, which is made up of the governor, the secretary of state, the state auditor and the state treasurer, to keep the body nonpartisan. If the majority of the state canvassing board members are from the same political party, then the House and Senate floor leaders would jointly appoint a member from the largest political party outside of the one that the majority of members are affiliated with. Otherwise, the governor would appoint the additional member.</p>

The ruling, issued Tuesday, is the second legal defeat on the issue for the Arizona Republican Party and its chair, Kelli Ward, who last year sued to eliminate early voting before the 2022 elections. The three-judge appeals court rejected the party&#8217;s argument that mail-in voting violates the secrecy clause in the state Constitution, which requires that voters must have a way to conceal their choices on the ballot. The state&#8217;s mail-in, or early voting, process does provide secrecy, the court found, &#8220;by requiring voters to ensure that they fill out their ballot in secret and seal the ballot in an envelope that does not disclose the voters&#8217; choices.&#8221; According to The Arizona Republic, it is unclear if the party will appeal this finding to the Arizona Supreme Court.</p>

According to Courthouse News Service, the Circuit seems likely to reverse a federal judge’s denial of a restraining order that would eradicate part of Maricopa County’s journalist-vetting criteria, which the judges called a First Amendment violation. Jordan Conradson, a reporter with The Gateway Pundit, was denied a press pass by Maricopa County that would have granted him access to voting centers during the November 2022 election. Maricopa County attorney Joseph Branco told the court Thursday that Conradson lost credibility in the eyes of the county, not because of the outcome of his reporting, but because his “process of newsgathering” differs from other journalists. “What you just said seems like a blatant violation of the First Amendment,” said U.S. Circuit Judge Ryan Nelson, a Donald Trump appointee. Nelson, the most vocal of a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, said it was “nonsensical” to deny Conradson access to voting centers during the November election to witness vote counting. As part of the lawsuit, Conradson and The Gateway Pundit, which bills itself as &#8220;a counter to the establishment media,&#8221; sought a temporary restraining order to bar the county from using those specific criteria to vet journalists. U.S. District Judge John J. Tuchi, a Barack Obama appointee, denied their request in November. He found the language of the criteria used was clear and fair, and Conradson’s denial didn’t violate the 14th Amendment since the county gave Conradson a chance to appeal in an email that he did not respond to for 41 days. The Ninth Circuit intervened in December and<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gateway-pundit-v-maricopa-county-order-ninth-circuit.pdf"> ordered</a> Conradson to be issued a press pass pending his and his employer’s appeal before the court.</p>

Speakes, the DA’s Office says, would have been disqualified from running for Firebaugh City Clerk since her home is based in Madera, not Firebaugh. Officials also mentioned that Speakes, who also goes by the name of Amanda Fleming, allegedly voted in Fresno County during the Primary and General Elections in 2022, but she is only allowed to vote in Madera County. convicted, the DA’s Office says Speakes could face fines, jail time, or spend up to 5 years in prison for the following felony charges: Perjury, elections fraud, and voter fraud.</p>

In a petition, Cox’s attorney argues a Montgomery County circuit judge incorrectly granted a State Board of Elections request in September to permit ballot counting as early as Oct. 1 to accommodate an expected deluge of mail-in ballots. Cox has conceded the election and isn’t challenging its outcome. But his attorney, C. Edward Hartman III, argues in the Jan. 4 petition that Circuit Judge James A. Bonifant’s decision, which was upheld on appeal, was flawed. Bonifant relied on language in Maryland election law that gives courts flexibility to protect the electoral process in emergencies. Cox’s petition says that the language — and the court’s interpretation of it — is unconstitutional. “The U.S. Constitution requires that the rules for holding an election be made only by the legislative body of the state holding those elections,” the petition says. “It is indisputable in this case that the Maryland Circuit Court for Montgomery County prescribed the manner of holding elections in Maryland, in direct contradiction of the manner already set by the Maryland legislature.”</p>

Democratic and Republican leaders from the lower chamber had both claimed they had the authority to schedule three critical special elections in Allegheny County. The outcome of those races will likely determine which party holds the majority in the state House, which is currently at a standstill because of the ongoing power struggle. The parties had previously agreed to hold one special election, to replace the late state Rep. Tony DeLuca, on Feb. 7, but were in disagreement on two others. The panel ruled in favor of Democratic Leader Joanna McClinton’s preference to hold all three elections on that date. Republicans had requested that two of the elections be held in the May primary. A spokesperson for the Allegheny County Elections Division did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the Associated Press, a lawyer for the county said Wednesday that voting machines had been tested and precincts had been secured for the elections. Ballots had not yet been printed nor had mail ballots been sent out as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to the York Dispatch, York County is<a href="https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/york-county/2023/01/13/york-county-in-settlement-talks-over-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-spanish-speaking-voters/69805539007/"> in talks to settle a federal lawsuit</a> filed last year by advocacy organization CASA in Action and LatinoJustice Fund over a lack of services for Spanish-speaking voters. That&#8217;s according to a joint status report filed in December with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and Rayza Goldsmith, an attorney for the plaintiffs. &#8220;When we filed that joint status report in December, we let the court know that we are actively working towards settlement negotiation,&#8221; Goldsmith said. &#8220;That representation was made by both CASA and the county.&#8221; York County Chief Clerk Greg Monskie said the county couldn&#8217;t comment on active litigation, but he did add that the county was in regular contact with CASA. CASA, a grassroots organization that advocates for Latinos and immigrants, filed the lawsuit and sought a preliminary injunction in October, seeking more services for Spanish-speaking voters in York County. Those included more bilingual poll workers as well as a Spanish-speaking person at the Board of Elections to answer questions. After the county agreed to institute those changes, among others, the preliminary injunction was withdrawn, but the lawsuit went forward.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/elections/2023/01/appeal-prevents-2020-vote-records-in-pa-county-from-becoming-public.html"> cast vote records</a> (CVR) from the 2020 general election in Lycoming County will remain confidential for the moment. That’s because the state Department of State is appealing to Commonwealth Court the Dec. 16 ruling of Judge Eric R. Linhardt making CVRs public in the county. When the judge overturned an Office of Open Records decision, he stayed implementation of his ruling for 30 days to allow for an appeal. That stay now will continue until the appeal is resolved. A state appellate court has never ruled on whether CVRs are public. Linhardt in his opinion cited the Department of State’s “keen interest” in the litigation because it had the potential to affect how requests for these records are handled throughout the commonwealth.</p>

Texas Election Code Sec. 66.058 requires election officials to preserve records, including ballots, for 22 months after Election Day, after which officials may destroy those records. During the retention period, ballots are to be kept in a secure container and officials who allow “unauthorized” handling of the ballots can be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. County elections officials have long interpreted the preservation rules as also preventing inspection of the ballots through open records requests and have only allowed access with a court order. In his opinion issued last August, Paxton wrote that while one section of state election code established the 22-month preservation period, another section designated “anonymous voted ballots” and all other election records as public information. In a<a href="https://odysseyweb.traviscountytx.gov/app/RegisterOfActions/#/30237C70E23E43E06A5D56B19199BE3D9E637053DF129BC1A1DC91CE8B39AF12ADC3A9ADD827525DB52F8E631B4EE477/anon/portalembed"> lawsuit filed in Travis County</a>, the Williamson County attorney’s office under Republican Dee Hobbs argues that Paxton exceeded his authority and that his opinion conflicts with state law. Although the county refers to what it calls the “plain language” of the election code, Paxton’s opinion notes that the code in question only mentions “unauthorized access” and does not expressly prohibit public access to the records, and that “the Legislature authorized entry into the locked ballot box for such purpose during the 22-month period.” The county is requesting that the 353rd District Court declare the ballots confidential and allow the election records to be withheld from the public until the 22-month preservation period ends.</p>

The decision dismisses Commissioner Bob Spindell from an open records lawsuit seeking documents and communications from the Elections Commission<a href="https://www.wpr.org/democrats-file-lawsuit-against-wisconsin-republicans-who-posed-electors"> in a case</a> related to the 10 Republicans, including Spindell, who attempted to cast electoral ballots for former President Donald Trump after the 2020 election. Advocacy group Law Forward originally filed a complaint with the Elections Commission in 2021, calling on the commission to hold the fake electors accountable for what the group describes as violating state election law. Law Forward later demanded that Spindell be recused from considerations of the complaint because of his involvement in the attempt to cast false ballots.</p>
