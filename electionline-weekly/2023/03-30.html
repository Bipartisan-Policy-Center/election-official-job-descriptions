							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>New survey and report highlight work of civic engagement organizations</strong><br />
<em>National Voter Education Week and Power the Polls</em></p>
<p>M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>It takes  a village to run a successful election.</p>
<p>In 2020 with the pressures of the pandemic weighing down on elections officials nationwide, a number of new partners and civic engagement organizations joined the village to help with everything from educating voters to recruiting poll workers.</p>
<p>Many of those organizations stayed in the game for 2022 with their eyes on 2024 and beyond. Two of those groups, Power the Polls and National Voter Education Week recently released reports and surveys on the impact of their work in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>National Voter Education Week</strong><br />
<a href="https://votereducationweek.org/">National Voter Education Week</a> (NVEW) is a collaborative, nonpartisan campaign to educate voters and equip them with <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7233" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voter-Ed-Week-300x108.png" alt="" width="300" height="108" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voter-Ed-Week-300x108.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voter-Ed-Week.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />the tools, information, and resources they need to cast their ballots with confidence. Launched in 2020, NVEW was founded on the belief, backed by data, that voters &#8211; especially new voters &#8211; are more likely to participate in elections when they feel informed and confident about the process.</p>
<p>Scheduled strategically between National Voter Registration Day and Vote Early Day, NVEW was designed as a way to help voters bridge the gap between registering to vote and casting their ballot, and has reached hundreds of thousands of voters with the reliable information they need to make their voices heard. The five days of NVEW each have a different theme that, in their totality, represent the full voter journey</p>
<p>Entering 2022, the NVEW Steering Committee — which is comprised of 24 nonprofit organizations and business partners — outlined an ambitious set of priorities intended to grow the campaign’s reach and engagement, while further entrenching NVEW as a permanent, visible fixture on the US election calendar:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase the number of community and creative partners that sign up to celebrate National Voter Education Week</li>
<li>Increase the digital reach and presence of National Voter Education Week</li>
<li>Increase the number of National Voter Education Week events and materials offered in non-English languages</li>
<li>More effectively measure and communicate the end impact of National Voter Education Week</li>
</ol>
<p>A<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KeQSn2fgwO1MogOEJEoJKAHvX0c5EJ3/view"> new report</a> lays out the progress made on each priority, and how they contributed to a record-setting NVEW &#8211; with more partners recruited, a larger digital footprint, and more earned media coverage than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Power the Polls</strong><br />
This week,<a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=dOOQzUBvOXAxCaULtariHXszQsFfdy-2BYM7sb2es6sqzH3g44PCfM7FVJzBxsQdSbJnio_nvWPMgeYguPucyB9NHqMPOA3Ixdnxket2pSs6dZHabj8IbW0sdHnGKIps9rHciMBKflE-2Bducv26KpW51osNUylQLsug2MkAW6h5x6g0iokPsm49ro1mlSJ6KYT3LPkifTFr50m6iownGKwy1-2BFdPVfaPPTvmPUyCSn5Ncn9eB-2F7fzoyx-2FkXZkZSyFR4euLFGnx0O-2FOwlOfEm1BYiqFjrvFWyYUMfpiCrjeEJiy7nsB-2FwNZ0pdcPoFfRFUbJc9IfKrMs8Q32rDpeiH-2Bvja7cf5nvcg-2B2d8mZAuMcJPIGhD1R7aVgpdJUtBDU9H2091KYEt0Z6A8IBHQmvrI6cv9-2BUHhoLt7-2FQYaZa0CUoNcw3qkTEJRaDBC-2BqzB-2BW7aaW5Tpu5osNshOMXbtfvAYw4-2FUzxw-3D-3D"> Power the Polls</a> announced it recruited more than 275,000 potential poll workers in the lead-up to the 2022 <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5824" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Power-the-Polls-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Power-the-Polls-300x183.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Power-the-Polls.png 516w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />midterm election. A new survey of people who signed up through Power the Polls shows that 88% percent said they’d be interested in working in future elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Power the Polls was created to address poll worker shortages and recruit poll workers who can help run safe and secure elections for years to come. In 2022, we connected nearly 300,000 potential poll workers with election administrators nationwide and supported nearly 600 jurisdictions across 42 states to fill poll worker shortages. Despite concerns about safety and poll worker issues on Election Day we did not see any widespread issues related to staffing at polling sites. 2022 was, in no uncertain terms, a success for poll worker recruitment,” said Ashley Spillane, senior advisor to Power the Polls and director of the Civic Responsibility Project.</p>
<p>Key findings of a new survey, conducted by Patinkin Research Strategies, of people who signed up through Power the Polls include:</p>
<ul>
<li>88% expressed interest in working in future elections</li>
<li>85% of those who received local poll worker training felt prepared to serve during the election</li>
<li>86% believed that elections were run well in their community</li>
<li>61% served as poll workers during the 2022 general election, with 95% reporting satisfaction in their work</li>
</ul>
<p>Power the Polls and its founding partners – Civic Alliance, Civic Responsibility Project, Comedy Central, Fair Elections Center, Pizza to the Polls, MTV Entertainment Group, and Center for Secure &amp; Modern Elections – worked closely with over 400 nonprofit organizations and businesses to recruit younger, more diverse, and non-partisan potential poll workers to ensure that local elections officials&#8217; needs for poll workers are identified and met, particularly in these jurisdictions with high need.</p>
<p>“The 2022 midterms should assuage any concerns that our election systems are not holding strong. Americans nationwide were able to safely and securely cast their ballots, due in no small part to the essential work of our election administrators and poll workers,” said Robert Brandon, president and CEO of Fair Elections Center. “We are so grateful for all of our election workers and are proud to have supported them this cycle. At Fair Elections Center, we’ve worked for years on building a better system for recruiting a new generation of diverse poll workers – and we’re thrilled to see that system work so well in 2022.”</p>
<p>Power the Polls was founded in 2020 to address concerns around a potential mass poll worker shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goal of recruiting a new wave of poll workers among younger, more diverse populations that have not historically filled these roles. While Power the Polls has made important strides through recruitment in 2020 and 2022, the initiative will continue to build on this work in future election cycles to ensure that poll workers adequately represent the communities they serve, including younger people, bilingual speakers, and communities of color.</p>

On the Senate side, state elections officials testified before the<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/03/28/state-election-officials-at-u-s-senate-hearing-discuss-threats-to-workers-call-for-funding/"> Senate Rules Committee</a> which is chaired by Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota). Klobuchar said it was important to hear from election officials from those states — North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nebraska — to help prepare for the 2024 elections. “In the face of these challenges, it is important as ever that we continue to support election officials as they do their jobs to uphold our democracy,” she said. New Mexico’s Maggie Toulouse Oliver spoke about the difficulty of hiring and retaining elections workers. South Carolina’s Howard Knapp talked about mis/disinformation. Nebraska’s Bob Evnen detailed how his state is moving to implement a new voter ID law. On the House side, the<a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/03/28/house-panel-hears-complaints-about-pennsylvania-election/"> House Administration Committee</a> held a hearing on problems faced by Luzerne County, Pennsylvania on Election Day. The county faced a host of problems on Election Day 2022 including running out of paper ballots at many polling places. Some Republicans have called that voter suppression. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that there were problems in Luzerne County, but Democrats questioned why a Congressional hearing was being held. Neither Luzerne County election officials nor Pennsylvania state representatives responsible for election oversight attended the hearing in Washington. Both were invited but declined to appear, citing the ongoing inquiry by Luzerne County District Attorney Samuel M. Sanguedolce. The committee did hear from one losing candidate—who did not contest the election—and several county residents about their experiences on Election Day. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D), whose district includes Luzerne County, did not speak at the hearing, but he released a statement supporting the district attorney’s inquiry.  “Well, of course we need an investigation,” he said. “And a hearing in Washington is also good, but it probably should have waited until the actual investigation is complete. Luzerne County has a very capable DA, and he is conducting that investigation. What we should not do is name the hearing beforehand ‘Government Voter Suppression’ and grandstand about it without any basis for such a thing.”</p>

In L<a href="https://thewesternnews.com/news/2023/mar/28/lincoln-county-election-officials-clerk-and-record/">incoln County</a>, not only has the clerk and recorder resigned, but so has everyone in the office that runs elections. According to County Human Resources Director Dallas Bowe, she has received letters of resignation from Clerk and Recorder Robin Benson and both employees in the Elections Office, including Administrator Paula Buff and her assistant, Amanda Eckart. According to The Western News, county commissioners are unsure how May 2 school board elections will be conducted. According to the Western News, although the resignation letters weren’t made public, there had been recent tensions about the amount of work elections staff were required to do without support from the county. In<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/03/28/cascade-county-election-presentation-scheduled-for-friday-location-moved-to-family-living-center/"> Cascade County</a>, there has been concern and confusion about how five upcoming elections will be conducted after newly elected County Clerk and Recorder Sandra Merchant said they could not be conducted by mail, a practice many Montanans have long embraced, including more than 80% of Cascade County voters. At a community meeting this week, residents<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-03-29/cascade-county-residents-voice-concerns-about-their-election-administrator"> expressed their concerns</a> about Merchant’s ability to conduct the upcoming elections. “When people don’t have confidence in the election procedure, guess what? They don’t vote,” resident Gerry Jennings said. “How sad for Cascade County. In the opinion of many, Ms. Merchant should resign from office.”A meeting is scheduled for March 31 to discuss how the county<a href="https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2023/03/29/election-presentation-by-merchant-now-friday-at-family-living-center/70059536007/"> plans to move forward</a> with at least these upcoming elections.</p>

The co-chairs of the council — former Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock, former Maryland Democratic Rep. Donna Edwards, former Indiana Democratic Rep. Tim Roemer and former Tennessee Republican Rep. Zach Wamp — wrote in the letter they are “deeply concerned that election officials are currently not receiving the federal support that they need to strengthen and secure federal elections in 2024 and beyond.” The National Council on Election Integrity, which began ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, includes about 40 civic and political leaders focused on “defending the legitimacy of our free and fair elections,” according to its website.</p>

The second bill, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/SB10/2023">SB 10</a>, prohibits the use of electronic vote counting systems that are capable of connecting to the Internet or cell phone networks or that possess modem technology. State Sen. Dan Roberts motioned to give SB9 a favorable report. The Committee voted unanimously to give SB9 a favorable report. SB10 was given a favorable report on an 11 to 0 vote. Both bills are supported by Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, who was present to show his support and answer any questions the committee members might have. The legislation can be considered by the full Senate as soon as Tuesday, April 4, when the 2023 Alabama Regular Legislative Session resumes.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Senate Republicans on the Elections Committee have approved a House bill granting officials the option to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1842620/legislation-permitting-hand-counts-ballots-moving-through-az-senate"> hand count ballots</a> instead of using voting machines in upcoming elections. Committee Chair Wendy Rogers explained why she supports the bill. “I would submit to you that machines cost more for updates and maintenance and upkeep than humans,&#8221; she said. But political activist Rivko Knox warned that her experience with hand counts shows even short, simple ballots are prone to human error. “Can you imagine how long it would take with Arizona’s long and complex ballot? And, by allowing any county to choose to hand count ballots the statewide certification of an election could be significantly delayed,” Knox said. The bill now moves to the Senate Rules Committee.</p>
<p>House Bill 2961 sponsored by Rep. Justin Heap (R-District 10) and co-sponsored by Rep. John Gillette (R- Kingman) would require county supervisors to provide a<a href="https://kdminer.com/news/2023/mar/28/arizona-bill-beef-ballot-chain-custody-record-pass/"> chain of custody record for ballots</a>, including the time and signature of each supervisor beginning at the printing locations to the transportation, storage and delivery to the county recorder/officer in charge of elections and to any voting location. It would also require ballot boxes to be locked with a “tamper evident seal.” Law enforcement would also need to be present during the lock box transferring phase. Currently, law enforcement can aid in ballot box transportation if it’s practical or if they are available. The bill would also require a log of “voting irregularities,” which Marson said is broad. “We are hoping for some specificity about what that means,” Marson said that counties already do incident reports. The county recorder or other officer in charge of elections would need to give a record of voting irregularities of the Arizona Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives within 30 days of Election Day. The Arizona Secretary of State would need to be provided a copy.  According to the bill, all “damaged and defective” ballots that are replaced with a duplicate ballot would need to be reported in the chain of custody record. Jen Marson with Arizona Associations of Counties spoke in opposition because parts of the bill are repetitive of what’s already being done in Arizona. Marson said the organization&#8217;s main concern is logistics and details. For example, Maroon said the “robust” chain of custody records component is vague in certain sections, including when it comes to obtaining the signature of a voting location supervisor. The bill passed committee 5-3 with Republicans in support and Democrats against.</p>

During the meeting, supervisors discussed multiple options that were on the table to replace the Dominion Voting Systems voting machines after the Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the contract with Dominion in January. The options were as follows: Negotiate a plan with ES&amp;S; Negotiate a plan with Hart; Rescind the earlier decision to cancel their contract with Dominion Voting Systems; or Provide an alternative option, such as hand counting ballots The board listened to several presentations from the Shasta County Election Office and representatives from both ES&amp;S and Hart voting systems. The decision affirms the board’s action in January to break the county’s contract with Dominion Voting Systems and develop a process to tally votes by hand. The board’s vote directed the county elections department to develop a process for hand-counting ballots rather than using machine tallying, which has been employed for decades. “The fact remains that these proprietary systems, without us looking into them, there is no trust for me. And most Americans, the majority of Americans, do not trust these machines,” Board Chairman Patrick Jones said. But dozens of speakers<a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2023/03/29/shasta-county-supervisors-opt-to-hand-count-ballots-in-local-elections/70058624007/"> disagreed</a> with Jones according to the Record Searchlight. They claimed the board’s actions would unnecessarily cost the county nearly $2 million, create more vote-counting errors and possibly interfere with the timing of future elections. County Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen said in a report that hand counting has not been tested anywhere else in California. After Tuesday’s board meeting, Darling Allen said she wasn’t sure she could develop a hand counting system in time for a special election Aug. 29 or a presidential primary election scheduled for March 2024.</p>

The Government Administration and Election Committee left five separate ranked choice proposals on the table when it finished a lengthy agenda on Monday, its last meeting before a deadline to advance committee bills. Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Stamford Democrat who co-chairs the panel, said there was no consensus on the committee whether to move forward with ranked choice voting and little time to explore the issue given more pressing priorities like advancing early voting policies in the wake of a constitutional amendment allowing for the practice in Connecticut. “We ultimately just decided that we didn’t have the bandwidth or the support we needed this session to get a [ranked choice] bill done,” Blumenthal said.</p>

The Senate previously passed a similar version of the measure. Defenders of nonprofit donations say they were essential for election operations since they started during the coronavirus pandemic. The money paid for items including equipment to process mail ballots, protective gear for election workers, elections staffing, absentee ballot postage costs and voter outreach. The voting law the General Assembly passed two years ago limited nonprofit contributions but didn’t shut them off entirely. The law, Senate Bill 202, prohibited direct contributions to county election offices while still allowing county governments to solicit grants on their behalf. This year’s legislation would close that loophole. If the bill becomes law, contributions would still be allowed to the state government, which could then distribute funding among counties. Before the House vote, the Rules Committee amended the bill so that it’s no longer backdated to Jan. 1, a provision that would have required DeKalb to return its $2 million grant. A retroactive law could have been challenged in court since it was legal for DeKalb to receive the money at the time. The Senate gave<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/ban-on-outside-elections-money-passes-georgia-general-assembly/USQR4MDGIZEAFFFZGNN4OQYK44/"> final approval</a> to the legislation by a 32-21 vote.</p>
<p>The Senate passed a bill to ensure workers can take<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/early-voting-time-off-bill-wins-final-approval-in-georgia/YVK262L4T5E5ZKKVKJTYULGQXU/"> time off to cast a ballot</a> either during early voting or on election day, sending the measure to Gov. Brian Kemp. The Senate voted 46-3 to approve the legislation,<a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/129"> Senate Bill 129</a>, which would expand on an existing law that guarantees two hours of unpaid voting time for workers on election day. Under the bill, workers would also have the option of taking time to vote during three weeks of early voting. Workers seeking time off would have to notify their employer in advance, and then the employer could decide on a time when workers could be absent, according to the bill. “Now, Georgians will have more options to cast a ballot during advance voting and more confidence in the results,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. “This bill is good for business, election officials and Georgia voters.” The legislation also would require<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-election-audit-shows-similar-results-as-machine-ballot-count/XZWADVQ6RNBITFGCQ5VFLI3CHQ/"> audits</a> of at least one statewide contest after primary, runoff and special elections.

House Bill 340 comes as the governor recently signed a bill removing student IDs as a valid form of identification at the polls. The bill also standardizes the voter registration process, and specifies the acceptable documentation needed to prove your identity and residence &#8211; both for registration and for voting. Secretary of State Phil McGrane says this was a key piece of legislation for his office coming into this session. &#8220;You may recall when we had the conversation with student IDs, I kind of had a caveat in terms of my support and that was, it had a former bill number at that time but that was this legislation. I think that this is important, particularly for poll workers and just the registration process in general. As you may recall, we have actually two identification requirements. We have the ID requirement to vote and we have the ID requirements to register to vote and currently they are quite different from one another. One is very specific, one is very broad. What this legislation does is unify those,&#8221; McGrane told the committee. According to the bill&#8217;s fiscal note, 98.8 percent of voters in the 2022 general election used a driver&#8217;s license to vote, 0.4 percent of voters used an affidavit attesting to their identity at the polls, while 104 people used a student ID. The bill sponsors anticipate that the state will issue fewer than 2,000 no-fee IDs each year. The bill now heads to the full Senate with a do-pass recommendation. That&#8217;s the last stop before it can reach the governor&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 23-11 to pass<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0138/"> House Bill 138</a>. If passed into law, the bill would<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-gov-brad-little-to-act-on-bill-moving-idahos-presidential-primary-election-back-to-may/"> move Idaho’s presidential primary</a> election back on the calendar from its current date on the second Tuesday in March until the third Tuesday in May. Sen. Mark Harris, R-Soda Springs, sponsored the bill in the Idaho Senate, describing it as a cost-saving measure that could increase voter turnout by consolidating the March primary election with an existing election date in May. Harris estimated consolidating the March presidential primary election into the May election could save the state $2.7 million every four years.  The bill is written so that it would take effect July 1. That means it would be in effect for the upcoming 2024 presidential primary elections.</p>

The amendments were presented by State Sen. J. D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, as the Senate considered House Bill 1334 on second reading. The bill has been engrossed for a third and final reading where the Republican supermajority is expected to pass the bill with ease. Republican lawmakers say the measure makes the identification requirements process for voting by mail or travel board the same as that for in-person early and absentee voting. The move, they say, will increase the security of the state’s election process and add a layer of protection against voter fraud. Their Democratic counterparts say the measure duplicates existing processes and laws and will disenfranchise the most vulnerable of voters: the elderly, disabled and members of the military. A second amendment sought to exempt voters using the travel board since the travel board is comprised of both a Republican and Democrat who can verify a person’s identity. He said it may be difficult for senior citizens or those who can’t leave their house to vote to have unexpired versions of the required identification. Most of those using the travel board are unable to leave their homes. Republican Sen. Dan Dernulc, R-Highland, joined a handful of other Republicans supporting the amendment exempting military and overseas voters. The measure failed 17-31. A straight party-line vote killed the travel board amendment.</p>

If someone has not voted at least once since the primary election in the previous presidential election cycle, they will be placed on inactive status and sent a letter asking if they still live at that location. Voters placed on inactive status will not be eligible to vote at their precinct and must cast an affidavit ballot. The list also removes someone from the selection pool for jury duty. Language of the bill is vague, and some experts are also interpreting it to mean any voter who misses a single election could be placed on inactive status.  Once someone is removed from the voter roll, they must register with their county elections office to have their voter status reinstated. Republican Representative Brent Powell says the registered voter will then have 4 more years to take action before they are removed from voter rolls. Democratic Representative Edward Blackmon says it would unjustly take voting rights away from Mississippians.</p>

Last year, the legislature opted to switch back to a caucus system, but a special committee on public policy met Wednesday to hear two bills that would reinstate the presidential primary, one  sponsored by Veit and another sponsored by Cyndi Buchheit-Courtway, R-Festus. The bills were presented together and sponsors cited limitations to attending caucuses, limitations to hosting caucuses and a lack of privacy at caucuses as reasons to return to a preference primary system. As it stands, military service members who are deployed can submit absentee ballots from anywhere in the world, but, caucuses require participation in person. “We’re asking them to fight and die for us, but we don’t care what they think, (about) their input,” Veit said. First responders and parents with young children were among other groups supporters said would not get input at caucuses. Fears of disenfranchisement were evident in testimony of both supporters and opponents. Supporters of the bill raised concerns that rural areas would not have access to the facilities required to host a caucus. A representative for the Missouri Association of County Clerks testified that having the primary election in March causes confusion for absentee voters who would be casting ballots for the April municipal elections at the same time. The Republican and Democratic Directors of Elections in St. Louis County testified together for informational purposes about the costs of primary elections being so close to municipal elections. “It’s gonna require a lot of extra work … to get our machines back so they can run the election in April,” said Rick Stream, the Republican director.</p>

Lombardo’s Chief of Staff Ben Kieckhefer said ending the “Covid-era” practice of sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters would save the state money, but Lombardo’s office would not say how much will be saved or how much it will cost to have election personnel respond to individual requests for ballots. Voters would be required to notate a driver’s license number or last four of their Social Security number on a mail-in ballot.</p>

Heider Garcia with the Texas Association of Elections Administrators notes, &#8220;We do it for two weeks. This is just allowing us to do for one more day what we already do for two weeks. So there are no compromises in security or chain of custody or anything to implement this program.&#8221;</p>

But hold your horses: Ballots wouldn’t change until 2028. Introducing<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2024/S.32"> S.32</a> to her colleagues on the Senate floor, Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, said ranked choice voting is “an often misunderstood and seemingly complex topic that, once understood, is actually quite simple.” S.32 comes after a different, more robust ranked choice voting bill died last year. Lawmakers came back this year with the idea to limit implementation of the system to presidential primaries as a trial run. In its original form, S.32 would have plowed ahead with a ranked choice presidential primary ballot as soon as the 2024 election cycle, but lawmakers heard from the Secretary of State’s Office and town clerks that the timeline was simply too tight. So 2028 it is. In the meantime, there will be a study committee comprised of lawmakers, representatives from the Secretary of State’s Office, municipal governments and other stakeholders to take a closer look at how widespread ranked choice voting would operate in Vermont. S.32 also contains permissive language offering municipalities the Legislature’s blessing to implement ranked choice voting for their own local elections, should they so choose, as early as 2024, but the bill does not require it. Senators voted 23-7 to approve S.32’s second reading. It faces one more Senate floor vote before it heads to the House.</p>

Finchem lost by more than 120,000 votes, but still filed an election contest in which the conspiracy-friendly former legislator claimed Fontes only won because of massive election malfeasance at the hands of Maricopa County and then-Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.  He provided no evidence that anything affected the election outcome, and his attorney mused in court that he would likely be disbarred and sanctioned for making the claims. Earlier this month, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Melissa Julian said the lawsuit was brought in bad faith, as many of the claims brought by Finchem would not have materially affected the outcome of his election even if they were true. Julian also told Fontes he could ask the court to order Finchem to pay the legal fees incurred by both his campaign and the Secretary of State’s Office.  On March 21, Fontes’s campaign requested more than $67,000 in attorney’s fees. And On March 27, the Secretary of State’s Office said it spent more than $7,000 fighting the case.</p>

Hubert Jack and Michael Anderson each admitted to charges of voting by an unqualified elector, stemming from their participation in the 2020 election, despite prior convictions that made them ineligible to vote. Jack also pleaded guilty to a charge of false swearing. Attorneys for Jack and Anderson both characterized the cases as political prosecutions. “This was a glorified waste of time and money and limited resources in the law enforcement community, all to make a political point,” said attorney Stephen Crawford, who represented Jack. “It’s pretty clear this was not about punishing a crime, as it was a political stunt,” said attorney Shelton Bridges, who represented Anderson. Both attorneys said their clients believed they were allowed to vote.</p>

Wiese was facing three counts of knowingly voting as an ineligible voter and one count of attempting to knowingly voting as an ineligible voter, all felonies, in three separate cases. He pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly voting as an ineligible voter as part of a plea deal that dismissed the other three charges.  District Judge Carmaine Sturrino put Wiese on five months of supervised probation and ordered him not to possess or use any firearms, explosives or mood altering substances. During the hearing, she stressed that Wiese is still not allowed to vote. &#8220;Continued efforts to vote could end up as a prison sentence,&#8221; Sturrino said in court.</p>

The lawsuit argues that Ashcroft unlawfully rejected Cooper’s filing, did so after a 15-day deadline and refused to provide a reason, as required by state law. It alleges that Ashcroft’s actions create a pretext where the secretary of state could block any ballot question he does not like. JoDonn Chaney, Ashcroft’s spokesperson, said that the secretary of state’s office was served the lawsuit and it is “currently under review.”</p>

The New Hampshire Attorney General&#8217;s office said Thomas allegedly assaulted the election worker at the town&#8217;s polling center at Iber Holmes Gove Middle School on Tuesday. She was arrested and charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct before being released on bail. Jonathan Wood, the interim town moderator in Raymond, confirmed to WMUR that he was the worker Thomas allegedly assaulted.  Wood said Thomas had gotten agitated when the polling location&#8217;s ballot machine rejected one of her paper ballots several times. Wood said the 52-year-old then folded the ballet and shoved it into the machine.  Wood said when he tried to remove the jammed ballot, Thomas hit him in the face, giving him a bloody nose. He said police at the polling center intervened, and he returned to help others cast their ballots soon after.  A spokesperson for the New Hampshire Attorney General&#8217;s said the Election Law Unit is working with Raymond police to investigate the incident, but no new charges have been filed.</p>

Ceisler said county courts, not a statewide court, have jurisdiction. The lawsuit, filed in the statewide Commonwealth Court, had argued that state law prevents what is known as “ballot curing” and, as a result, must be barred by the court. Ceisler agreed with lawyers for the state&#8217;s Democratic administration and ruled that county courts have jurisdiction in the matter, not a state court, because counties have the authority under state law to make rules, regulations and instructions necessary to run an election.</p>

Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Speakers for this event include Richard Hasen, Director, Safeguarding Democracy Project and Professor of Law &amp; Political Science @UCLA School of Law, Judd Choate, director of elections for the Colorado Department of State and Elizabeth Howard, senior counsel, Democracy at Brennan Center for Justice: <strong>When:</strong> April 4, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUlfuGvpzwvH9de5KpwRhaV0sP87iC8Ll4n">Can We Improve the Way We Elect Our President?</a>: Making Every Vote Count and Leadership Now Project will co-host a virtual program to discuss the U.S. presidential election system based on the Electoral College provisions of the Constitution. We hope that you will join us. The purpose of the program is to inform and energize opinion leaders, business professionals, and others interested in democracy issues about how the Electoral College works; describe the damages it causes and why; and discuss possible reforms. It is not the purpose of the program to enlist support for any particular reform proposal. Neither MEVC nor Leadership Now endorses a particular proposal. But the program will cover the reform proposals, and speakers and panelists will express their views on them. At the core of the April 4 program will be a panel moderated by E.J. Dionne, nationally syndicated columnist and long-time student of and commentator on the country’s presidential election process and the Electoral College system. <strong>When:</strong> April 4 at 2:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

This meeting is to conduct an annual review the VVSG 2.0 Requirements and  implementation, review the status of the EAC’s e-poll book pilot program, discuss ongoing EAC programs, and address election official security and mental health concerns. This meeting will include a question and answer discussion between board members and EAC staff. Board members will also review FACA Board membership guidelines and policies with EAC Acting General Counsel and receive a general update about the EAC programing.

Background: On February 10, 2021 the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) announced the adoption of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0, the fifth iteration of national level voting system standards. The Federal Election Commission published the first two sets of federal standards in 1990 and 2002. The EAC then adopted Version 1.0 of the VVSG on December 13, 2005. In an effort to update and improve version 1.0 of the VVSG, on March 31, 2015, the EAC commissioners unanimously approved VVSG 1.1.

From cable news to social media, we’re very aware that what we’re hearing or reading could be wrong. And it seems our skepticism of the right’s version of current events should extend to our history as well. A new book,<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/20454/9781541601390"> Myth America: Historians Take On the Biggest Legends and Lies About Our Past</a>, dispels many of the myths being pushed about our country’s past. In a collection of 20 essays from top historians, edited by Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer, this important text shows how those on the right have used revisionist history to fan the flames of politicization and unravel the seams of democracy.  Join us for a live virtual conversation on Thursday, April 20, at 6 p.m. ET with historians featured in the book, Yale University law and political science professor Akhil Reed Amar, Emory University African American Studies professor Carol Anderson, and Northwestern University associate professor Kathleen Belew, as well as editors and Princeton professors Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> April 20 at 6 pm Eastern.</p>

The purpose of the conference is to share ideas and solutions for ensuring voting and election system reliability, transparency, and integrity through better testing of systems. The 2023 conference will feature a panel discussion on risk-limiting audits by leading national experts in the field.
