							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona State University’s Mechanics of Democracy Laboratory establishes AI + Elections Clinic</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Bill Gates<br />
Arizona State University</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, I had a front row seat to the needs of election officials. Fortunately, as a policymaker, I could ensure that our elections department received the resources they needed. And it was still incredibly difficult. Over a two-year period, we faced intense public scrutiny, stared down an adversarial audit, and navigated our own technical challenges. This fueled deep skepticism among our voters – skepticism that continues to this day. I cannot imagine what smaller, less resourced counties and officials would have done if they faced what we did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12613" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BillGatesASU-225x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BillGatesASU-225x300.png 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BillGatesASU.png 684w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />In my new role as the executive director of Arizona State University’s new Mechanics of Democracy Laboratory (MODL), I look for tools that will strengthen our democracy . Artificial intelligence is one of them, and while</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/issue-brief/generative-ai-is-a-multi-tool-not-a-magic-wand-for-election-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is not a magic wand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it will assist election administrators doing routine work and, perhaps, significantly improve election administration by helping solve longstanding challenges. Facing stagnant or decreasing budgets, increased scrutiny, and fragile trust in governmental institutions, election officials need access to increased productivity and transparency tools that AI can provide more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because AI can be used for bad, there is skepticism. Currently, there are no programs or training opportunities for elections officials to expose and develop the skills and experience needed to use AI effectively. And importantly, for all the good that we suspect AI can bring, election officials need guidance on guardrails related to its use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this void, we are establishing the ASU AI + Elections Clinic. Through the clinic, we want to help people make their lives easier by using easy, safe and basic tools they already have. And also we want to tackle hard questions – and give out real advice. A few of our beginning efforts include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 8 at noon ET, we are co-hosting a webinar with The Elections Group, titled “AI + Elections: A Different Mindset, A New Skillset, and A Growing Toolset.” Register</span><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_-xkP5okoS2a7vPu7xE6Q7A"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, we’re participating in a conversation with a group of election administration communicators and other researchers and practitioners to discuss appropriate guardrails for using AI in election communications. I look forward to amplifying the work of this group.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are meeting election officials where they are – at their conferences, events and offices. Our goals are to support development of AI literacy and capabilities (mindset, skillset and toolset) across the community and provide election officials with access to AI-powered tools and resources that will trigger curiosity innovation. Our AI and Elections 101 training series begins in June. To request a workshop, email me at bill.gates.1@asu.edu.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the clinic, we are standing up a collaboration hub and development sandbox where elections officials and AI experts, including ASU faculty members, will collaborate to identify efficiencies and solutions, and test theories and deployments. Importantly, information learned at the clinic will be carefully discussed, vetted and findings published to aid the entire ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get updates on opportunities, <a href="https://forms.gle/L5Gsodjighva65Kc7">sign up here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether election officials are ready for the potentially sweeping technological and societal changes that powerful and easily accessible AI-powered tools and resources will bring, the future is here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASU is</span><a href="https://ai.asu.edu/asu-ai-advisory-committee"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uniquely positioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to operate this first-of-its-kind clinic. In fact, ASU’s public goals include “providing</span><a href="https://ai.asu.edu/asu-ai-advisory-committee"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> national and global leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the development of societally beneficial and transformative AI understanding, tools, technologies, and platforms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for us at gatherings throughout 2025, and if you attend one of our sessions, come say hi.</span></p>

Martin, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to permanently take the position, was involved in the “Stop the Steal” movement and </span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/dc-prosecutor-ed-martin-launches-election-accountability-unit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promoted false claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the 2020 election was rigged, said the “Special Unit: Election Accountability” has already opened one investigation and “will continue to make sure that all the election laws of our nation are obeyed,” according to the email reviewed by The Associated Press. The scope of Martin’s unit is unclear and raises questions about whether he is seeking to investigate cases outside the realm of his authority, which is limited to the District of Columbia, said David Becker, a former U.S. Justice Department attorney who leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a Washington-based nonprofit. “I’m waiting to see more about what this unit actually is, what jurisdiction it purports to claim, what authority it tends to seize and what laws it purports to enforce,” Becker told the AP. California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees elections, said he is concerned that the unit would be “more focused on attacking political enemies than protecting all Americans’ right to vote in free and fair elections.” Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are sounding the alarm about the <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2025/03/democrats-push-justice-department-keep-election-threats-task-force-amid-rollbacks/403858/?oref=ng-homepage-river">future of the Justice Department’s Election Threats Task Force</a> in the wake of the Trump administration’s moves to curtail or disband other federal election security initiatives. In a</span><a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-durbin-lead-push-to-save-task-force-combating-threats-to-election-officials/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">March 17 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Attorney General Pam Bondi, 31 senators — led by Sens. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. — called for the DOJ to continue the work of the task force, which was launched following the 2020 presidential election to investigate threats of violence made against election officials and workers. The senators wrote that “given the recent disturbing personnel and policy decisions at the [DOJ] and the lack of transparency about the future of the Task Force, we request an immediate update on the status and activities of the Task Force, as well as what resources will be provided to ensure its important work continues so that election officials of both parties can safely administer our elections.”</span></p>

The North Carolina State Board of Elections helped pave the way for this EAC program as a pilot participant and provided electronic poll book systems to further the EAC’s research efforts on their capability to comply with federal requirements. The Board’s participation and feedback was invaluable as the EAC refined requirements and implementation of this program. Since most election jurisdictions utilize electronic poll books, the EAC hopes this federal certification program informs future policy decisions and encourages other states and manufacturers to implement these standards to better serve election officials and voters.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic poll books, designed to replace paper poll lists by accessing digital voter registration records on a laptop or tablet, are a significant shift in how election officials serve their voters. About 84% of jurisdictions across the country utilize electronic poll books. As of 2025, all 100 counties in North Carolina use electronic poll books to check in voters for in-person early voting, and most use a combination of electronic and paper poll books for Election Day voting, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

Under the legislation, counties must randomly select one precinct and one statewide or countywide race for audit, excluding races already subject to a recount. The bill, sponsored by State Rep. Debbie Wood (R-Valley), seeks to enhance voter confidence by ensuring elections are properly administered.  “Post-election audits ensure public confidence in the election process,” said Wood. “Audits increase transparency and demonstrate that elections are fair and accurate.” The audits, to be conducted no earlier than 31 days after an election, will be overseen by county probate judges, who must publicly report their findings to the Alabama Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will then publish the audit results and submit a report to the governor and state legislature. The legislation outlines a structured audit process, including the appointment of inspectors and poll workers, securing election materials, and allowing poll watchers and media access. Ballots will be manually tallied or reviewed using certified ballot counters that were not in use during the election. HB30 was amended on the floor to include poll watchers in the audit process to increase oversight options. All audit-related costs will be reimbursed by the state’s comptroller, ensuring counties do not bear the financial burden of implementation.</span></p>

Emergency clauses require a two-thirds vote in each chamber, meaning at least 67 House votes, and allow laws to go into effect immediately upon the governor’s signature. HB 1713’s emergency clause received 70 votes Wednesday and will next be heard in the Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs. HB 1713 narrowly passed the equivalent House committee on March 12 after lawmakers and members of the public raised concerns that proposed ballot measures are too complex by default to be written at or below an 8th-grade reading level. Bill sponsor Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, said the bill should help Arkansans “make informed decisions when asked to sign a petition, without confusion, without legalese, without any deceptive wording.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill meant to further deter those who are </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/03/19/proposed-ban-on-noncitizen-voting-already-illegal-passes-arkansas-house-committee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not United States citizens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from voting in Arkansas elections narrowly passed a legislative committee this week. Noncitizen voting is already illegal on the federal level. In Arkansas, the only documents required for voter registration are a Social Security card and a driver’s license or state-issued identification card, both of which noncitizens are able to obtain, said Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, sponsor of the Only Citizens Vote Act. The proposed law,</span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1422&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1422</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would require the Department of Finance and Administration to share “names and identifying information of each” noncitizen with an Arkansas-issued ID or driver’s license with the Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections. The DF&amp;A, which oversees issuance of driver’s licenses and state IDs, would provide the information in quarterly reports starting Jan. 1, 2026.</span></p>

The measures, introduced by the Chairperson for the Legislative Committee on Elections, Senator Telo Taitague, focus on election security, voter privacy, and government accountability. Bill No.53-38 safeguards voter privacy by ending the outdated practice of posting hardcopies of voter registration indexes for unmonitored access. Bill No. 54-38 enhances voter registration processes, election procedures, and ballot handling with clearly defined guidelines and established timelines. Bill No.55-38 improves campaign finance reviews by clarifying campaign finance reporting requirements, and implements a quarterly financial reporting system. The Guam Election Commission voiced general support for the bills, emphasizing the need for greater transparency, streamlined processes, modernized systems, and improving voter confidence in Guam’s election process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3569" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IowaStateHouse-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Iowa:</strong> Senate Republicans passed a bill this week to </span><a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/state-government-news/2025-03-19/gop-senators-vote-to-ban-ranked-choice-voting-in-iowa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ban ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. About 50 jurisdictions across the country vote for some elected officials by ranking candidates in order of preference. The bill would prohibit ranked choice voting in Iowa, where it’s currently not being used. Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, says Iowa has a very good election system and ranked choice voting would be confusing. “In my view, ranked choice voting makes it harder to vote, it makes the votes harder to count, and it’s much harder to ensure a transparent and — accountable democratic process.” Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, opposed the bill. She says ranked choice voting saves money on runoff elections and gives voters more choices. “We see increased voter participation and much higher voter satisfaction because all candidates are considered, and all the votes count.” The bill now goes to the House for consideration.</span></p>

The Legislature now has sent three election bills to the governor’s desk. The other one would narrow the window for advance ballots to arrive at county election offices. </span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/sb4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the House passed 80-39 on Feb. 27 and the Senate passed 30-10 on March 6, would end the three-day grace period for advance ballots. Currently, ballots are counted if they are postmarked by Election Day and received by the following Friday. The law would require ballots to be returned instead by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Based on last year’s numbers, the change could result in more than 2,000 ballots being disqualified statewide in a general election. The House passed</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/sb5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/sb6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 86-37 margins on March 13. SB 5, which the Senate passed 32-8 on Monday, would prohibit election officials from accepting funds for election expenses from any source not authorized by the Legislature. The bill requires federal election funding only be used for purposes authorized by Congress. The law would explicitly prohibit the use of federal funding for election-related activities that include voter registration and voter assistance. SB 6, which the Senate passed 30-10 on this week, would prohibit any form of ranked-choice voting methods in federal, state, county or municipal elections. The method gives voters the option to rank candidates in order of preference, and if the first choice doesn’t have the votes to win, the ballot counts for the next choice. Kansas has not used ranked choice voting in official state-run or county-run elections. It was last used in the state during the 2020 party-run Democratic presidential primary.</span></p>

Currently, Montana election offices are required to operate on business days before an election and on the Monday before the election from 8:00 a.m. to noon, and from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on election day. Under the proposed bill, for the 30 days leading up to federal elections, voters would need to make changes in-person at locations like the Missoula County Election Office. The bill would require Montana counties to be open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the Saturday before the election. Late registration would no longer be available on Monday, and on election day, hours would be reduced to 8:00 a.m. until noon. If passed, the bill would result in expanded Saturday services and the elimination of Monday for late voter registration. </span></p>

The early voting period for general elections would stay the same. The bill would limit the governor’s authority to set early voting for special elections, capping it at six days. It also mandates at least 30 days of absentee voting for special elections. Municipal elections offering early voting or absentee options would face the same six-day cap. If approved, the changes would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026.</span></p>

This includes those proposed by the Legislature and through voter-initiated petitions. Under the resolution, the Secretary of State’s Office would have to certify that each proposed amendment complies with this rule. The Secretary of State’s Office could only approve petitions to gather signatures for proposed amendments if the amendments do not contain more than one subject. Critics have raised concerns that the amendment would give the officials a disproportionate amount of power to approve or deny changes to the constitution. It could also lead to more legislative and litigation-related costs to the state, opponents said.</span></p>

The legislation would also require voters who register using a mail-forwarding service or other post office box as their address to additionally list “a description of the location of the individual’s habitation” to be able to vote in state and local elections. Individuals who leave the state must “intend to return” to qualify as a resident, HB 1208 says.</span></p>

The bill also requires the Secretary of State’s Office to update its statewide voter registration file weekly and reduces the cost to access a copy of the state’s voter registration list. It currently costs $2,500 to purchase a list of South Dakota registered voters, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. HB 1062 would create an electronic spreadsheet option for $225.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/26073"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 185</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Sen. Amber Hulse, R-Hot Springs, would change the challenge process. The bill allows a person to challenge someone’s residency status on grounds other than “identity,” which is what the group used to challenge the 132 ballots last year, or that a person is a felon or mentally incompetent. Challenges could also be based on residency, voting or being registered in another state, or being deceased. Challenges could only be made in the months ahead of the election, not on Election Day. Oliva and Chapman said they worked with Hulse to reach a sufficient end result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota’s voter registration form already requires a voter to certify they’re a citizen of the United States.</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25611"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 73</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require people to be South Dakota residents when they register to vote while applying for a South Dakota driver’s license.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25723"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 75</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require U.S. citizenship status be placed on a driver’s license or nondriver identification card, allowing poll workers to more easily identify if a voter is eligible. Democratic lawmakers argued the bill would lead to discrimination against noncitizens outside of elections.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25822"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 68</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increases the penalty for voting illegally in the state. Rep. Logan Manhart, R-Aberdeen, carried the bill in the House, calling it an “election integrity” bill and saying it would deter fraudulent voting and keep noncitizens from voting in elections.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25856"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Joint Resolution 503</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sends a constitutional amendment to South Dakota voters clarifying a person must be a U.S. citizen to vote in the state.  The resolution doesn’t require the governor’s approval.

Supporters said the change is necessary to ensure adequate time for signature verification and legal challenges before the election. </span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25466"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require petition signatures for constitutional amendments to be gathered from each of the 35 state senatorial districts in the state.  The bill requires that a petition gain signatures from a number of registered voters in each district equal to 5% of the total votes cast for governor in that district during the last general election. The bill also retains the requirement that the total number of signatures on the petition must equal at least 10% of the votes cast statewide for governor in the last general election.</span></p>

The question of how far Paxton can go to prosecute election fraud is one that drove a wedge between the OAG and the Court of Criminal Appeals, the state&#8217;s highest criminal court. One bill,</span><a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB1026/2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, would permit the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to prosecute voter fraud if no court proceedings have begun after six months. That legislation is a response to a 2022 ruling from the Court of Criminal Appeals, in which the Court ruled 8-1 that the OAG cannot unilaterally prosecute voter fraud. Another bill heard is</span><a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB318/2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 318</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe. That bill would establish an &#8220;election integrity division&#8221; within the Office of the Attorney General. Under Paxton, such a division exists, though SB 318 would codify its role permanently. &#8220;It is creating a division in the AG&#8217;s office so that it will most certainly remain a priority that needs to be addressed,&#8221; Creighton said.</span></p>

The bill now heads to the governor’s desk. SB 487 would reduce the period of voting inactivity from four years to two years, meaning that voters who haven’t voted in any election during the preceding two calendar years and who haven’t updated their voter registration records would receive a confirmation notice from their local county clerk’s office and be moved to inactive status. Inactive voters can become active voters again and return to the active voter registration file if an application is received to update the voter’s registration or to vote in any election while they remain on the inactive list. Voters who remain on the inactive list during a period beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for federal office occurring after the date of the notice must have their voter registration file deleted.</span></p>

Allen’s move nearly ended up disenfranchising legitimate voters before legal action was taken. The lawsuit was initially brought in September by several groups &#8212; Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, League of Women Voters of Alabama, the Alabama Conference of the NAACP and four legal voters affected by the policy announced in August 2024. The cases were consolidated under the DOJ during the Biden administration, a federal judge in Birmingham halted Allen’s program before the 2024 election, finding that it violated the National Voter Registration Act. the Justice Department, now overseen by the Trump administration, said it filed to dismiss the lawsuit “to permit Alabama the time and space to develop a legal, efficient, and effective process to remove noncitizens from their voting roll and secure the vote for their citizens in upcoming elections.” The agency’s statement announcing the dismissal filing did not mention that legal voters would have been removed from the rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona:</strong> Attorneys for Kari Lake and Mark Finchem are on the hook for $122,000 in legal fees for Maricopa County for filing what a federal appeals court called a </span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-03-14/federal-court-rules-attorneys-for-kari-lake-mark-finchem-owe-fees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;frivolous&#8221; challenge to the use of voting machines in Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Judge Ronald Gould, writing for the majority, said Andrew Parker and Kurt Olsen made &#8220;false and misleading allegations&#8221; in their 2022 lawsuit claiming that voting machines were unreliable and subject to manipulation. They had sought an order on behalf of the two GOP candidates, who ultimately lost their elections, requiring that ballots be counted by hand. Gould also said the lawyers even misrepresented to the court that all voting in Arizona is done by machine when, in fact, most people use paper ballots, with electronic tabulation. And he said that U.S. District Court Judge John Tuchi, who imposed the sanctions after throwing out the case, was correct in concluding that the lawsuit was based on &#8220;speculation and conjecture.&#8221; Gould said the sanctions are merited not just because they filed an action without merit but that their lawsuit misled the public and caused &#8220;baseless concern about a topic of national importance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3587" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/California-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />California:</strong> Rep. Darrell Issa sued the state of California to</span><a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/issa-sues-california-to-stop-mail-in-ballot-counting-after-election-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stop mail-in ballots from being counted after Election Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which he claims provides &#8220;an unfair electoral advantage for opponents of Republican congressional incumbents.&#8221; The federal lawsuit filed last week on Issa&#8217;s behalf by conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch argues that counting vote-by-mail ballots that arrive up to seven days after Election Day violates federal law and directly led to the defeats of two Republican incumbents in last fall&#8217;s election. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who is named as the defendant in the complaint, said in a statement, &#8220;I will vigorously defend California&#8217;s commonsense election laws and safeguard every voter&#8217;s right to have their ballot counted.&#8221; The congressman&#8217;s lawsuit states he intends to run for re-election in 2026, but &#8220;faces a material risk that he may lose future elections due to these unlawful ballots.&#8221; The complaint also states that &#8220;Even if late-arriving VBM ballots in 2026 do not result in his defeat, Plaintiff is injured when an electoral performance is seen as less impressive. An unimpressive result leads to the public perception that California voters are turning away from Plaintiff&#8217;s message and platform.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shasta County has requested a court to h</span><a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/local/ballot-measure-for-election-reform-halted-by-shasta-county-over-legal-concerns-and-costs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alt a proposed ballot measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing potential violations of state and federal laws. The proposal, titled &#8220;Election Transparency and Security Reform,&#8221; was submitted by members of the public on March 3. The proposal aims to amend the Shasta County Charter to require all ballots to be hand-counted by volunteers at precincts, with results published on election night or shortly thereafter. The measure also seeks to limit absentee balloting, require voter ID to reduce fraud, and maintain voter rolls locally on a computer not connected to the state, third parties, or the internet. Additionally, it calls for the removal of individuals from voter rolls who are deceased, have moved out of the county, or have undeliverable addresses. In response, Shasta County filed a complaint with the Superior Court against Laura Hobbs, Deidre Holliday, Kari Chilson, Jim Burnett and Richard Gallardo, requesting a hold on their proposal. The county claims the measure violates the U.S. Constitution, California Constitution, California Elections Code, and federal laws. The court filing expressed concerns about the significant costs associated with the proposal, arguing that taxpayer dollars should not be spent on measures that may ultimately be unenforceable and overridden by higher legal authorities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 19, Superior Court Judge Benjamin Hanna </span><a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/03/19/shasta-county-loses-bid-to-delay-election-ballot-measure-work/82545722007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied the request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saying County Counsel Joseph Larmour&#8217;s request was &#8220;sparse,&#8221; &#8220;deficient&#8221; and the reasons he offered for making the request did not meet the legal requirements for approval. &#8220;This is too important of an issue for the court to make a decision on an expedited basis,&#8221; Hanna said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/coalition-good-governance-v-kemp-order-usdc-northern-ga.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a challenge to provisions of a controversial GOP-sponsored </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-challenge-to-georgia-gop-election-law-changes-made-after-2020-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">election law that went into effect soon after the 2020 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where President Donald Trump lost the state but disputed otherwise. Boulee rejected election integrity activists’ request to prohibit enforcement of certain provisions of</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/georgia-republicans-advance-sweeping-voting-restrictions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 202</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are criminal in nature. Pushed by Georgia&#8217;s Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the bill&#8217;s sweeping overhaul of the state&#8217;s election laws went into effect July 1, 2021. Many of the changes, which included permitting unlimited challenges to voter eligibility, shortening runoffs from nine weeks to four weeks, restricting the use of 24/7 drop boxes, and prohibiting people from passing out food and water to voters waiting in line, have been challenged in court proceedings since. A week after its enactment, Boulee refused to grant a preliminary injunction to block the law, citing concerns about changes to election administration rules mere days before runoff races in two special elections. The Coalition For Good Governance, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization focused on election security and transparency, contested five provisions, including the suspension rule, which allows the State Election Board to suspend a local election superintendent or board of registrars for violations of law. Members of the organization that serve as county election board members asserted the rule violates their due process procedural rights. Other voters argued that if a board is removed and not replaced in time, it could create a hurdle to voting and make them unable to register to vote. &#8220;In the court’s view, this type of remote injury is precisely the kind of speculative harm that is insufficient to confer standing,&#8221; Boulee wrote. Boulee, a Trump appointee, wrote that no officials have ever been suspended under the rule or are currently being considered for suspension, including any of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Georgia Supreme Court debated this week whether the State Election Board w</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/state-election-board-rules-appeal-argued-to-georgia-supreme-court/WRBPAK5GKBCFXE62VPXLHKSFTY/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ent too far when it attempted to pass new voting rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weeks before last year’s election. The case tests whether the board’s right-wing majority had the power to require election inquiries and hand-counts of ballots without laws passed by the Georgia General Assembly. While a judge’s order stopped those proposals from taking effect, the question remained about the extent of the board’s power. Justices on the state’s highest court on Wednesday often interrupted attorneys to ask whether the State Election Board has the authority to create new policies. “It does seem that some of these rules … look a lot like sort of setting up their own mini set of laws that govern that aren’t connected to anything in the code,” said Justice Andrew Pinson during oral arguments held at the Booth Western Art Museum in Cartersville. Justice Sarah Hawkins Warren said separation of powers between branches of government are “a big deal.” “The exact question that is trying to be answered here is, is this permissible? Does this exceed authority?” Warren asked. The court will rule in the coming months on the appeal of a Fulton County judge’s decision to overturn the State Election Board’s rules before November’s election.</span></p>

The lawsuit, filed in February in Ingham County Circuit Court, follows a </span><a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2025/03/16/rnc-lansing-foia-drop-box-lawsuit/82371481007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public records request </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the RNC sent on Nov. 26, seeking copies of surveillance video from absentee ballot drop boxes in the city on Nov. 5, Election Day. The RNC submitted similar requests to East Lansing, Delta Township, Flint, Detroit, Battle Creek and Muskegon, among others, and in its lawsuit said Lansing charged far more than any others. Detroit, Delta Township and Muskegon didn&#8217;t require any fee. Scott Bean, a spokesperson for Mayor Andy Schor, said in a statement that the city doesn&#8217;t comment on active litigation, but &#8220;is confident of its compliance with the Freedom of Information Act and an answer to the complaint will be filed soon.&#8221; The RNC said in a statement that the public has a right to see the video. &#8220;The City of Lansing is throwing up completely unnecessary obstacles and violating Michigan law to discourage citizens from requesting records about our elections, just like this footage of ballot drop boxes,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous, and the RNC will hold localities accountable if they choose to stonewall instead of following the law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6001" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.22.43-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Mississippi:</strong> The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that it would</span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/03/19/federal-appeals-court-affirms-mississippi-cant-count-late-mail-in-absentee-ballots-for-federal-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not change its prior decree </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Mississippi cannot count mail-in absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day.   The order means that Mississippi’s law allowing election workers to process mail-in ballots for up to five business days after the election will be suspended for all federal elections. The law only allowed the workers to count ballots postmarked by Election Day. The ruling does not impact state or local races, including Mississippi’s upcoming municipal elections. The recent order affirms an October ruling from a three-judge court that sided with the Republican National Committee and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi, who sued Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office because he administers the state’s elections. The order stated that Judges Jennifer Elrod, Edith Jones, Jerry Smith, Priscilla Richman, Catharina Haynes, Don Willet, James Ho, Stuart Duncan, Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham voted for denying the rehearing. Judge Oldham, writing for the majority, said the law that the Legislature enacted in 2020 to allow election workers to count mail-in ballots that arrived up to five days after the election conflicts with federal law because Congress had not explicitly granted states the authority to process ballots after Election Day.</span></p>

Michelle Previte, a Penn State Behrend mathematics professor who has wrangled with the county in court over other records requests made under Pennsylvania&#8217;s Right to Know Law, had sought on Dec. 16, 2022, nearly three months of surveillance footage of the drop box outside of the Erie County Courthouse, which houses the Erie County Voter Registration Office and the Board of Election. She also sought video from two cameras inside the Voter Registration Office. The Board of Elections denied her request, but did not ask for a hearing or respond to her appeal before the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records, which eventually ruled in Previte&#8217;s favor. Previte&#8217;s request also included the operating manual for the Dominion Voting machines used by the county. &#8220;(T)he Board did not act in willful and intentional defiance of the court order,&#8221; Ridge wrote. &#8220;Further, both Julie Slomski, who previously served as County Counsel&#8217;s (sic) clerk, and therefore had the responsibility to attempt to obtain and preserve the recordings, and Karen Chillcott, her successor, who assumed the same responsibilities, did everything that they could have reasonably done to obtain all the surveillance recordings and provide them to Mrs. Previte.&#8221;</span></p>

The case involves Texas’ 2021 redrawing of 2021 of political maps for congressional and state legislative districts after the 2020 census. The updated maps were meant to reflect the state’s population growth, which, according to the census, was driven almost entirely by Texans of color. However, the Republican-drawn maps diluted their political power, splitting up areas that had high minority populations and giving white voters even greater control. That sparked complaints from the federal government and other groups that the maps discriminated against voters of color. Republican lawmakers and attorneys representing the state in court have denied that their work violated the Voting Rights Act or constitutional protections against discrimination. The remaining plaintiffs in the case are coalitions of organizations representing Latino and Black Texans as well as individual Texans. According to Votebeat, the federal government’s withdrawal leaves the private plaintiffs to pursue the cases on their own. Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said the Justice Department’s decision does not affect the remaining parties&#8217; stance in the case. A trial has been set for May 21.</span></p>

This dismantling of CISA leaves our elections vulnerable and impairs a critical partnership between the federal government and state and local election officials that keeps our elections secure and safe. Join us for an important discussion about the role that CISA plays in identifying and mitigating cyber threats and enhancing election security. “Safeguarding Democracy: CISA’s Role in Protecting Elections,” will feature Kim Wyman, former Washington Secretary of State and CISA Senior Election Security Advisor, in conversation with current election officials Rob Rock, Rhode Island Deputy Secretary of State, Wesley Wilcox, Supervisor of Elections in Marion County, Florida, and Julie Wise, Director of Elections in King County, Washington. The event is presented by Issue One and Issue One’s Faces of Democracy initiative. <strong>When:</strong> March 21 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
