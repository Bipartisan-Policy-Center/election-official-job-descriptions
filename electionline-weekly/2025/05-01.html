<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Tammy Patrick, Chief Program Officer<br />
</span><a href="https://electioncenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Coalition of Election Association Leaders (CEAL) published the Association Maturation Guidebook: A Self-Assessment Guide to <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12811" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam1-300x191.png" alt="" width="300" height="191" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam1-300x191.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam1-1024x653.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam1-768x490.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam1-1536x980.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam1.png 1859w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />the Evolution of Election Associations, a valuable resource and self-assessment tool designed to help state and local election associations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEAL provided a preview of the guidebook for attendees at Election Center’s April 2025 Special Workshop in Pittsburgh as the first step in this iterative process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had the privilege of attending the Election Center’s ‘Special Workshop for Coalition of Election Association Leaders’ held in Pittsburgh from April 23 to 25,” said Julian M. Young, Director, Florence County Voter Registration and Elections. “This workshop was packed with</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">outstanding and relevant information for those of us election officials who are part of our State Associations. The speakers and organization leaders who shared their knowledge and wonderful research regarding their work with state associations were inspiring and spot on. I am thankful to the great Election Staff and Board who work so hard at engaging election officials in such meaningful and useful workshops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association Maturation Guidebook provides practical strategies and tools to enhance the effectiveness and capacity of state associations in upholding the integrity of the election process. These include a national landscape analysis of state associations, which provides insight into the number of state associations currently in operation and an overview of some of their operational and financial procedures. The analysis informs several self-assessment tools, including a list of questions for determining whether an association is informal, semi-formal, or formal, and an in-depth strategic assessment worksheet to support associations&#8217; strategic planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The origins of this project trace back to the vision of Stacey Scholl, a former Senior Program Associate at Democracy Fund, Pam Anderson, President of Consilium Colorado, who had run the Colorado County Clerks Association (CCCA) for many years, and me. Our initial efforts involved compiling a dataset of state association names, websites, and contact information, and cataloging conference information, social media presence, and the focus areas of each association. In 2023, this foundational work was moved to Election Center, leveraging its hub for election officials and state association leaders to gather valuable insights in one centralized location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CEAL is bringing association leaders together in an innovative environment to foster collaboration across states during this challenging time in elections administration,” Kathy J. Holstine Campbell, MACCEA Executive Director “As one of five state association executive <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12810" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam3-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam3-228x300.png 228w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam3-777x1024.png 777w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam3-768x1012.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CEALTeam3.png 952w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />directors, it was a privilege to be among peers who are modeling the way for associations to serve their members in a meaningful manner. Election Center’s dedicated focus on learning is the key to our success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEAL collaborated with partners and organizations across the field to create this guidebook, ensuring the final product is actionable and provides tangible benefits. Association leaders and members can use the guidebook to strengthen state associations that support professional development, collaboration, and advocacy efforts for election officials. Four case studies highlight best practices among state election official associations in Colorado, Missouri, Ohio, and Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guidebook is the first product of the Coalition of Election Association Leaders (CEAL). CEAL, a project of Election Center, serves as a network for current, past, and aspiring election official leaders. It is a supportive network that helps state election associations grow by providing guidance, networking opportunities, best practices, and data-driven tools. The Association Maturation Guidebook is our latest endeavor to help association leaders and members support their colleagues both within their state and nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit the new </span><a href="https://electioncenter.org/ceal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEAL page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Election Center’s website to download the Association Maturation Guidebook and view additional resources for state associations. Election Center members can also access the workshop presentations in the &#8220;Member Resources&#8221; section of the new member portal.  </span></p>

Donald Palmer, chair of the Election Assistance Commission, sought to reassure election officials that the commission would weigh their concerns and encouraged them to continue sharing their thoughts. “Wherever we end up in this process, my goal is to provide the least disruption to the states, to mitigate any impact on you and your voting systems,” Palmer told the group. At the same meeting, election officials learned that </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/29/trump-dei-election-security-states/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzQ1ODk5MjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3MjgxNTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NDU4OTkyMDAsImp0aSI6IjMzOGQ2ZTU3LTFjYTQtNGQ1ZS05ZTM5LWFmMmU4OTRhOGJjZSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI1LzA0LzI5L3RydW1wLWRlaS1lbGVjdGlvbi1zZWN1cml0eS1zdGF0ZXMvIn0.3huEEYfC3y7FQ5ullb0NvIoIcgxQy88F4aI7s9tAMYc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to apply for election security grants, they would have to sign an agreement certifying that they do not “operate any programs promoting DEI”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that violate federal antidiscrimination laws. After facing pushback from state officials, the commission told states Friday it was reviewing the terms and conditions of the grants. “More information will be provided soon,” said an email from the commission that was obtained by The Washington Post. A spokesperson for the commission did not respond to questions about the grants. The White House said it was reasonable to expect states to follow antidiscrimination laws if they receive federal election funds. In more EAC-related news, at a </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/election-assisstance-commission-chair-ballots-after-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on California’s ballot counting process this week, Palmer said, “There should be a deadline for absentee or mail ballots prior to Election Day and then they should be returned by Election Day.” In his</span><a href="https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=118157"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> written testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Committee on House Administration, Palmer specified that the statements were his personal opinion. “Unless otherwise noted, I am solely responsible for this testimony, and my views may not necessarily reflect the positions of the agency or those of my fellow EAC Commissioners,” Palmer said. Over at the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/28/justice-civil-rights-harmeet-dhillon-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to numerous news reports, since being sworn in this month, civil rights director Harmeet K. Dhillon has redirected her staff to focus on combating antisemitism, the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports and what Trump and his allies have described as anti-Christian bias and the Democrats’ “woke ideology.” The division changed mission statements across its sections to focus less on racial discrimination and more on fighting diversity initiatives. And department officials reassigned more than a dozen career staffers — including section chiefs overseeing police brutality, disability and voting rights cases — to areas outside their legal expertise. On the cybersecurity front, this week </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/kristi-noem-rsac-2025-cisa-mission/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary Kristi Noem outlined her plans to refocus the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on protecting critical infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated threats — particularly from China — while distancing the agency from what she characterized as mission drift under previous leadership. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, according to a report in The Hill, the </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5276489-musk-doge-voter-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Government Efficiency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DOGE) has referred dozens of alleged cases of voter fraud to DOJ for prosecution.  Antonio Gracias, who is working for DOGE in the Social Security Administration, said the cost-cutting panel had identified 57 resident aliens who had registered to vote. “We’ve referred many prosecutions to the DOJ, and they’re working on them now,” he said. “They take a long time to prepare because you have to go to the states and get information and be 100 percent sure you’re correct. And the problem is it’s very laborious because, as I pointed out, it’s several different databases. You have to actually hand sample the databases trying to find the stuff. You can’t compare them automatically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3427" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Election-Mail-3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />The Case of the Missing Ballots</strong>: Not even Jessica Fletcher may be able to solve this one. The Vanderburgh County, Indiana Election Office received 6,428 requests for absentee ballots in last year&#8217;s election. Of those, 5,886 were returned. Forty-one were subsequently tossed out because they arrived after the deadline. The 91.5% absentee ballot return rate was a few percentage points lower than past election years&#8217; return rates, a scenario former County Clerk Marsha Abell Barnhart says would have been unlikely in a high turnout presidential election. One of these years, Barnhart imagines, someone in a U.S. postal facility somewhere will stumble upon a dusty old box and find hundreds of absentee ballots mailed by Vanderburgh County voters in 2024. By then, of course, it will be too late to matter. It&#8217;s already too late for them to be anything but artifacts. When Barnhart left office as county clerk on Jan. 1, she was </span><a href="https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/local/2025/04/24/missing-vanderburgh-county-2024-ballots-gone-for-good-clerk-says/83215804007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conducting an investigation into the fate of nearly 550 mail-in absentee ballots that hadn&#8217;t shown up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the election nearly two months earlier. They still haven&#8217;t shown up, said Dottie Thomas, who succeeded Barnhart as Vanderburgh County&#8217;s chief elections officer in January. And there&#8217;s been no word about the missing ballots from the U.S. Postal Service, the clerk said. &#8220;I think they’re gone for good,&#8221; said Thomas, who was elected on Nov. 5. &#8220;I don’t know where, but they’re gone for good.&#8221; The former clerk was driven from the beginning of her quest for answers by her conviction that hundreds of voters would not go to the necessary trouble to vote absentee by mail and then fail to follow through. Barnhart has another idea, she told the Evansville Courier &amp; Press that she’s pretty convinced something happened to them since Evansville’s mail is now being sorted through Kentucky. Barnhart regrets how unsettled and unfinished the whole matter seems. She is convinced that hundreds of Vanderburgh County voters were disenfranchised by the Postal Service&#8217;s &#8220;poor management. &#8220;I ran out of time because I had to vacate the office,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wish I could have stayed around and taken it on as a project, to be able to keep calling people, because I still feel that taking mail from Evansville, Indiana, to Louisville, Kentucky — there’s something that just shouldn’t happen.&#8221;</span></p>

The ordinance, brought forward by Assembly member David Guttenberg, changes borough code so that after ballots are processed and tabulated during an election, the canvass board will undergo a hand count of a contested race from two random precincts, as well as one contested race from early voting. This information will serve as an audit of the machine count done on election night, the Assembly said. “Hopefully, we’ll get more confidence in what we’re doing,” Guttenberg said, explaining the intent behind his ordinance, “and I think that’s just a natural outcome of what should be happening to verify what an election is.“</span></p>

Sponsored by Rep. Rachel Keshel, a Tucson Republican and member of the far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus, the proposal would ban in-person early voting and the use of vote centers where any registered voter within a county can cast a ballot.  Instead, it would require the use of precincts capped at 1,000 registered voters apiece. Most counties use voting centers, which allow any registered voter to show up and cast a ballot at any polling site in the county. Under the precinct model, only voters assigned to a precinct can vote there, and if they vote at the wrong location, their ballot won’t be counted. According to the Arizona Mirror, the proposal is all but guaranteed to get a veto from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, but the Senate could still vote on its mirror, House Concurrent Resolution 2002, which would bypass the governor’s desk and head straight to the 2026 ballot to be decided by the voters.  The Joint Legislative Budget Committee wrote in an April 11 fiscal note that HCR2002 would cost the counties a total of around $53 million in its first election year and more than $21 million each election year after that.  House Bill 2017 would have the same impacts, including the requirement that counties open 3,957 additional voting locations for each election, and find more than 27,000 additional poll workers to staff them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the House and Senate have approved a bill that would r</span><a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2025/04/30/american-made-voting-equipment-might-not-be-ready-by-2029/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equire counties to purchase voting equipment made solely in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something that does not currently exist. Under the legislation, beginning in 2029, the secretary of state’s office cannot certify vote-recording and vote-tabulating equipment unless each and every part of the machine, including all components and software, are “sourced from the United States.” House Bill 2651 also says the equipment must be assembled in the United States. The measure now goes to Gov. Katie Hobbs.</span></p>

House Bill 1327, as written, would change how petitions are submitted to the state’s title board. Legislatures hope this will prevent what happened in 2024 with the ranked-choice voting ballot measure, when multiple versions were created for state officials to review. The law would set reporting requirements as signatures are being gathered and require ballot measures to be labeled. HB 1327 was not amended in the Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee last week. However, Republicans tried to remove the bill&#8217;s safety clause, which they called unnecessary, and replace it with a petition clause that would give citizens the right to challenge the measure. That failed. The bill passed on a party-line vote and is now awaiting debate in the full Senate. Kipp told Colorado Politics she&#8217;s considering amendments. The bill also adds fines of $1,500 for anyone who doesn&#8217;t follow the changes. Menten said that the right to petition is not universal, and that &#8220;we should be celebrating this right, not restricting it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are sending the governor a measure meant to </span><a href="https://www.aspenpublicradio.org/government/2025-04-30/colorado-lawmakers-approve-voting-rights-bill-despite-pushback-from-election-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shore up voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The move is part of a national effort to write protections established by the federal Voting Rights Act into state laws. But it comes despite opposition from local officials, who have argued the law could upend decades-old practices. </span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-001"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 25-001</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed the legislature this week largely along party lines. It would give voters the right to bring discrimination suits at the state level and extend new protections specific to Colorado, including making sure people can vote while in jail and barring discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Pushback has come from local officials, including some representing progressive parts of the state. They say the measure could reopen settled legal questions about voting practices that some could argue are discriminatory. Those include electing officials at large, which can keep minority candidates out of office, and holding local elections in the spring or summer, when turnout tends to be lower. Throughout the legislative session, the Colorado Municipal League, which represents local governments, has been</span><a href="https://cml.informz.net/cml/data/images/SB25-001%20Position%20Paper%20_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging lawmakers to amend the measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The group says the proposal conflicts with provisions of the Colorado Constitution that bar state regulation of municipal elections. It also says the bill could erode the nonpartisan nature of local elections, by forcing them to coincide with state and federal voting, and it notes that the measure doesn&#8217;t apply to state or school board elections.</span></p>

The House approved the bill earlier this month with a 76-31 vote. Under HB 1205, amendment sponsors would be required to post a $1 million bond among other sweeping changes that also include shortened timelines for petition gathering and stiffer penalties for violations. The Republican-sponsored bill also prohibits using public money to campaign for or against an amendment after Gov. Ron DeSantis spent millions of dollars fighting last year’s marijuana and abortion rights initiatives, both of which ultimately failed.</span></p>

A bill sponsored by Foley and cross-filed by state Sen. Cheryl Kagan (D-Dist. 17), would have required special elections to fill legislative vacancies in certain circumstances. The legislation proposed an amendment to the state constitution to deal with the issue of filling legislative vacancies statewide. Similar bills have been unsuccessful over the past several years. Versions of the legislation like the bills sponsored by Foley and Kagan have failed four times in five years. Similarly to this year, the legislation has often been held up in the House – not necessarily failing to garner votes, but not even appearing on an agenda. In the past, some members of House of Delegates have expressed that the appointment process offers a decreased cost and low barrier to entry to becoming a representative, which could potentially offer opportunities for more marginalized community members. “The fact that this didn’t pass … I mean, it’s beyond ridiculous and without a good reason,” Foley told Bethesda Today in an interview last week.</span></p>

It would also bar the state from using public money to support such mailings by other groups. State Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who sponsored</span><a href="https://www.capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB511"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 511,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said it would put voter-registration applications under the same restrictions that are already in place for mail-ballot applications. A 2021 Texas law — which faces challenges in federal court — barred election officials from sending out unsolicited mail-ballot applications. State Rep. Tom Oliverson, a Houston-area Republican, filed a bill identical to SB 511 in the House. Both bills have been advanced and could soon reach the floors of their respective chambers. Voting rights groups said the bills could also make it harder to get registration forms in other ways. Bettencourt said the bill does not prevent deputy volunteer voter registrars and candidates from distributing voter registration applications. But some voting rights advocates say language in the bill that says state officials “may not distribute a form on which a person may apply for registration to a person who didn’t request it” is too broad. They say it could have implications for election officials who, for instance, choose to display voter registration application forms on the counter of their elections offices. </span></p>

City Councilors Ed Parigian, Jeremy Rubell and Bill Ciraco voted in the majority, while Tana Toly and Ryan Dickey dissented. The vote overturned an earlier decision to employ ranked-choice voting in the mayoral and City Council election in November. The election will be managed in the traditional method, which creates the possibility of a primary election if enough candidates seek the mayor’s office or a seat on the City Council. The vote followed testimony from supporters and critics of the voting method.</span></p>

Even though the rule was written by WEC with input from an advisory committee that included members of right-wing election conspiracy groups, election skeptics opposed the rule’s passage at a number of public hearings. At a</span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/04/21/legislative-rules-committee-hears-testimony-on-rules-for-election-observers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week, 2020 election deniers — including former state Rep.

Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), complained that the rule was written without enough input from legislators. Despite that opposition, Rep.

But she allowed other parts of Trump’s sweeping executive order on U.S. elections to go forward for now, including a directive to tighten mail ballot deadlines around the country. The March executive order overhauling how U.S. elections are run prompted swift lawsuits from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the League of Women Voters Education Fund, the Democratic National Committee and others, who called it unconstitutional. Kollar-Kotelly sided with voting rights groups and Democrats, saying that the Constitution gives the power to regulate federal elections to states and Congress — not the president. She noted federal lawmakers are currently working on their own legislation to require proof of citizenship to vote. In a 120-page</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.279032/gov.uscourts.dcd.279032.104.0_1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she said the plaintiffs had proven that the proof-of-citizenship requirement would cause their clients irreparable harm and go against the public interest, while the government had offered “almost no defense of the President’s order on the merits.” Accordingly, she granted a preliminary injunction to stop the citizenship requirement from moving forward while the lawsuit plays out. The judge also blocked part of the Republican president’s order requiring public assistance enrollees to have their citizenship assessed before getting access to the federal voter registration form. But she denied other requests from a group of Democratic plaintiffs, including refusing to block Trump’s order to require all mailed ballots to be received by Election Day nationwide. She also did not touch Trump’s order to open certain databases to billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to allow it to review state voter lists to search for noncitizens. The judge said those arguments brought by Democrats were either premature or should be brought by states instead.</span></p>

Filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the brief backs Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, the defendant in a lawsuit filed by March for Our Lives Idaho, a student organization that encourages young voters to cast ballots and supports gun safety, and the Idaho Alliance for Retired Americans. Both nonprofits are based in Boise. Their suit contends that prohibiting student IDs discriminates against younger voters and violates the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18 when it was passed in 1971. Their suit also notes that Idaho allows others IDs for voters: a state-issued driver&#8217;s license or an ID issued by the Idaho Transportation Department, a passport issued by the U.S. government, a tribal ID card or a license to carry a concealed weapon. The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho granted a summary judgment in Idaho&#8217;s favor, but the plaintiffs filed an appeal at the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit. Arizona and the other states in the “friend of the court” brief are arguing the district court ruled properly in allowing Idaho to exclude student IDs for in-person voting or registration. The states contend there is no evidence that the Idaho Legislature tried to deprive young people of their right to vote by excluding student IDs or that the state violated the 26th Amendment.</span></p>

With no appeal to the state’s highest court from the commission within 30 days, the appellate court finalized its decision on April 21. “There are no legal charges any more against her, and there never should have been any,” her attorney, Jon Salomon of Louisville, said this week. Susan Clary, executive director of the ethics commission, had no comment when asked why the commission did not ask the Kentucky Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision. The commission had been investigating Grimes for several years. In November 2021, the commission fined Grimes $10,000 for two ethical violations pertaining to handling of voter data.</span></p>

The Republican National Committee, the state Republican Party and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi sued Secretary of State Michael Watson and local elections officials over a state law that allows election workers to process absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day for up to five days after the election.  The political parties argue that Congress is the only entity that can set specific parameters for federal elections, while state officials contend that federal law defers to states on specific details for conducting elections. Now Mississippi officials are asking the Supreme Court to uphold the state law, a decision that could have broad implications for more than a dozen states that have similar laws on the books.  The litigation does not impact state or local races, including Mississippi’s current municipal elections. Mississippi’s next federal election will be the 2026 midterm.</span></p>

Mendez and his wife face new charges in the 20-count superseding indictment including attempts to tamper with a witness to the alleged ballot stuffing scheme. Mendez has served on the council for nearly five years – including being re-elected in 2024 – since he was accused of stealing mail-in ballots with numerous co-conspirators in the run-up to the 2020 election. The New Jersey State Attorney General’s office alleged Mendez and several co-conspirators stole mail-in ballots, falsified them, and then stuffed hundreds of them in a mailbox in Haledon to try to win the election. Mendez and his wife Yohanny Munoz-Mendez have denied wrongdoing and previously pleaded not guilty. In all, five people have been charged in the alleged voter fraud scheme. The charges include election fraud, tampering with public records, forgery and the new charge of witness tampering. If convicted, the top count carries a sentence of up to 5-10 years in prison.</span></p>

Lindenberg was arrested after allegedly requesting, completing, and submitting an early mail ballot in another person’s name to the Suffolk County Board of Elections in the 2024 general election, the DA said. The DA said Lindenberg would also go on to allegedly cast a vote himself, thereby voting twice. &#8220;Confidence in electoral systems is integral to a free society,&#8221; Tierney said. &#8220;I thank the Suffolk County Board of Elections for referring this matter to us. My office is committed to ensuring the reliability of our voting process.&#8221; According to the investigation, on Oct. 19, 2024, Lindenberg used the early mail ballot online application portal to request a ballot on behalf of another person, unbeknownst to the other individual, the DA said. On April 28, he was arraigned before District Court Judge Jonathan R. Bloom for one count of first-degree offering a false instrument for filing, a Class E felony, and one count of first-degree falsifying business records, a Class E felony, the DA said. Bloom released Lindenberg on his own recognizance during the pendency of the case without bail because his charges are considered non-bail eligible under current New York State law, meaning prosecutors cannot ask for, and judges cannot set, bail, the DA said. Lindenberg is due back in court on May 21 and is being represented by Scott Gross, the DA said.</span></p>

Republican defendants promptly appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals to “preserve the status quo.”  The panel of appeals judges stayed the trial court’s judgment, allowing the auditor to gain control over appointments until an appeal is resolved or the court issues another decision. They did not explain the rationale for their intervention, and the names of the judges on the panel will continue to be sealed for 90 days, although the decision was unanimous. Should the state’s highest court not intervene, the law will go into effect May 1, and Boliek will have the ability to make appointments to elections boards on both the county and state level, chosen from lists of candidates provided by the state Democratic and Republican parties. This ability may potentially shift the boards to a Republican majority, from a 3-2 Democratic majority.  Stein, who has appealed the decision to the state Supreme Court,</span><a href="https://x.com/JoshStein_/status/1917673782916886584"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the intermediate court’s decision</span></p>

The Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked the high court in January to hear their appeal of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on provisional ballots issued days before last year’s presidential election. In a 4-3 decision, the state’s highest court affirmed voters’ rights in the commonwealth to cast provisional ballots and have them counted, if they learn their mail-in ballots have been rejected. In a brief opposing the GOP’s petition, the state Democratic Party and the DNC argue the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is the ultimate authority in the case. Granting the appeal would set a precedent invalidating state supreme court jurisdiction in election law cases across the country. “Granting certiorari here would almost surely engender requests for this Court’s review of any and every state-law election case, burdening the Court with invitations to weigh in on all manner of (often time-sensitive) state-election-law disputes,” Democratic party lawyers argue. “That is not a regime the Court should foster.” The</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-786.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Republican National Committee, et al. v. Faith Genser, et al.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An out-of-state group that </span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/out-of-state-group-cant-sue-for-pa-voter-registration-records-federal-appeals-court-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued the commonwealth for records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it claimed would show “non-U.S. citizens have been registering and voting in Pennsylvania for decades” lost an appeal in federal court. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Virginia-based Public Interest Legal Foundation has no standing to sue the Pennsylvania Department of State for voter registration records under a federal law intended to increase participation in elections. “While a statute may authorize private suits to compel compliance with the law, private citizens are not deputized as private attorneys general empowered to enforce any and all violations of a statute without regard to their personal stake in the matter,” Circuit Judge Marjorie O. Rendell wrote in an opinion for the court. A spokesperson said the Department of State is pleased with the decision. A PILF spokesperson said it is considering the court’s opinion and “will be moving forward from there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Middle District Judge Matthew W. Brann has </span><a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/04/state-lawmakers-suit-over-2024-election-issues-in-pa-county-dismissed.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed a Republican lawmaker’s challenge to the processing of voter registration and mail-in-ballot applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Luzerne County before the 2024 General Election.Brann ruled Monday Rep. Jamie Walsh did not have standing because he was unopposed in the general election for the 117th District seat. Walsh defeated incumbent Rep. Mike Cabell in the Republican primary by 4 votes, but the winner was not officially declared until five months later because of litigation related to provisional ballots. Walsh’s claims about Luzerne County election procedures, if true, could not possibly have caused him any injury as an unopposed and successful candidate. Brann concluded. An unopposed candidate who wins his office suffers no injury at all when voter registration and mail-in ballot procedures are followed imperfectly, the judge wrote.There is no legal authority to support standing where plaintiffs, as in this case, merely “seek to protect the rights of all Pennsylvania voters,” he said. Any fear of future injury in the 2026 election is conjectural, he said.</span></p>

The agreement, originally reached in 2016 following a voting rights lawsuit, was set to expire after the 2024 election. In advance of that election, the U.S. Department of Justice and the ACLU of Utah monitored San Juan County to ensure compliance with federal voting rights laws and the terms of the existing settlement. Advocates say the extension is essential to preserving voter access and preventing a return to past barriers. Under the agreement, San Juan County must continue operating voting information centers in Monument Valley, Montezuma Creek and Navajo Mountain. Each location is required to be staffed with trained Navajo-language interpreters to assist with voter registration, ballot replacement and election-related questions during the weeks leading up to elections. The county is also required to share election information in Navajo at Utah Chapter Houses, on KNDN and KTNN radio stations, and in both the Navajo Times and San Juan Record newspapers. “Language access is not just a matter of convenience — it’s a civil right,” said Aaron Welcher, communications director for the ACLU of Utah. “All eligible voters have a right to full and equal voting access without barriers, including the right to read and understand their ballot and voting resources. We’re encouraged that the extended agreement will continue because language access is voter access.”</span></p>

It prolongs the group’s lawsuit, first filed in June 2024, that challenges a Burlington charter change allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. “Vermont’s Constitution is clear: when it comes to votes concerning state matters, only U.S. citizens have the right to decide,” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for the conservative group, said in a press release. “RITE is proud to stand with Vermont citizens to defend the rule of law and fight the left’s creeping endorsement of noncitizen voting.” Joe Magee, the deputy chief of staff for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and a spokesperson for the city, said that the city “is confident that our all legal resident voting provision is defensible, and we look forward to a favorable ruling by the Court.” Burlington voters in 2023 approved a charter change to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. The Vermont Legislature overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Phil Scott to enact it several months later.</span></p>

The suit was filed in Dane County Circuit Court. If the suit is successful, Wisconsin would adopt a voting system that’s currently being used in New York state and Connecticut. There, each voter still gets one vote. But a candidate can appear on the ballot more than once, next to every political party that endorses them. That pushes candidates to find commonalities with more than one party, and it gives minor parties other than the Republicans and Democrats more of a voice, proponents of fusion voting argue. “This is a way to increase real political representation and political participation,” said Jeff Mandell, Law Forward’s president and general counsel. “For every single person in the state of Wisconsin who’s ever looked at a ballot or at an election and thought, ‘I don’t love either of these candidates, or I wish things were a little bit different,’ this is a way to try to advance that.” The people suing include former state Senate Majority Leader Dale Schultz, a Republican who endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president in 2024, and former Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney, a Democrat. The other plaintiffs are former Republican state Rep. David Deininger; a retired Court of Appeals judge, Lee Rasch, who heads the advocacy group LeaderEthics-Wisconsin; and Kristine Andrews, a lobbyist who’s served as chief of staff to two Republican members of Congress. They’ve formed a group called</span><a href="https://unitedwisconsin.org/about-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> United Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to allow fusion voting in the state and to “promote legislation and candidates for public office that will advance cooperation across political party lines, compromise, and problem-solving.”</span></p>

Moderated by Votebeat Arizona reporter Jen Fifield, you’ll learn about the practical realities of requiring documented proof of citizenship for elections. Currently, there is no federal requirement to show proof of citizenship in order to vote. Instead, voters across the country must attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. President Donald Trump&#8217;s executive order on elections included a requirement for proof of citizenship. In Congress, the SAVE Act has a similar requirement and has passed the House. Three states have passed a proof of citizenship requirement in recent years, and several others are considering legislation. As the United States appears to be moving closer to requiring some form of citizenship proof in order to vote, this conversation will dive into the practical reality of administering elections with this requirement in place. Arizona has had a documented proof of citizenship requirement for state and local elections for twenty years, and officials determined in 2024 that state systems didn’t properly record the citizenship status of around 200,000 voters. This year, New Hampshire held its first election with a documented proof of citizenship requirement.
