							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What if the unthinkable happened?</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Q&amp;A Report from GAO looks at special House elections</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty years ago, with the specter of the September 11th terrorist attacks still looming large, Congress passed the</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/109/crpt/hrpt8/CRPT-109hrpt8.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Continuity of Representation Act of 2005</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-109hr841pcs/pdf/BILLS-109hr841pcs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.R. 841</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, established a framework for conducting expedited special elections to fill House vacancies resulting from a catastrophic terrorist attack or other extraordinary circumstances. The purpose of H.R. 841 is to ensure that a functioning House of Representatives would be in place with the ability to operate effectively and with legitimacy in the wake of a potential catastrophic terrorist attack </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, if the Speaker of the House announces there are more than 100 vacancies, federal law generally requires states to hold special elections within 49 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, threats against members of Congress have increased. This has raised questions about states&#8217; ability to fill vacancies in the House.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12327" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.11.17 AM-300x136.png" alt="" width="300" height="136" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.11.17 AM-300x136.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.11.17 AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government Accountability Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GAO) is an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. GOA examines how taxpayer dollars are spent and provides Congress with timely information that is objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, nonideological and balanced. Most GAO work is done at the request of congressional committees or subcommittees or is mandated by public laws or committee reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-107428.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q&amp;A Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the GOA analyzed state laws and surveyed election officials from all 50 states to gather perspectives on holding such elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOA found that about half who responded were unaware of this federal law. However, a number of officials noted that they believed they could hold special elections consistent with the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What GAO Found</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Constitution requires each state&#8217;s governor to issue written orders for special elections to fill vacancies in the U.S. House of Representatives (House). Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, a federal law was enacted in 2005 that generally requires states to hold special elections within 49 days of the Speaker of the House announcing that there are more than 100 vacancies in the House. Under the statute, this is referred to as &#8220;extraordinary circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12328" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.12.33 AM-261x300.png" alt="" width="261" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.12.33 AM-261x300.png 261w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.12.33 AM-892x1024.png 892w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.12.33 AM-768x882.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.12.33 AM.png 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" />While almost all states have laws for holding special elections to fill House vacancies in general, GAO identified nine states that have laws for holding such elections in extraordinary circumstances, consistent with the federal law. The laws in these states adopt aspects of the federal law, including those related to the 49-day time frame, although most of them do not adopt all the law&#8217;s requirements. The other 41 states do not have laws that adopt aspects of the federal law, and their laws for holding special elections to fill House vacancies vary in the types of timing provisions they contain. Examples of the timing provisions for holding such elections include specifying the number of days within which states are required to hold the election or giving the governor discretion to order an election within a specific time frame. In the case of extraordinary circumstances, states must follow the provisions of the federal law regardless of whether their laws adopt aspects of that law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GAO surveyed state election officials in all 50 states to obtain their perspectives on holding special elections consistent with the federal law. Nineteen of the 33 officials who responded reported that they were not aware of the federal law prior to hearing about GAO&#8217;s study. In addition, officials identified a range of challenges related to holding special elections consistent with the federal law. For example, officials reported that selecting candidates through primary elections in time to hold a special election within the 49-day time frame in the law would be difficult.</span></p>
<p><strong>Examples of Challenges that States Might Face in Holding Special Elections in Extraordinary Circumstances</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12329" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-22-at-2.51.14 PM-1024x538.png" alt="" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-22-at-2.51.14 PM-1024x538.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-22-at-2.51.14 PM-300x158.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-22-at-2.51.14 PM-768x404.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-22-at-2.51.14 PM.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State election officials reported that the challenges they identified could affect the accuracy and availability of ballots, pamphlets, and other voting materials; public perceptions of the election; and voting access, such as whether voters have sufficient time to request absentee ballots. However, a number of officials noted that they believed they could hold special elections consistent with the federal law. Additionally, officials identified state practices that might help them hold such elections. For example, officials reported that in some cases states assign responsibility for candidate selection to political parties and noted that this could be done relatively quickly under a special election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why GAO Did This Study</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GAO was asked to examine state capabilities to hold special elections to fill House vacancies in extraordinary circumstances, consistent with the federal law. This report provides information on (1) state laws related to holding special elections to fill House vacancies and (2) the perspectives of state election officials on the capabilities of, and challenges facing, states in holding special elections to fill House vacancies consistent with the federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To conduct this work, GAO analyzed laws in all 50 states related to holding special elections to fill House vacancies. In addition, GAO conducted a web survey of state election officials in all 50 states to obtain their perspectives on holding special elections consistent with the federal law. To encourage responses, GAO followed up multiple times with non-respondents by both phone and email. Thirty-three states responded to the survey. GAO also reviewed relevant reports and interviewed subject matter experts from four organizations, selected based on their work on this topic.</span></p>

They were on scene for probably two minutes. So they definitely showed up with a plan &#8230; and were gone just as quickly just after they did the damage.” The graffiti was anti-establishment and anti-government, he said.The damaged windows were boarded up as of 9am Jan. 20 and the office was open for business as usual Tuesday, Denis Theriault, spokesperson with the Multnomah County Communications Office, said in an email. “Nothing like this has happened before in the 17 years I’ve been with Multnomah County,” Elections Director Tim Scott told the AP in an email. A contractor has been hired to measure the windows, with hopes to replace them by next week, he said. Also in the Pacific Northwest, last week the FBI gave an </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/ballot-box-fires-oregon-washington-2024-election-a5e4febfc3b647b49ca60b686604e0e6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update on the investigation into the incendiary devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were placed in drop boxes in Oregon and Washington in advance of the 2024 election. The devices used to spark the three ballot drop box fires were made of a “very volatile mix” of thermite and scrap metal, FBI agents said Thursday. Thermite devices are made of metal shavings and iron oxide, and can burn as hot as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,204 Celsius), Special Agent in Charge Doug Olson told reporters at a news conference at the FBI’s Portland field office. He said the person who made the devices welded them using scrap metal for the exterior and inserted thermite inside. Thermite can be easily made, he added. “We’re very worried that this person may harm himself or others if he continues to experiment with thermite,” Special Agent in Charge W. Mike Herrington said. “In addition to the physical risks, these devices can cause significant damage to homes, storage areas or testing locations such as fields and forests.”</span></p>

Complaints about three Wake County elections board members and four Rowan board members sought removal from their posts. Democrats on the state elections board voted not to move forward with the complaints, while its two Republican members said they had enough evidence to call for hearings.  Two of the state board’s Democrats said the law is unclear.  “It is disturbing when our memos are not adhered to,” said Jeff Carmon, a Democratic member. “The lack of clarity from our legislature gives them an out.” The </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/state-moves-to-remove-waynesboro-election-official-who-refused-to-certify-vote/article_2d53c4b8-4589-5784-8bd4-855bc5428ea6.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Board of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is seeking to remove Waynesboro Electoral Board Vice Chair Curtis Lilly II from his post after he attempted to prevent the certification of last November&#8217;s election results. Lilly, who was chair at the time and was part of a conservative majority on the three-person local board, said he would not certify the election results unless all ballots were hand-counted. The attempts to thwart the certification of the votes failed after a band of Waynesboro voters filed a countersuit and the state requested the case be dismissed, calling it &#8220;dubious&#8221; and &#8220;contrived.&#8221; The state board’s 5-0 vote on Jan. 15 petitions that same court to remove Lilly from his post. </span></p>

The </span><a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2025/01/some-nj-voters-had-to-wait-hours-last-november-theres-an-investigation-into-why.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burlington County, New Jersey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> board of supervisors have agreed to hire an independent special council to look into what caused long lines and hours of delays for voters on Election Day in 2024.  “Burlington County residents deserve accountability and appropriate action to ensure the 2024 election failures are not repeated, and our Board is committed to making sure that occurs,” Felicia Hopson, the Burlington County Commissioner Director, said in a statement this week. “We have decided that it is in the best interest of all parties that the review be performed by an independent third-party.” The election was the first to use ballot marking devices and tabulators at polling locations. Older switch-based machines had been used for the past 25 years. The new machines used a voter-verifiable paper record that is a “significant increase in security that wasn’t present with the old machines,” the county said. In November, the Commissioner Board asked the Superintendent of Elections and the Board of Elections to submit a report about the issues on election day, a county statement said. “While both offices have gathered information, neither has the expertise to complete the review process,” the statement concluded. Commissioners have appointed Connell Foley LLP as independent special counsel. The firm was the only respondent to a request for proposal issued earlier this month. The term for the contract runs through December 31, 2025. Levinsky said a resolution passed this month said the cost for the special counsel service should not exceed $250,000. In </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/wisconsin/2025/01/22/missing-madison-ballots-could-have-counted/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madison, Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an article from Votebeat indicated that about 70 of the nearly 200 uncounted ballots discovered after Election Day may have been able to be counted if staff members had promptly alerted the county. The clerk’s office staff didn’t find 125 of the uncounted ballots until Dec. 3, after the state already certified the election. But they found 68 of them well before that, on Nov. 12, the same day Dane County certified the election. If the clerk’s office had reported the missing votes to the county within a few days, the county election board could have petitioned the Wisconsin Elections Commission to amend its results to include those ballots. And in </span><a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/investigation-of-voter-registration-fraud-in-lancaster-county-moved-to-pa-ags-office/article_f85dba60-d833-11ef-a88e-d3191ad3440d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state attorney general’s office has taken over the investigation  of alleged fraudulent voter registration applications submitted in several counties ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The counties include Berks, Lancaster and York. The attorney general’s office informed the Lancaster County district attorney’s office earlier this month that the commonwealth would take the lead on the multi-county investigation, according to a news release from District Attorney Heather Adams on Jan. 21. Lancaster County detectives reviewed 1,203 applications received by the elections office. Of those, 367 were verified as accurate, 383 were found to “contain fraud” and 453 were unable to be verified and are therefore suspected to be fraudulent, according to Adams’ office.</span></p>

Noting that registering voters online was pioneered by the state of Arizona in 2002, Ms. Fawkes said that the practice has grown significantly in the years since. The USVI joined 43 states, the District of Columbia and Guam in offering online voter registration. Fawkes said she hopes the introduction of online voter registration not only increases registration numbers, but also turnout. On the portal, resident citizens will be able to register as a new voter, update their registration information, cancel their registration, or request an absentee ballot for an upcoming election, all from the comfort of their home, office, or the beach, if they choose. Explainer videos in English and Spanish for each process will be available on the ESVI website to guide users along. Any issues encountered during the online registration process will be forwarded to ESVI officials, who will then contact the individuals to assist them in resolving any problems they may encounter. Once the registration information has been submitted, it will be verified by ESVI staff and in two to five business days, the individual&#8217;s voter registration status will have been updated. For a new voter, once their registration has been approved, they will have to make a trip to the ESVI offices should they wish to receive a voter identification card. However, not even that is strictly necessary, as Virgin Islanders are able to use any form of government-issued identification to vote. “We&#8217;re elated that we&#8217;re able to implement this process,” Fawkes said.</span></p>

After historically high youth voter turnout of over 50% in the 2020 presidential contest, CIRCLE’s early estimate is that 42% of youth (ages 18-29) voted in 2024. And after several cycles of overwhelming support for Democratic candidates, exit poll data suggests that young voters supported Vice President Harris over President Trump by just 4 percentage points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIRCLE’s initial analyses of those exit polls point to some explanations for those shifts—especially young people’s focus on the economy and a more conservative and Republican-leaning group of youth who cast ballots. But exit polls only give us data on youth who voted. To truly understand what happened with the youth vote in 2024, we need data on all young people that directly tackles why many youth didn’t vote and what drove or prevented participation beyond a single issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/2024-poll-barriers-issues-economy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIRCLE Post-2024 Election Poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives comprehensive data from a nationally representative survey of young people ages 18-34. In this initial analysis from our poll, we answer key questions about what motivated youth to vote and why others stayed home, their diverse issue priorities, and whether campaigns and institutions did enough to reach young voters this past cycle.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Barriers: Some youth were ignored by campaigns or lacked support to vote, but 44% of young nonvoters were disinterested or disliked the candidates.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Informed and Qualified: 3 out of 4 youth saw at least some information about registering to vote and felt well-qualified to cast a ballot.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politically Homeless: Less than 1 in 4 youth, and just 13% of those who didn&#8217;t vote, feel like they belong to a group that expresses itself politically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Issues Are Key: Nearly half of youth who voted said one of their top motivations was the desire to have an impact on the issues they care about.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diverse Priorities: The cost of living/Inflation was far and away youth&#8217;s top issue, but they were also concerned with healthcare, abortion, climate and immigration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Struggling Financially: More than 40% of youth, and over 60% of young nonvoters, sometimes or often find it difficult to meet basic needs.</span></li>

These quarterly surveys allow us to identify spikes or shifts in hostility, monitor important trends in threats and harassment, and contextualize these trends in the larger political environment. In each survey round, local elected officials are asked about their personal experiences with hostility, their concerns about hostility, and their willingness to engage in certain political activities – like running for re-election or attending events – in the future. The survey captures not only the presence but also the intensity of concerns, allowing us to assess the impact of even low levels of worry on democratic processes. </span><a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/experience-hostility-increases-worry-among-local-officials-negatively-impacting-willingness-engage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks at over 4,000 survey responses from the last two years to explore both the contributors to, and effects of, worries about hostility. It additionally investigates whether, and to what degree, demographic factors and personal experiences with hostility are connected to the severity of worries about hostility, as well as their links to willingness to engage in political behaviors such as running for re-election or working on controversial topics.</span></p>

The now-rescinded order covered longstanding federal agencies&#8217; voter registration efforts that are authorized under federal laws — including the State and Defense Departments helping eligible military members and other U.S. citizens living abroad vote. Biden&#8217;s order led to new voter registration guides, mailers, updated websites and programs such as Veteran Affairs facilities in Kentucky and Michigan distributing and helping eligible voters fill out registration forms. According to NPR, the move comes after Republican officials ramped up efforts to turn the 2021 order into a partisan flash point ahead of the 2024 election.</span></p>

The bill&#8217;s sponsor, Senate President Warren Peterson, told members of the committee that early mail-in ballots dropped off in person would no longer be accepted on Election Day. Petersen’s proposal also replaces emergency voting on the weekend before Election Day with regular early voting. Anyone turning in a mail-in ballot at a voting site would have to show ID and be checked against the voter rolls under the terms of the bill, which would eliminate the need for election officials to check signatures of those mail-in ballots turned in in-person. Mailed-in ballots would still be accepted until 7 p.m. on election night. The bill passed the committee on a party line vote “For your early ballot there is a cut off of 7pm the Friday before the election, this allows all counties to have on site tabulating from the day that the election starts up until election day,” Petersen said. Gabriela Cazares-Kelly, Pima County Recorder, told Arizona Public Media the bill would disproportionately impact voters in rural and tribal communities. “Especially for household members who are returning on behalf of another in rural areas,” Cazares-Kelly said. While Petersen’s bill includes provisions to add voting locations, Cazares-Kelly noted that rural and tribal areas often only have one voting center in, limiting the impact of the proposal. She also raised concerns about safety, pointing out that Pima County was one of several jurisdictions that received bomb threats during the last</span></p>

State Rep. Jennifer Bacon, D-Denver, the assistant House majority leader, has introduced the </span><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/denver7-news-kmgh-563649/3764492551745-lawmakers-introduce-the-colorado-voting-rights-act-to-protect-voting-access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , along with State Rep. Junie Joseph, D-Boulder, and State Sen. Julie Gonzales, D-Denver. “This bill is our commitment to Coloradans,” said Bacon. “It is our commitment to the sanctity of voting and is our commitment to accountability. All people should be able to engage freely without worrying that they&#8217;d either be turned away or that their vote would be suppressed, or a community&#8217;s vote would be diluted.” Bacon said the bill will enshrine protections of the federal Voting Right Act into Colorado law and build upon those protections to ensure access to voting at the state and local levels.</span></p>

Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford introduced a bill last week that would require residents to present </span><a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/connecticut-lawmaker-introduces-bill-requiring-voters-to-show-valid-photo-id-craig-fishbein-wallingford-middlefield-voting-rights-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valid photo identification to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fishbein, submitted H.B. No. 5157 to the Connecticut House of Representatives, which referred it to the Joint Committee on Government Administration and Elections. The required photo identification would need to have the voter’s name and address, according to the bill. In a statement, state Fishbein said a right to vote should have the “same level of protection” as processes like boarding a plane or buying alcohol. “It only makes sense &#8211; to me at least. You can&#8217;t rent a car, stay at a hotel, buy alcohol, or board an airplane without photo identification,” he noted. “Those rules and laws are there to ensure the provider that the person is who they say they are. The right to vote should be afforded (at least) that same level of protection.” Current Connecticut law requires voters to tell poll workers their name and address.</span></p>

Telo Taitague, said she plans to introduce a bill to </span><a href="https://www.guampdn.com/news/taitague-plans-bill-to-end-motor-voter-registration/article_7c95bff8-d7b2-11ef-a2be-afc531a2f3e5.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discontinue the voter registration policy known as “motor voters.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Taitague said “while the intentions behind Public Law 33-34 are understandable, the law has unfortunately proven to be both an inefficient process and an unnecessary burden on our government resources.” The motor voter registration law was passed in 2015 and implemented in 2019 and allows individuals to register to vote at the same time they are registering their vehicles at the Department of Revenue and Taxation’s motor vehicle division. During a Jan. 9 Guam Election Commission meeting, commissioners discussed that while motor voter registration has led to a record number of registered voters, it has also resulted in an all-time low voter turnout. Taitague said her bill will help “to end these inefficiencies and stop the financial pressures this law has inadvertently placed on the (GEC).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5487" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IL-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Illinois:</strong> State Senator Chapin Rose (R-Mahomet) is introducing a new bill that he says will help make voting smoother. It’ll require voters to start using a </span><a href="https://www.wcia.com/illinois-capitol-news/il-state-senator-rose-introduces-voter-id-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photo ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to cast a ballot. The 51st district lawmaker brought up Senate Bill 181 on Friday and is now hoping to get it passed. The full document is 87 pages long. Senator Rose said it’ll simplify the process. Rose wants to make it mandatory for voters in the state to bring the IDs to the polls. Right now, IDs are not required to cast a ballot unless you are also registering to vote at that time. But, Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons isn’t a fan of the idea. “I am absolutely opposed to what he’s putting forward. We already have photo ID requirements for registration and same day registration as the bill also says that you can’t register to vote on the same day,” Ammons said. Ammons said requiring IDs at the polls could lead to voter suppression. Rose said making the change will help cut back on slip ups and hopefully get people in and out faster. The bill also aims to make ballot harvesting a crime and eliminate the use of drop boxes for ballot submissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3684" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Kansas:</strong> Secretary of State Scott Schwab (R) urged the Legislature to i</span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/01/17/kansas-election-official-asks-for-state-law-to-deter-threats-against-poll-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ncrease the penalty for threatening a poll worker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, impose a ban on political parties nominating candidates without an individual’s consent and broaden state authority to compel counties to securely deploy ballot drop boxes. Schwab encouraged lawmakers to carefully craft bills amending the way people participated in elections to avoid lawsuits challenging constitutionality of reforms. He reminded legislators use of one or two ill-chosen words could swing a case against the state and lead to costly awards of attorney fees to plaintiffs. Schwab said complaints about the accuracy of Kansas elections and the tabulation of votes was misplaced, because the three elections conducted in Kansas last year went smoothly. There was a poorly attended presidential preference primary in March, which cost nearly $3 million, as well as the regular August primary and November general elections. The primary had the lowest turnout of this century, while the general election had record-high participation. “Election administration is a complex process governed by a framework of federal and state laws designed to ensure the integrity and security of Kansas elections,” Schwab said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill proposed in the House seeks to </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/01/22/kansas-house-bill-would-use-drivers-license-records-to-look-for-voters-who-are-not-citizens/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove people who are not U.S. citizens from the state’s voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through temporary driver’s license records, invoking concern for potential disenfranchisement of Kansas voters. The Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, which supports</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/hb2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has received a temporary driver’s license list about six times in the past 15 years, Election Director Brian Caskey said. About 38,000 people in Kansas have active temporary drivers licenses as of December. Of the state’s more than 2 million voters, state officials found 202 potential matches when comparing a temporary driver’s license list and the voter rolls. About 120 of those were false positives, and 85 warranted additional investigation. About 21 of the 85 have a voting history attached to them and would require even further investigation to determine citizenship status. Clay Barker, general counsel to the secretary of state’s office, said nothing prevents officials from investigating a case of a potential voter who is not a U.S. citizen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are once again considering ending the </span><a href="https://www.kake.com/home/kansas-lawmakers-renew-push-to-end-advance-ballot-grace-period/article_9ce31a6e-d918-11ef-a194-abd43517a8a6.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grace period</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for returning advanced ballots in elections. That&#8217;s the three days after Election Day when your local election office continues counting arriving mail-in ballots, as long as they were postmarked on Election Day or before. The Secretary of State&#8217;s office was neutral on the idea, saying it&#8217;s purely a policy decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6131" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MS-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Mississippi:</strong> Rep. Zakiya Summers (D-Jackson) introduced House Bill 753 to </span><a href="https://www.supertalk.fm/legislation-introduced-to-allow-online-voter-registration-in-mississippi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow first-time voters to register via an online platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The process would only apply to qualified Mississippians possessing valid state identification. Under Summers’ proposal, the Mississippi Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections, would be tasked with collaborating with the Department of Public Safety to create and manage an online portal to process applications from prospective voters seeking to make an inaugural appearance at the ballot box. There is also an educational component to the bill. Each Mississippi county would be required to provide all public schools with instructions for submitting an online voter application as well as mail-in applications. This would be done in both semesters of the academic calendar, especially before notable primary and general elections. Each public school in Mississippi would have to welcome the county registrar or their deputy to register persons who are eligible to vote and to provide voter education. The goal is to help get young people out to vote as soon as they turn 18 or have the first opportunity to exercise their constitutional right. Per the bill, online applications must be submitted at least 30 days before an election, unless the 30th day falls on a Sunday or legal holiday. Under those circumstances, the applicant would have one extra business day to fill out the online document. Once an application is submitted, county registrars would be required to review it and determine whether or not to accept the document. If an application is given the green light, the county registrar would mail a written letter notifying the applicant that he or she is eligible to vote, along with county and polling precinct information. That letter would operate as the individual’s legal voter registration card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Elections Committee Chairman Jeremy England, (R- Vancleave), said he intends to move a bill through the Senate that establishes </span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/01/20/mississippi-legislature-poised-to-debate-early-voting-bills-this-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 days of no-excuse early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before Election Day. To cast an early ballot, the measure requires people to vote in person at their local circuit clerk’s office and present a form of photo ID. Mississippi currently allows in-person absentee voting before elections, but voters must meet criteria, such as being over 65 or disabled, or provide one of a handful of valid “excuses,” such as being out of town for work on election day and follow a long list of rules and procedures. England pushed the legislation last year, where it passed the Senate 44-8. It died, however, in a House committee without any debate or a vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Zakiya Summers, D-Jackson, introduced House Bill 1419 this week. The bill serves to </span><a href="https://www.supertalk.fm/bill-introduced-to-establish-deadline-for-polling-precinct-relocation-in-mississippi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent polling precincts statewide from being altered within 60 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a primary, general, runoff, or special election. This comes after more than 50 voting locations were changed across Mississippi’s 82 counties ahead of last November’s general election. One exception to HB 1419 is that a polling location can be changed in that 60-day window if exigent circumstances exist. In that event, the local municipality or county would be required by law to justify its decision, citing specific reasons for the swap in venue. Afterward, public notice of the precinct relocation would have to be submitted at the local city hall, courthouse, registrar’s office, and the previous polling location for three weeks or weekly for the last three weeks before the election. The bill currently sits in the House Apportionment and Elections Committee. If approved as-is, the new rules would go into effect on July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3756" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MontanaCapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Montana:</strong> House Bill 187 would remove the </span><a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2025/01/22/committee-considers-repealing-continuous-count-ballot-tabulation-provision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuous tabulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requirement for future elections. Rep. Bob Carter, D-Missoula, told the committee that especially when looking at the largest counties, the provision created conditions where there is a higher likelihood for errors in the election process.  “It’s inviting problems to happen,” Carter said. “I submit to you, this actually erodes voter confidence to do things this way.” The 2023 Legislature passed the law requiring continuous tabulation in the name of restoring voter trust, according to former Rep. Lyn Hellegaard, who carried the bill.  At the time, many county clerk and recorders, and election administrators testified against the change, saying it would place additional burdens on their departments and workers — concerns that played out last November. Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman said it was difficult to recruit workers willing to pull the overnight shifts, even with an increased wage, and tired staff made small errors.  While none of the errors impacted the validity of the results, Seaman said it was easy to see how bigger errors happen.  “As people get tired, simple tasks can become more complicated, and it maximizes the opportunity to make large mistakes that could impact the validity of the election,” he said.  Instead, he said, allowing staff to go home late at night, rest up, and return to work is a better option.</span></p>

The House State Affairs committee is advancing the proposal 7 &#8211; 6. It requires individuals to live in South Dakota for 30 consecutive days to be able to register to vote. The legislation targets voters who are technically state residents, but may live elsewhere or in an RV. Tens of thousands are legal South Dakota residents through mail forwarding services. All it takes to become a state resident is a physical address and an overnight stay in the state. While the service is helpful for permanent travelers—critics say many also use it to take advantage of the state’s lack of income tax. Some backers of Carley&#8217;s bill say, “not true citizens” of South Dakota are voting in local elections. Carley said he wants to make sure local voters’ wishes aren’t diluted by folks registered in South Dakota who might live elsewhere.The Secretary of State&#8217;s office is bringing</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25680"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the residency and voter registration issue.</span></p>

It starts with</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/SB00077I.pdf#navpanes=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 77</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Hall says they are working to amend the bill to make all ballots paper and hand-marked. “Your hand-marked paper ballot is the foundation going forward,” said Hall. Gregg County Elections Administrator Jennifer Briggs said it’s not that simple. “You’re easily looking at another million dollars for what we have to replace,” said Briggs on their election equipment, which was purchased in 2019. Hall estimates that the changes would first be seen in the 2027 elections if passed. As written the law would take effect on September 1 of this year. The bill would also eliminate countywide voting, returning to a precinct-based system. The law would ban electronic polling lists, essential for countywide voting, says Briggs. “They could literally vote at every location, you would have no way to know if they did it on the same day, so by getting rid of electronic poll votes it gets rid of countywide voting,” said Briggs.</span></p>

Rex Shipp R-Cedar City. “You have to opt-in to get a mail ballot, is the plan,” he said. “Once you’ve opted in, you’d continue to get a mail ballot unless you miss a general election. If you miss a general election, then you have to opt back in.” According to Shipp, the bill will prevent problems with ballots in southern Utah being sent out of state to be stamped and sorted. Shipp says another reason for the bill is inaccurate voter rolls. “Our voter rolls seem to be somewhat of an issue these days not being cleaned up,” Shipp said. “People (are) getting multiple ballots (for) people that may have moved out of their household. Or, even people that are moving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Representative Ryan Wilcox, (R – North Ogden) confirmed that he is running a bill to </span><a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/bill-targets-lt-governors-election-oversight-with-appointed-executive-director-of-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create an executive director of elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who would take oversight away from the Lt. Governor’s office. “I just want to do whatever I can to quash this idea that it’s…Anything personal with the lieutenant governor, the current one or the former one, or anybody else.” Wilcox said. “That’s not it at all. Honestly, I, I think it makes more sense for (the position) to be as independent as possible rather than tied to any campaign.” In the latest</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/asp/billsintro/RepResults.asp?Listbox3=WILCORD"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet-to-be-released version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of his bill, Wilcox says the Executive Director would be hired by five of Utah’s county clerks. That panel of clerks would be appointed collectively by the governor, senate president, house speaker, state treasurer, and state auditor. “(County clerks) would know far better than other elected officials who don’t study elections, who don’t do those things when they’re hiring an executive director for election,” Wilcox said. “If there’s any malfeasance, if there is anything shady, if we see anything like we saw in other states, then they’re going to be able to see it sooner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Government Operations Committee on Jan. 22 — the second day of the Legislature’s 45-day session — unanimously voted to approve</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0069.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB69</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bill sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, that would in some circumstances criminalize accessing and disclosing information about how or when an individual voter returns their ballot.  The legislation comes after some elected officials — including Sen. Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, who was recently elected to the Senate’s new Republican leadership team as majority assistant whip — have expressed concerns about Utah County Clerk Aaron Davidson tracking information on how at least two politicians returned their ballots, and criticizing them for not paying postage. According to Utah News Dispatch, Davidson and McKell have clashed over Davidson’s earlier decision that Utah County would no longer automatically pay return postage for by-mail ballots, and Davidson instead encouraged voters to pay the $0.73 for their stamps. If they didn’t, the U.S. Postal Service would still deliver the ballot, but charge the county. An earlier version of the bill was already endorsed in November by the Government Operations Interim Committee, when Gricius said the intention of the bill is to make clear to clerks “you cannot do a looky-loo at someone’s information for fun.”</span></p>

The resolution to restore voting rights to people who complete felony sentences passed the Senate on party-line votes. The House version passed with bipartisanship support.  In both chambers, Republicans sought failed floor amendments to require people to have completed restitution payments they may owe in addition to having already completed their prison sentences before their rights can be restored. Another amendment sought to restrict people with violent offenses from automatic restoration and require them instead to individually petition the governor for a case-by-case assessment.  That process is what is currently underway for all people with felony convictions in Virginia, but petitioners have said they have little criteria as to what earns a “yes” from Gov. Glenn Youngkin. His restoration numbers have been lower than previous governors from both parties who had worked to streamline the process. And a mass generic rejection email with no explanation or blind carbon copy feature sent to hundreds of formerly incarcerated people last fall prompted many of them to wonder if Youngkin’s individualized process was happening at all.</span></p>

Defeated proposals included stricter photo ID requirements, a shorter early voting period, and tighter voter registration verification rules. Despite the partisan divide, the committee unanimously approved a bipartisan bill to shorten the voter registration closure period, signaling rare cooperation in an otherwise contentious debate over election laws. By an 8-7 party-line vote, the panel killed a Republican proposal to reinstate stricter photo ID requirements for voters.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB1070"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1070</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, would have required voters to present a photo ID at the polls, ending the current option to sign a statement affirming identity under penalty of perjury. Peake defended the measure, saying photo ID laws previously worked well in Virginia and enjoyed broad public support. “Eighty percent of the population supports photo ID, and I’m just trying to help bring the commonwealth into agreement with that 80%,” he said. By another 8-7 party-line vote, the committee defeated another Peake proposal to reduce the early voting period for primary elections from 45 days to 14 days.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB1072"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 1072</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, merged with an</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB856"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identical bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Timmy French, R-Shenandoah, aimed to streamline election operations and reduce costs associated with maintaining lengthy early voting periods, according to Peake. The panel further voted to defeat</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB1073"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 1073</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another Peake proposal which proposed verifying voter registration information — such as Social Security numbers — against federal or state databases before finalizing registration. Peake argued the bill would bolster election security and prevent fraud. The panel approved a bill that would allow localities to use ranked choice voting for local offices, such as mayoral and school board elections.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB1009"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 1009</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen.

Proponents said nearly a million eligible voters in Washington are not registered. Abigail Leong, communications manager for the Washington Voting Justice Coalition, testified this week in support of the measure. She said the unregistered are typically new citizens, low-income, or people with convictions who are less likely to get enhanced driver&#8217;s licenses, where they would be automatically registered. Leong argued the bill would also save the state time and money. One opponent of the bill testified the legislation would make the state&#8217;s elections less secure. The bill is scheduled for an executive session in the Senate Committee on State Government, Tribal Affairs and Elections.</span></p>

The committee was considering </span><a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0131"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 131</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, legislation that would ban the use of ballot drop boxes in Wyoming. The bill advanced on an 8-1 vote with only state Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, voting against it. During his testimony before the committee Wednesday, Gray made it clear he doesn’t believe drop boxes are allowed under Wyoming law, which he has consistently maintained. Yin then asked Gray if he was accusing Wyoming county clerks who allow drop boxes of breaking the law. During the 2024 election, seven counties offered ballot drop boxes. In 2022, nine counties provided them. It’s the clerks’ interpretation that each county can decide if it wants to offer the boxes. Gray argues that flies in the face of having a uniform election code statewide overseen by him and other secretaries of state. A number of clerks testified that most of their constituents support use of the boxes, citing turnout numbers showing that hundreds, and even thousands, of people used them in the most recent elections.</span></p>

Francisco was sentenced on two counts of false claims of citizenship in connection with voting, one count of false statements in an application for a United States passport, five counts of use of a United States passport obtained by false statements, and one count of aggravated identity theft. According to the plea agreement, Francisco began claiming the identity of a U.S. Citizen in 2011. Francisco used her identity to obtain a U.S. passport that same year. Documents show Francisco used a false identity to travel to and from her home country of Guatemala in 2012, 2015, and 2018. She would use the identity to renew her passport in 2022, to travel back to Guatemala. In addition, Francisco also illegally registered to vote in Alabama under her false identity and voted in both the 2016 and 2020 primary and general elections. “This sentence sends a clear message that any attempts by non-U.S. citizens to vote in the Northern District of Alabama are unacceptable and will result in serious consequences,” said U.S. Attorney Prim Escalona of the Northern District of Alabama.</span></p>

Following President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, Randy Corporan, an attorney who hosts a conservative radio show, interviewed Joseph Oltmann, a Castle Rock-based businessman who claimed he heard a man identified as “Eric from Dominion” say on an antifa conference call that he was going to make sure Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. Oltmann concluded that the Dominion employee was a man named Eric Coomer, director of product strategy and security at Dominion Voting Systems in Denver. Colorado Court of Appeals Judge Eric Kuhn wrote in the</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eric-coomer-v-salem-media-appeals-ruling.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 74-page opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Coomer was reasonably likely to succeed on his claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation. Corporan says his statements were not defamatory because he was merely expressing an opinion about the 2020 presidential election, but the panel disagreed. “This argument overlooks Coomer’s allegations in his complaint and the later evidence he supplied in connection with the special motion to dismiss. Coomer’s complaint asserts that Corporon expressed more than an opinion,” Kuhn wrote. “Instead, he alleges that Corporon endorsed Oltmann’s factual statements and asserted that they were true during his radio show.” Kuhn noted that a reasonable jury could find that Corporan presented Oltmann as a subject matter expert on his radio show who was exposing a sinister plot about election interference. “We conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that a jury could find that Corporon bolstered Oltmann’s credibility and endorsed Oltmann’s statements that Coomer had in fact attended an antifa conference call, said in that call that he had made sure that then-President Trump was not going to win the election, and had taken steps to undermine the election results,” Kuhn wrote.</span></p>

Since Reconstruction began in 1865, the DOJ&#8217;s Civil Rights Division says that Houston County has only had one Black county commissioner. That is despite 31% of the county being Black as of the 2020 Census.  However, the lawsuit argues that is a structural problem. &#8220;The current method of election the Houston County Board of Commissioners dilutes the voting strength of Black citizens,&#8221; the lawsuit said. The lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday, pushes for a judge to order the county to move to geographical political districts.  Currently, Houston County elects its county commission through at-large — or countywide — elections. But under that system, the DOJ argues that white voters overpower Black voters. The product, they argue, is a county commission that is unrepresentative of the diverse Houston County community. The DOJ argues that geographic districts would fix that. The lawsuit asks a judge to find the county&#8217;s at-large election scheme in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, that provision bans voting practices and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race.</span></p>

Brueggemann granted a motion from county clerk Justin Crigler and his attorney Jeff Mando to stop some evidence discovery in the challenge which was brought by former Union City Commissioner Doug Bine. The judgment came at a hearing Jan. 21. Specifically, Crigler and his team had requested the court prevent depositions of both Republican and Democrat poll workers at Union Precincts 1 and 4, where voters reported wrongful ballot distributions on Election Day. The motion to quash also requested the court prevent the depositions of Crigler himself and Elections Supervisor Stacy Adkins. Both sides must now simultaneously submit arguments to the court by Monday, Jan. 27, laying out their proposed remedy for solving the election problems. There has been confusion about the court’s power in this case, as the election irregularities arose not out of bribery, violence or intimidation, for which there is already established case law and statute, but due to mistakes. Megerle confirmed with LINK nky that he and Bine plan to ask for a new city-wide election.</span></p>

That case was the first real test of a fringe-turned-mainstream legal concept called “independent legislature theory,” which holds that the U.S. Constitution gives nearly unilateral authority to state legislatures to set their own election qualifications for federal elections. The Montana Democratic Party successfully challenged the two bills that the Montana Supreme Court struck down in a 5-to-2 split decision. Those were House Bill 176, which eliminated same-day voter registration, and House Bill 530, which prohibited paid absentee ballot collection. The State of Montana also argued that by taking the case, the U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to review the boundaries of state supreme courts and a state legislature’s power to make election law.</span></p>

Griffin filed a request directly with the state Supreme Court in December, asking it to step in and keep the state board of elections from certifying his race and instruct it to remove over 60,000 ballots he is disputing. The North Carolina associate justice race is the only statewide race in the United States that is still uncertified over two months after the election.  The North Carolina Supreme Court</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/north-carolina-supreme-court-may-ultimately-decide-its-own-next-justice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> halted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the certification of his election and proposed a rapid case schedule. It dismissed a request to schedule a hearing in the case Wednesday, rendering it invalid, as a lower court will now weigh Griffin’s arguments.  The court also</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/jefferson-ncsc-prohibition-order.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> left</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a stay on the election certification process in place until appeals have been exhausted, which could signal that it may be many months until the final results of the election are finalized. Until it is, Associate Justice Allison Riggs — Griffin’s opponent — will continue serving in her seat.  “A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary writ,” Republican Associate Justice Trey Allen</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/jefferson-ncsc-prohibition-order.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the order. “The writ ‘does not lie for grievances which may be redressed, in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, [or] by appeal &#8230; it is to be used, like all such, with great caution.’” Chief Justice Paul Martin Newby concurred and was joined by his Republican colleagues Associate Justice Philip Berger Jr. and Associate Justice Tamara Barringer.  “I write separately to emphasize that this case is not about deciding the outcome of an election,” Newby wrote. “It is about preserving the public’s trust and confidence in our elections through the rule of law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Pennsylvania:</strong> The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said Jan. 17 that</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2025/01/17/baxter-philadelphia-undated-misdated-mail-ballot-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will take up a case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Baxter v. Philadelphia, on whether requiring voters to date mail ballot envelopes violates the state constitution. Pennsylvania’s 2019 no-excuse mail voting law, Act 77, says mail voters must sign and date their ballot return envelope for their vote to be counted. Thousands of voters have had their ballots rejected in every election because the envelopes lacked a proper date. The validity of the dating requirement has been disputed for years, but the issue in the current case is whether it violates the “free and equal” election clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which bars any interference with “the free exercise of the right of suffrage.” Voting rights advocates argue that because election officials do not use the handwritten date to determine a ballot’s eligibility, it represents an unnecessary — and unconstitutional — burden that interferes with voting. The plaintiffs are Brian Baxter and Susan Kinniry, two Philadelphia voters whose mail ballots in September 2024 special elections were rejected for lacking a date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-turns-away-pennsylvania-mail-in-ballot-dispute-2025-01-21/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to hear a bid by civil and voting rights groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end Pennsylvania&#8217;s mandate that mail-in ballots bear a handwritten date on the outer envelope, a requirement they contend is unnecessary and has resulted in needless disqualification of legitimate ballots. The justices turned away an appeal by the plaintiffs of a lower court&#8217;s ruling that upheld the requirement and rejected the argument that it violated a provision in federal law that bars discarding ballots due to paperwork errors that are &#8220;not material&#8221; in determining whether a person is qualified to vote. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2024 decided that the date requirement &#8220;serves little apparent purpose&#8221; as it is not used by officials to determine whether it was received on time. Nevertheless, it remains valid because the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies only to voter registration rules when a state is determining who is qualified to vote, not &#8220;how a qualified voter must cast his ballot for it to be counted,&#8221; the 3rd Circuit ruled.</span></p>

The decision comes after members of the town’s Municipal Election Commission — Kenneth McIver, Caroline Gore, and Derrick Stevens — appealed a Nov. 1 order by an Horry County judge that reversed a decision by the panel that had kept Taylor from being officially seated on council, even though the election results had been certified. In his ruling, Horry County Circuit Judge William Seals said Taylor should be seated “immediately” and called an appeal by candidate Shawn Swinson “untimely.” The Nov. 1 ruling came after Taylor appealed a 2-1 vote by the election commission on Oct. 17 that upheld a protest by Swinson, despite him acknowledging that he had not officially challenged the results within 48 hours of the polls closing. Instead, his protest came 149 days after the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5226" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tennessee-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Tennessee:</strong> Fayette County commissioners violated the Voting Rights Act with their adoption of </span><a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/01/16/lawsuit-fayette-co-diluted-black-voting-power-violated-voting-rights-act-in-2021-redistricting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2021 redistricting plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that stripped Black voters of equal opportunity, the U.S. Justice Department claims in a lawsuit. “The County Commission deliberately rejected multiple districting plans that would have combined Black communities in districts that would allow Black voters to elect representatives of their choice,” a</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-voting-rights-suit-against-fayette-county-tennessee"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the department states. In doing so, the commission rejected the “explicit advice” of both its own redistricting committee and outside redistricting counsel, which had both endorsed plans that included districts with majority Black voting age populations and warned that choosing a plan without such districts would expose the county to lawsuits. The commission instead adopted a plan with no majority-minority districts that was not one of the final two maps recommended by the redistricting committee, voting 10-8 with one abstention. A month later, the commission again rejected advice that their chosen plan would “not hold up under litigation” and adopted a modified version of the map — still without any majority-minority districts — in a 12-6 vote with one abstention. The lawsuit further alleges that the district plan adopted in 2021 built off of a 2011 redistricting cycle in which the county commission also “successfully diminished Black political power.” In 2010, four Black officials held seats on the commission. That dropped to one by 2018, then to zero after the commission adopted the plan with no majority-Black districts in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Jan. 17 rejected an attempt by a conservative activist to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-voting-records-1e1d4ce4b7d60582cb36a7298417168b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain guardianship records in an effort to find ineligible voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the case could return. The court did not rule on the merits of the case, instead saying in its 5-2 decision that a lower appeals court did not follow proper procedure when it issued a ruling saying the records should be released. The justices said the District II appeals court, based in Waukesha, was wrong to overturn a Walworth County Circuit Court ruling denying access to the records. In a nearly identical lawsuit, the District IV appeals court, based in Madison, had denied access to the records saying they were not subject to disclosure under the state public records law. Justice Janet Protasiewicz, writing for the majority, said that the District II appeals court could have sent the case to the Supreme Court, explaining why the other appeals court ruling was incorrect. If it follows the proper procedure for doing that, the case could end up right back before the Supreme Court again. In the meantime, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the appeals court for further action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two women suing the Wisconsin Elections Commission have</span><a href="https://www.wbay.com/2025/01/20/local-women-refile-lawsuit-over-myvote-online-portal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amended their lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a federal court ruled that they can’t sue a state agency. Their lawsuit filed in federal court in Green Bay now names elections commission administrator Meagan Wolfe as the defendant. Jeanette Merten, an elections clerk for the Town of Oshkosh, and Brown County voter Dawn McCole are seeking an injunction barring the use of the MyVote.wi.gov online voter portal until cybersecurity measures are added. They say anyone can request a ballot to be mailed anywhere by putting in someone’s name and date of birth. The plaintiffs contend “inadequate cybersecurity measures&#8230; jeopardize the integrity of the electoral process and the personal data of Wisconsin voters.” The initial lawsuit was filed two weeks before the presidential election. The State responded to that lawsuit arguing there are criminal laws to protect against election fraud and it has prosecuted people for it.</span></p>

Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. This webinar will feature Amy Gardner, The Washington Post, Pamela Karlan, Stanford Law School, and Stephen Richer, Recorder of Maricopa County, Arizona (until Jan.1, 2025). Moderated by Richard L. Hasen (Director, Safeguarding Democracy Project). <strong>When:</strong> Jan. 28, 2025, 3:15pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

The event will include workshops, committee meetings and awards luncheon. <strong>When:</strong> January 29-February 1, 2025. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.securingamericanelections.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking Back &amp; Looking Ahead at Election Resiliency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In the face of unprecedented challenges, counties and local election offices across the nation have taken measures to safeguard our election systems and ran an excellent 2024 general election – in many cases, without the resources required to do so. From foreign interference and cybersecurity attacks, to natural disasters, to staffing and equipment shortages, election offices worked hard to provide secure, trustworthy and accessible voting experiences despite growing challenges that far exceed what any single locality or state can manage alone. Critical gaps were filled this election cycle. County governments leveraged their own emergency funding to get to the finish line, veterans extended their public service by stepping up as poll workers, and election administrators worked around the clock to ensure timely and accurate certification. But their offices will need more support moving forward to inoculate against future vulnerabilities. With this election now behind us, this panel discussion brings together national security experts, election administration specialists, veteran leaders, and civic officials from across the country to examine the financial and operational needs of our election infrastructure as we look to the future. Attendees will gain insights into the ongoing efforts to fortify our election systems, and the immediate needs that local election officials already face as they prepare for the next election. Speakers Include: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC Commissioner Don Palmer; Ohio Association of Election Officials Director Aaron Ockerman; We the Veterans Executive Director Ellen Gustafson; Partnership for Large Elections Jurisdictions Director Carolina Lopez; and Authors of “A Republic if You Can Afford It”, Mary Jo McGowan and Martha Kropf. Moderated by CQ Roll Call White House Correspondent &amp; Editor-at-Large John Bennett. <strong>When:</strong> Jan 29, 7pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/events/winning-the-fight-for-voting-rights-state-voting-rights-acts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winning the Fight for Voting Rights: State Voting Rights Acts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The freedom to vote is under attack across the country, especially for Black voters and other voters of color. States can join the growing movement to protect the freedom to vote and remove barriers to the ballot box by enacting their own voting rights acts.
