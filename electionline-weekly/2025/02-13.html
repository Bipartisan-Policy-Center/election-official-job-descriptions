							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Building Operational Resilience</strong><br />
<em>Preparedness in the Face of Disasters</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Kevin O’Reilly and TJ Pyche</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than six weeks before Election Day 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, and proceeded to cause destruction throughout the Southeast, including in North Carolina, where more than 100 people died in what has been called a 1,000-year flood event. Hurricane Milton hit Florida again just ten days later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12478" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HurricaneWarning-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Helene and Milton destroyed some polling locations and left others unusable. They wiped out roads, took down telephone poles, knocked out electricity, and left communities without cellphone service. Elections officials were left to pick up the pieces at the same time that they dealt with their own personal loss. A recent report from the Election Infrastructure Initiative estimates that the affected counties face approximately </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6083502fc0f6531f14d6e929/t/6797d44a1c6d4a0b5fa8b997/1738003533648/EII+Emergency+Costs+Report+FINAL+%281%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$120 million in recovery and restoration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disasters like these don’t announce themselves, and they can cripple the electoral process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election offices in the Southeast and across the country already take steps to prepare for the worst. But as a professional community, it’s important to collectively do more. To start, here are practical steps election officials can take to strengthen readiness and resilience, safeguarding both their operations and the democratic process itself.</span></p>
<p><strong>Establish Emergency Management Relationships Early</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No election official should be scrambling to find a phone number for their local emergency management director on Election Day. Proactive <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12477" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FireThreat-300x180.png" alt="" width="300" height="180" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FireThreat-300x180.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FireThreat-1024x613.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FireThreat-768x460.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FireThreat.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />collaboration between election offices and emergency services can reduce delays and confusion when a crisis hits. Building trust and communication lines now – and asserting the importance of election officials’ spot at the table – ensures everyone knows their roles and responsibilities when emergencies unfold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take, for instance, North Carolina during Hurricane Helene. Many early voting sites were destroyed or inaccessible, but partnerships with emergency services allowed officials to mobilize alternate voting locations quickly. These relationships made it possible to ensure access to voting in the face of severe flooding​.</span></p>
<p><strong>Develop Flexible Contingency Plans</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparedness doesn’t mean just having a plan—it means having multiple, flexible plans. The most predictable aspect of any disaster is that it will <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12465" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Earthquake-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Earthquake-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Earthquake-768x775.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Earthquake.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />be unpredictable. No two scenarios will unfold exactly the same way. During Hurricane Milton, Florida’s Manatee County had to consolidate polling locations while simultaneously navigating getting correct information out to voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials who conduct regular scenario-based exercises and tabletop drills are better positioned to adapt under pressure. These exercises help teams identify blind spots and fine-tune their responses to everything from flooding to bomb threats​. Additionally, these activities provide election officials and other partners the opportunity to enhance election procedure documentation. </span></p>
<p><strong>Diversity and Secure Critical Resources</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Election offices need redundancy built into their operations. Natural disasters often result in power outages, road closures, and other logistical hurdles. Missouri election officials learned this in 2024 when Election Day storms flooded polling places and disrupted electricity. Generators kept some sites operational, but not every jurisdiction had access to emergency resources​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in robust backup systems and training staff on emergency protocols can reduce vulnerability during critical periods​. Understanding the <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12464" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DHSThreatLevel-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />resources needed to continue the voting process is essential. </span></p>
<p><strong>Communicate Early and Often</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In moments of crisis, clear communication with voters is vital, and election offices must act swiftly. During the 2024 election, some counties spent tens of thousands of dollars mailing polling place change notices after hurricanes and other events forced last-minute relocations​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s critical to have a rapid-response plan for voter communication. A network to communicate with, however, can’t be spun up immediately in the event of a crisis, so committing to multiple methods of communication to voters (emails, text messages, mail) when <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12479" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SnowWarning-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />there are no crises pays dividends. </span></p>
<p><strong>Champion Sustainable Funding</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving from disaster response to readiness and resilience requires sufficient, consistent investment. Emergency preparedness, staff training, infrastructure upgrades, and contingency resources all come with a price tag. Many election offices operate on razor-thin budgets, relying on emergency appropriations to cover the costs of disaster response​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing long-term funding—particularly federal funding that fills critical gaps in local government budgets—both ensures that election offices can invest in preparedness rather than scrambling for resources after a crisis hits. Reliable funding also enhances public trust by reducing delays and disruptions at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time to prepare is now. Start building your election resilience strategy today, and if you need support, don’t hesitate to reach out.</span></p>

According to Colorado Newsline, Kyle Giddings, deputy director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, said data he has collected from county clerks and the secretary of state’s office show that over 2,300 people voted from jail in 2024, compared to 231 voters during the 2022 midterm elections. That includes in-person voting and those who submitted a mail ballot. “Across the board, everyone really stepped up to the plate and got it done,” Giddings said. Jefferson County Clerk Amanda Gonzalez, who is running for secretary of state in 2026, said she’s proud of the turnout her county saw during this election. In the 2022 election, before Gonzalez was clerk, three voters cast a ballot from jail, and in 2024, the county had 348 people vote from jail. “I want to continue to see this program expand — I want to see every single eligible voter participate in our democracy — but I am really proud that we made a significant step forward toward that goal during this cycle,” Gonzalez said. Arapahoe County Elections Director Bill Mast said his county started holding in-person voting in jail in 2022, but the transition to meet the requirements of the new law went smoothly for 2024. He said they anticipated higher interest from incarcerated voters for the presidential election, so the clerk’s office held in-person voting over four days in the jail. “We value this program. We’ve prioritized it for a number of years. We were ecstatic to see this bill go through to kind of reinforce what we were already doing in collaboration with our nonprofit sector partners, and our sheriff’s office,” Mast said. “We are just happy that all of our voters have an opportunity to get their voices heard, their ballots cast.”</span></p>

Officials finalized the purchase of the three-story, 29,000-square-foot building on Friday for $115,000. Renovations are expected to cost between $500,000 and $1 million. The first floor of the building will be dedicated to election night activities, though it will not serve as daily office space.

Officials are working to devise a solution before early voting begins in less than 10 days. &#8220;We&#8217;re currently trying to find the most efficient, secure way to stage the equipment for the upcoming March primary election,&#8221; said Board of Elections Commissioner Ben Borgmeyer, who outlined two potential solutions: attempting to transport the equipment via the disabled elevators without human passengers, or dismantling the steel cages to manually carry the equipment down three flights of stairs. According to KSDK, officials said they could hire professional movers to haul the gear down stairwells and into trucks before deploying them to six public libraries before early voting begins on Tuesday, February 18. The rest of the equipment would go out into specific precincts and polling sites before the March 4 election date.  The situation has created an unprecedented logistical challenge for election officials, who must now balance equipment security with urgent time constraints. The Board of Elections has not yet released cost estimates for either proposed solution, though Borgmeyer said any cost incurred to hire movers would likely be covered by the building owners. </span></p>

Rep. Rachel Keshel (R-Tucson) filed House Bill 2440 more than a year after an Arizona grand jury indicted two Republican Cochise County supervisors on felony charges for attempting to delay certification of the county’s 2022 election results over unsubstantiated claims that vote tabulators had been compromised. “Obviously, in the bill it says in good faith – if they have some concerns about the election that they have the right to question, and not just feel forced to certify the election,” Keshel said. However, under Arizona law, a county board of supervisor’s duty to certify an election is considered a ministerial act, meaning they do not have discretion to delay certification or refuse to certify results altogether. Keshel’s bill passed the Arizona House’s Federalism, Military Affairs &amp; Elections Committee on a party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House passed a bill that would </span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-02-07/arizona-lawmakers-want-new-disclosures-on-confusing-election-mail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require non-governmental groups to include the words “Not from a government agency” on mailers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rep. John Gillette (R-Kingman), the bill’s sponsor, said some outside groups have designed their election-related mail to look like it comes from a county recorder and that confuses voters. “They are not from a government agency, and they are a lot of times misinformation, disinformation, but they mimic very closely,” Gillette said. The Arizona House of Representatives passed</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/bills/HB2006H.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2006</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Feb. 6 with mostly Republican support; four Democrats also voted for the bill. Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) vetoed a similar bill in 2023 over concerns that rules requiring specific font sizes for the required disclosure were too burdensome. “While I am generally supportive of disclosure in this context, I believe that the specific requirements around text size within this bill create an unreasonable burden on those who are trying to improve voting access in Arizona,” Hobbs wrote in a veto letter. Marson said the new bill doesn’t include that text size requirement. She said the bill also doesn’t include any punishment or enforcement mechanism — something the counties originally sought when they first asked lawmakers to consider the proposal five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5404" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AR-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arkansas:</strong> A bill filed in the state legislature would </span><a href="https://www.4029tv.com/article/arkansas-bill-seeks-to-change-noncitizens-drivers-licenses/63692965"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change how noncitizens’ driver’s licenses are issued and tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the intent of preventing them from voting. House Bill 14-22, known as the “Only Citizens Vote Act,” would introduce new voter registration checks to identify and remove any noncitizens improperly registered to vote. “So, right now, those individuals are not able to vote, and this is setting up a system,” said Jennifer Price, Washington County’s director of elections. “So, when they do receive a driver&#8217;s license because they are eligible to receive a driver&#8217;s license, their driver&#8217;s license will look different than driver&#8217;s licenses issued to U.S. citizens.” The bill would also require the state Department of Finance and Administration to send a list of noncitizens with Arkansas driver’s licenses to the secretary of state. “They will then take that list, compare it to the list of registered voters in the state,” Price said. “If they do find a name of an individual who&#8217;s on the list of registered voters, then they would notify the county clerk in that county, and then those individuals would be removed from the voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs advanced five of six bills that would alter Arkansas’ </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/02/12/senate-committee-advances-bills-regulating-arkansas-ballot-initiative-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citizen-led petition process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after more than three hours of debate this week. The Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs considered the legislation sponsored by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, who said his bills all had the goal of enhancing the integrity of Arkansas’ ballot initiative process.  “Each of these bills have been prepared working with the secretary of state’s office to assure that each bill safeguards the rights granted under the Constitution, while not infringing on the rights of citizens and their respective groups who want a safe, secure and integrity-driven process through which signatures can be gathered for an initiative.” The five bills advancing out of committee Tuesday: </span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB207&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 207</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require canvassers to disclose that petition fraud is a Class A misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 1 year in prison; </span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB208&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 208</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require canvassers to request a photo ID from potential signers; </span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB209&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 209</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would disqualify signatures collected by canvassers if the secretary of state finds “by a preponderance of evidence” that they violated state law collecting the signatures; </span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB210&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 210</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require potential signers to read the ballot title of a petition or have it read aloud to them in the presence of a canvasser. It would also make it a misdemeanor for a canvasser to accept a signature from people who have not read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them in the presence of a canvasser; and </span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB211&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 211</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require canvassers to file an affidavit with the secretary of state certifying they complied with the Arkansas Constitution and state laws related to canvassing, perjury, forgery and fraudulent practices in the procurement of petition signatures. Signatures submitted without the affidavit would not be counted. All five bills contain an emergency clause, and if approved by the Legislature, would go into effect immediately upon the governor’s signature.</span></p>

The 4-1 vote was made by Supervisors in closed session yesterday, February 12. It was announced after the Board returned from a discussion regarding the lawsuit. Supervisor Kevin Crye cast the only dissenting vote.  The newest lawsuit against the Elections Office was filed on February 3 by Shasta County activists Dan Ladd and Laura Hobbs. The two identify themselves in a piece of correspondence included in the lawsuit as the President and Vice President of the self-described Shasta Elections Task Force, a private citizen group whose members have engaged in election observation and protests. The Board did not share with the public a reason for suspending the actions of the Elections Commission until the lawsuit is resolved. But a public comment from Elections Commission Chair Ronnean Lund appeared to shed some light on the matter.  Lund said she was contacted last week by Deputy Shasta County CEO Stewart Buettell, who told her that he had been instructed not to schedule any Elections Commissions meetings until the Board could discuss the new lawsuit in closed session.  “I was informed by him,” Lund told the Board, that “he had been instructed to not (post notice of a scheduled Election Commission meeting) due to the fact that declarations that were completed by myself and another Commissioner concerning the November 2024 election were included as documentation in the lawsuit that was filed against the ROV.”</span></p>

Supporters of the bill,</span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HJ00047&amp;which_year=2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Joint Resolution 47</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, argued that pre-registration will increase voter turnout and civic engagement among young people, while opponents raised concerns about implementation challenges and potential confusion for new voters. Jess Zaccagnino, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut (ACLU-CT), testified in favor of the resolution, emphasizing the importance of early voter engagement. “Voting is a foundation of democracy, a right through which we can protect and preserve our other rights,” Zaccagnino wrote in her testimony. “This must include a targeted effort to increase voter turnout among groups with traditionally low participation, like young people.” However, concerns about implementation were raised by the Registrars of Voters Association of Connecticut (ROVAC). Sue W. Larsen, a South Windsor Registrar of Voters and chair of the ROVAC Legislative Committee, submitted testimony outlining potential challenges. “The concept of 16-year-olds registering to vote is not the issue here,” Larsen stated in her testimony. “It is the issue of implementation that has registrars concerned.” She additionally highlighted several logistical hurdles, including necessary software changes, integration with Department of Motor Vehicles registration systems, and maintaining accurate voter rolls. In order to amend the state Constitution, a resolution must be approved by at least three-fourths both the state House and Senate to be placed on the ballot in the next regular state election. A resolution approved by a majority of the membership of each house but less than three-fourths is referred to the General Assembly session held after the next regular state election, where it must be approved by majorities in both houses again before being placed on the ballot.</span></p>

Sally Turner (R-Lincoln) has reintroduced a bill to help </span><a href="https://www.wandtv.com/news/sen-sally-turner-refiles-bill-make-election-process-more-transparent-uniform/article_4d4cf5d6-e8ba-11ef-8ea8-c35ad43d3d8b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make the election process more transparent and uniform for county clerks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Turner told WAND News her suggested changes come from 24 years of personal experience as the Logan County clerk and recorder. The election process is a very important issue to Turner, who has filed the same proposal to standardize election procedures since she became a state senator in 2021. She believes the State Board of Elections should update required election judge training to ensure every judge knows about voter verification, campaign free zones, electioneering, vote-by-mail processing, provisional voting, and ballot processing. Turner&#8217;s plan could also require local election leaders to publish vote-by-mail processing rules on their websites 120 days before elections. She said clerks could simply post the state&#8217;s legal requirements for vote-by-mail to help the public understand every step of the process. Turner&#8217;s bill also calls on election authorities to post updates on their website if there are any reporting delays from election judges five hours after the polls close. The State Board of Elections would be required to audit vote-by-mail ballots received after elections as well. Turner&#8217;s plan states the audit would cover 5% of election authorities in Illinois to review their handling and processing procedures for vote-by-mail applications, certification envelopes and returned envelopes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5802" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Indiana:</strong> A bill headed to the House would </span><a href="https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/senate-republicans-advance-bill-to-ban-use-of-student-ids-when-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ban the use of student IDs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to verify a person’s identity when voting. Students at public colleges and universities in Indiana have been allowed to use their IDs when casting a ballot for about two decades. Republicans pushing the bill have offered no evidence of any issues surrounding the use of student IDs for voting. Lawmakers like Sen. Greg Goode (R-Terre Haute) simply said that student IDs don’t have the same rigor as other allowable forms of identification. “It was never intended to be used off campus,” Goode said. Under current law, not any student ID can be used for voting. In addition to coming from an Indiana public college or university, it must also show the person’s name, their photograph and have an expiration date. Sen. J.D. Ford (D-Indianapolis) said Indiana’s real crisis is its low voter turnout — which won’t be helped by further restricting access to the polls. “</span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/10/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not about securing elections — it’s about choosing who gets to participate in those elections,” Ford said. Indiana regularly has one of the worst voter turnout rates in the country. The Senate approved the bill 39-11, with Sen. Greg Walker (R-Columbus) joining Democrats in opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6527" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MaineCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Maine:</strong> Representative Steve Foster (R-Dexter) has introduced a bill that would put a </span><a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/new-bill-proposes-giving-ballots-individual-tracking-information-in-maine-elections-transparency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unique identifier on each ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Maine. Voters could then keep that identifier and track their ballot&#8217;s progress. But critics say that information potentially could be tracked by others to determine how you voted. Despite those concerns, the bill&#8217;s sponsor insists the current system needs more integrity. “Concerned voters can record their ballot’s identifier, and that’s when they vote in later view how their votes were,” Foster said. “LD313 would serve to improve voters’ confidence with the use of electronic voting machines and will prove the integrity of the system of tabulation in the state.” “This takes away the fundamental democratic value of secret ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Emily Cook said. “This is a recipe for conspiracy theories and voter intimidation rather than an increase in voter confidence. It would undermine our democracy, and it is on this point that we most strongly object to this proposal.” Critics are also concerned about the cost of this program, which local towns and cities would have to pay for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6131" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MS-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Mississippi:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that would give residents a chance to cast ballots up to </span><a href="https://www.supertalk.fm/mississippi-senate-passes-bill-to-implement-no-excuse-early-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 days before an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sen. Jeremy England’s legislation, called the “In-Person Early Voting Act,” would allow registered electors to vote at their local circuit clerk’s office without an excuse in the days leading up to the polls opening. The Republican from Vancleave argued during floor discussions that voters deserve the chance to cast a ballot early without having to issue a reason or justification as to why they cannot exercise their right on Election Day. “We are doing this to allow for our hardworking Mississippians that may have a difficult time getting to the polling place on Election Day,” England said. “Other states recognize that convenience is needed when voting.” If the bill is enacted into law, it will bring an end to Mississippi’s 45-day in-person absentee voting period, which requires people to fall into the state’s set of categories allowing them to cast a ballot early. Current criteria include being over 65 years old or disabled, or providing an “excuse” such as being out of town on Election Day.</span></p>

That would leave only public and private high school student ID cards as valid forms of student ID at the polls. SB 223 would also allow any New Hampshire student who registers to vote to qualify for in-state tuition in the next academic year, which would override the current requirement that a person must have lived in New Hampshire for 12 uninterrupted months without attending college during that time to qualify for in-state tuition. In the House, lawmakers are considering </span><a href="https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2025&amp;id=413&amp;txtFormat=html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 323</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would bar student identification of all types – including high school identification – from being used to obtain ballots and also block out-of-state driver’s licenses. That bill would include an exception for voters who have been on the voter registration checklist for fewer than 63 days. </span><a href="https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2025&amp;id=651&amp;txtFormat=html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 289</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would also bar a person from claiming domicile here if they are a “legal dependent of a person who does not live in New Hampshire.” Rachel Deane, the Durham town clerk and tax collector and a representative of the New Hampshire City and Town Clerks Association, argued SB 233 does not actually change the law allowing college students to vote – which would require a change in the definition of domicile – but merely eliminates a method for those students to vote. That could mean that students who are otherwise eligible to vote cannot because they don’t have driver’s licenses or state identification, Deane said. The University System of New Hampshire has objected to the bill, arguing that it would drive students to register to vote to obtain the lower in-state tuition, and calculating that it could cost the public universities up to $141.6 million in tuition. “Out-of-state tuition revenue would decrease to unsustainable levels,” USNH wrote in a fiscal note attached to the bill.</span></p>

Since 2018, New Jersey has allowed residents to automatically register to vote when they obtain a driver’s license, non-driver ID card, or driving permit during a visit to the Motor Vehicle Commission. The opt-out system also provides for automatic voter registration when obtaining some services from the Secretary of State. The Republicans’ bill would extend automatic registration to the Department of Environmental Protection’s fish and wildlife division, requiring residents who obtain hunting licenses, beaver trapping permits, wild turkey permits, or deer permits be given the opportunity to register to vote. It would further require the New Jersey State Police and local police agencies to offer automatic registration to residents obtaining firearms purchaser ID cards or permits to carry handguns.</span></p>

Curry County Sheriff Michael Brockett told House Consumer and Public Affairs committee members that his county is too big “for a small amount of people to police.” A law passed last year bans open-carry firearms at polling places with exceptions, including certified law enforcement officers, a person in a private automobile and a person carrying a concealed firearm who has a valid concealed-carry handgun license. “Agencies are uncertain about how to interpret who is included in the proposed exemptions in HB 101. There are no definitions in the bill clarifying the difference between “commissioned” officers and “certified” officers already covered by statute,” the bill’s Fiscal Impact Report states.

Kathy Hochul to </span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2025/02/08/bill-to-delay-special-election-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delay special elections in New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and therefore the anticipated race to replace Rep. Elise Stefanik in the 21st Congressional District if she is confirmed as UN ambassador.  Current law requires the governor to schedule a special election within 90 days of a declared congressional vacancy. A bill carried by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie in their respective houses would provide the governor with the option to delay that to the general election.  The bill, and Stewart-Cousins herself, claim the move is meant to streamline election efficiency and increase voter turnout. “The Legislature finds that New York&#8217;s  current system of filing federal and state elected office vacancies  places undue financial and operational burdens on local boards of  elections and exacerbates voter confusion and fatigue by asking voters to frequently participate in elections throughout the year, thus resulting in lower voter turnout and decreased participation in the electoral process,” the bill reads.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5272" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ND-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Dakota</strong>: Lawmakers are considering </span><a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/nd-bill-proposes-canceling-recall-elections-without-opposing-candidates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes to the state’s recall election laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create uniform standards for municipalities across the state. Senate Bill 2269, introduced by Sen. Kristin Roers and co-sponsored by several legislators, seeks to standardize recall procedures by increasing petition requirements, mandating justification for recalls and granting local election officials the power to cancel uncontested recall elections. While supporters say the bill will prevent politically motivated recalls and clarify inconsistencies between state law and local home rule charters, critics argue it could make it harder for voters to remove elected officials. The bill seeks to create and enact a new section to chapter 44-08 of the North Dakota Century Code, clarifying recall elections for city governing body members and amending sections related to recall petitions and elections for political subdivision officials. The bill proposes several changes to the recall process, including stricter requirements for initiating a recall election. Currently, only one petition is needed, with signatures totaling 25% of voters from the previous election. Under the proposed amendments, at least 15 petitions must be taken out by qualified voters instead of one. These petitions must then collectively obtain signatures equivalent to 35% of the voters in the most recent election. Another proposed change mandates that recall petitions “must include a stated reason for the recall and be approved as to form before circulation by the Secretary of State.” Rummel said these changes aim to prevent politically motivated recalls. “If you have a personal vendetta against a sitting commissioner, you can&#8217;t almost by yourself get that person recalled and drive to a recall election,” he said. He also emphasized the importance of transparency, adding, “You have to tell us a reason, so you can communicate it to the people that you’re trying to get the signatures from.” The bill’s most significant change would allow city auditors or local election officials to cancel recall elections if the recalled official is the only candidate on the ballot. “If the member subject to the recall election is the only individual placed on the ballot for that election, the city auditor shall cancel the election, declare the recall petition ineffective, and the member may continue to serve the remainder of the member’s term,” the bill states. This provision addresses an issue currently facing Dickinson, where Commissioner Jason Fridrich is the only candidate on the ballot after being recalled. Additionally, the bill stipulates that a city governing body member may not be recalled twice in the same term.</span></p>

It requires residents to be living in the state for 30 consecutive days before submitting a voter registration form. Thomas Deadrick is the Deputy Secretary of State. He said his office opposed the bill specifically due to the word “consecutive.” “There’s just so many scenarios out there where a person is still trying to be and doing everything to be a resident of this state and they’re taken out of the state for whatever reason. And sometimes the reasons aren’t even really their own reasons as to why they want to leave,&#8221; Deadrick said. &#8220;It may be because of vacation, a short time work over in another state. Or as one example I like to give is, what if you have a relative who lives in Omaha or Phoenix, and they die on you, and you want to go to the funeral? And you just blew your 30-consecutive.&#8221; Proponents countered, saying the bill takes into account the intent of a person to be in the state for 30 consecutive days. </span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25736/276498"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1066</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passes committee 8-2 and now heads to the floor of the House.</span></p>

Senator John Carley, the author of numerous election-related bills this session says Senate Bill 217 opens the door to more accurate and efficient elections. Numerous state county election officers testified against the bill. Hughes County Finance Officer Thomas Oliva says the machines are valuable for a number of reasons. The bill would have also ended the use voting machines utilized by disabled votes. District 24 Senator Jim Mehlhaff supported sending S-B 217 the 41st Legislative Day, effectively killing the bill.</span></p>

It was brought by Hot Springs Republican Sen. Amber Hulse. “This one isn’t too controversial, and we had a lot of parties involved so I’m excited to have that clear slate,&#8221; Hulse said. &#8220;We’ll have probably a couple amendments on the floor, but it looks like we have a good path to victory here.” It would allow the Secretary of State, local auditors, or even individual registered voters to file an application challenging an individual right to vote case. If passed, that challenge must take place within one month of election day.</span></p>

The resolution was passed after Dallas-area Republican Senator Bob Hall introduced a bill into the 89th legislative session that would ban countywide voting. In a summary of Senate Bill 76 that Hall’s team sent to channel 5 News, Hall said some election workers have said countywide voting creates vulnerabilities in election security. Hall also said countywide voting increases the frequency of error and fraud in elections. Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza says there are benefits to keeping the countywide polling program.  According to Garza, countywide voting gives voters more places to go vote, and it helps the county during emergencies.  Garza said countywide voting also reduced the number of polling locations, which saved the county money.  “That helps reduce the number of poll workers that we have to hire, so we’re expecting to see in the long run a cost savings, “Garza said.</span></p>

The Dallas County Commissioners voted 4-1 to approve a two-year contract for up to $7.6 million with Know Ink for electronic Pollbook services in a special meeting of the Dallas County Commissioners Court this week. The news comes after Dallas County’s electronic pollbooks from Election Systems and Software glitched during the November election resulting in nearly 4,000 voters receiving and casting ballots in the incorrect precinct. The version of the pollbook software used in the November election has since been decertified by the state of Texas in an unprecedented move. Tuesday’s vote allows the county to order 4,500 Know Ink machines, receive the deliveries by the end of March and begin training poll workers ahead of the May 3 election. Some machines will be held as “backups” to be ready to use if needed. Early voting in the May 3 election begins April 22.</span></p>

For county election officials, Fiefia’s bill would: Require the finished tabulation of all ballots received before Election Day to be published on election night; Require the finished tabulation of all ballots received on Election Day to be published the following night; and Require officials to publish the unofficial final election results on the Monday after Election Day. Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, said that any election reform bill that emerges from the 2025 session needs a “statutory deadline” for county clerks to report election night results.</span></p>

Amy Laufer (D–Charlottesville), would allow general registrars to only cancel voter registrations through a written request from the voter or data from an approved source. Laufer told a House subcommittee on Jan. 27 that the bill aims to protect military families overseas and other potential “vulnerable” voters from being improperly removed from the rolls. “It also attempts to streamline procedures by centralizing approved data sources, which mitigates potential errors and disputes related to inaccurate or unverified data,” Laufer said. If the bill is signed into law, registrars can only use data from the Department of Elections or approved state agencies, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and Department of Health Office of Vital Records. Family members would no longer be allowed to report deaths to registrars, and election officials wouldn’t be allowed to use obituaries to remove someone from the rolls. “This [bill] would prevent that from being a possibility for an individual to use to cancel,” Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said during the House subcommittee meeting. Beals told the subcommittee that the elections department gets weekly death notices from the vital records department, and registrars have access to a national health database to cancel voter registrations.</span></p>

The House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee voted the bill down 8-1 while the same Senate committee did not take a vote on a matching bill at all.  House Corporations Chair Rep. Chris Knapp, R-Gillette, said even had they advanced </span><a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0215"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 215</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday, he did not believe that it would have gone any farther than that when considering the high quantity of bills the House is considering right now. Rep. Paul Hoeft, R-Powell, agreed and said he has “serious questions” related to the cost of counting all ballots by hand. Multiple members of the Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee expressed concerns about the potential downsides to </span><a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/SF0184"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate File 184</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as opening the state up to more vulnerabilities by having ballots only counted by hand.  The county clerks opposed the bills and requested the committees to cover the proposal in an interim topic. Thermopolis resident Cheryl Aguiar, one of the main hand count proponents, warned against this on Wednesday, mentioning how it would then have to pass through the 2026 budget session. Any non-budget bill must receive a two-thirds vote just to be considered during a budget session.</span></p>

Laramie County is the only one of Wyoming’s 23 counties to use touch-screen voting machines. Rep. Christopher Knapp, R-Gillette, the sponsor of the bill, said the state needs to have uniform election laws across all 23 counties. Secretary of State Chuck Gray previously expressed support for Knapp’s bill during a House Appropriations Committee meeting, saying he found Laramie County’s elections “unsatisfying.” Laramie County Clerk Debra Lee spoke against the bill during the committee meeting last week, where she told lawmakers it would “upend” her county’s elections. From 2006 to 2013, county voters had the opportunity to weigh in on their preferred method of voting — a majority of them said they preferred the touch-screens, according to Lee.</span></p>

The decision upholds the victory of Democratic state Rep. Mack Jackson, who received 48 more votes than his Republican opponent, Tracy Wheeler, out of nearly 28,000 votes cast. McCorvey ruled that Wheeler failed to prove enough improper votes to put the result of the election in doubt. McCorvey wrote that only 14 improper votes were verified during a three-day trial last month. The judge found there wasn’t evidence showing that 44 additional ineligible voters — the number Wheeler claimed received ballots that included the House District 128 race but lived outside the district — actually voted in the election. “Succinctly stated, voters being provided with an opportunity to vote in the wrong district does not equate to proof by a preponderance of evidence that such voters actually tainted the election by voting in the election at issue,” McCorvey wrote in his nine-page order.</span></p>

The organization chose to dismiss the case after finding no voters with disabilities who were denied their voting rights as a result of the laws during the November and December 2024 elections. The dismissal, if granted without prejudice, will not prevent DRLA from bringing lawsuits in the future if the laws hinder the ability of voters with disabilities to vote. DRLA</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-2024-07-10-Complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a lawsuit in July 2024 against Louisiana Secretary of State Nancy Landry (R) and Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill (R) challenging several state laws for violating the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Louisiana Acts 380 and 317 prohibit assisting more than one absentee voter. Individuals who deliver absentee ballots or absentee ballot applications for more than one person outside of immediate family members can be criminally prosecuted. Louisiana Acts 302 and 712 make it similarly illegal to serve as a witness for more than one non-family absentee voter. All four were signed into law in June 2024 by Gov. Jeff Landry (R). DRLA argued these laws violate Section 208 of the VRA, which allows voters with disabilities to receive assistance “from a person of the voter’s choice.” Many voters with disabilities who live in nursing homes, group homes or hospitals rely on staff members to help them apply for or return absentee ballots. DRLA claimed that with the laws in effect, those voters will be unlikely to vote if their immediate family members are not available to assist them. It asked the court to block the four statutes.  In July, a federal district judge rejected a request to temporarily block the laws, citing a legal doctrine that discourages courts from changing voting rules too close to an election. The laws were therefore in effect during the 2024 presidential election. In October 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the plaintiffs had failed to meet procedural requirements like establishing standing and stating a claim for relief. </span></p>

Republican Planning Board chair Chuck Marshall received 1,760 votes. He was the only name on the ballot. At the beginning of court attorneys confirmed that interim commissioner Hank Kuczynski, a Democrat who mounted a last-minute write-in campaign, earned 1,663 uncontested votes. There are 106 contested ballot to be reviewed by Judge Walsh. Attorneys were unable to break them up into categories. More than 60 of those objections were stipulated to have been caused by a voter writing “Democrat” or “D” on the ballot. Questions remain about 25 undervotes and up to 40 overseas military ballots. Depending on the margin following Walsh’s decision counting those votes may be solely academic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s highest court was asked this week to reverse a ruling against a law that would allow </span><a href="https://www.whec.com/national-world/new-york-city-argues-for-noncitizen-voting-law-before-states-top-court/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noncitizens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to vote in New York City municipal elections by lawyers who argued city officials acted within their legal powers. New York City became the first major U.S. city to grant widespread municipal voting rights to noncitizens in January 2022 — though the law approved by the Democrat-led city council was never implemented due to a legal challenge from Republicans. The city law did not grant noncitizens the right to vote in presidential, congressional or state elections. A trial judge sided with Republican challengers to noncitizen voting in June 2022. And a mid-level state appeals court ruled last year that the law violated the state constitution and a legal requirement to hold a public referendum on the proposal because it changed an election method. The city council appealed to the state Court of Appeals. An attorney for the council told the judges that the city government did not violate the state constitution. “It engaged in a core act of self-governance and the exercise of its home rule powers. This court should hold that the constitution permits the city to make that choice,” attorney Claude Platton said. Arguments this week focused largely on how to interpret specific constitutional language and how to define words like “citizen.” Though Judge Jenny Rivera noted the law could have an big impact if implemented, saying it would “expand the franchise to a very large number of individuals.” A decision is expected in the coming months.</span></p>

Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections (RITE) filed the lawsuit on behalf of two Vermont voters in June, around a year after Burlington amended its city charter to allow noncitizens who are legal residents in the U.S. to vote in local elections. This includes voting on the education budget and the school board, which were at the center of this case. Hoar granted the city of Burlington’s motion to dismiss RITE’s case last week, rejecting the group’s argument that since the city’s education funding is decided by local voters but paid for by the state, the policy violates the Vermont Constitution, which requires U.S. citizenship to cast a vote on “any matter that concerns the State of Vermont.” The two voters also initially argued that their votes would be diluted by noncitizen votes, meaning that their votes would have less impact on the election results. The judge dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs can’t refile it in the future.</span></p>

The case focuses not on Wolfe’s performance as administrator, but rather on the legality of appointees staying on after their terms expire. Wolfe’s four-year term expired in July 2023, and the Republican-led state Senate appeared poised to reject her confirmation if the Wisconsin Elections Commission had voted to reappoint her. All three Republicans on the commission voted to reappoint Wolfe, but the Democratic commissioners abstained from the vote. They cited a 2022 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling stating that appointees can stay in their roles past the end of their terms. That meant Wolfe wasn’t formally reappointed, and therefore not subject to another Senate confirmation proceeding. Still, Senate leaders took a vote to fire her.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://politics-prose.com/katherine-stewart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine Stewart — Money, Lies, and God: Inside the Movement to Destroy American Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Why have so many Americans turned against democracy? In this deeply reported book, Katherine Stewart takes us to conferences of conspiracy-mongers, backroom strategy gatherings, and services at extremist churches, and profiles the people who want to tear it all down. She introduces us to reactionary Catholic activists, atheist billionaires, pseudo-Platonist intellectuals, self-appointed apostles of Jesus, disciples of Ayn Rand, women-hating opponents of &#8220;the gynocracy,&#8221; pronatalists preoccupied with the dearth of white babies, Covid truthers, militia members masquerading as &#8220;concerned moms&#8221; and battalions of spirit warriors who appear to be inventing a new style of religion even as they set about attacking democracy at its foundations. Along the way, she provides a compelling analysis of the authoritarian reaction in the United States. She demonstrates that the movement relies on several distinct constituencies, with very different and often conflicting agendas. Stewart&#8217;s reporting and comprehensive political analysis helps reframe the conversation about the moral collapse of conservatism in America and points the way forward toward a democratic future. When: Feb. 20, 7pm Eastern. Where: Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/antidemocratic-conversation-david-daley"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antidemocratic: A Conversation with David Daley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 1965, voting rights advocates secured the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The law removed some discriminatory barriers that Black and other historically disenfranchised voters faced at the polls. From day one of its passage, however, this legislation has been attacked in state legislatures and the courts — most notably, the U.S. Supreme Court. In “Antidemocratic,” author David Daley outlines the beginning of a movement within the legal system that helped pave the way for the decision in</span><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/five-decades-section-5-how-key-provision-voting-rights-act-protected-our-democracy"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shelby County v. Holder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Supreme Court case that gutted the Voting Rights Act. According to Daley, fringe theories about our elections threaten to undermine our democracy and silence voters. In a conversation with CLC’s Senior Vice President Bruce V. Spiva, Daley will discuss what pro-democracy advocates can do to protect the freedom to vote. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 21, 1:15pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://esra-conference.org/2025-call-proposals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2025 ESRA Call for Proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The 9th Annual Summer Conference on Election Science, Reform, and Administration (ESRA) will be held in-person from Monday, June 9th to Wednesday, June 11th at Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL. The conference is interdisciplinary and invites participation from scholars across a variety of fields including political science, public administration, law, public policy, computer science, statistics, engineering and from election administrators. The purpose of the conference is to engage both election practitioners and scholars alike on pressing topics related to U.S. elections by providing a forum for collaboration and exchange that can stimulate policy evaluation and innovation. Unlike traditional academic conferences, ESRA seeks to facilitate a shared space between academics and election professionals so as to encourage the practical applications of scholarly research in the field. We hope that a wide variety of topics will be addressed at the conference. We are particularly interested in new and innovative projects that evaluate the way U.S. elections are currently administered and how they may be reformed. <strong>When:</strong> Deadline is Feb. 21. </span></p>
