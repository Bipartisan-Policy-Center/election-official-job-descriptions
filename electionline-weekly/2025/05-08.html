</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathleen Hale, JD, PhD, executive director, Election Center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice, a collaboration of <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/">Auburn University</a> and the <a href="https://electioncenter.org/">Election Center</a>, are excited to announce the Call for Innovative Election <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12830" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Institute-Logo-2024-RGB_Full-Color-300x106.png" alt="" width="300" height="106" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Institute-Logo-2024-RGB_Full-Color-300x106.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Institute-Logo-2024-RGB_Full-Color-1024x363.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Institute-Logo-2024-RGB_Full-Color-768x273.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Institute-Logo-2024-RGB_Full-Color-1536x545.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Institute-Logo-2024-RGB_Full-Color-2048x727.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Administration Funding Solutions, a competition seeking groundbreaking, practical solutions to address the critical issue of adequate funding of election administration across local, state, and/or federal levels in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This challenge is designed to encourage creative thinking and collaboration in developing new approaches to election funding. Entries should focus on election administration and how we fund local, state, or federal elections, or any combination thereof. The contest seeks proposals with solutions that can help sustain funding of election administration while promoting participation among eligible voters, accessibility, and election integrity while acknowledging the increasing complexity of administering U.S. elections and demands on election offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We welcome proposals that present novel ideas for how to fund local and state government generally so long as the connection to how election administration is funded is clear in the proposal. We prefer proposals that are widely applicable, model solutions that can be adapted to various state and local contexts but will accept proposals focused on particular state models or solutions (e.g., mail ballot states, states with vote centers, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is open to all individuals or teams from various backgrounds, from election administrators and officials, policy makers, think tanks, and academics and students from related disciplines, including but not limited to law, public administration, public finance, political science, economics, business, technology, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to two team members from the top 10 proposals will have travel paid to present their ideas at our October 26-28 symposium on the Auburn University campus. The top five winners will receive cash prizes which will be announced at the symposium. Cash prizes will include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,000<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submissions will be judged on originality, feasibility, impact, scalability, and alignment with the principles of democratic access, integrity and transparency. A team of national experts in public finance and election administration practice, policy, and research will review and score the proposals. Review of proposals will be single-blinded (i.e., reviewers will not know the identity of the proposers).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://portal.electioncenter.org/NAEO/Events/Sign_in_Event_display.aspx?EventKey=EVNT1025&amp;WebsiteKey=b9cec59d-e686-40ed-9bbc-d88297b5b256">symposium</a> is co-hosted each October in odd years by Auburn University and the Election Center. Begun in 2015, it is designed to bring election officials, researchers, policy makers, vendors, and representatives of other interested groups together to discuss issues of significant importance to election administration. Registration for this year’s symposium will open in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals must be submitted by August 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2025.

The new mission statement for the voting section makes a passing reference to the historic Voting Rights Act, but no mention of typical enforcement of the provision through protecting people’s right to cast ballots or ensuring that lines for legislative maps do not divide voters by race. Instead, it redefines the unit’s mission around conspiracy theories. In his proposed budget, President Donald J. Trump  proposes shuttering the disinformation offices and programs at the </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5279753-trump-proposes-cisa-disinformation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CISA), alleging in the budget request that they contributed to the censorship of the president and his supporters. The budget proposal claimed CISA’s disinformation offices and programs “functioned as a hub in the Censorship Industrial Complex.” The proposal calls for slashing the agency’s budget by about $491 million. This would be a nearly 16 percent reduction in funding from what the agency received last year. It currently has a budget of about $3 billion. “Under President Trump’s leadership, CISA will protect our critical infrastructure instead of censoring Americans,” the fact sheet stated. “The Budget refocuses CISA on its core mission—Federal network defense and coordinating with critical infrastructure partners—while eliminating weaponization and waste.”</span></p>

In </span><a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/warren-news/ballot-mistake-in-warren-impacts-some-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trumbull County, Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Elections Director Stephanie Penrose says poll workers in one precinct made a mistake by providing some voters with only one ballot when they should have gotten two, one for local races and one for ballot issues. “Some people who requested Democratic ballots in the city of Warren were given an issues-only ballot instead of the proper Democratic ballot,” Penrose said. “In an election this slow, I’m hoping it was very few people. I can’t go back and change it. All I can say is it has been rectified — everybody is getting the ballot they want.” </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/video/dallas-county-introduces-new-voting-machines-to-ensure-smooth-election-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dallas County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out their new voting system during the May 3 local elections and the system performed with few, if any problems. </span><a href="https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/new-vote-collection-procedure-sparks-concern-among-poll-workers-as-traffic-worsens-local-news-near-me-crime-law-public-safety"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bexar County, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out a new process for collecting and reporting results on May 3 and it was met with frustrations. The new system requires poll workers to deliver poll results on thumb drives to a central location, rather than multiple sites across the county as done previously. Bruce Glinski, an Alternate Election Judge described the scene, saying, &#8220;Everyone that&#8217;s in this line has been working for 15 hours today, and we&#8217;re not done yet. It&#8217;s just ridiculous, poor planning, bad decision. As for myself, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever gonna do this again.&#8221; Despite the congestion, staff from the elections department claimed this was the fastest result turnout in 18 years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Democracy Sausage</strong>: Governance is often referred to as making the sausage and in Australia, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/05/02/australia-election-democracy-sausage/0dd5b4da-27b0-11f0-ae6d-e4db528eba27_story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enjoying a “democracy sausage” at the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Election Day is akin to showing off your “I Voted” sticker in America. According to The Washington Post, a grilled sausage wrapped in a slice of white bread and often topped with onions and ketchup is a regular fixture of life Down Under, but when offered at polling places on election day , the humble treat is elevated to a democracy sausage — a national, if light-heated, symbol for electoral participation. There is even a website that tracks real-time, crowd-sourced democracy sausage locations on polling day. According to The Post,  the tradition is far from political. Cooking and selling the snacks outside polling places is the most lucrative fundraising event of the year for many school and community groups. Democracy sausages are served everywhere Australians vote, even abroad. The friends who run the apolitical and nonpartisan website democracysausage.org began the project in 2013, when they struggled to find information about which polling places would offer food on election day, a spokesperson told The Associated Press. Judith Brett, a professor of politics at Melbourne’s LaTrobe University and author of the book “From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage: How Australia Got Compulsory Voting,” attributed the sausage’s appeal to the Australian sense of humor — “It was a bit of a joke,” she said — and its grassroots origins. “Government didn’t think it up, a political party didn’t think it up as a slogan,” she added. “It’s something that binds everyone together,” Dawson said.</span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Florida</strong>: Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed into law a bill to </span><a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/02/florida-lawmakers-agree-on-stringent-ballot-initiative-requirements/83412822007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it more difficult for citizens to get constitutional amendments on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like ones in recent years that raised the minimum wage to $15 and allowed for the use of medical marijuana. The Legislature passed the measure (</span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/1205/BillText/e1/PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1205</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) May 2 and the governor signed it later that same day. The House and Senate earlier had been at odds over at what point a signature collector would have to register with the state as a &#8220;petition circulator&#8221; and take a two-hour online training course. The measure bounced between the chambers the last three days of the session before the House boosted the threshold to 25 signatures on May 1. The next day, the session&#8217;s final day, the Senate agreed with a 28–9 vote. The Legislature responded to DeSantis’ call to reform the process with a measure that requires groups sponsoring ballot initiatives to put up a $1 million bond, as well as shortens the time for submitting signatures and increases financial penalties for violations. But it also prohibits spending &#8220;public funds for a political advertisement or any other communication&#8221; to support or oppose a proposed amendment. “This bill is not an attack on the citizens’ initiative process. But it is an attack on those who have corrupted it,” Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said in an April 30 debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6527" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MaineCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Maine:</strong> Rep. Poppy Arford (D-Brunswick) introduced</span><a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP1161?legislature=132"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LD 1743</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow municipalities to adopt an order, ordinance, policy or regulation that </span><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/05/01/secretary-of-state-backs-bill-allowing-towns-to-ban-guns-at-polling-places/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limits or prohibits firearms within its buildings and voting places and at public proceedings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The municipalities would be required to post the rule in a prominent location outside of all buildings. Though local and state government proceedings can be contentious, Arford said people shouldn’t be deterred from engaging in those meetings or voting out of fear of someone bringing a firearm.  Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who is also running for governor next year, said towns should have the option to regulate firearms in polling places because there is often anxiety over threats to election workers that data collected by her office shows persist.  “This may not be right for every municipality, but for some, it could be the right option, and we believe they should have the option,” she said, speaking in favor of the bill.  Bellows was asked if she was concerned over this proposal restricting one right for the sake of exercising another. She said this didn’t concern her, comparing it to the First Amendment limitations that already exist at polling places so as to not influence other voters.  Opponents argued that people intent on committing crimes aren’t deterred by gun-free zones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, lawmakers heard public testimony on </span><a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/lawmakers-consider-three-bills-to-implement-voter-id-requirements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three separate bills that would require voters to present photo identification </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">before casting a ballot. Sen. Jeff Timberlake, R-Androscoggin, is sponsoring one of the bills. Timberlake’s bill would require the Secretary of State’s Office to provide free photo IDs to voters who need them. While all three bills focus on requiring photo ID, one, L.D. 1149, also includes changes to absentee voting. It would ban voters from requesting absentee ballots over the phone and limit each municipality to a single ballot drop box. The secretary of state&#8217;s office says a voter ID requirement would cost about $1 million for equipment and to create a process to check IDs. Maine voters will also get to weigh in on this issue in November, after a citizen&#8217;s petition got a voter ID question on the ballot.</span></p>

They are the first of several in what will be a larger package of election proposals known as the Security, Accountability, and Nonintervention in Elections plan, or SANE, said Rep. Stephen Wooden, a Democrat from Grand Rapids. The first,</span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billintroduced/House/pdf/2025-HIB-4461.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB 4461</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would create new obligations for the secretary of state to help keep the voter rolls free of noncitizens. It would require the secretary to verify the citizenship of any registered voter who “during a transaction with the secretary of state” provides documentation suggesting they aren’t a citizen. The state would have to check the person against state vehicle databases or “any other relevant program.” If that person is found not to be a citizen, the secretary of state would have to notify that person that their voter registration will be canceled within 60 days unless they provide proof of citizenship. The second bill,</span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billintroduced/House/pdf/2025-HIB-4462.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB 4462</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, comes from Rep. Matt Koleszar of Plymouth. It would allow the secretary of state to remove someone from the voter rolls after they haven’t voted in 20 years. Benson has been working on a similar effort, but it is not a codified requirement. </span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billintroduced/House/pdf/2025-HIB-4463.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 4463</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Rep. Mai Xiong of Warren, would require the secretary of state to review the instructions on voter registration forms every even-numbered year. The form would have to clearly state that U.S. citizenship is required to register.</span></p>

The measure would require new Michigan voters — and almost certainly some current ones — to provide documents proving they are U.S. citizens before they can cast a ballot in the state. The measure’s sponsor, state Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford, said the resolution “is a common-sense way to close a massive loophole in our current system.” The vote on House Joint Resolution B needed two-thirds approval, or at least 74 votes, to pass the House. Republicans control the state House, but only narrowly, and at least 16 Democrats would have needed to vote yes. In the end, none did. If the vote had succeeded, the measure would have gone next to the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate, where it faced steep odds. </span></p>

DFL Rep. Brad Tabke won his district by 14 votes but there were 20 missing absentee ballots from one precinct, which sparked controversy. An investigation by Scott County determined the ballots were never processed and were likely thrown away in their secrecy envelopes — one of two envelopes voters sign during the absentee voting process.  The proposal, brought forward initially by Tabke and included in a larger bill, adds clarifying steps to the absentee ballot process and requires elections officials to document any discrepancy while counting the ballots in the incident logs they already are putting together as part of their job. The absentee ballot boards, which review the ballots and count them, also must keep all ballot envelopes until after the period during which voters and candidates can challenge election results is over. House on Thursday approved the provisions in a bipartisan state government and elections package.  Michael Stalberger, an elections administrator in Blue Earth County who is a member of the Minnesota Association of County Officers, said during a March committee hearing that for the most part, elections officials are already implementing the proposed changes, but putting them in statute adds a layer of transparency. He called retention of all envelopes a &#8220;fail safe.&#8221;</span></p>

LB 521 would make a series of changes, including to allow hospice or disability services patient records to count as a photo voter ID, stop petition signature verification of candidates or new political parties at 110% of the goal (similar to ballot measures), notify a voter if their voter registration is canceled, prohibit petition circulation within 200 feet of ballot drop boxes and permit the secretary of state to distribute petition pages to counties “by a secure method,” rather than just mail or by law enforcement. Four other bills were amended into LB 521, by a 41-0 vote. They would: Allow Lincoln or Omaha to move odd-year city elections in April and May to instead be in line with statewide primary and general elections (LB 19 from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha). Exempt local foster care review boards from the Open Meetings Act (LB 238 from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha). Address situations where a public meeting notice has been sent to a newspaper but can’t be published on a proper timeline, and address what happens if a public notice can’t be posted online (LB 243 from Sanders). Allow political parties to appoint watchers to monitor county election officials’ mandatory three independent tests of vote-counting devices. The results of the tests would later be published online (LB 659 from State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County). LB 521 includes a provision that could allow the secretary of state to use software to assist in processing a filed petition, but not to verify signatures.</span></p>

Both bills are retreads of proposals that didn’t make the cut last session. Senate Bill 63 would ban ranked choice voting and S.B. 153, would require every voter to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. Under current law only citizens may vote, and officials regularly comb through the rolls looking for individuals improperly registered.  The bill, sponsored by state Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, and Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, tosses in a few other conservative wish list items alongside the citizenship provisions. They place new strictures on the petition process, including requiring paid canvassers wear a badge identifying themselves as such, and they eliminate the use of ballot drop boxes.</span></p>

Some of the changes include the addition of language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.” State Superintendent Ryan Walters said he decided to add new language to the standards after his administration received input from the public and from focus groups. He said the new content wasn’t intended to support or deny the results of the 2020 presidential election, but rather to encourage students to draw their own conclusions. After the Legislature failed to act, Walters celebrated that “the most unapologetically conservative, pro-America social studies standards in the nation are moving forward.” </span></p>

Thomas Mehaffie (R-Dauphin) passed with a bipartisan 14-12 vote in the House State Government Committee. Democratic Reps John Inglis of Allegheny County and Nancy Guenst of Montgomery County voted in support. The committee voted along party lines, however, to approve an omnibus bill that would eliminate ambiguity in Act 77, the law that gave Pennsylvanians the option to vote by mail without an excuse for the first time in 2020. The vote-by-mail provision has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, including one now before the U.S. Supreme Court, as candidates and parties have argued over how election officials should handle irregularities, such as errors on completed ballots, that are not explicitly addressed. The bill would make clear that county election officials are required to notify voters if their mail-in ballots have been rejected for the lack of a signature and give the voter an opportunity to “cure” the error. Among other changes,</span><a href="https://www.palegis.us/legislation/bills/text/PDF/2025/0/HB1396/PN1584"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1396</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would also give election workers up to a week before Election Day to prepare to count mail-in ballots, a process that has been a bottleneck for election results in parts of the state, providing fodder for election deniers. The omnibus bill voted out of committee Tuesday would provide for bond issues through the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority to pay for new software, computer hardware and other equipment to modernize election administration. The legislation would codify procedures the Department of State has directed or allowed county election officials to use to make voting more accessible and secure, such as the use of ballot dropboxes, logic and accuracy testing for electronic voting machines and risk limiting audits. It would also require counties to provide early voting, with one polling place open for 11 days before Election Day for every 100,000 registered voters. In the most recent election, some counties allowed voters to apply for, complete and return mail-in ballots at the election office in a form of makeshift early voting. And the bill would increase the minimum pay for election workers to $175.</span></p>

Carrie Isaac, R-Dripping Springs, allows an election judge, early voting clerk, or deputy early voting clerk who is serving as an election judge to carry a concealed handgun at an early voting or Election Day polling place as a means of protection for themselves and others. The bill passed 89 to 53 in the House and will now go to the Senate for approval. This bill would codify a decision made by Attorney General Ken Paxton in 2018, where he ruled that since district judges can carry firearms to polling places and election judges had been given the authority of district judges, they should also be able to. Isaac told lawmakers this bill was needed because the elections director for the Texas Secretary of State reported that during the 2024 election, workers endured bomb threats and physical attacks, including thrown water bottles. She said it’s becoming harder to retain and recruit poll workers because of this climate, so protections must be put in place at polling locations. Critics of the bill questioned whether allowing an election judge to carry a weapon could be considered dangerous to the voting process. This bill would not change current laws banning the general public from bringing firearms to a polling location, and it would only allow election judges and those designated by them to carry guns, and not all poll workers, said Isaac.</span></p>

Bryan Hughes, a Mineola Republican, would require most elections to be held in November and on Tuesdays. There are exceptions for the primaries, runoffs and special elections. That means city and school districts would be required to hold their elections in November, rather than May, as they are now. Hughes said he hopes the change will save money and drive up voter turnout. “Low turnout elections are closely and resource-intensive. And since each election has substantial fixed costs, the cost per ballot increases significantly when there’s low turnout,” Hughes told the State Affairs Committee. Cynthia Lum, the Houston County elections administrator overseeing local elections, says the legislation, which has already won approval from the state Senate and is waiting for a House committee to review it, would ease the strain on smaller counties and cities of holding multiple elections a year. And it has the potential to save taxpayers. Moving the elections to November would instead allow more counties, cities and schools to split the cost, which could make a difference in small communities. “Let’s say it costs $8,000 to run one precinct, that $8,000 could be divided by the school, the city and possibly the hospital district,” Lum told Votebeat. “So instead of $8,000, you’re dividing it between four entities and talking about a couple thousand.”</span></p>

Citizens can request a voter registration card with a photograph from either their county clerk or the Secretary of State, per the code, however the process for doing so is not specified in the bill text. Any cards requested will be given free of charge. No funds were allocated through this bill for the creation or distribution of such cards. Anyone who is unable to provide a valid photo ID at the ballot box will still be able to cast a provisional ballot after signing an affidavit confirming their identity. Once election officials verify their identity, the provisional ballot should be counted as long as the person is an eligible voter.</span></p>

The CFTC, in a filing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said its proposed dismissal was voluntary and on terms agreed to with Kalshi. A CFTC spokesman told CNBC that the commission earlier voted to seek dismissal of the appeals. The agreement calls for both sides to bear their own costs and attorney fees, and for Kalshi to waive all legal claims arising from litigation in the case. The CFTC for months had pursued its appeal of a September ruling by Washington, D.C., federal district court Judge Jia Cobb. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cobb, ruling in Kalshi’s favor, said Congress had not authorized the CFTC to conduct a public interest review that led the agency to bar the exchange from offering contracts on elections.

In the post, Trump directed the U.S. Department of Justice to “take all necessary action to help secure the release of former Mesa county clerk Tina Peters,” referring to her as a hostage that was “being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons.” “FREE TINA PETERS, NOW!” Trump wrote to punctuate the message. Trump’s online proclamation is the latest step in a growing federal effort to free Peters. In March, the Department of Justice went to</span><a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/23/federal-judge-trump-help-imprisoned-tina-peters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a bid to help Peters and potentially free her from custody. Attorneys for the state of Colorado have asked a federal judge to reject the Justice Department’s filings. The judge said at the hearing that he will rule after determining whether he has jurisdiction. In March, a spokesman for the governor said Peters had not applied for clemency or a pardon and said the office would only consider clemency on its own merits “regardless of bullying and threats.” The office didn’t immediately respond to a request from Colorado Public Radio for  comment on Trump’s latest social media post.</span></p>

Stuart was charged with 34 counts related to the ballot theft scheme, which occurred in the lead-up to last year’s presidential election. She pleaded guilty to one count of identity theft and one count of forgery in the 21st Judicial District Court. According to Colorado Public Radio, for much of the hearing, she answered Judge Brian Flynn’s questions with a simple “yes,” but when asked why she was willing to accept the plea agreement, she responded because “I feel like I am guilty for the part that I played in it.” The scheme was uncovered when some voters alerted authorities after the Colorado Ballot tracking system informed them their ballots were being processed, even though they hadn’t received their ballots yet. State officials said three of the stolen ballots that were cast fraudulently did make it through the signature verification process and were counted as legitimate votes.  At the time of the theft, Stuart was working as a U.S. Postal Service employee in Grand Junction with direct access to ballots that had been sent in the mail in October of 2024.</span></p>

It attacks the fundamental freedom of Floridians to participate in their own democracy,” said FDH Executive Director Mitch Emerson. “It is a calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules — not to serve the people, but to protect their own power.” Under the new law, voters could be charged with a felony if they collect more than 25 signed ballot petitions, other than their own or those of immediate family members, and don’t register with the state as a petition circulator. Emerson estimates the new law will mean millions of dollars in additional costs for his campaign, the price of complying with new requirements and hiring more paid circulators to make up for volunteers who back out for fear of legal liability.</span></p>

Svitlana Demydenko and Yelyzaveta Demydenko, 22, voted in the November general election despite not being U.S. citizens, the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office alleged. Both are facing a federal charge of being an alien unlawfully voting in a presidential election. A person found guilty can face up to one year in prison and a fine up to $100,000. The Demydenkos appeared last week before U.S. Magistriate Judge Ryan M. McCabe. Both were found to be indigent and were assigned federal public defenders. As a matter of policy, the public defender does not comment on active cases. McCabe set bail for both defendants at $25,000, requiring that they each have a co-signer. They are scheduled to return to court for a preliminary arraignment on May 20.</span></p>

They allege that Senate Bill 10, which was recently signed into law by Gov. Mike Braun, is an unconstitutional &#8220;surgical attack on young voters&#8221; that restricts their rights. They&#8217;re asking for an injunction from the court to &#8220;ensure that young Hoosiers can freely exercise their constitutional rights in Indiana&#8217;s elections,&#8221; according to the federal complaint. The lawsuit points out that since Indiana&#8217;s voter ID law went into effect in 2005, tens of thousands of young voters at public colleges and universities in Indiana have been able to use their student IDs to vote as long as those IDs meet the state&#8217;s general requirements, including containing a voter&#8217;s name, photograph and expiration date. The complaint states that Indiana law doesn&#8217;t exclude any other category of ID in the same way, with the legislature even expanding the scope of acceptable IDs, such as military IDs that do not contain an expiration date. Voters can also still use federal Veterans Affairs cards as an acceptable form of ID.</span></p>

Defendants are Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Douglas County Clerk Jamie Shew. SB 4, which the Legislature passed this year, disqualifies any mail-in ballots not received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Previously, mail-in ballots were counted if they were postmarked by Election Day and arrived within three days later. Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed SB4 but that veto was overturned in both chambers, with votes falling along party lines. In a statement, the three advocacy organizations called SB 4 a “deliberate and unconstitutional assault on Kansans’ fundamental right to vote.” “This reckless law carelessly disregards the realities of postal delivery delays, which will disproportionately harm rural, elderly, and disabled voters,” the statement said. “Furthermore, this law deliberately undermines the will of Kansas voters who have increasingly chosen to vote by mail in recent election cycles.”  In the lawsuit, the advocacy organizations make a point that Kansans have been voting by mail ever since the Civil War. In 2017, the Legislature recognized that mail-in ballots arriving late deprived voters of their right to vote, and they instituted the three-day grace period. </span></p>

Public Interest Legal Foundation filed the lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, in November 2021, alleging Michigan was violating the National Voter Registration Act by refusing to remove 27,000 individuals from its qualified voter file the group said were dead. Lawyers for Benson’s office had argued that she declined to remove the voters because doing so without confirming the accuracy of the group’s list would have risked removing eligible voters in violation of federal voting law, which seeks to ensure voters aren’t wrongly removed. That argument was supported by U.S. District Court Judge Jane Beckering of the Western District of Michigan, who in March 2024 rejected as “theoretical” the harms claimed by the group, and concluded that deceased voters were removed from Michigan’s voter rolls on a regular basis. In its decision to reject Public Interest Legal Foundation’s appeal, the 6th Circuit said Michigan has actively made “an inherently rational, sensible attempt at maintaining accurate voter registration lists,” and that the state “goes further by also actively employing a third party, ERIC, to assist in identifying deceased registrants. This additional effort only further enhances the reasonableness of Michigan’s efforts to maintain accurate voter rolls.”</span></p>

Thomas pleaded guilty to one felony count of assaulting an election officer, the Attorney General’s office said in a statement. She was accused of slapping Raymond Town Moderator Pro Tem Jonathan Wood during the town’s municipal and school elections on March 28.  Thomas was sentenced to 12 months in the house of corrections, all suspended for one year on the condition of good behavior and compliance with her sentencing order, the AG’s office said. She was ordered to have no contact with Wood during the period of her suspended sentence and to complete 10 hours of community service. “Assaulting an election official is a serious offense that strikes at the heart of our democratic process,” Attorney General John Formella said in a statement. “This plea and sentence send a clear message that such conduct will not be tolerated in New Hampshire.” Thomas has also lost her right to vote in New Hampshire in accordance with state law, the AG’s office said.</span></p>

The court ruled against Republican-led challenges to the law in that it conflicts with individual county charters. Twenty counties are chartered, meaning they have locally drafted and approved laws outlining the structure and authority of county government, and there have been three separate amendments in the state Constitution allowing for and protecting counties&#8217; abilities to govern through charters. The court ruled that the state constitution gives local governments the right to “a legislative body elective by the people” and to adopt alternative forms of county government, &#8220;but neither of those provisions gives a county exclusive local control over the manner in which local elections will be held or the specific details of each office.&#8221; At issue is a law passed by the New York state Legislature and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in December 2023 that moves several local elections outside of New York City to even-numbered years starting this year, with the exception of some city or village elections, and races for county clerk, sheriff, district attorneys, local judges and others protected in the state Constitution. The Republican-led challenge, initiated in Onondaga County, also argued the law is not a &#8220;general law,&#8221; which applies alike to all counties other than those wholly included within a city, all cities, all towns or all villages. &#8220;We reject that argument as well,&#8221; the court wrote, siding with the state&#8217;s argument since the even-year law applies to all counties outside New York City.</span></p>

In</span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Myers-Riggs-Griffin-ruling.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 68-page ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Myers said the state Board of Elections should certify the election results based on the tally of all eligible votes in November, which means Democratic incumbent Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs would prevail in the race for the seat on the high court over Griffin. Her 734-vote lead over Griffin was confirmed in two recounts. Myers stayed his order for seven days to give Griffin time to appeal. Riggs said in a statement night that the ruling is a vindication for voters. Myers, a Trump nominee, wrote that the state Board of Elections should not follow the Supreme Court’s orders. Retroactively invalidating military and overseas voters’ ballots violates those voters’ due process rights, and the “cure” process violates their equal protection rights, he wrote. Requiring military and overseas absentee voters  in one county to “undertake additional efforts to have their votes counted” while similar voters in other counties don’t have to make that same effort is ‘a constitutional violation’ of the Equal Protection Clause,” Myers wrote. “Overseas military and civilian voters followed the rules as they existed at the time of the election, but the retroactive change in voting procedure at issue here deprives them of their fundamental right to have their votes counted,” he wrote. Myers said the state has an interest in limiting the right to vote to bone fide residents, but it shouldn’t risk throwing out votes from people who live in the state. “[T]he court finds that post-election ballot disqualification for individuals erroneously designated as Never Residents constitutes a substantial burden on the right to vote,” Myers wrote. Myers ruled that election rules cannot be changed after the fact, writing: “[T]his case concerns whether the federal Constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters, and in so doing treat those voters differently than other similarly situated individuals. This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible. “To this court, the answer to each of those questions is ‘no.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-supreme-court-election-appeal-b227a456e5ca04bc42bf6075af46028c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Griffin provided a statement indicating that he has decided not to appeal the ruling of U.S. District Court Judge Richard Myers II that Riggs must be certified as the winner. “While I do not fully agree with the District Court’s analysis, I respect the court’s holding — just as I have respected every judicial tribunal that has heard this case,” Griffin said. “</span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/jefferson-griffin-concedes-in-supreme-court-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will not appeal the court’s decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

Segura was taken into custody on May 3rd, along with five others. The arrests stem from a multi-agency investigation led by the Texas Attorney General’s Office, which alleges coordinated efforts to manipulate mail-in ballots. Court documents FoxSA obtained last year said Segura is accused of leaking confidential ballot data, such as ballot delivery dates and locations, to another individual involved in the scheme. That person allegedly charged between $1,500 and $2,500 for vote-harvesting services. Authorities stated in court documents that this points to a larger operation designed to influence election outcomes by targeting vulnerable populations.</span></p>

Moderated by Votebeat Arizona reporter Jen Fifield, you’ll learn about the practical realities of requiring documented proof of citizenship for elections. Currently, there is no federal requirement to show proof of citizenship in order to vote. Instead, voters across the country must attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. President Donald Trump&#8217;s executive order on elections included a requirement for proof of citizenship. In Congress, the SAVE Act has a similar requirement and has passed the House. Three states have passed a proof of citizenship requirement in recent years, and several others are considering legislation. As the United States appears to be moving closer to requiring some form of citizenship proof in order to vote, this conversation will dive into the practical reality of administering elections with this requirement in place. Arizona has had a documented proof of citizenship requirement for state and local elections for twenty years, and officials determined in 2024 that state systems didn’t properly record the citizenship status of around 200,000 voters. This year, New Hampshire held its first election with a documented proof of citizenship requirement. Because it’s one of the six states that are not subject to the National Voter Registration Act, the law prevents anyone without documented proof of citizenship from voting in federal elections as well as state and local ones. <strong>When:</strong> May 14, 5pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
