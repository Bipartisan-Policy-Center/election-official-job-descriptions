							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The state of election security</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal partnerships in election security remain uncertain</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After weeks of speculation on the future of election security in America, state and local elections officials have a bit more clarity but the outlook is still uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity Infrastructure &amp; Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CISA) announced that it would end funding–about $10 million–to the </span><a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Internet Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was the home of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through two presidential election cycles and a pandemic, CISA and the EI-ISAC were very public partners with state and local elections officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials have come to rely on the federal government&#8217;s partnership, expertise, and resources to safeguard our election infrastructure at the state and local level. The absence of that support creates a significant gap and heightens the risk of malicious actors successfully exploiting any vulnerabilities.” Tammy Patrick,</span><a href="https://electioncenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s Chief Program Officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EI-ISAC was established to support the cybersecurity needs of the elections subsector. Through the EI-ISAC, election agencies gained access to an elections-focused cyber defense suite, including sector-specific threat intelligence products, incident response and remediation, threat and vulnerability monitoring, cybersecurity awareness and training products, and tools for implementing security best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10300" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EIISAC-300x95.png" alt="" width="300" height="95" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EIISAC-300x95.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EIISAC.png 654w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“Disappointed is not the right word, and I haven’t figured out what is, yet,” said Wesley Wilcox, supervisor of elections for </span><a href="https://www.votemarion.gov/Your-Election-Office/Meet-Your-Supervisor-of-Elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marion County, Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Election Center Board Member. “This is leaving an unfillable vulnerability for the conduct of Elections in the US. Although there are multiple highly sophisticated and cyber-aware jurisdictions across the US, they unfortunately are not the majority. The majority of elections offices are small and have less than 5 or maybe 10 total staff. Even those large sophisticated operations are NOT going to be able to replicate what was/is possible on a national scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, </span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary Kristi Noem responded to a <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.21.25-NASS-Board-Letter-to-Sec.-Noem.pdf">February 21 letter</a> from the National Association of Secretaries of State stating that CISA is “&#8230;currently undertaking an internal review of all election security related funding, products, services, and positions. These actions are being taken to ensure that all election security efforts are in alignment with the agency&#8217;s statutory authorities and its critical cyber, physical, and emergency communications mission.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The<a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/letter-dhs-noem-simon-030725.pdf"> letter went on to say</a> that state and local election officials can continue to receive products and services offered by CISA security advisors and through the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). This includes the cyber and physical security assessments, incident response planning resources, and tabletop exercises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12591" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.28.33 AM-1-300x104.png" alt="" width="300" height="104" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.28.33 AM-1-300x104.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.28.33 AM-1-1024x354.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.28.33 AM-1-768x265.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.28.33 AM-1-1536x530.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.28.33 AM-1-2048x707.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“To say we are deeply troubled is an understatement,” said Pam Smith, executive director of </span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “ Strictly speaking, elections infrastructure analysis and incident response could be conducted from within CISA — but elections departments face chronic funding and resource issues; federal support for this work should be increasing, not decreasing. Since it has already made these cuts, DHS should publish the findings of its “internal review of all election security related funding, products, services, and positions” that led to the cuts. Until we learn otherwise, this looks like an apparent de-prioritization of what election officials need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting from </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-election-security-review-lacks-transparency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyberscoop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates that the review is complete but the findings will remain internal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assessment that CISA has undertaken is internal and will help inform how the agency moves forward to best support critical infrastructure,” a CISA spokesperson told Cyberscoop. “This is an internal document that is not planned to be released publicly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains unclear who and how many CISA staff are still working on election security, if at all. “You&#8217;ve got a lot of people who … are looking over their shoulder as opposed to looking at the enemy right now,” a CISA employee told reporter Eric Geller for </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-cisa-under-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a piece in Wired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a spokesperson for CISA denies that there have been major cuts to staff, anyone who has had dealings with CISA have seen the email bouncebacks or lack of replies and have seen staff unsubscribe to elections-related content such as this newsletter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps we have a different interpretation of the word ‘mass’ or the word ‘layoffs,’” said Judd Choate, director of elections for the state of </span><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Either way, the reality for election officials is we are witnessing the gutting of the federal cybersecurity infrastructure that protects US elections.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/gowri-ramachandran"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gowri Ramachandran</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Director of Elections and Security for The Brennan Center noted that ever since election infrastructure was designated as critical infrastructure in 2017, CISA as well as the EI-ISAC built up an impressive and effective community of trust, information sharing, and incident response along with state and local election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the communication about recent cuts and personnel actions has been confusing and concerning,” Ramachandran said. “The dedicated public servants at CISA and the state and local election officials facing the continued threat of attacks by sophisticated nation states deserve better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s next for elections officials? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To be clear, election officials will do what they have always done—make use of their limited resources, their dwindling support, and their all-too-often insufficient tools to provide the best possible service to their voters,” the Election Center’s Patrick said. “They should not have been put in this position and the question remains whether their ingenuity and tenacity will be enough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choate said the Colorado Elections Division and the Colorado county clerks are closely aligned and will work together to fill the gaps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, while all election officials should be concerned that the current administration is cozying up to the very country that led President Obama to declare elections critical infrastructure, we have spent the past decade building layers of security around each election processes,” Choate said. “The counties know that we are doing everything possible to fill any gaps created by the colossally stupid decisions being made at the federal level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida, where Wilcox was preparing to do logic and accuracy testing for an upcoming election, even though he was struggling to come with a word to describe his feelings about the current situation, there was something he was certain about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The elections profession is mainly compromised by highly motivated, get-it-done types. Our elections will continue, and we will be successful!” Wilcox said. “ Is this another hurdle? YES. But, will we scale it? Yes. Does this present a challenge to our overall cybersecurity? Yes. But as we do, we will adapt, and carry on!”</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-8148" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="161" height="161" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px" />Proof of Citizenship</strong>: As more and more states are considering (or passing) proof-of-citizenship legislation, </span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2025-03-11/nhs-new-id-requirements-send-some-would-be-voters-home-to-grab-passports-birth-certificates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters in New Hampshire headed to the polls this week for their first election under the state’s new citizenship law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The roll out of the new law was not smooth for all. According to New Hampshire Public Radio, it took Brooke Yonge of Derry three trips to her local polling place before she was able to cast a ballot Tuesday. On her first trip to the polls, Yonge didn’t bring proof of her U.S. citizenship, so she drove home to grab her birth certificate, and then tried to vote a second time. But there was another problem. “It doesn’t have my married name on it,” she said. Town voting officials then sent her away a second time, to get her marriage certificate. “It is what it is,” said Yonge, walking back to her car yet again. In Derry, where local officials described the turnout as low, there were at least two other would-be voters who were denied a ballot because they initially lacked proof of their citizenship. In one instance, an 18-year old was able to contact her mother, who texted her a picture of her birth certificate. In Hopkinton, 70-year-old Betsy Spencer did end up casting a ballot, but it took plenty of doing. Spencer has lived and voted in Hopkinton for decades, but briefly relocated to Maine where she cast a ballot in November’s election. She moved back to Hopkinton last month, and when she arrived at the polls to register Tuesday, she thought she was prepared. “I had my birth certificate, a change of address from the US Postal Service — everything but my blood type and the kitchen sink — and I was told I could not register to vote,” Spencer said. The issue, Spencer said, was that her surname on her birth certificate is different from how she was registering to vote. Spencer said after local election officials consulted with the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s office, her expired passport was deemed sufficient proof of ID for her to register and vote. But she said casting her ballot ended up taking several hours. “I should be back working, but the truth was, I could not let this go,” Spencer said. “This is not ok.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3921" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/EdmundPettusBridge-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Bloody Sunday Anniversary</strong>: March 7 marked </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2025/03/08/g-s1-52698/selma-bloody-sunday-march-60-anniversary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/selma-alabama-bloody-sunday-commemoration-civil-rights-99bfb53f36453948d850a84c57ab50a8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bloody Sunday,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a violent clash between civil rights marchers and police that left many jailed, bloody and beaten, including the late Congressman John R. Lewis. The attack shocked the nation and galvanized support for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965. The</span><a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/03/09/tens-of-thousands-commemorate-60th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-in-selma/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annual commemoration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pays homage to those who fought to secure voting rights for Black Americans and brought calls to recommit to the fight for equality. Members of Congress joined with Bloody Sunday marchers to lead a march of several thousand people across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They stopped to pray at the site where marchers were beaten in 1965. Kirk Carrington was just 13 on Bloody Sunday and was chased through the city by a man on a horse wielding a stick. “When we started marching, we did not know the impact we would have in America,” he told The Associated Press. “We gather here on the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday when our country is in chaos,” said U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama. Sewell, a Selma native, noted the number of voting restrictions introduced since the U.S. Supreme Court effectively abolished a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to clear new voting laws with the Justice Department. Other speakers noted the Trump administration’s push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and a rollback of equal opportunity executive orders that have been on the books since the 1960s.</span></p>

Stakeholders across the government, private, and nonprofit sectors spent much of 2024 preparing for AI-accelerated challenges to election administration. Their concerns were sparked by the rapid emergence of widely accessible generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, or GAI) tools, which can create text and synthetic images, audio, and video. Less understood is how GAI could improve election administration. Just 7% of election administrators reported using AI in their work, according to a May 2024 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice. Although other government workers and many commercial workplaces are exploring how to integrate GAI into their jobs, many election administrators are reluctant to do so because elections are high-stakes exercises. At a precarious time for public trust in election integrity, the margin for error is razor thin. Simultaneously, tight timelines, small staffs, and limited resources afford administrators little time to innovate and to experiment with new technologies. On August 29, 2024, the Bipartisan Policy Center held an exercise for election officials to more closely consider election-related uses of GAI. Building on previous suggestions—including those from</span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/resource/generative-artificial-intelligence-for-election-administrators-an-introduction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Elections Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/2024-04/artificial-intelligence-for-electoral-management.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> International IDEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—this event convened election officials, technologists, and researchers to identify cumbersome, challenging, or time-consuming tasks routinely completed by election offices. (As these tasks often keep officials from other work, we refer to them as “bottlenecks.”) Participants broke into small groups to discuss whether and how GAI might “unstop” these bottlenecks.</span></p>

The proposed initiative aims to reinstate partisan political primaries, adjust appointment procedures, reestablish special runoff elections, and amend rules for independent expenditure groups. Lieutenant Governor Dahlstrom stated that the approval confirms the sponsors of the initiative have met the necessary legal requirements for the process. With this approval, the initiative sponsors can now begin gathering the required signatures to place the measure on a future ballot. If enough signatures are collected, the initiative will be presented to voters for consideration. The current voting systems, which were introduced following the passage of Ballot Measure 2 in 2020, were narrowly rejected in a similar repeal attempt during the November 2024 election, with a margin of just 743 votes. &#8220;Our democratic process is strengthened when Alaskans engage directly in shaping our electoral system,&#8221; said Lieutenant Governor Dahlstrom. &#8220;In approving this ballot initiative application, we have confirmed that the initiative sponsors have met the necessary requirements under Alaska law.&#8221; Lieutenant Governor Dahlstrom encouraged Alaskans to stay informed and engaged as the debate over potential changes to the state&#8217;s voting systems continues.</span></p>

The contract was $219,489 for five years of licensing and ballot-programming services for the borough’s annual municipal elections. The scanning machines also count the ballots for the City of Fairbanks and the City of North Pole’s municipal elections. Borough code requires municipal ballots to be counted by machines, which are proven faster, more accurate and cheaper than hand-counting. “According to FNSB code, chapter 5.24, ballot counting procedures specifies ballots are counted by optical scan or other computer, red or electronic ballot precincts,” said Borough Clerk April Trickey. She reported that the borough already owns ballot scanning machines, having spent $359,956 in 2020 and an upgrade in 2022. The current five-year contract expires on April 17, 2025. “This contract does not purchase any additional software or equipment as the borough owns the software and the equipment that we currently have,” she explained. Without the contract renewal, the borough would not have the license to use the machines it already owns. Assembly member Brett Rotermund asked about changing the voting system. “If we were to vote this down tonight and get rid of our current machines and go back to a hand counting process, how will that affect the upcoming election?” Rotermund asked. Trickey explained, “This assembly would have to adopt an ordinance to go back to hand counting voting. &#8216;Cause right now I&#8217;m supposed to conduct our elections using computer-counted ballots.” Member Barbara Haney moved to postpone voting on the contract until the Assembly could check with the Cities of Fairbanks and North Pole. But that was voted down. The contract extension was voted down 4 to 4</span></p>

Katie Hobbs (D) vetoed their recent attempt to make the state’s elections more like Florida’s. Two of the proposals,</span><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/81926?SessionId=129"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1097</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/81926?SessionId=129"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1098</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were sponsored by Sen. Jake Hoffman, leader of the Arizona Freedom Caucus.  One bill, SB1097, would force every public school operated by a school district to close on each primary and general election day and requires schools that have gymnasiums to act as a polling location, at the county’s request.  The proposal would get rid of a provision in state law currently that allows school superintendents to refuse to serve as polling places because of safety concerns or lack of space.  It would also require all other government offices to serve as polling places, at the county’s request.  While Hoffman’s proposal would force schools to close to students on Election Day, it would bar teachers from taking time off that day. Senate Bill 1097 would also take a less extreme approach to requiring counties to use precinct-based voting than a bill sponsored by another Freedom Caucus member that already passed through the House and the Senate Judiciary and Elections Committee.  A precinct-based voting model requires each voter to cast a ballot at their designated location, and if they vote at the wrong location, it won’t be counted. In contrast, any registered voter in the county can cast a ballot at any voting center in the county. Most Arizona counties use voting centers or a mix of precincts and voting centers. Senate Bill 1098 would require voters who drop off early ballots at a polling place to show identification and sign an affidavit promising that they’re legally allowed to drop off those ballots. In Arizona, voters can only return their own ballot, ballots from family members or housemates or from a person for whom they are a caregiver. Those who violate that law could face a felony charge and more than a year in prison.  Right now, voters can drop off their early ballots in drop boxes or at polling locations without having to provide identification, and the ballots are validated by election workers verifying the ballot envelope signatures.</span></p>

If the bill becomes law, they would be given the same latitude sheriffs have had for decades. The appellants would have to give their reasons for appeal in their filings with the Governor’s Office. From there, the local lawmakers would have five days to respond to the grievance. After the response, the Governor’s Office would set up a timely hearing of the Administration Commission. From there, the proposal would give 30 days to determine a resolution. That could include accepting one side’s proposed resolution or a combination of line items that could be a state-brokered compromise. This law would take effect in July, potentially leaving a tight window for local budgets that take effect October 1 and are often passed just before the beginning of the new fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Ethics and Elections Committee introduced a comprehensive election bill  (</span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/7016/?Tab=BillText"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 7016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) that includes provisions that Republican lawmakers say are intended to reduce fraud and “safeguard </span><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/03/07/here-comes-another-bill-that-would-change-the-citizen-led-petition-process-in-florida/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the process” by which amendments are placed on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SB 7016 is the second such measure introduced in the Florida Senate to address criticisms leveled by Gov. DeSantis about the petition gathering process that he said in January required the Legislature to convene in a special session. While GOP leadership didn’t immediately respond back then, they are now moving quickly on fulfilling his request (the other Senate measure to deal with ballot petition fraud was earlier introduced by Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia –</span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/1414/?Tab=RelatedBills"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 1414).</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 7016 also: Reduces the number of days a sponsor has to submit signed petition forms to the appropriate supervisor of elections to 10 from 30; Enhances the fines regarding late- or not-submitted signed petition forms to the supervisor of  elections to $50 per each day late, and raises the fines from $250 to $2,500 for each petition form if the sponsor or petition circulator acted willfully.  Increase fines for non-submitted petition forms from $500 to $5,000 if the sponsor or petition circulator “acted willfully;” and Prohibits all felons who have not had their right to vote restored and all noncitizens from collecting signatures. The initiative sponsor is liable for $50,000 fine for each person collecting petitions on its behalf in violation of the prohibition. The bill also requires applicants for petition circulator to complete training about these and other related legal requirements.</span></p>

State Representative Lindsay Cross of Pinellas County says her bill would enforce policies like expanding early voting, allowing for more flexibility with mail in voting, dropping off ballots at different polling locations, utilizing more mobile polling sites, etc. “This is not something that is red or blue or purple, people all over the state were impacted by this and so just making some of these things automatic will help people to have the confidence that they will be able to vote, that their vote will count, and really just helping to strengthen our democracy,” said Cross.</span></p>

If the Legislature approves the current version of </span><a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/70198"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 397,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would give the two chamber leaders powers to remove members from a board that was at the forefront of controversial election rulemaking in 2024. However, the architect behind the proposal for removing Georgia election board members, Atlanta Democratic Rep. Saira Draper, said she’s not optimistic that the updated clause will remain in the final election bill expected to be crafted before the session ends April 4. On Feb. 18, Draper filed </span><a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/70425"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 501</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which clarified state law by giving the House and Senate chamber leaders the same post-session authority to remove State Election Board members as they have to fill vacancies on the board. On Thursday, the House voted 159-13 in favor of a substitute passed out of the House Rules Committee that no longer included a provision that would give municipal election officials the choice to opt-out of advance voting for municipal elections on Saturdays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, late at night in the House last week, representatives</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-lawmakers-keep-election-bill-alive-so-they-can-change-it/4CTOSYNOJ5EPRPLBTQ2BUCDL6U/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pushed through a hastily rewritten elections bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with little notice, less debate and no hint of its significance. This short bill is called a “vehicle” — a piece of legislation that can be amended to include very different election proposals, some of which never received a hearing or committee vote. </span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/397"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed the House and awaits action in the Senate, creates a process to remove members of the State Election Board. But Republicans might alter it to include ideas that did not survive last week’s deadline for bills to clear at least one legislative chamber, such as prohibiting voters from turning in their absentee ballots in-person the weekend before Election Day, banning last-minute election rules and a plan to withdraw Georgia from a national voter registration accuracy organization. “Everybody is looking at it and probably looking to make some changes,” Senate Ethics Committee Chair Sam Watson (R-Moultrie) told the AJC. “It’s good to take time and take a breath. Let’s see what happens and go from there.”</span></p>

The legislation would allow anyone to be registered to vote when they apply for a REAL ID or standard driver&#8217;s license as long as they show a document confirming US citizenship.  Leaders told the House Ethics &amp; Elections Committee this week that Illinoisans would only be able to opt out of the automatic voter registration when they receive a postcard from their local election authority. Residents would have 23 days to return the postcard to election officials if they would like to be removed from the state database. The House Ethics &amp; Elections Committee could vote on the proposal before the House Committee deadline on March 21.</span></p>

The House Economic Growth and Technology Committee advanced the bill, with its floor manager Rep. Ray Sorensen noting the bill was a “work in progress.”  Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, cautioned the committee on moving too quickly on the issue, noting a similar law had passed in Colorado and “is not going well.”  “We are on the cutting edge right now … We could perhaps use some time to learn from the mistakes of others and come out with something perfect – maybe it needs to be next year,” Baeth, who voted to advance the bill, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill on elections,</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&amp;ba=HSB281"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Study Bill 281</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, advanced through the House State Government Committee. The legislation would allow the Iowa Secretary of State’s office to work with federal and state agencies, as well as private companies, to confirm the citizenship status of voters registered in Iowa. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate proposed the bill after his office issued controversial guidance leading into the 2024 general election. Pate directed county auditors to challenge the ballots of more than 2,000 registered voters whose citizenship status was in question.</span></p>

The legislation also includes increasing the threshold for political party recognition from 2% to 10% of the total votes cast for a candidate in the previous general election. The measure was passed 14-7 through the House committee with no debate.</span></p>

That three-day grace period would be repealed by SB 4, meaning all mail ballots would have to arrive by 7 p.m. Election Day in order to be counted. The proposed change would take effect in 2026. The Secretary of State&#8217;s Office remained neutral on SB 4, but provided lawmakers with a summary of arguments for and against. It also lobbied to keep ballot drop boxes as an option for voters. While the governor is expected to veto the bill, Republicans likely have the votes for an override. The Senate passed SB 4 on Thursday with a 30-10 vote, which is three above the supermajority needed for an override. One Republican sided with the Democrats. A week before, the House passed the bill 80-39. While the House was four votes shy of a veto-proof supermajority, there were four Republicans absent that day — all four of whom previously voted to repeal the three-day grace period in 2023. There were four Republicans who sided with Democrats.</span></p>

In the Senate Judiciary Committee members approved Senate Concurrent Resolution 89, sponsored by Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon. “Kentucky has long debated how to balance accountability with second chances,” Higdon testified before the panel. “This task force will allow us to take a thorough, thoughtful approach to ensure any changes to the voting rights restoration process are fair, secure, transparent, and not always sweeping and unilateral as it currently stands.” The proposed task force would be composed of House and Senate members and additional stakeholders as needed. It would meet regularly during the 2025 Interim to study existing laws, hear from impacted individuals and experts, and develop recommendations. A final report would be submitted to the General Assembly by December 1, for potential legislative action in the 2026 Regular Session. Meanwhile, the House Committee on Elections, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs gave their nod to House Concurrent Resolution 67, sponsored by Rep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville. It would create a similar task force with the same reporting date, but the make-up of the task force has minor differences than the Senate version. Both measures received committee approval and now go to the floor of the respective chambers.</span></p>

According to Maine Morning Star, the committee does however appear poised to sign off on requiring automatic recounts when there are apparent ties in elections, as currently there are no automatic recounts even in this case, though the final recommendation will be determined once absent members cast their votes in the coming days.  These mark the first few committee recommendations for how the state should, or shouldn’t, alter its elections laws this session. The bills will now head to the House of Representatives and Senate for floor votes.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, it was a critical step for House Joint Resolution B, which seeks to amend the Michigan Constitution to require voters to prove their citizenship before registering and to require election officials to check the citizenship status of those already registered. The proposal has a long way to go before it becomes law, though. Potential constitutional amendments must win approval of two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature before they appear before voters for final approval. Should the measure fail in the Legislature, Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford and the proposal’s author, has confirmed that a signature-gathering initiative run by Prove It Michigan would aim to get the proposal before voters in 2026.

Under AB148, all mail ballots must be distributed to voters living in Nevada between the fourth and fifth Monday before an election. Existing law requires that mail ballots be distributed to in-state residents no later than 20 days before an election, but in practice, county election officials send mail ballots out over a wider time range before an election. The bill would also set an earlier deadline for local election officials to send out sample ballots. Nevada law requires that sample ballots be sent before the start of early voting, which is the third Saturday before a general election. But under AB148, sample ballots must be sent out by the last day that mail ballots can be sent, which would be five days earlier than the current sample ballot requirement. The bill sponsors said they will also look into changing the timeline to send ballots to out-of-state voters.</span></p>

Election officials told the New Jersey Globe the short runoff period—with another election just 13 days after the certification—makes it impossible for officials to follow the letter of the law while administering the runoff. “The timeline established by current laws, particularly around certification, mail-in ballots, and early voting, makes it virtually impossible to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law,” McCann Stamato said in a release. “These laws were not designed for the current landscape, and it’s time to update them for the reality of modern elections.” The deadline to contest the November election is Dec. 6, creating a potential legal challenge, since the deadline comes after the scheduled Dec. 2 runoff. McCann Stamato said the specifics of her proposal will be released in the coming weeks. She said she plans to work with municipal officials and elections administrators while crafting the bill. “As an elected official committed to ensuring fair elections, I cannot stand by while our municipal elections are mired in confusion and legal contradictions,” the assemblywoman said.</span></p>

Authored by Rep. Tammy Townley, R-Ardmore, House Bill 1678 requires a second election to resolve a voting tie, whether it appears in primary, runoff, or general elections. The move comes as a direct response to a tied result in Carter County last year, where the outcome of a sheriff&#8217;s race was determined by nothing more than a random drawing. Currently, Oklahoma law allows for a tied vote to be settled in such a hit-or-miss fashion, but Rep. Townley believes in a different path. &#8220;This bill ensures elections are decided by voters, not by chance,&#8221; Townley said. &#8220;I was surprised to learn that races could be settled by a random drawing. With the technology we have, there’s no reason a tied election can’t go to a runoff. This bill takes that step to make our elections fair and transparent.&#8221; Under the new legislation, if a tie occurs after a second vote, the election board will hold a public drawing to decide the outcome. HB1678 challenges the idea that the democratic process should be decided by chance, arguing that it should be in the hands of the voters.</span></p>

According to the bill’s memo circulated by Rep. Tim Brennan (D-29) and Rep. Mary Jo Daley (D-148), the bill aims to join 11 states in prohibiting all firearms at polling places. The lawmaker’s memo says the legislation aims to quell concerns voiced by voters and election workers about safety at polling places, as people have been “threatened, harassed, or intimidated.” Voting districts have also struggled to find or retain volunteers to work at such locations due to safety concerns, per the memo. The memo adds that prohibition would not apply to law enforcement officers and military personnel on duty at the locations, and it would also allow those licensed to carry a firearm to keep the firearm in their vehicle while voting. The prohibition would only apply to the building in which votes are cast. The bill has not been submitted for introduction yet.</span></p>

That would include voters who registered through a voter registration drive or by mail, rather than while obtaining a Texas drivers license or state ID through the Department of Public Safety. Voters who don’t provide proof of citizenship would be placed on a separate voter roll and could cast ballots only in U.S. House and Senate races. Voters on that list wouldn’t be allowed to vote for president under the bill, which experts say could invite a legal challenge. The bill would create a new barrier to voting for some of Texas’ more than 18 million registered voters, and could diminish the rights of eligible voters who are not able to provide documents proving their U.S. citizenship. It would subject election officials to potential criminal penalties, making it a felony punishable by jail time to knowingly register an applicant without first verifying that they are citizens. It would also require election officials to provide the state attorney general’s office a list of voters who have not provided proof of citizenship, and calls for the attorney general to prosecute any offenses if local officials do not.</span></p>

The ordinance was drawn up in response to last fall’s election process, in which voters were reportedly harassed by aggressive candidates and campaign workers as they stood in line to cast their ballots. During a workshop meeting last month, City Manager David Mitchell noted that the city’s polling site for last fall’s election, the Harker Heights Recreation Center, was the only one that voters complained about, according to the county elections office. Mayor Pro Tem Tony Canterino said, “We got a ton of complaints last year. We need to make it more comfortable for people to vote. Too many signs make it difficult for people to get to the (candidates’) tents.” After about 20 minutes of discussion, the council approved the new ordinance in a 4-1 vote. The ordinance will take effect immediately, with early voting beginning for the May 3 city and school board elections on April 22 at the Harker Heights Recreation Center.</span></p>

According to the Breckenridge Texan, the decision at this week’s meeting will abolish the position that the commissioners created last April. The voter registration duties will return to the tax assessor-collector’s office, and election functions will now be handled by the county clerk’s office, in accordance with Section 31.048 of the Texas Local Government Code. During this week’s meeting, Roach asked McLane to address the commissioners in the public session, explaining what he had told them last week. McLane said that, based on his experience, the position doesn’t require full-time work, outside of election periods. “During the election time, it can get hectic once you get settled in,” McLane said. “After the elections… it’s not a full time job.” McLane estimated that he spent minimal time on administrative duties between elections. “I’d say at most, 10 to 12 hours a week into the elections itself. And that’s at most,” McLane said. “… if a taxpayer would come ask, I think it’d be hard to justify this salary, from my aspect.” Rather than replacing McLane with another elections administrator, the county plans to restructure its approach to managing elections. “I think what we’re going to do is cut that (elections administrator) position, reduce that expense totally, $55,000, $50,000 something like that,” Roach said in a phone call Friday afternoon. “We’re going to move somebody out of the tax assessor-collector’s office across the hall to the county clerk’s office, and reduce the staff in the tax office, because they’re not going to be handling elections anymore.”</span></p>

The bill had already passed the West Virginia Senate earlier last week, where it was originally proposed by Sen. Jack Woodrum, R-Summers. Ranked choice voting is already not practiced in the state. Proponents of the bill, like Del. J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, describe it as a “proactive” effort to uphold the integrity of elections in West Virginia. “We often pass legislation in this body proactively,” Akers said on the House floor Friday. “If we see a problem somewhere else, we try to address it before it’s in West Virginia.” But opponents of the bill say banning a practice not in place has little effect. Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, argued that the bill would prohibit a practice that “promotes civility in politics,” and is already used to select committee chairs in the state legislature itself. “If you’re running against somebody [and] you think that y’all are pretty close there, you want [to be] their voters’ second choice,” Pushkin said on the House floor. “So you’re not going to attack them, because you want their folks to give you their second choice.” Despite the pushback from Democratic lawmakers, Senate Bill 490 passed the House by a vote of 87-9 on Friday. It now returns to the state’s Senate for a final review, before heading to the governor’s office for approval to become law.</span></p>

Representatives of the state Elections Commission, which proposed the administrative rules, testified last month they don’t have the authority to propose penalties for local elections officials as part of the package and that would have to be done through legislation. State Rep. Scott Krug (R-Nekoosa) told the committee last week that he is working on legislation that includes the changes the commission proposed in its rules package. But his bill will add the penalties Republicans want to ensure local officials have “skin in the game” when it comes to following rules for election observers. The proposed rules, which have been in the works for more than two years, include standards such as when events at a polling site can be recorded or what observers can do when ballots are cast in a care facility.</span></p>

The three-judge panel’s unanimous ruling on Thursday in favor of the state GOP reversed the Maricopa County Superior Court’s dismissal of the case, and sent the case back to the county court for further proceedings. According to Votebeat, the ruling casts some doubt on which set of instructions will apply to this year’s all-mail local elections, one of which is taking place in Tucson this month, while others are in May and November. The manual contains detailed instructions for how counties must run elections, with sections on voter eligibility, polling place setup, and certifying and auditing results. Fontes’ office, which is developing a manual for next year’s elections, believes the 2023 manual is still in effect for now, and will appeal the court’s ruling, spokesperson Aaron Thacker said. The Republican Party of Arizona, which brought the lawsuit along with the Republican National Committee and the Yavapai County Republican Party, believes that the ruling invalidates the 2023 manual, and that counties must revert to the 2019 manual for this year’s local elections, state GOP Chair Gina Swoboda told Votebeat.</span></p>

It will also determine whether a group of Washington, D.C. voters have the right to challenge the law. The law allows noncitizens who reside in D.C. for at least 30 days before the election and are at least 18 years old to vote for local offices and ballot initiatives. This gives noncitizens a voice in choosing the District’s mayor, school board members, attorney general, and more.  After efforts to overturn the law stalled in Congress, the legal arm of the anti-immigration advocacy organization Federation for American Immigration Reform filed a lawsuit on behalf of a group of D.C. residents, arguing the law unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of U.S. citizens. One of the plaintiffs, Stacia Hall, was the Republican candidate for mayor in 2022.  The plaintiffs alleged that by allowing noncitizens to vote, the D.C. Board of Elections (DCBOE) “unlawfully discriminates against U.S. citizens living in D.C.” in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. They also claimed the law violates the “constitutional right of citizens to govern, and be governed by, themselves.” The DCBOE defended the law, asserting that noncitizen voting has a long history reaching back to the earliest days of the country. “Courts—including the Supreme Court—have either endorsed non-citizen voting or at least never questioned its constitutionality,” they wrote. They also argued that the plaintiffs didn’t have standing. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing because the plaintiffs failed to show how they were injured by the law.  In her opinion, Berman Jackson wrote that the plaintiffs “may object as a matter of policy to the fact that immigrants get to vote at all, but their votes will not receive less weight or be treated differently than noncitizens’ votes; they are not losing representation in any legislative body.”</span></p>

Superior Court Judge Scott Jones quickly advised the five defendants of the terms of their release, including a ban on them talking to potential witnesses, and transferred the felony cases to Bridgeport Superior Court. The more than 150 charges filed against the five defendants are the result of one of the largest criminal investigations into ballot fraud and other election-related crimes in Connecticut history. State prosecutors with the Chief State&#8217;s Attorney&#8217;s office alleged in arrest warrants that Joyce, Castillo, Pereira and Geter-Pataky committed a raft of election-related crimes, including illegally taking possession of voters&#8217; absentee ballots ahead of the September 2023 primary between Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim and his Democratic challenger John Gomes.</span></p>

Boulee has </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-against-georgia-absentee-request-deadline/P4LU3G7ORRAOZJENQVVOHZLT4Y/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed a lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that claimed Georgia’s deadline to request an absentee ballot 11 days before Election Day broke civil rights law. The lawsuit alleged that the deadline imposed by Georgia’s 2021 election law violated a provision of the Voting Rights Act allowing voters to cast absentee ballots if they apply at least seven days ahead of time. Boulee ruled that the plaintiffs, a labor union of TV and theater workers, could not sue because voting is not part of the group’s purpose. While the ruling tossed the lawsuit, Boulee did not address whether Georgia’s election law defied federal law. “In short, plaintiff is a labor union and not a voting organization,” Boulee wrote in a 19-page decision. “It represents the interests of its members as laborers in a particular industry and not as voters in the state of Georgia.”</span></p>

Maddox has ruled that a Maryland State Board of Elections regulation </span><a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/state-government/maryland-election-activists-DNT6NQNV4VF3NHVD4OIBPN6V6E/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violated federal election law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving a win to “election integrity” activists suing the state for unrestricted access to voter rolls and voting histories. Plaintiffs Katherine Strauch Sullivan and David Morsberger sued a handful of board members and the elections administrator because the state had rejected their request for voter lists. Sullivan runs a group called Secure the Vote Maryland that meets weekly to comb through voter files for deceased individuals, noncitizens and duplicate registrations. With the voter lists her team has obtained, they canvass neighborhoods to verify the names and addresses of registered voters. The state allows Maryland voters to access and pay for voter registration lists, but only for use in the electoral process, such as running for elective office. State agency regulations specifically say the electoral process does not include investigations into “an illegal or suspected illegal infraction or violation involving the voter’s behavior. But Maddox ruled that federal law allows voter records to be checked for their accuracy, too, and found it “impracticable to disaggregate” a search for accuracy versus inaccuracy based on federal voting laws. State election administrator Jared DeMarinis said the board restricted access to protect voters from undue harassment and intimidation.</span></p>

Judge Mark Fratarcangeli. Fratarcangeli threw out the charges against temporary election worker Molly Brasure, 31, and voter Geneva Oday, 42 following a preliminary examination in 40th District Court in St. Clair Shores. Several people in the courtroom gallery, including city Clerk Abby Barrett, applauded, and Brasure and Oday smiled and embraced. as Oday wept. Oday said afterward she was “very happy.” Brasure and Oday are the third and fourth of seven defendants – four voters and three election workers – to have charges dismissed in the case brought by the state on allegations of double voting or aiding and abetting double. Three defendants, all voters, still face charges at Macomb County Circuit Court, and the state Attorney General’s Office is appealing the dismissal of the cases in two other cases by the other St. Clair Shores district judge, Joseph Oster. Fratarcangeli stated the claims against Brasure, one of three employees who worked in the Election Day call center at the August 2024 primary, may have been the result of a “mistake” that is probably made “hundreds of times” statewide in each election. “You were a victim of a situation,” the judge told Brasure. “Everyone at the call center did exactly the same thing you did. There’s no evidence you were in cahoots with anyone. “It has to be a uniform application of the law.” Barrett, who was the one who discovered the mistake, testified there were “a few errors” during the election and that “everything doesn’t go right” on an Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10903" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MontanaFlag-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Montana:</strong> Pro-voting groups </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/montana-voter-registration-penalty-law-is-permanently-blocked/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reached an agreement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the secretary of state and attorney general to permanently block portions of a law that criminalizes voters who are inadvertently registered to vote elsewhere.  The agreement, which was approved by a district court judge on March 10, comes after more than a year of litigation challenging provisions of House Bill 892, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) in May 2023. The bill’s backers said it was intended to block voters who register to vote in Montana from deliberately remaining registered to vote in another jurisdiction.  But the law imposed criminal penalties and fines even on people who violated the provision inadvertently. The pro-voting groups who sued to block the law — the Montana Public Interest Research Group and the Montana Federation of Public Employees — alleged that it’s overly vague in its language, which could be used to unjustly punish voters for making a mistake. The lawsuit also challenged a provision of HB 892 that requires a person who was previously registered to vote in another county or state to provide their previous registration information when they’re registering to vote. The plaintiffs alleged that this requirement could lead to voters being criminalized for simply forgetting to fill out a portion of their voter registration. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that these parts of H.B. 892 violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of due process and burden the right to vote under the First and 14th Amendments. In April 2024, the law was temporarily blocked when the district court judge granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. “The public maintains a strong interest in ‘exercising the fundamental political right to vote,’ the judge wrote in the order. “The ability of Montana voters to register to vote without fear of felony criminal penalties appears to substantially implicate the public’s interest in protecting the franchise.” The order was appealed by the Republican intervenors in the case — the Republican National Committee and the Montana Republican Party — to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who upheld the district court’s ruling.  With both parties reaching an agreement, Montana won’t enforce the challenged provision of HB 892. And under the district court’s order, the state is permanently prohibited from imposing criminal penalties on anyone who forgets to cancel their registration in other counties or a different state or fails to provide their previous registration information while registering to vote. </span></p>

The three board members met to finalize the swap; however, they agreed to delay a vote because the board had inadequately notified the public that individuals could publicly comment on the proposal at the hearing. Hours later, county Solicitor Jacquelyn Pfursich sought a court order from the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas to approve moving Manheim Township Seventh District’s poll from the Residence Inn by Marriott Lancaster at 1450 Harrisburg Pike to Michael’s Motor Cars at 922 North Queen Street. According to Pfursich’s request, the Board of Elections could not reconvene for a vote on the new polling location in time to meet the required 20 days of notice for voters before the election date. This shift is one of ten changes county officials made to accommodate the special election. Nine others were finalized two weeks ago. Pfursich’s request also states there were no members of the public present for the hearing to oppose the change, and only one individual was present to support it.</span></p>

In a</span><a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/1025696.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimous ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the justices determined steps taken in recent years have improved the system to help voters fix, or “cure,” signature problems on their ballots. Signature verification is a central piece of Washington’s vote-by-mail elections. “All too many ballots are not counted because election workers cannot verify the voter’s signatures and the voter does not or cannot cure their ballot in time,” Justice Steven Gonzalez acknowledged in the opinion.  “But signature verification is only a part of the election system established by our legislature,” Gonzalez continued.  He notes, for example, direction to local election workers to go further in trying to reach voters whose ballots may not be counted and an expansion of the ways voters can cure their ballots.  In the opinion, the justices still leave the door open to challenges in specific instances where election workers rejected ballots. “We are pleased with the court’s ruling, which affirms our commitment to secure, accessible, and transparent elections in Washington,” Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said. “Signature verification has been a fundamental part of our state’s vote-by-mail system for decades, helping to protect against fraud while ensuring that every eligible voter’s ballot is counted.” A trio of civic-minded organizations  — Vet Voice Foundation, The Washington Bus and El Centro de la Raza — and four individual plaintiffs filed the lawsuit against Hobbs and King County election staff in 2022 over the signature verification process. They alleged the system disenfranchised voters while doing little to further secure elections. After a King County judge denied summary judgment motions from both sides, the Supreme Court took up the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> The progressive voting rights-focused firm Law Forward filed a </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/law-forward-sues-city-of-madison-over-lost-absentee-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class action lawsuit against the city of Madison and Dane County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the 193 absentee ballots that city election workers lost and didn’t count during the 2024 election.  The ballots were found in sealed courier bags after the Nov. 5 election and not counted even though the bags were discovered for the ballots to be added to the final vote tally. Law Forward staff said the lawsuit was filed because voters were denied their constitutional right to vote.  “The goal of this lawsuit is to reinforce and strengthen the right to vote in Wisconsin law, the right to vote is absolutely fundamental in our democracy, the cornerstone of our entire system of governance,” Jeff Mandell, Law Forward’s general counsel, said at a news conference Thursday. “Law Forward exists to defend and advance democracy in Wisconsin, standing up for the right to vote, whenever and wherever it may be violated, is a key part of Law Forward’s mission. This lawsuit is not an attack on any individual municipality or election official. It is instead a necessary and important defense of the right to vote in Wisconsin.” Law Forward is representing four of the voters whose ballots went uncounted, but Mandell said the remaining 189 voters would have the ability to join the lawsuit if a judge allows the class action to move forward. The suit requests that damages totalling $175,000 be paid to each affected voter — which exceeds the $50,000 limit under state law for claims against municipalities.  If all 193 voters participate and receive the full requested amount of damages, the city would be forced to pay more than $33.7 million for the error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2nd District Court of Appeals ruled this week that</span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsin-appeals-court-overturns-ruling-allowing-email-ballots-disabled-voters"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disabled people are not allowed to receive absentee ballots by email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, overturning a lower court’s ruling less than three weeks before the April 1 election. The initial ruling made in 2024 by a Dane County Circuit Court judge allowing for the ballots to be emailed was appealed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature. The appeals court in August put the ruling on hold and no ballots were emailed ahead of the November presidential election. The ruling means disabled voters will not be able to receive absentee ballots by email for the April 1 election, either. Voters are choosing a new Wisconsin Supreme Court justice who will determine majority control of the court, and voters are electing the state’s top education official. Early voting begins next week. Disability Rights Wisconsin, the League of Women Voters and four disabled voters brought the lawsuit a year ago. They argued that not having the email absentee voting option violated their right to independence and privacy while voting. Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell ruled in June that disabled people should be allowed to have absentee ballots emailed to them. But the appeals court overturned that ruling, saying Wednesday that the lower court was wrong to issue a temporary injunction that would have changed and “significantly disrupted the status quo.” The status quo in Wisconsin allows for absentee ballots to be emailed only to military and overseas voters, “no one else,” appeals court judges Mark Gundrum, Shelley Grogan and Maria Lazar wrote.</span></p>
